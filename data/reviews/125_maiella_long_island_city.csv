5.0,5/1/2019,I dined at Maiella with my mother who was visiting from out of town. I have been living in the Astoria/LIC area for a long time and really wanted to try a new place. I had recently met one of Maiella's managers Jay Santiago who gave me his card and spoke very highly of the restaurant. There are so many places to choose from but he promised I wouldn't be disappointed and he was so right! We had a nice table by the window with a beautiful view. The manager working that night was Anthony and he was so lovely. He stopped by the table to check on us and chat a few times and he even sent us a wonderful dessert at the end of our meal! Our server Eddie was knowledgeable about the food and wine (which was amazing). Our pastas were delicious and clearly made in house. We both had pastas with seafood. The seafood was super fresh and perfectly prepared. The entire experience was wonderful and we will absolutely be returning.,0,0,0,Eulone G.,"Queens, NY",0,3,0

3.0,4/25/2019,"Hi I been in the place 3 times already so I went there last week for my brother birthday because he love pasta and Italian food, the first thing was the waiter was very rude with us. We asked him about some food and he said all the information and the ingredients are in the Menu, I don't know if he has a long day and he's tired but you don't treat the customers like that. Also I ask him if he can bring me a glass of water he told me gimme 5 min. We busy at this moment, but other than that the food was really good.",0,0,0,Cesar Z.,"Highland Park, Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0

5.0,4/23/2019,"Maiella,Thank you! I just know I will not be able to express how lovely our day at Maiella was.We had a small, intimate wedding this past Easter Sunday. My husband proposed to me under the Pepsi Cola sign on the water, and fate would have it that Maiella was seated just behind the sign, making it the perfect location for our lunch reception. Not only is the restaurant gorgeous and the food divine, the staff here are simply some of the best people in the city. Lea, the event coordinator, was fun, sweet, and made the planning phase a breeze. Meeting with her cinched the deal for us as we just felt so comfortable with her, she assured us the venue could accommodate our guests, and even allowed us to have an outside wedding cake and did not charge us for plating. Our package was so affordable, but based on taste and quantity, and the amount of options for our guests, you would never know it! We loved the idea of our guests having choices and the freedom to make that choice based on what they were in the mood for that day. Our menu included kids menu options and a very reasonable added fee, beer and wine open bar, appetizer, entrees, and dessert. Our family and friends are still raving. When we arrived, I slipped in a few minutes early to set up our minimal decor (favors, name cards, guest book, etc.) while my husband took our guests to admire the waterfront. Immediately the staff, hosts, general manger, Mike, our team John and Eduardo, and the other lovely servers (so sorry my mind was swimming and did not catch everyone's names but you were all amazing and put up with all of my hugging) stepped in, introduced themselves, assured me that they would help if we needed anything, started setting up the cake table and put on our cake toppers, and helped me put up decorations making it just so simple and elegant. Our added embellishments were not at all necessary as the restaurant is already so gorgeous and classy, and best of all the gorgeous view of the sign and the Manhattan skyline. We reserved part of the main floor, and while the restaurant was very busy, our party felt intimate and private and also spacious and comfortable at the same time. I couldn't believe how perfect it was. Our team made our guests so comfortable, helped my husband and I find key times for toasts, cake cutting, settling the bill discretely, and making the rounds to greet everyone, which we truly appreciated as it can be difficult to navigate these things on your big day. This was truly above and beyond what we were expecting from our restaurant, and just showcases what amazing people they are. The staff felt like they had such great teamwork, and seemed to enjoy being there, which is a testament to the restaurant itself, management, and owners and made our day everything I hoped for and more. Our guests keep raving that it was the most beautiful wedding they've ever been to, and it was not only because of decor but because of all of the love and kindness we received.Eat here. I want everyone to know about Maiella. We can't wait to celebrate all our anniversaries here! Love, Liz and Kevin",1,0,0,Liz A.,"Manhattan, NY",109,13,17
5.0,4/16/2019,"Located in LIC minutes away from Manhattan and along the NYC skyline. Great location with an amazing park behind the restaurant to stroll along the water before or after eating. Restaurant decor, setting and design was very beautiful. Outdoor seating available when weather permits. They have a brick oven that can be seen from the dining room where your fresh pizza is made. I was told almost everything was house-made! We ordered the Maiella Pollo Caprese and Mezza Pollo. Both were very delicious and well prepared. Tomato sauce was very flavorful and fresh. Most Italian restaurants have a bland or acidic tomato sauce, this was not the case. Paired with al-dente pasta on top of a flattened breast. Mezza Pollo was paired with delicious vegetables and we subbed for the truffle potatoes which were also delicious. For dessert we ordered the Venetian Meringue Cake. It was sweet and delicious. However it was a bit icy when we got to the bottom. Obviously pre-made but proper timing on pulling for service should be checked out. A few other cons but not major issues, the Coke/Pepsi was a bit flat and no Grenadine for my Shirley Temple. It was subbed with a splash of cranberry. Service was excellent, Oscar and Danny were very informative, made suggestions and were very attentive checking on us throughout. I would definitely recommend and I'll definitely be back(as long as they have grenadine).",0,0,0,Travis L.,"Queens, NY",8,90,21
5.0,4/16/2019,"I hold off on writing reviews until I try a place several times but I think twice is enough. Maiella is a beautiful establishment that definitely took its time to create a great atmosphere. I loved the style and amazing customer service. I loved how everyone who worked there was professional and courteous. But I usually judge a restaurant by its food and this definitely doesn't disappoint. Every dish was amazing, and growing up in my Italian friend's home, the authenticity was on par with a great home cooked meal. Portions were great, price was right for the neighborhood and the experience was very pleasant. Definitely will go back and I highly recommend it as a top choice for a night out in LIC.",0,0,0,Rajat S.,"Woodside, NY",1,10,3

5.0,4/13/2019,5 stars all around. Great service and even greater food. Dining here is a complete experience and I would recommend this place to anyone! This was my second time here. I came here with the parents and we were greeted and sat right away. The hostess was the nicest person and even noticed my parents Dartmouth jackets and spoke to us about how she was an alum there also. The view is breathtaking. We were seated right by the window with views of the manhattan skyline and the landmark pepsicola sign. We ordered some of the specials and the infamous fettuccine Maiella. Everything was beyond delicious and well worth the price. Check this place out if you're ever looking for an amazing dining experience in Long Island city!!,0,0,0,Samantha J.,"Westbury, NY",3,37,159

1.0,4/9/2019,"Amazing food, terrible service.I would like to preface this review by saying the food was great - amazing - hats off to the chef. The service we experience was unlike anything I have ever witnessed in my life. We were quickly seated for dinner when the waiter came to our table for water. We noticed we did not receive a wine menu and asked for a list of bottles. When the waiter came back, he made a comment about my fathers speech impediment and claimed he was already drinking - my father is a military veteran, has hearing loss, and his speech is impacted because he cannot hear himself well. For the waiter to make such an inappropriate comment was only the beginning of the problems. Completely uncalled for and the waiter should be ashamed.After ordering a bottle of wine, specifically the Woodwork Pinot Nior 2015, the waiter brought out a bottle of Barefoot. My jaw literally dropped. First, this was not the wine we ordered, second, the waiter proceeded to explain the wine as if it were the Woodwork. I quickly commented this was not the wine we ordered and wanted to look at the menu again. The waiter walked away from the table, laughing. At that moment, it was obvious the waiter was profiling myself and my family. Why would the waiter bring out a bottle of wine and try to sneak it by us? Charge us for a $52 bottle of wine and give us a $6 gas station wine - beyond poor service. For reference, Barefoot is not event on their wine list. After the wine situation was resolved, by myself for calling out the issue, we proceeded to order appetizers and entrees. The appetizers came out quickly and we enjoyed them thoroughly. Our favorite was the Polpettine d' Angello and the Maiella Tagliere. After finishing our appetizers, the waiter did not clear any of the serving dishes or our dirty plates. The waiter continued to place our new, clean silverware on the dirty table with all our remaining plates. We then has to ask the waiter to remove the dirty dishes. Any fine dining I've experience, the plates are cleared as soon as the dish is finished, never left on the table for the entree. Again, poor service.I was looking forward to trying this restaurant as I am a local to Queens and wanted to share the dining experience with my family visiting from California. I was beyond disappointed with the service that was provided to us. It was a complete let down and ruined the experience.",9,0,0,Ashley S.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",1,15,3
5.0,4/3/2019,I can't believe I'm gonna say this but the food was worth the wait! As someone who doesn't consider themselves a fan of Italian cuisine Maielle's has me reconsidering my life choices. Â All the food we had was so delicious and flavorful. All the vegetables were fresh and the pasta was as delicate as some cute baby animal. And as if that wasnt good enough the service was incredible. Our waiter had us cracking up the whole night and someone else who wasnt even our waiter went through the menu in detail with my friends and I. I dont know what else to say other then just go!,1,0,0,Nana J.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,3,5

1.0,3/31/2019,Horrible service for this expensive restaurant and the waiter got us kids portions instead of regular ones very bad taste food and the appetizers came to our table after the main course is horrible service horrible quality of food never again and overpriced we paid $16 for a child's menu pasta with sauce no meat no nothing on top of it just regular marinara sauce with one spoon of pasta very small portions!,0,0,0,Evie D.,"Long Island City, Long Island City, NY",25,1,0
5.0,3/31/2019,"I have come back several times since my last review, and the food continues to be delicious. During our last visit, we took a friend from California to Maiella and she loved the pasta and veal dishes that we all shared. We tried all of the cakes too and they were all delicious, my favorite is the chocolate cake. Recently, we've been ordering aperol spritzes and moscow mules with our order, and the drinks were strong and tasty. I will continue to say, as a LIC resident, that the valet situation is dangerous and wholly unacceptable. The valet uses a public street as a ""valet line."" It is illegal to be double parked along the bike lane on the ""valet line."" Valet workers make dangerous U-Turns on Center Blvd., and the ""valet line"" blocks traffic in front of the restaurant, causing loud noise including excessive honking. Recently, a friend using the Center Blvd. bike lane had to duck valet workers and pins in the bike lane because the Maiella valet chose to obstruct the bike lane. I really hope that customers consider public transportation, and I hope that Maiella chooses to be a more considerate neighbor.",3,0,0,Jeremy R.,"Queens, NY",0,11,0
5.0,3/30/2019,"Absolutely loved the food! After spending time in Italy, I always find it difficult to love italian food in the US but Maiella bailed it. The small Maiella Tagliere (charcuterie plate) was a really good start. The different types of meats offered had great flavors and the ricotta cheese was so fresh tasting. I then had the Fettuccine Maiella Table side. First, the show of making the pasta is so much fun but the actual taste of the pasta with all of the cheese and the truffles, I've been craving for more since I left the restaurant. I then had the Ossobuco. The meat fell right off the bone, no need for a knife at all. There are a lot of restaurants that get this dish wrong because they go for tenderness over flavor but Maiella got both. The sauce was so good especially with gnocchi. On top of a great meal, the server was attentive and friendly. I can't wait to go back and send everyone I know there. The views are great too but they are hard to notice when you are so entranced by great food!",2,0,1,Ellyn L.,"New York, NY",104,63,67

5.0,3/23/2019,"Our evening 03/23/19 6:15pm reservation at Maiella's Restaurant in LIC. We went tonight to celebrate my mom's 90th birthday. We had reserved a table & when speaking to the hostess over the phone on Friday, I had explained that we had never been there before & would like a really nice table (best they had) near the window. We did get a table but near the bar & it was near a window, but not a view of the city.A little disappointed we didn't get a table near a nice view (just had a wanted a nice view for mom)Otherwise, the staff was friendly & professional, why even a gentleman in a chef's jacket (?) took a picture with us (nice touch)The Lobster Bisque was exquisite, pure lobster taste, the grilled calamari was so tender & delicious!!! And the pasta with seafood, delicious & cooked perfectly aldente (my 12 y/o finished her plate) & the plate was full of seafood (not skimpy at all).

One solid dish I did have was their Â infamous pasta dish it was great very flavorful. Â I enjoyed it a lot but the prices were crazy I paid $10 to add shrimp to the dish: $5 for a flat soda $25 for a dribble of three cheeses on a plate and they don't even offer bread u have to ask for it.

It has a cool looking circular bar in the front that seems like an enjoyable area to grab a drink or two. The service was very good and I have no complaints regarding that or the food.

3.0,3/10/2019,"I went to dinner last evening with two friends at Maiella. It is a very nice looking restaurant and the service is very good. However, it is extremely pricey and I don't really think the quality of the cuisine is commensurate with the price. I regularly dine out at a variety of different restaurants and don't have any problem paying a premium price for a dinner, but I expect the food to be top notch in such a case. Here, my pasta was simply middle of the road, not bad at all, but not worth $35.00. My two dining companions ordered some kind of chicken dish that they liked but again, nothing spectacular. I wouldn't say that I would never return, but there are definitely other better choices around. In addition, I didn't appreciate the $10 charge for valet parking. I just traveled to Beverly Hills for vacation a few months ago and most of the restaurants charged $5 for valet. There is no reason for the $10 charge.",0,0,0,Ed D.,"Garden City, NY",57,43,0

5.0,2/21/2019,"We had a chance to go to Maiella for the first time with our 1 year old for dinner and the whole experience was awesome. The place itself has a very cool vibe to it with the views of the city and nice decor and lighting. We got a seat pretty quick (we did go early though because of the baby) and were immediately greeted by the waiter and then moments later by the manager? (Not sure what he officially is but the guy who talks to people at the tables at nice Italian places). He was really nice and gave us recommendations and had some nice conversation about kids (more on him later). We ordered the Burrata, chicken fingers, fettuccini maiella, and lasagna (I believe it was a special that night as I didn't see it on the web menu). Everything was awesome. I can't stop talking about how good the fettuccini maiella was to people. The whole melting the cheese wheel show was cool and the chef coming out with fresh truffles and oil was a nice touch. If you're a cheese lover though this is one of the best dishes you'll ever have. We finished the night with some creme brÃ»lÃ©e which again was awesome, and some coffee. When the check came the manager comped us dessert to congratulate us on our daughter turning 1 which was really nice and unexpected. Overall we had an awesome time and the food was great.

3.0,2/18/2019,"While the food was fantastic, I have to say that I was disappointed in the overall attitude and common human respect of the staff. Now, I dont want to be the guy complaining about attitudes, however, when you spend $500 in 2 hours at a restaurant in Long Island City NY, you would expect the staff to be more warm and welcoming. From a woman of the staff getting annoyed while being asked to take a photo, to the manager running around our table 100 times making it very awkward, never said hello, had no idea who he was until I paid more attention. The waiter himself was a decent gentleman, but gave me an eye like I owed him money after I tipped him 50 bucks. Bottom line I'll plainly say the people there act like assholes for no reason whatsoeverAll in all, this is not my first night at a restaurant, and the behavior isn't acceptable. I was a waiter for many years, and I knew how far a smile and good service went. These people were more focused on grabbing my money.It can be the best food, but when surrounded but crap attitudes, well, you get the point.As there are many many restaurants blooming in the area, and many great existing ones as well, I would stay clear of this place to be fair to you readers.

2.0,2/15/2019,"Just had the worst Valentine's Day experience here. I was looking so forward to this meal and to try their cheese wheel truffle pasta. But my high hopes were immediately shut down when we sat down and was told that the restaurant was only serving their prix fixe menu for the day - no exceptions. Okay - Now I felt like I was basically forced to dine here with their limited menu (looks like a Restaurant Week menu) that didn't even include the namesake Maiella truffle pasta. If you're charging nearly $100 pp (20% gratuity automatically applied), I would expect at least some degree of quality. The portions were small. The lobster bisque had good flavor but did not recall actually seeing any lobster pieces. The fra-diavolo spaghetti's texture was like raw dough, the sauce lacked flavor and spices, and the shrimp were rubbery! The dessert was even worse, the blueberries on my semifreddo were still FROZEN and the chocolate cake was really dry. NOT worth the calories, ladies! I understand from a business perspective that you're trying to turn tables as quickly as possible on a holiday, but this meal was overpriced and disappointing, without any personal touch nor care.

4.0,2/13/2019,"Great location in the heart of LIC. Excellent and attentive staff. A few blunders here and there by the wait staff but nothing outrageous (e.g. brought us the appetizers from the table next to us, drink was sitting at the bar for a bit until we reminded them about it, almost forgot about the bag for take out).We came as a couple with a newborn in a stroller on a Thursday. Place was packed but they managed to accommodate us in a location that was friendly for a stroller to be parked next to the table. Wine was available by the glass. Assumed we could order the bottle, but it was not advertised in the menu. Started with a half dozen oysters - not on the menu. They had offered two types of east coast oysters and one type of west coast oysters. We had the blue point, which is usually a safe choice. The tray of oysters came with three sauces - some sweet vinaigrette, a very mild hot sauce, and a typical cocktail and horseradish sauce. We also ordered the grilled octopus to start was well. It was okay. Had a nice char on it and decent flavor.For the main we got the Spaghettoni ai Frutti do Marie and the Fettuccini Maiella. The spaghettoni was pretty good.

2.0,2/12/2019,"I hate to write this review, but I don't think its worth it come all the way from downtown Manhattan. Maybe this is a sophisticated waterfront restaurant but there are improvements on their hospitality, such as have one specific waiter to take care of one Â table instead different waiters came to ours table to take our drink and food orders. When we asked about any recommendations on wine list, the waiter did not have a clear answer, he just pointed the menu to show us where the wine located on the menu. The food here was just fine, I liked the spaghetti with lobster, the flavor of lamb chop but the lamb chop itself is kind of fatty. The tender calamari did not came out the way we were expected. Service need to be improved, the waiter did not come back to check on us, only at the end of our meal, I can tell he did not seemed care enough our dining experience. Also finally when we asked for our check, I don't think the waiter was going to bring our check so the waiter who took our order in the very beginning had to bring it to us, when he received the check not even a thank you! That's fine! We chose to come here because I like the view and positive reviews on yelp, food seemed intriguing.

Since I saw this place when looking for a restaurant to enjoy restaurant week, thought this would be my opportunity to check it out. I met a friend here for dinner and really thought the restaurant was cute. Be mindful that parking nearby is hard to come by however the restaurant does have valet parking services. For the appetizer, I got the Burrata al tartufo and my friend got the Ribollita soup. I really enjoyed the burratta al tartufo, it was delish and I would definetly order it again. For the main course I got the Gnocchi ai Cinque Formaggi, which was good and I couldn't stop eating it even though I was stuffed like a pig. My friend got the Raviolione all'uovo and she stated it was good but she wished she ordered something else instead. For the dessert choice I asked the waiter what his favorite on the menu was and he stated the Panna cotta so I opted for that and my friend got the bread pudding. Luckily she wasn't as hungry when the dessert came because I found myself mostly eating hers and left the panna cotta to the side.

We had a reservation and our table was not ready until 30 minutes later. The host than says ""your table is ready if you still want it"" Me and my bf felt that was so rude and dismissive of our patience and wait time! They then brought us to a corner room away from the ambience of the restaurant, I was so upset that THAT was our table after a thirty minute wait! When I asked for another table the host said it would be a really long wait. My frustration level increased at the continued dismissiveness. Luckily a server overheard the conversation and saved the day! He said a table was going to be ready in two minutes.

I go to the Foodcellar next door for a 10$ burrata (two big round pieces) and the juiciest tomatos and make myself the best burrata salad ever. Where do you get your veggies?! Other than that - the pasta is great! Especially their cacio and pepe.

We arrived and did the valet parking for 10 bucks which was worth it because it was brick city outside! We were seated by the window with the most scenic views. Greeted by a very kind waiter and served almost immediately. We started off with the fresh bread and sundried tomatoes spread. The bread was warm, buttery and chewy. The sweet and salty taste of the spread matched perfectly. We then ordered an assortment of cheese and meats. We got the prosciutto, apple, two jams, pecorino with truffle and another one that slipped my mind lol they were so good. We of course ordered to the two pastas that came in the wheel of cheese. Mine was the red wine fettuccine with truffles galore and piles of cheese. I was like cheese cheese cheese! . My husband had the parmesan with pepper pasta and he devoured it.

2.0,1/2/2019,"The restaurant doesn't appeal me first because, as a neighbor, I don't like the way they take care of the client's cars which are most of the time double parked, blocking the street, etc. Besides that, the service is poor. First time I went for dinner the service was disappointing, but at least the food was good. Second time, the service was very very disappointing and the food wasn't good. The menu has no information about allergies at all and the waiter was not prepared or helpful to provide us with information about gluten. He actually got annoyed with our questions about the food and the ingredients. He left the table several times without answering our questions properly. I tried to order Melanzane, which according to the menu is eggplant, spinach, mozzarella, and tomato, but the waiter told me it is breaded. There is no such information on the menu. I don't really know if it's true or not. Due to the fact we were unsure about the allergies, we decided to order Fettuccini Maiella for my husband and daughter, who can't eat gluten, because the waiter had said that they could prepare all pastas gluten-free. No fettuccini and no Parmesan at all. The pasta, a kind of penne, was overcooked and with no Parmesan. My husband asked the waiter to bring Â him the Parmesan, but we ended up leaving the restaurant with no cheese at all. I ordered polenta with ribs, but I wasn't confident it was really gluten-free as the waiter had said. I ate it because I personally don't have issues with gluten, I just follow my daughter's diet when we are together.

It creates a dangerous traffic condition on a curved Â road and makes for a terrible neighbor.

Their apology of a glass of wine is far less than the only thing I would appreciate from this visit. I must say that the staff is amazing and always trying to please the customers. Also the valet guys were superb however the entire meal was at most mediocre. My party of six started with fried calamari and an array of mozzarella. The fried calamari was on the small size and the sauce was so bland. The cheeses were the only hit for appetizers. Every meal serve was missing any form of spices. The food was bland and we found the tomato base sauces to lack any indication of spices. For a place that I assume proclaims to be Italian, it should improve the main ingredient which is its sauce. This is the first time in many years whereas we requested additional items to make the sauce more bare able to digest. Don't see a reason to go back when there's not much to appreciate except for the staff.

But the bar service could have been better considering how dead the place was when we were there. You can be sitting there with an empty drink in front of you for 15 minutes and still not be able to get the bartender's attention that you'd like another. Getting a glass of water with your drinks and/or meal is like pulling teeth. After multiple dishes arrived we still had the same empty glasses of water sitting there throughout. My melted ice cube served as my water for the last meal to come out. The meals were good, but it was kind of awkward having the bread and dip without plates. We had to create our own makeshift plates by unfolding napkins on the bar.

Our hostess came and found us and carried our drinks to our table. Service was great. Our waiter took awhile to greet us but it was busy so we were understanding. He gave us great recommendations and was very attentive after. We ordered a few appetizers: lobster bisque soup, eggplant, grilled octopus, and scallops. The lobster bisque was a little watery, but that's just preference, it tasted like a plain old lobster bisque, nothing too exciting. It had maybe two chunks of lobster. All the food came out at the same time, so everything else was warm/cold after we finished the soup. The eggplant tasted like mozzarella, very cheesy, but I liked cheese. Next, I had the octopus, which was where I drew the line, it tasted absolutely burnt and salty. The olives in the dish were too overpowering, like I just ate pure salt. Then, the scallops, literally tasted like licking a grill. It was over cooked on the outside and undercooked on the inside. We returned the scallops as that could not be consumed. The two entrees we got were the lamb and the maiella fettuccini special. The fettuccini was made table side by the executive chef which was quite a spectacle, the truffle Parmesan pasta in a giant Parmesan cheese wheel was fun to watch. The lamb was cooked perfectly but the herbs was very similar to street food, strangely enough. The seasoning was nothing special. It came along with other seafood pieces that were pretty average: scallops (not grilled poorly) prawns, and polenta drenched in cheese. I think we were charged for the scallops we didn't eat as well, oh well. Overall, the ambience was great, mood, lighting, atmosphere and service was great. The food?

5.0,10/23/2018,"This restaurant is located inside of a hotel near the scenic water-scapes of Long Island City. I'd never heard of this place in my life when my friend wanted to come here for a weekend brunch/lunch a month ago. It was kind of a belated birthday celebration. Really cool because the inside is both beautiful and the outside looks out on to the surrounding hotel, Cola sign, and water behind you in a nice garden area. They don't do a super boozey brunch here but I did try a cocktail and it was really legit strong. I think we went with the Maeilla house drink and a Thyme Fizz. Delicious!First they start you off with a breadbasket that is unlike any other basket I've seen in my life. There were mini chocolate chip muffins, some kind of pound cake bread, croissants, a mascarpone butter whip and a really interesting jelly. The pasta is where this place shines though. They make some of their dishes table side in a giant wheel of cheese. I've never seen this done before and I know its a new thing for restaurants to pull out of their back pocket. But the Fettucine Maiella is one of the best things I've ever had in my life. It's cooked in red wine, parmesan, and an insane amount of truffles. My friend had the bucatini cacio e pepe and that was almost just as good but I still preferred my dish a stitch more. Insane. Desert is also insane. Get the nutella pannacotta served with chocolate chip gelato and never look back. I've never had a pannacotta before in my life and it blew my mind.Come in here if you feel like treating yourself.

Fantastic food, very elegant atmosphere and excellent, attentive, professional service is what you'll find here.Being it my first time here, my friend and I wanted to try multiple dishes, especially since everything looked good. We split 2 appetizers of a (daily special) sea scallop on creamy polenta and the eggplant. I wish I could let you taste my scallops. They were buttery soft but salty flavorful with just the right hint of sea flavor. Wow! Eggplant was 2 rolled up portions, very good.We had to try the Bucatini Cacio e Pepe which I have personally never had. They bring out the wheel of pecorino cheese and toss the freshly cooked pasta into it then spin it until the cheese melts into a light layer of sauce. Then it's topped with freshly ground black pepper. Excellent! The second entree was the slow cooked pork (belly, I think) with roasted potatoes & pear. Delicious, falling apart meat with a great combo of sweet pear and salty potatoes. For dessert we split the warm bread pudding sitting in a layer of custard. Although the portions looked small sitting in the oversized plates, they were the right size. We left quite full. Cabernet wine rounded out our meal.Parking is tough but they do have a great $10 valet service who you text when you're about to leave the restaurant so they have your car ready.

We asked him to ask the chef/kitchen multiple times and were given the same answers. Other questions we asked also resulted in us having more questions than answers. Unknowable staff.

4.0,10/5/2018,Definitely top notch Italian food. We had their signature Fettuccine dish which the chef came to our table to finish cooking and add his finishing touches. The drinks were pretty tasty and strong enough for a restaurant. This place sits on a strip of many other establishments and has an amazing view of NYC. There's valet parking which eliminates the stress of having to look for parking in that area.

2.0,9/29/2018,"Went for special occasion dinner... didn't expect to sit for a 3 hour plus meal. Â After being seated- waited 20 minutes and never were even acknowledged... had to call manager (Michael) over to see if we even had a server. Â Overall service was horrendous- had to keep asking over and over for the same things that went ignored: bread, water, salt.... etcFood took forever to come out with at least an hour between apps and main course- and after that wait- we couldn't believe the food came out cold. By the end all I could do was laugh that I was going to pay $400 for this below par experience. I brought these issues up 2x to one of the managers Â and he seemed annoyed and never even came over to check on us.

3.0,9/23/2018,"Came here for a romantic dinner with my boyfriend. We had reservations at 8:45 and arrived at 8:52, we had to wait for our table for about 15 mins and was seated towards the back room of the restaurant. My boyfriend specifically requested for a table by the window view and purposely made our reservation after the dinner rush for this reason. Maybe it was because we arrived a little late that our table was given away or possibly they don't read the memos on the reservation. As soon as we were seated I noticed that the wine glasses at our table were dirty and immediately asked for them to be cleared from the table. Our server was the manager of the restaurant and he was very polite and professional. He gave us the specials and his own recommendations which we followed with.For starters we got the grilled calamari and the pear salad. Both were very delicious and did not disappoint from the recommendations. I got the truffle gnocchi and my bf got the pasta that was made in the cheese in front of our table. It was definitely a fun show as they prepared my bf's pasta. My dish was amazing, perfectly seasoned and well balanced. However my bf's pasta was salty, he couldn't finish his dish sadly. For dessert we got the ganache slice and it was okay, nothing to write home about that. Overall we had a decent experience at this restaurant. I was happy and enjoyed my food, but my boyfriend felt unsatisfied and still hungry because he couldn't even finish his meal. The service we received was great in the beginning when we sat down and up until our appetizers, but sadly nobody came to check on us throughout our main course/dessert and when we needed our bill.

We ordered the polpo al carbone (grilled octopus), maiella mozzarella trio, risotto all' anatra (duck), and gnocchi al tartufo. For dessert we ordered the tiramisu and the nutella panna cotta (usually tiramisu is my favorite dessert anywhere I go but this time I enjoyed the panna cotta more).

One of the reasons I chose this spot was because I was under the impression that it was a waterfront restaurant, but unfortunately it's not. There's really no view from inside the restaurant, HOWEVER I highly recommend taking a short walk down to the water after dinner as the view is great.  Â The only reason this isn't a 5 star is because I came here to celebrate a birthday which I specified on my reservation. The hostess noted this when we checked in (not so subtlety) and told the other girl showing us to our seats to make sure the waiter knew to bring a piece of cake with a candle. Something must've gotten lost in translation because that didn't happen, and it was definitely a let down as my girlfriend would've really loved the surprise.

The food was OK - my fish was ice cold and the desserts were pretty bland, but it really was the service that we had a hard time with. In total the meal took 3.5 hours when it should've been no more than 2. We ordered wine and soda and didn't receive anything for over 30 minutes. It took even longer to get a second drink, even after reminding the waiter numerous times. It was also a birthday, and the waiter brought out a cake with candles that was ""on him"". Until it was listed on the bill, which we also waited over 30 minutes to get. There were two parties going on in the side rooms, so we tried to be understanding.

5.0,9/11/2018,"I've been here a few times and have mainly come for the happy hour and half-priced pizza at the bar. The pizza is great, especially with the deal they offer. A few times I've dealt with people at the front who don't know when the happy hour starts or ends or where you can sit. I would recommend that they should make sure everyone on the staff is aware of their own happy hour. Also, one time when I came, they wouldn't honor the happy hour even though I was already sitting at the bar and it was 1 minute past. I am a frequent customer and was disappointed in this customer service. Regardless of these interactions, I still want to leave a 5-star review because of Jason, one of the bartenders. He is extremely welcoming and hilarious. He got us to stay much longer than we thought we would, just due to his witty personality and creative mixology skills. He made my mom's night who fell in love with him. If you happen to go to Maiella- ask for Jason at the bar!

Presentation is where they absolutely deliver, on top of their fabulous waitstaff and gorgeous interior, they have two pastas that are served from within a wheel of cheese that is an Instagram win.

1.0,8/26/2018,"This was my third time visiting Maiella for dinner. My first experience was incredible. My second experience wasn't that great. We ran into small issues such as waiting 20 minutes for server to take our drink order, we endured an server shift change, steak was cold, and the merengue cake was so disappointing. The over all lack of attentiveness was horrible but I thought maybe it was an off night. Against my own judgement, I decided to give it another try for a friends birthday dinner.I made a reservation via Opentable and someone from the restaurant called me to confirm. I indication in my reservation that we wanted outdoor seating. The woman who called said that they received my request and without any issues able to accommodate. Great!There is ballet but there is a $10 charge. Why do I have to pay to park? The valley person took my cell phone number and said they would text me a confirmation and I could text about 10 minutes prior to us wanting to leave and my would be ready. Well, I did not receive the text. We got to restaurant at 8:00pm and were waiting for 1 other friend to arrive. I checked in with the hostess and reminded her that I made a reservation for outdoors. She told me that outdoor seating is on a first come, first serve basis. I explained that is not what I was advices in the phone. Luckily, they had a table opening up.While we were waiting, I ordered drinks from the bar. I gave the bartender a $100 bill for drinks $36 worth if drinks. First they ran out of champagne glasses. I mean, it's a Friday night and you have assistants. The bartender brought my change back in a typical leather card holder with no receipt and he gave me $39 in change. I was able to get his attention and told him that he gave me the wrong change back. At first he was confused. I explained that he owes me $64 and not $39 and I also asked for my receipt. Begrudgingly, he gave me my receipt and correct change. A bartender works with cash and should know how to count change. My other 2 friends were seated outside while I was clearing up the bartender issue. When I arrived outside the servers were wiping down our table. The hostess had spilled a glass of champagne all over the table and chair. Not a big deal. However, the waiter pulled out the chair for me to sit in and it was not dried enough and it was sticky so I took the chai we had our bags in and swapped it out in my own.We ordered 3 appetizers and only 2 came. they were enjoyable. We also ordered our main dishes and ordered a bottle of wine. The wine came and we noticed that 5 tables around us had been seated, they received bread and their appetizers and entrees before us even though we were seated before them. Now we had been waiting for 2 hours.One of the managers had walked by and we were able to chat with him. I explained to him about the valet issue and he took care of it. We asked our waiter what was taking so long and he said that the kitchen gave our food to another table. Fast forward 20 minutes later and we received our food. We ordered the gnocchi and fettuccini Maiella. Both were cold and very very oily. Against our own judgment we ordered 2 desserts which were okay. We were comped the bottle of wine and desserts which was a nice gesture and we did personally thank the manager. However, 2 our of my 3 visits have resulted in extremely disappointing experiences.

3.0,8/26/2018,"Decided to try somewhere new for date night. We had made reservations and i had requested, if possible to be seated outside. Because of the nice weather we were told there was a wait for it, so we just said it was ok if we sat inside. As we waited, we had a drink at the bar. The specialty cocktails were very good and the bartender was friendly. When it was time to go to the table, they in fact seated us outside which was great. It took about 10 mins for a waiter to come to our table, which wasnt horrible because we could tell they were busy so we didnt think much of it, at first. We ordered more drinks, appetizers, and our entrees. My boyfriend had ordered the shrimp risotto as a first course and another shrimp dish as his main. I had also ordered the shrimp risotto but as a my main course. My boyfriend even made sure that the waiter understood this and the waiter repeated the order back with everything we ordered. The drinks took exceptionally long to get to the table, about 15 mins the first time. Once the drinks arrived, my boyfriend ordered another round and joked that it would be there in time for our main course. Once again drinks took another 15 minutes to arrive. I had wine and my boyfriend had a vodka orange juice. This doesnt require that much time in preparationso the wait time was ridiculous. Also, my boyfriend ordered a pepsi which took 10 minutes, which is insane! The food was decent but once the main course came the waiter forgot my shrimp risotto. He apologized and said if I wanted it he would bring it, but because the service took so long i just said forget it. Plus at this point, my boyfriend was visibly frustrated. This ruined the mood for the night and i just shared his 2nd course. 10 minutes later the waiter brought the risotto and compd it. It was nice but the mood was already ruined. Not to mention my bf ordered a side of potatoes which never came but also wasnt put on the bill. We quickly asked for the bill, paid and left.

5.0,8/25/2018,They obvs don't need my good review but this place is outstanding. I think it's reasonably priced and the quality service and food is amazing.Server Named Angel was amazing and patient no matter what we asked him for. Chef came to talk w us. Charming and kind. Front of house staff were lovely. They check in to make sure you're enjoying. Bathrooms are clean which means kitchens are too. Try to make a reservation. It gets really busy. Inside can get a little loud -it's a big place. Outside is quieter but you miss some of the theatrics going on inside. Like lighting the cheese on fire and watching dough get made and prosciutto get sliced. Service is great. They replace utensils between meals. Water glass is always full. Wine list is on an iPad. It's not too long and many reasonably priced IMO ($36 and up). Hard to see in the sun outside though. Bread is served hot and it's so delicious. Light And chewy but a little crusty and airy. Almost like focaccia. They will bring you more for no extra charge. They serve w sun dried tomato spread. Yum. Ask for olive oil and use both. Their oo is so good. Try really hard not to fill up on bread. Good luck. They are definitely using quality and fresh ingredients. They make a lot in house And import things from Italy. We got Pizzas:Margarita - sauce is delicious. It's like eating garden fresh tomatoes $14. Crust is perfect. Crispy but still chewy. It's perfection. The one w meatballs $18- good size pieces. Didn't taste it though my dad loved it. Crust is a little thicker to hold toppings. Robiola Pizza - $22 looks like pie. It's like a stuffed crust w a creamy cheese and arugula and it's a generous size- but FYI it's a mild Sheep goat milk kind of taste. It's SO good. Server suggested adding prosciutto to it next time. Mmm. Duck - $32 my sister cleaned the plate. But I didn't taste it so can't say more Salmon tartar - $18 -fresh and generous portion. Asian flavors. Italian cheesecake - light and creamy. Dip it in the berry sauce on the plate. Yum $10Flourless chocolate cake $12- tastes liked a light and fluffy brownie -$5 for a scoop of gelato Only real complaint is the bottle of white wine wasn't cold enough. And Diet Pepsi $3 was served in skinny cocktail glass so you don't get much. They have gluten free options - we were excited to see Millet (a kind of gf grain) on the menu Good for vegetarians. Maybe not vegans. There is no hurry here. They space out courses. You can sit and relax and take it all in.

It happened only once than I had to ask all the time. The worst part of the meal that I was being rushed. The busboy came to the time a half dozen times to ask if we were done. You want to hear the best: my father was chugging his beer and this busboy is asking him if he could take is plate. LEAVE HIM THE $&@- ALONE before the poor man chokes in his beer. At the end of the meal I asked the server and the busboy 5 different times for toothpicks. Do you think they brought them? Nooooo. I had to go inside and ask myself for them at the bar.Now to the owner of this place which I know very well and far back from his old place on 31 Ave. If the service suck the food won't taste good. I'm sorry but the truth hurts. Hoping that you guys will improve.",0,0,0,Tony M.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",0,34,4

My wife ordered the Branzino without salt added and it was beyond excellent. As if that wasn't enough, the chef and the owner came over to make sure everything was perfect. I had a pasta dish which was wonderful. We ordered the signature Merengue cake for desert and it was superb. There's valet parking, a ferry stop nearby so getting here not difficult at all.

3.0,8/4/2018,"Let me say we chose this place based on their website which says fine dining on the water -depicting a beautiful city view. Â Not! Â no water view at all and no view. In fact shades pulled all the way down and no view. Â This could be of course due to western exposure. Â Was with a party of 4 for a very special occasion for both couples. Food, apps and entrees were delicious (although portions rather skimpy) but veal dish was very veined and tough and over half of it was not eatable. We brought it to the servers attention and he just said he would tell the manager. Â When the bill came there was no adjustment and for the prices at this establishment you would expect a fine meal.. Â We paid our bill and tipped our server who was attentive and friendly. Â On the way out the manager asked how our meal was. One of the ladies relayed about the veal dish and his response was just to hand her his business card and hope she brought her friends back soon. Â What are we supposed to do with that. Besides this valet service takes forever. My husband joked where did you bring the car, Manhattan? Â Won't be back Maiella.

We were greeted as soon as we sat by someone telling us that our server would be with us right away and served us our water. This was the only good service we would get at our table all night. We ordered some drinks (Moscow Mule & a glass of wine) along with the Grilled Octopus & Buffalo Mozzarella plates. We asked 3 times for some balsamic for the cheese with no avail... the octopus was grilled nicely, yet it comes in a sweet tomato sauce with olives and chickpeas... not a great compliment to the flavor of the octopus. We had to track our waiter down to order our main courses as we finished our appetizers... would've liked to order before we got to the end of the first course but alas...We proceeded with the Gnocchi & the Lamb Ragu for the main course... gnocchi was creamy , yet bland... and the only saving grace was the truffle slices on top. Lamb Ragu was under seasoned and again with that sweet tomato sauce... My wife went for the Tiramisu, and that was ""the best"" thing she'd had at the restaurant... to which I replied ""that's not saying all that much.""

Â The grilled octopus was very good, but the portion was extremely small and left me wanting more. The burrata appetizer was delicious. They also put foccacia bread on the table with a tomato sauce/paste to spread on the top - I was not impressed with this.I ordered the Paccheri all' Aragosta (Maine lobster, sweet peas, cherry tomato) for my main course which was good, but definitely needed a little bit more lobster and a little more flavor. Â It was just lacking something. Â My fiance ordered the Bigoli Neri ai Calamaretti (Homemade squid ink bigoli, calamari, fava, fresh peperoncino). Â He enjoyed it very much.Instead of being handed a dessert menu, all of the desserts were presented to us on a platter for us to choose from. Â This really made it difficult to say no! Â We chose the Nutella Pannacotta which was definitely lacking in the Nutella department, but was still chocolaty and delicious nonetheless.Our server, Armando, was great.

3.0,7/28/2018,Definitely not worth the money. Food was very sub-par compared to the price and the way it was portrayed in Yelp. I felt the potato wedges i got w my branzino dish was left over from previously made o batch maybe a day ago and wasn't really freshly made. All the food we ordered was disappointing and all under sub-par. Def not desire to go back. The only nice gesture that made up for the disappointment was that the hostess took notice that it was our friend's birthday dinner and they surprised us w a nice Italian cake. Was very sweet and thoughtful. That was the only redeeming quality to the really sub-par quality of food. Â So that was THE one good thing that came out of this experience.

Unfortunately the weather wasn't all that great and we weren't able to experience the outdoor seating on the water in LIC. We had a variety of different wines and cocktails, the best was the Aperol Spritz, exactly how you would find in Italy. The options for food for restaurant week were limited but very appealing. Since we were a party of 6, we basically tried everything that they had to offer. I started with the Insalata de Pere Caprino (Carmelized Pear, Goat cheese, and Currant salad). Very fresh and delicious. The best appetizer was the Burrata with sundried tomato, figs, and prosciutto. My main course was the Gnocchi al Tartufo Estivo. The Gnocchi was amazing, very soft in the middle and perfectly cooked. I was also able to try the Tortelli al Vino Rosso which was great as well as the Branzino. The Branzino was definitely my favorite bite of food that I put into my mouth. It was cooked very well and served with potatoes. For Dessert I had the triple layer chocolate cake which was very good. The cake wasn't too sweet as you oftentimes see with a cake of that caliber. My girlfriend tried the Meringue cake which was good, nothing to write home about.

4.0,7/16/2018,"Almost 5 stars but a couple of things.I will say this, I have zero complains with the food. Fantastic all around. Very good portions and everything was perfectly done. Why it gets only 4 stars (well the food was amazing) if the food was bad it would get 2 stars.1. Lipstick residue still on the glasses. I get they have been washed, but lipstick has wax in it and will not come off the glasses unless hand washed. This is a task the restaurant did not perform and is a huge cleanliness concern for me. If you side step this what else have you side stepped.2. Â I ordered a 2012 bottle of wine and received a 2013. No mention was made to me when it was brought out until the glasses were poured and realized it after the fact, but did not drink it until the issue was resolved. I told the waiter and was then was told they had a glitch in their system (aka the iPads they use for the wine list) and there was nothing they could do and it would be the same price. I am a big wine guy and can tell you for a fact that each year a bottle changes price depending on the vintage. If it's a bad year it will be less, if it's a good year it will be more. If you're going to make the switch communication should be made prior. We ended up liking the wine so we didn't make a big fuss about it. Compensation was made at the end where I received a glass of grappa and I thank them for doing so. Side note: PLEASE STOP USING IPADS. Finger grease all over the iPad, impersonal, cheesy, not classy. Make a wine list in paper. Some things should never change.3. The interior of the restaurant is beautiful. I cannot say the same for the outdoor seating area. It's like going from a 5 star restaurant to a cafe. Very little decor, no plants etc. If you're going to offer an outdoor seating area it should match the rest of the restaurant. This is a huge area that should be updated and in return would exponentially receive more business. Nothing wrong with exterior, but it was exceptionally bland.Let be clear, I am not a snob. However, if I am going out to a ""casually elegant"" restaurant the top 3 things should never happen. Yes I know the word casual was used, but I have been in far less casual restaurants and have never experienced the 3 main concerns above. I'm being harsh for one reason, the food is fantastic and it angers me that the manager/owner would let these things slide based on the level of this restaurant.

I had a seafood with pasta and the shrimp tasted rubber along with the lobster it was so hard and just plain no taste. Others had steak and seafood and complained about the shrimp and lobster just being so tasteless and tough. Even the cheesecake we ordered wasn't good.

4.0,7/2/2018,"Looking at a range of restaurants for my birthday, I zeroed in on Maiella. Â I'm loving this section of Long Island City and the posted reviews, views, and menu affirmed my choice.As this was a splurge evening, we went all out. Yes, it is very easy to spend a lot of money at Maiella ... but I see that one can cut back and have a wonderful meal.My daughter, husband and I started with a portion-and-a-half Â -- nice that they can do that! -- of the insalata Bianca, with endive, frisee, romaine, walnuts and gorgonzola. This is a good departure from the typical green salad. Note that one portion (forget the half) is plenty for three, as a starter. Next came the charcuterie plate, which simply put, is divine. Â One can choose from a selection of Â meats and cheeses. Â (I'd be happy with a Â bottle of wine and a 5-item plate.)If you like lamb, you'll love the pistachio crusted lamb chop. (A week later, and my husband is still talking about it!) I went with the butterfly shrimp and eggplant -- a good choice! -- Â and my daughter had the filet. While cooked as requested, she wasn't bowled over -- though she enjoyed Â leftovers for lunch the next day.With our eyes bigger than our stomachs, we ordered an old favorite, fried zucchini, for the table. Â  It needed something to jazz it up, rendering it good, not great. Â Our waiter -- who by the way, was excellent -- brought over a tray of desserts. Â We chose one for the three of us: Â the most delicious bread pudding, topped with a scoop of ice cream. Â OMG, try it!The wine list is pricey.

3.0,7/2/2018,"Maiella is a good restaurant overall (not outstanding). The food is consistent and of good quality. My issue is the pricing. It's just overkill. Veal Parm is $36.00. A lamb chop entree is $48.00. Pastas are well over $20.00, most nearing $30.00, some exceeding $30.00-- not even Babbo in Manhattan (an expensive restaurant itself) charges that much for pasta in New York. I understand that LIC is getting hip and expensive, but Maiella seems to be taking overt advantage of that and it's not right. Their mark-ups are outrageous. An important factor in picking any restaurant, especially in a competitive market like New York where there are many good options, is VALUE. Although I have generally enjoyed my experiences at Maiella, the value there is poor and by the end frankly, I feel ripped off when I am there-- or price gouged. I can have a better meal in the West Village at a top Italian spot and pay less. Why would I go out of my way to visit Maiella?

3.0,6/28/2018,"My friend decided to celebrate her 21st birthday at Maiella which has a wonderful view of the Manhattan skyline and Brooklyn bridge just a short walk away. The restaurant itself is beautiful, spacious, rustic yet modern, and has valet parking (woohoo!) I arrived a little early for the reservation and the hostess was kind enough to direct me to a lounge-y area where people just wait or get drinks and talk. When the full party arrived, we were walked to the back of the restaurant with a table large enough for our entire party to sit comfortably and isolated enough that it had a semi-private feel. I really did enjoy the interior design, with wine stored all throughout the ceilings of the place and large mirrors along the wall. The menu was extensive filled with lots of high quality seafood, meats, pastas, and pizzas. For those not looking to spend a lot, you could get a large sized pizza for less than $20! However, if you are feeling a little fancier and is wanting to treat yourself, there are some foods that can cost almost $50-$60! I decided to share food with a friend and got a magherita pizza, a chicken pharm, and calamari. Appetizers come out first and the entrÃ©e actually took a relatively long time to come out afterwards. When I was the calamari, I was confused to say the least. It definitely was not what I was expecting. It's a lightly breaded large piece of squid on a skewer, which I'll attach a photo of. Nevertheless, it was delicious but I wish it were little rings of squid battered and fried with marinara sauce. When all the food came out, they were all huge portions and looked delicious. The pizza took a little while longer to come out. The chicken pharm was a little salty for my liking, the magherita pizza was simple which I enjoyed.. probably my favorite thing after sampling multiple other things on the menu through friends. After dinner was over, they brought over a slice of meringue cake for the occasion (not complimentary) and they had a wonderful way of displaying their dessert menu but we ultimately opt'd not to get dessert since everyone had to take their food out (HUGE PORTIONS!) Overall, I had a nice experience here and would probably consider coming back although with all the competition in the neighborhood, it would not be my first choice. The food was good, not great.

3.0,6/10/2018,"Not sure how I feel about this place. Our food was pretty good but service was just OK and the maitre d's behavior was just a little too snooty for me. When we arrived he said the restaurant was full and we could sit at the bar and how he had all these reservations that night so no room. He just stared at us uncomfortably. We just thanked but when we turned to leave, he told us to wait while he checked "" something"". Â He shortly returned and we were seated. So what was all that about being full before? Â Did he want something? This table just appeared out of nowhere? Â The drinks were very slow to come and we were never asked if a refill was desired.

3.0,6/9/2018,"Maiella is a gorgeous restaurant, with an idyllic location right on the waterfront and the food is superb. The many seafood dishes are especially noteworthy, from calamari to seabass, always fresh and perfectly cooked. The Maiella pasta, made tableside directly from a ginormous cavernous block of cheese, is cheesy carb heaven. The only reason I'm giving it 3 Â was because of service timing. First of all, since early on in the booking, we agreed on our tables to be ready by 8, as many in our group were fasting and needed to break fast at 8.25 sharp. The booking was made for 8 PM, the contract stated 8 PM, but when I arrived in advance and announced myself to the receptionist, she said ""I have your party down for 8.30."" I had to re explain the whole situation before accomodating everything be ready by 8 PMSecond was the print out menu. I stated well in advance (also noted in the contract) that there should be no pork in any of the menu items, and that the burrata should be vegetarian sans prosciutto, which was always an option available in the menu. The final printed menu still stated prosciutto with the burrata, causing a moments panic among my guests; I had to assure them it was a typo and just to make sure I had to then reconfirm my request with manager & service staff : please make sure the kitchen knows that nothing should contain pork. I had a VIP party of 14, and although they had our orders by 8.30 and everything (starters, primi, sides) were set menu save for the mains, the main course did not come out until well past 10.30. I found it frustrating that even though we were always well tended to with our drinks & water glasses never being empty, I had to actually ask why the heck our main course haven't come out by 10.15. A few of our VIP guests actually had to leave before eating because they needed to catch flights. I was mortified. Only after making a fuss, our waiter & manager went back to the kitchen to check up on our mains. They did apologize profusely and tried to compensate with dessert, but by 11 our guests had to leave and so desserts were packed in to-go containers. I have always loved Maiella and have been a repeat customer over the years, but if event management is going to be this haphazard, I can sadly no longer reccommend it for any of our future corporate dinners.",0,0,0,Annisa P.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,7,0

2.0,6/4/2018,"Went yesterday for the first time to celebrate a girlfriend's birthday. We had a reservation for 7:15. The table was ready at the time we arrived. We got a good table in the corner by the window. Started off great. But then little by little it started to go down from there. We started with some appetizers. A selection of the salumi, beef carpaccio, burrata, oysters and a Margherita pizza. The salumi selection was okay. The very little cheese that was on it was a bit bland. The beef carpaccio was room temperature. It should have been more cold. The burrata was good but the figs were too sweet. And the margherita pizza had no basil. Which is what i was really most upset about. First of all if the kitchen ""ran out"" of basil the server should inform us and ask us if we would still want it. Secondly, not only did he not inform us but when he placed the pizza down he just said there's no more basil and just walked away. Our server was not there to refill our water. Our drinks too a long time. And anything we asked for took a while. Then our entrees came. My friend ordered his steak medium (i know dont ask) and it came out medium rare. Also his shrimp was over cooked which made them rubbery and overly salted. The pappardelle lamb ragu and gnocci was good. But the mushroom risotto was bland. We then informed our waiter and said that we brought a cake. He said okay and then still brought out the selection of desserts. So then we chose a dessert which he then brought out with a candle. But again we had to say that we brought our own cake. So by the time he got it, we had to sing happy birthday 2 separate times when he should have brought it out all at once.

5.0,6/1/2018,"So if you dont know this place its easy to think its pretentious, and you wouldn't be totally wrong at first. With that being said, once you get past how much they love themselves you will see that they are correct to do so.The food is really great, the menu has a great variety and there is something at basically every price point. I personally think the $14 pizza is better than the $34 hamburger (you read that right). You can easily dress to the nines and spend a small fortune here, or you can roll in in sweats and sit at the bar on a sunday and have a very reasonable bill. Either way your going to have a good meal and a good time.Alfredo the bartender is awesome, very personable, very service oriented and knows how to pour a drink. The meant and cheese plates cover a good variety and you can get things from your run of the mill pasta to braised duck breast spinach pasta.

5.0,5/28/2018,"My boyfriend and I spent had his birthday dinner here on the Friday of Memorial Day weekend. Backstory: I called a few day in advance, after booking on open table to confirm the special request I had left on the site--special seating near ""the best view of the city"", a happy birthday song after our entree. When I spoke to the hostess, she was warm, and informed me that the restaurant did not accommodate reserved seating, and could assist us with planning the birthday song. I was a little disappointed about the reserved seating, but understood.The day of his birthday, we arrived 45 minutes late to our reservation. So we expected a wait and I didn't expect a ""great"" seat. A few minutes after our arrival, the hostess grabbed us from the bar and told us our table was ready. The place was packed, yet she smiled as she turned around while leading us to tell us that we actually were getting the best seat in the house. I don't know if that was a coincidence (because of what the first hostess told us over the phone), but I was super happy.Once seated, our waiter, Elias, was attentive and warm. The view was ok, theres a gate blocking the waterfront, but you can see the NYC skyline. I was happy with our seating. Something happened while we were there-- I believe the restaurant was getting an inspection and so all the customers had to wait until it was over, about 30 minutes, to receive food. It was no big, we already had been served our appetizer and were in a pretty good mood + we appreciated the honesty and were having a good night. Shit happens right? While we were waiting, Elias informed us the drinks were on the house and kept refilling our wine, even though we started drinking a little faster as we got a little more tipsy. :-)Our food finally came out, small portions, but delicious. Â We both enjoyed our meals. I had the fettuccine maiella, and he had the pistachio ravioli (?). Â We aren't dessert people, so right after we finished our entrees, the waiters all Brought a small scoop of ice cream with a candle in Â it and sang happy birthday.All in all, I thought our experience was great.

1.0,4/8/2018,"Edited to add: seems like the owner only responds to perfect reviews. Not a word under ours. Downgraded to a 1 point. I really really wanted to love it but i just couldn't. We came here to celebrate our anniversary and were super excited. Staff was very nice, we got seated right away. We ordered a bottle of white wine which proved to have sort of an acidic note. Never mind, i figured once paired with the food it would work. They brought out focaccia with some kind of tomato paste looking thing. I couldn't stomach it. For apps we got blue point oysters, the pork belly, the octopus and the burrata. The oysters were great. The pork belly was dry as anything and the rice it came with was way undercooked and kind of pasty. The octopus was chewy, whereas in other places it simply melts in the mouth and was served with a terrible tomato sauce. The burrata was just ok, wrapped in prociutto and served with fig. For the entree i chose the maiella pasta and my husband chose the duck ragu pasta. My pasta was prepared table side in a big wheel of cheese. It's a terrible idea to reheat Alfredo sauce. My pasta turned into nothing short of oil and fat. It was difficult to eat. My husbands pasta lacked any semblance of flavor. The vegetables in the ragu were hard and way undercooked. We watched the owner walking around, shaking hands with every patron except us. When it came to dessert time the waiter showed us an array of various sweets. We chose an Italian merengue cake which was nothing short of bread and cream. To make matters worse, they in no way acknowledged that it was our anniversary, even though we mentioned that when making the reservation. The worst part of the evening was when the chef came out to cook a table side dessert for the other patrons next to us. We weren't even offered this service. The entire dining experience made us feel like the ugly stepchildren that they simply discarded leftovers to.

We were sat next to the window and I had a perfect view of the Empire State Building and the Chrysler building. Our waiter promptly arrived with menus and told us the specials. He recommended a great Italian red wine which I forgot the name of. For apps we went with grilled calamari with bread crumbs and burrata. The calamari would have been much better without the breadcrumbs. It did nothing for the taste and texture. Simply grilled with olive oil,salt, pepper and lemon is all it needed. The burrata with prosciutto and figs was delicious however. For entrees we went with the red wine infused fettuccine with truffles warmed up on the cheese wheel. That was fun to watch and I tried it from my friend's plate and it was really delicious. I had the duck with gooseberries and polenta. It wasn't bad but I wasn't inlove with it either. The duck was cooked medium well and I had asked for it medium. It also lacked flavor. I should of gone with a seafood dish since I saw plenty of enticing ones on the menu. For dessert we shared the vanilla panacotta. That was literally my favorite part of the entire meal. It was light,creamy,not overly sweet and great with the berries. A great ending to my meal.

Upon entering Maiella the staff greeted us politely and we were seated. The menu had so many wonderful choices that it was tough making a decision. We had the burrata appetizer. It was a delicious. We also ordered the stuffed eggplant with ricotta and spinach. Our 10 year old daughter (who is not a fan of spinach) devoured it! I ordered a ""special"" which was gnocchi with truffles. Â The gnocchi were so delicate and light, like little clouds. After the dish was presented to me, the waiter proceeded to shave the truffles on the gnocchi. Let me say, he was generous with the shavings! We apologize for not recalling his name, but the waiter was so attentive, and friendly. He was very concerned with our comfort. He was a delight! Â We have eaten at Babbo in NYC many times. When ordering a dish with truffles, they are a bit stingy with the shavings, but not a Maiella. My daughter has a made-to-order bucatini pasta with truffle shavings and she was so happy. During our meal, Tommy (an owner) came over and introduced himself. He is such a sincere and caring individual and shared his preference for ""light and fluffy ricotta gnocchi"" with us. Throughout the night we observed him, catering to each diner, and making sure everyone was comfortable and happy. The manager, Anthony, also approached us and wanted to make sure everything was ok; it was more than OK it was paradise on earth! Â My husband had the duck ragu with pappardelle, he loved it, and savored each bite. Dessert was perfection! Â My daughter had the italian meringue, I had the creme brulee, and my husband had the Nutella semifreddo. Â We are in consensus that they were all incredible desserts and tip our hats to the pastry chef. My daughter sampled all three of the desserts, and is still talking about them! Â Our next visit to the restaurant will include their signature dish of wine infused pasta with truffles created on a parmesan wheel. We watched the chef, Rafael create the dish for many diners who were in awe. Â I can go on and on about Maiella!

Â It's enjoyable but not memorable. Â I had the View Parmigiana (presentation is terrific) which was good. Â Others at my table had the Shrimp, Salmon and suckling pig - all good. Â Portions are large. Â None great.Price -- it's pricy but what you would expect at a water front restaurant in NYC with views of Manhattan. Entrees between $30-$40. Â No surprise.Service -- not good, WAY to slow. Â Sat down and didn't get to order drinks for 20 minutes then took another 15 minutes for them to come. Â Over 30 minutes before your 1st drink arrived. Â That's way to long!!! Â  The appetizers came in reasonable time but dinner was again too long of a wait. Â Then we sat with our dirty dinner plates (after we finished eating) for atleast 20 minutes before anyone came to take them away. Â The server was very nice, good personality and knowledgeable of the menu, but needed to pay better attention to serving the tables. Â All he tables experienced the same (we spoke about it with tables next to us - that's how noticeably slow the service was!!!)Last comment -- we did their special fettuccine plate they make table-side. Â Great presentation. We did as appetizer, and good thing we did. Â It's a heavy plate with all the cheese, too heavy as your main course. Great to share as an appetizer. Â We ordered 1 plate and shared 4 ways. Â The server was pushing us to get 2 plates for sharing but you don't need that much. Just enough for a taste. Would I come back? Â Yes maybe it was a bad service night or maybe I just had a bad server (which I think was the case as other tables with different servers seems have better experience). I saw tables with different servers sit after us and have drinks before we even ordered.",0,0,0,Stephen V.,"Sea Cliff, NY",0,24,4

2.0,2/27/2018,"I have been a customer at Maiella for 2 years. For 1.5 of those years it was excellent. My wife and I would literally come 3-4 times a week. However, in the past 6 months there has been a deep decline in overall service. Service is our number one requirement. This is not the fault of the staff. This is the fault of the management. This restaurant is under staffed and the workers can't possibly keep up with the demand. The management must have changed and it has not been for the better. We now, maybe come once a week and that is only bc we come to see our good friend. Tonight has taken so long and I am so disappointed in management I won't be back for a while. Please, hire more important staff and get rid of the manager who has made all of these changes. Your business is hurting and I can see it every time I do come back.Also, the bar was so slow that you lost money.

2.0,2/24/2018,"I came to Maiella's with my wife, her cousin, and her husband. The cousin fell for the reviews and made a 6 pm reservation. We made a bad decision and ate outside because on 7/3 it became a little windy and making the umbrellas outside a little unstable before the staff decided to close them after numerous customers concerns. We ordered the calamari, stuffed clams and moz w/prosciutto as apps. The apps were good but nothing to write home about. Dinner we ordered two lasagna specials,a margherita pizza and a fish dish. When served, the fish came out cold, the lasagna was nothing great and the pizza was average. Service was very slow because of a large party inside but with that said and it being July 4th weekend, everybody should've have on hand and service should've been better. For dessert we ordered a tartufo, and a cannoli. $9 for a cannoli?! I'm sorry but I work too hard for my money to be spending at mediocre restaurants when I'm expecting a better experience.

But we didn't hold back, two app to share and two drinks each for four of us. I ordered the Mari and Marti(I think), the surf and turf basically. The steak was superb!!! I generally like my steak medium well but ordered it medium because most chefs mess it up, but the one didn't. It came out medium and quite yummy. It wasn't rubbery and didn't melt in your mouth. But the more you chewed the better it tasted. It was served with truffle mash (yes, soooo much flavor), well cooked asparagus, and like 5 large well charred prawns! The short rib was divine, it fell of the fork and melted in your mouth, but a bit too fatty for a smaller plate. The Gnocchi had no potatoes but tasted sooo rich, the ricotta was extremely fresh and a made it a really filling plate. The Fettuccini Alfredo has house made pasta, which made me feel like I was back in Italy, perfectly cooked and comes with a cheese pot presentation. They melt the cheese on a cheese bowl at the table and add fresh white and black truffle after! All in all a great place with a great chef and menu and view.

Polpo al Carbone had a good quality of grilled octopus, but a sauce with Chick Pea were not match with this dish. Polpette pizza was so delicious that they made it in the authentic pizza oven. I will definitely try another pizza,again. Spagettoni Fra Diavolo served with fresh seafoods and great tomato sauces, but the spagetti noodle was thick texture for me. Carre D'Agnello was good and their sauce was harmonized with Lamb chop.

3.0,2/12/2018,"This is a restaurant with a beautiful decor, which inspires a sophisticated but fun vibe. We had made a reservation for a party of five one week in advance for a Saturday evening. It was a special occasion and we requested a window table at time of booking. We were told the request would be noted. On the Saturday of our outing to Maiella, we called to reconfirm our reservation (we are true New Yorkers) and again mentioned our request. We were told it was noted and that it wouldn't be a problem and we even had a name to go with the confirmation. Upon arrival at 7, we were especially appreciative of the valet parking since it was raining and it is difficult to find parking in that area. Â We were 'acknowledged' by what seemed like an overwhelmed host who barely greeted us. After about 5 minutes we were seated at a 5 top right next to the server station. We casually mentioned our initial request for a window spot and were unapologetically told there weren't any available. Which we could see was true. We knew we had gotten pretty much the worst seat in the house. But our mood was celebratory and we moved on. I did however tell one of the managers who did tell me he would relay my comment to the GM, who was in the house that evening. I was slightly disappointed in the manager's response. He was professional and kind but dispelled any notion that perhaps they could have done better like actually reserved a table for us. That's what a true 4 + star restaurant would do and so that's what I had expected. Â Drinks were great, food was very good. I can't remember dessert because the drinks were that good. Service was fine except one guest's vegetable arrived at least 10 minutes after the entrees. The cooking of the pasta table side was, honestly, unremarkable.

1.0,11/20/2017,"great spot for a view, good food but awful service. Went in for brunch/lunch the restaurant was not busy at all, yet they were not attentive. Be careful ordering the Fettuccini Maiella(extra $8), they it cook in a block of cheese. First of all they don't explain the process of what they are doing, not explaining the ingredients or the flavors like some reviews said. They don't properly clean the cheese block!! There was a piece of a hard old shrimp in my pasta. It was over an inch piece of shrimp tail hiding in between my pasta. The guy cooking should have seen it there, if that doesn't tell you the attention they put into keeping things sanitary. Well after I told the waiter they brought the manager, then a group of them huddled in the middle of the room discussing, the manager then approached me and he apologized and offered me another plate, at that point I wasn't hungry anymore. After that none of the waiters were around our table, the restaurant was close to empty. They did not charge us for that plate.

4.0,11/11/2017,"Still love this place (we've been here 4 times now, counting our visit on 11/4). Â If we ever want a special night out, this is still our go-to. Â I've lowered this to 4 stars due to our last experience, but I am still excited to return and hope to up it again with the next one. Â This didn't seem to be a typical night, and I hope that it was the exception and not the new rule.The restaurant was clearly overbooked that night. Â There were noticeably more tables set up Â than previously, and I can understand the reasoning - for every table you can fit in, the more people you can accommodate and the more money you can bring in. Â I know the weather had gotten colder as well, so while there used to be more seating outside, that was no longer an option.While financially it might seem like a good move in the short term, I wouldn't be surprised if this negatively affected things in the long term though... For us, it truly diminished the entire experience while we were there. Â Aside from just feeling claustrophobic, you were considerably closer to other parties. Â It's hard to feel intimate or that you have any sort of privacy when you can easily overhear the conversations next to you and even across from you, and that they can equally hear yours as well. Â As much as we tried not to listen in, we couldn't help but hear the snobby complaints of the girls next to us. Â They even self-proclaimed to being ""food snobs"" and ""truffle queens"" and acted like that gave them a license to continue their horrible, entitled behavior. Â It was hard to ignore them to focus on what was supposed to be a romantic 5 year anniversary dinner. Â Instead we were just disgusted with humanity, and we felt immense pity for our servers who tried so hard to accommodate them, bending over backwards to get them whatever they asked. Â There were more accidents that night as well, as people were bumping tables to get in and out. Â Even putting aside these distractions, which were bothersome but not deal breakers for us (after all, it's not Maeilla's fault that some rotten egg customers were there), it was clear that the kitchen was severely backed up and staff were overrun. Â The wait time detracted the most from the whole ordeal. Â Our server did his best to keep everyone happy, but there wasn't much he could do if the food wasn't ready. In the end, we were at the restaurant for close to 3 hours... We waited over an hour between appetizer and entree alone. Â  I'm unfortunately a lightweight when it comes to wine, so I typically wait until I have more food in me before I can really drink it, so it was unfortunately a lot of waiting until the food arrived. Â It would have helped to have received bread to hold us over in between, but that never came.I was also sad to see that Maiella had changed their menu (it appears to be less than before).  One of the dishes I was most excited about, the lamb chops, was gone. Â Perhaps I was just disappointed in not getting what I had been looking forward to, but I felt the truffle gnocchi special was disappointingly bland... Â I wished I had gotten the Maiella Fettuccine (which I did try on our third visit, by the way, and it is as AMAZING as it looks!!) While an assistant chef was topping off my gnocchi with truffles, the snobby girls next to us grabbed him to complain and wouldn't let him leave. Â He tried to smooth the situation over and ended up talking to him for an extended period of time. Â  She bullied him into giving her some truffles as well. Â We later saw him being pulled to the side and yelled at by another staff member.Maiella did acknowledge the delays and did offer us a free dessert as an apology. Â I felt that was a kind gesture and we did appreciate that. Â As good as they were, I'd give up all of my desserts if it meant having a better, more timely experience next time. Â I sincerely hope that Maiella finds the perfect balance of seats vs. service. Â I am eager to return again!",0,0,0,Jennifer P.,"Queens, NY",0,36,38

3.0,10/4/2017,"I have to say : fantastic atmosphere very good service but I would not say excellent, now we could talk about what's important the food, I was not impressed at all i see that there a gimmick is the Pasta inside the parmigiano wheel,So let's talk about that Joe the cheese guy who prepared the pasta was very nice but a quarter of a pound of pasta for $34 with a few scrapes of Parmesan and the fire show hardly impressed me , you want real truffle pasta go to scalinatella in the city ,he poured a small amount of grappa the fire went out almost immediately ,only because I know food I have to say this : they put truffle oil and what appeared to be fresh Summer truffles were Chinese knock off truffles if they were real there would be no need for the truffle oil the truffles they used had no taste. I also had the seafood fra diavolo it didn't come with squid ink pasta when I asked the waiter he said they ran out. I had the pear salad with current vinaigrette and goat cheese that was no big deal either. The lobster bisque was good the waiter was nice enough to let us split that, I will say being a cook it should have chunks of lobster in it knuckles or anything else , it was garnished with a lobster tail and also shrimp, we skipped dessert, in my opinion the cocktails were expensive also . It's not so much the money factor but when you go out and spend money , you like to get what you pay for , in all honesty I left the place still hungry I didn't want to complain or say anything but I don't think I will be returning. I felt like I spent money and left unsatisfied . What's right is right and what's wrong is wrong and you have to call a spade a spade. Seams like a great place but they have to up their game a bit in a few different areas . Also the rumors of this being Rocco's place from Astoria il incontro are bogus.

A fairly nice range of dishes to choose from and a few specials were offered. For our app. we tried the skewered Calamari which was perfectly cooked and tender to the bite. We had the Paparadelle pasta with lamb ragu which was again cooked properly and full of flavor. Additionally we had the whole Branzino which was simply grilled and easily shared by two. A side of wild mushrooms completed the meal. The highlight was the definitely the Calamari and I would order it as a main were it so offered. Service was somewhat erratic as I think the waiter was new on the job. Wine ordered didnt arrive until just before the main courses although asked for earlier. The mushrooms were forgotten until asked for. As we were enjoying the outdoor seating and were not in a rush this was not a major issue but considering the upscale prices and the obvious efforts to make this a higher end restaurant vrs the wonderful Trattoria L'incontro staff should be more consistent in service or better supported Â if still learning the ropes. Â Desert , the apple cake with cinnamon ice cream was tasty but not exceptional. Overall the meal was good but not outstanding and a good part of the experience was being outdoors on a beautiful night. Â Upon leaving the inside room was packed and beyond Â  Â loud making me very glad we chose to eat outside. Â Lastly a small complaint regarding the restrooms.

The outdoor space was beautiful however you won''t be able to see the city view. Our waiter, Mark, was a delight. He was very polite, explained everything and cracked a few jokes. As for the food, I have the Salmon and my husband had the Filet mignon. The both tasted very delicious. It is on the pricey side, but it was for a special occasion, so why not. We would definitely return for another occasion.",0,0,0,Wendy M.,"New York, NY",1,28,34

My family and I returned to Maiella for our fifth visit and are still so impressed by the amazing cuisine, atmosphere and service. That said, there were a few changes that were disappointing but not show stoppers. First, the menu feels quite a bit longer. While having options is good, it's a little overwhelming. Especially when there's also 8-9 specials to consider as well. Second, my absolutely favorite pasta dish was changed. I always order the Fettucine Maiella - a pasta dish with crushed sausage. They changed it to veal. Again, not the biggest thing but the dish tasted completely different. We noticed a few other changes like this that made finding old favorites a challenge. Finally, the dessert menu is totally different.One nice feature - you can almost always get a table. Even on busy times, there's at least a few spots you can grab as a walk-in.

Â Parking is virtually impossible but they do offer reasonably priced valet service ($7) with a modern twist. Â They text you a link to activate when you are ~15 minutes from leaving the restaurant so you do not have to wait for your vehicle. Â My only complaint was that the valet altered my seat settings and my mirrors!The venue itself, is very large, inviting and airy. Â Outdoor seating is available BUT make sure to request it when making a reservation (definitively recommend).The service was impeccable. Â Wait staff were courteous, well spoken and friendly. Â The manager was also very affable and made sure to introduce himself to us after we were seated.So at this point you must be thinking...""so...why the 3 star rating?"" Well....From the Restaurant Week menu (nycgo.com/restaurants/maâ¦) I ordered:-Gamberoni alla Griglia: Grilled White Shrimp Salad, seaweed vine ripe tomato fresh caviar vinaigrette Â Not a traditional salad but consisted of 4 grilled shrimp arranged horizontally atop a small Â  amount of seaweed salad, each end was capped with caviar.This was a decent dish, I would have preferred more seaweed salad though Â lol-Filetto di Branzino al Forno:Oven Roasted Fillet of Mediterranean Sea Bass served with artichoke, taggiasca olives,grape tomato and fingerling potatoes in a white wine sauce Â  Â  Â  I am a HUGE fan of Chilean Seabass and I will admit when it was first presented I was a little disappointed. Â I have only had this fish prepared in a ""filet mignon"" like style in which the fish is fluffy, airy and circular shaped. Â Here it was a thin, narrow shaped filet. Â I did overcome this relatively quickly though. Â I dug right in! Â Ohhhh but apparently the disappointment was not to be over so quickly! Â Unfortunately, the bottom of the filet was very overdone/burnt. Â I hesitated to mention it to the waiter but I was not able to continue to eat it. Â The waiter promptly got the manager who stated that the dish was NOT to prepared that way. Â He was very apologetic, provided my guest and I with a complimentary glass of wine and offered me another entree. I chose to stay with the Chilean sea bass. Â  Â  Â  Â It seems that this was prepared on the other side of the spectrum. Â This time it was slightly underdone and tasted mildly ""fishy"" (seafood lovers will understand). Â The sea bass had the skin on the bottom. Â I did not return the item again nor did I complain.Finally for dessert I ordered:-Torta alla Meringa:Traditional Italian Meringue cake, layered with Chantilly cream, served with vanilla custard cream Â  This was by far the best part of the meal BUT was not perfect. Â I love love love meringue! Â Light, fluffy, sugary deliciousness! Maiella achieved this perfectly!The cake inside was a bit firm but good. Â The custard cream inside seemed to be almost frozen. Â  Â The portion of cake was so large that I was unable to finish it and took it home (too good to waste). Â I finished it the following day and the custard filling was much softer and more of a pleasure to eat.Overall, service was great but for the price the food was only mediocre.",0,0,0,Joey M.,"White Plains, NY",208,433,262

4.0,7/27/2017,"EDIT:2 thumbs up for the food. The service could've been a little better.I had reservations for 8 on 7/26/17. 2 of us arrived within the 15 minute window of our reservation but the rest of the party did not. When I arrived I informed the hostess that the rest of our party was running late and that only 6 of us would be dining that evening. I went to the bar and had a couple drinks. My group showed up 15 minutes later and we were sat within 10-15 minutes after.The food was really good, I ordered the Burata and the Ravioli di Ricotta di BÃºfala. My girlfriend ordered a Margarita pizza and a pasta that was prepared table side. The burata was not a typical burata, it was pre cut with the cream spread on the plate. Also the cream was mixed with tomato sauce. I enjoyed the different take on the burata. The Margarita pizza was also really good, I must've ate half of her pizza. My ravioli was very tasty. My girlfriend as well as 2 others ordered pasta that was prepared table side. This was a pretty cool experience seeing the cook at work. However, the cook could've brushed up on his table side manners, he was rude to his helper and everyone at the table was put off by it. He was also a bit arrogant when he was serving truffles asking if we knew what truffles even were. (I honestly missed the joke but he laughed by himself.)The server did take a while to serve a drink at one point. Â And also forgot a pizza, which she brought out after we finished our dinner. Thankfully she did not charge us for the pizza which was nice of her.All in all the food was great. But the service could've been a little better.I was however contacted by one of the owners, Robert, about my experience. (I felt we could've been sat quicker, the waitress could've been more attentive, and the cook could've been nicer to his helper.) Robert seemed sincere. He did not make excuses for his staff he just wanted to know what the issues were so that he could prevent them next time around. He invited me to come back so that I could have a better experience. I believe him that this could've been a fluke because I only went to Maiella because of boasting reviews from close friends who have been there several times. Also because of a connection with Trattoria L'incontro in Astoria which I have had awesome dinners at. The customer service I received from Robert, more than made up for the mishaps during my meal.I will be visiting Maiella again in the near future and trying other items on the menu.",3,0,0,Jeffrey B.,"Queens, Queens, NY",5,54,12

2.0,7/22/2017,"This is really a one and a half star. I really wanted to like this. The restaurant was situated right in Center Blvd which is prime LIC. Once we walked in, the space was big and open. We were a party of 14. 12 of us were here but they wouldn't seat us right away. We ended up waiting about ten minutes before they seated us. Once seated, they left the a la carte menu which we were surprised about since they were pretty adamant we had to do prix fix $39. So being that they left us the a la carte, I guess that wasn't the case. About ten minutes after we were seated, I believe the manager came up to us saying that he didn't know that we were doing prix fix which caused some confusion. I would have been perfectly happy doing a la carte. He takes another ten minutes to come back to us with the prix fix menu. Here's my gripe. If we were a big party and you wanted us to do $39 prix fix to make things easier on your kitchen FINE! But truthfully why does a big party get forced into doing prix fix to make it easier for YOUR KITCHEN?! We are paying customers and should be given that choice. I've been to enough high end restaurants where the kitchens can handle large parties without a hitch. If your kitchen isn't competent enough to execute on a party of 14 brunch, something needs to be done on YOUR end! That means you prob don't have am adequately staffed kitchen. The menu is $39 prix fix. But it's not like each person gets to choose what they want out of that prix fix menu. The whole 14 person party needs to collectively choose as a group one pizza and two entrees and one side. Makes no sense. Makes it easy on your kitchen but a challenge for a group of 14 people who have differing palates and tastes to agree on one PIZZA AND TWO ENTREES AND A SIDE. I was absolutely not impressed with that. $39 includes one drink and no dessert. I don't balk at prices normally but felt that this meal was definitely not up to par for me because not only did I NOT get to decide what I wanted to eat because we had to choose our food as a group, what pissed me off was that in the end, they served each person the same eggs with chorizo individually. So if that was the case, why didn't each person get to choose their own entree if we were getting our own individual plate served to us?! In other restaurants where you are forced to do prix fix, each person gets to pick from a smaller prix fix menu (usually of easier to cook items) and I get that but this place thought they were slick by streamlining that one more level. Make the entire group choose one pizza and two entrees so our kitchen only has to make three real things plus a side. I saw right through that and did not think that was cool at all! The pizza we had was ok. Our entree of eggs and chorizo was ok. If you mess up eggs and chorizo, then that's pretty sad. Who does that?! Also with regard to drinks, my prosecco with fruit was super sweet. I'd like to know what kind of fruit was used to make the drink sooooo sweet that I ended up taking two sips and switch if to wine. We ended up waiting about half hour for our drinks. When a few of us decided to switch to wine, it took another 20 minutes to get our wine. Service as a whole was quite slow. The food took a long time. The drinks took a long time. And the restaurant wasn't super busy so u don't know why service was so slow. Since we were here for a birthday, our friend had already mentioned it beforehand. The manager ends up coming up to us again and asking in front of the birthday girl if it's a birthday. Not cool. Desserts were not part of prix fix and it should be. We ended up ordering a bunch of desserts. All too sweet in the end what was a $39 brunch became over $80pp. In my humble opinion way more competent places that have better food and service that is cheaper. I don't usually harp on prices because if the food is good, I don't mind. But in this case both food and service was meh. I really wanted to come try dinner before having brunch Would I come back?! Prob not. The only thing they have going for them is a nice space.",1,0,0,Sylvia L.,"Brooklyn, NY",154,477,716

Â But, isn't NYC known for having, like, the best Italian food in the Americas? Â I had the eggplant parmesan and sampled my company's pasta and shellfish. Â It was nothing that I couldn't get out of a box of Marie Callender's. Â The service was fine, but all of the waitstaff looked a little listless with hollow countenances. Â The City may want to investigate this place for possible zombie labor. Â There must be laws against that kind of thing.

2.0,7/14/2017,"It pains me to write this... as you can see from my previous 2 reviews I LOVE THIS PLACE, but my last experience was less than stellar.This is only a review of the bar, the bartender and the drink. We did not end up staying because it was Fathers Day and they were only offering a pre-fixed menu and we didn't want to participate in that. It was a lot of money, and did not seem to be not worth it. Too bad as they were not even busy. Most of us at the bar left upon hearing the news. The bartender did not great meet for 10 minutes, I am so specific as I was shocked so I paid attention. He was talking to a server at the service portion of the bar and never even turned around. The server and I made contact multiple times, yet she never said anything.when he finally came to me and asked could he help me. Really? I ordered my favorite drink, the drink named after the place, the Maiella, it was 75% full, tasted like crap and no garnish. The homemade strawberry fruit roll up is the best part! I was so disappointed. The bartender never said anything. I have heard that the over all experience has gone down as of late, and I didn't believe it, but maybe it has?I will give it another go, but please go back to being amazing!

The positives - the place is beautiful. Terrific decor. The management was very nice. Negatives - Service was terrible. Niko, our waiter, seemed preoccupied and was not attentive at all. He asked if we wanted grated cheese and forgot to bring it until I chased him down to ask for it. We finished dinner and the bus staff promptly cleared our dishes. It took Niko over 20 minutes to come back to us to ask if we wanted dessert. By then we were so aggravated, we took the check and left.

5.0,6/17/2017,"I wanted to take my family someplace special for Father's Day, and I remembered hearing about a nice Italian place with a view of Manhattan in Hunter's Point. Â I found it on Google, and then started reading reviews. Â Most were excellent, but a few were terrible. Â I hesitated, but decided to try it anyway. Â And boy am I glad I did. Â I feel bad for the people who said they had bad experiences, because our experience was so wonderful that it makes their bad experiences even worse. Â The service was amazing. Â They were extremely attentive, with the floor manager coming over at least 3 times, two very attentive waiters, water always being poured, bread brought on time and re-filled (and it was very good, with a delicious sun dried tomato spread). Â They offered to take our picture, made sure our daughter saw the private magic show that was going on nearby, behind some shrubs, joked with our teenage son, and were generally friendly and helpful. Â They let us take our time to enjoy, but they didn't ever hesitate for too long at any point. Â But, as good as the service was, I would never give a restaurant 5 stars unless the food was top notch. Â I had the fettuccini Maiella, and it was exactly what I was hoping for - just the right amount of delicious cheese, and a beautiful color from being drenched in wine, plus truffles to add more flavor and interest. Â The chef came out himself to make the dish tableside. Â I won't go into everything we ordered, but suffice it to say everyone enjoyed their dishes. Â There was one cocktail worth mentioning, that had egg whites in it. Â All I can say is try it! Â The salad we ordered came with dressing (we asked for on the side) and it had this rich olive oil that complemented the fresh greens perfectly. Â The chocolate cake for dessert was mostly a rich chocolate mousse, which we loved. Â And, lastly on the food, the burrata deserves a special mention. Â It came with fresh figs, and the salty and sweet combination was such a treat. The only negative I can think of was that, because it had rained earlier, the outside tables were closed off and it was foggy so we didn't see much of Manhattan until we took a walk in the park on the water later, where the view was breathtaking. Â All in all, this is a special place that deserves all the hype it can get. Â It's not cheap, but, if you can afford it for a special occasion, it is well worth the money!",0,0,1,Karen N.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,1,0
5.0,6/14/2017,"I came to Maiella last Friday night with my boyfriend and had an excellent dinner. We made a reservation ahead of time on open table (I highly suggest you do this). We made the res. for 8:45, but still had to wait about 20 or so mins, which was kind of annoying and disappointing (we were starving). However, this was the one and only negative of the entire night. There seemed to be a few other people waiting on their reservation, so this would be my one tip for improvement. The service throughout the night was exceptional. We had a few people taking care of us (one main server and other people who took our drinks orders, ran food etc), however it was not confusing. One of the managers (Victor) even came over at one point to introduce himself and tell us about the chef. And by exceptional service I mean calling my BF Sir, pulling out our chairs at one point, and escorting me to the ladies room. Very above and beyond. The restaurant itself is beautiful (and huge). We sat at a table in the back by the window that overlooked the patio and the empire state building. I sat on the side facing the restaurant, but they had mirrors placed on the opposite wall so I could see the empire state from the reflection, how smart! Also, its very common in NYC to be super jam packed next to other tables, even in nice restaurants. That was not at all the case here-- there was plenty of room around our 2 person table, that we didn't need to squeeze by anyone, or overhear any conversations. It made for a really nice, relaxing and intimate experience. Â Now onto the food: which any of the above wouldn't matter if the food was bad, but as expected the food was excellent. To drink I had the Vagabondo; a cocktail of tequila, fresh pineapple, ginger, lime, etc. It was delish and super refreshing. For appetizers we had the burrata and the grilled calamari:Burrata: creamy and delicious. The added sun-dried tomato really made it pop grilled calamari: this was delicious! it came on a bed of lettuce and radicchio. The calamari was coated in a delish herb crust, but wasn't as heavy as fried calamari. Â The squid was cooked to perfection-- very tender and not chewy at all. Also, the portion was sizable. For the entree we split the lobster pasta and truffle gnocci (one of the nights specials). the lobster pasta or ""Tagliolino con Aragosta"" was very good. I wish there was more lobster in it of course, but the flavors were great and the pasta was homemade and cooked to perfection. The truffle gnocci was amazing. I'm still dreaming about it. The shaved truffle on top was generous (which came with a $35 price point). I would suggest splitting pastas with whoever you're with, as they were both very bold in flavor in their own right. It was nice to switch between the truffle cream sauce and a tomato based sauce. For dessert: the server comes over to your table with a mock-up plate of all the desserts they offer instead of a menu. So it's hard to say no! (in a temptation way, not a pressure way ;P )We shared the panna cotta. Which as expected at this point, was delicious. There is no doubt I will be back at Maiella--- Since it is pricey, we will probably keep it to special occasions, but we're always looking for reasons to celebrate life so I'm sure well be back sooner than later!",3,0,1,Hannah A.,"ASTORIA, NY",320,142,918

4.0,5/31/2017,"Went here for my birthday dinner and was seated promptly at 6:30 on a Friday. For the table, i ordered a tartufo and margherita pizza to share and both were pretty impeccable. For main courses, the pasta dishes were all handmade so we got a homemade ravioli, fettuccine maiella, gnocchi, and eggplant parmigiana. They tasted amazing! Like no other pasta you've had elsewhere. The fettuccine maiella is served tableside in a cheese wheel which is aesthetically pleasing and definitely better in quality than basta pasta which is found on facebook newsfeeds thanks to insider foods. The view is stunning as well, however our table was seated behind a pillar in the room because we were a part of 6 and the majority of tables were for 2 or 4 people. Womp. Regardless the pier is walking distance and the restaurant is behind the pepsi cola sign so you can take pictures either before or after leaving the restaurant The desserts are presented to the table as fake dessert replicas and your mouth starts watering again from looking at them. The service is attentive but for the later half of the dinner we weren't checked on for over an hour. Which was pretty annoying because nobody had anything to drink for that time period.

5.0,5/28/2017,"My mom was the one to discover and reserve seats at this skyline-facing gem. Sometimes parents are useful - kidding, they usually are! Okay, back to the review...The four of us walked in -well before our reservation time- and waited about 5 minutes for the staff to prepare a table for us. My parents and sister were seated first leaving me stuck facing center boulevard as opposed to the city lights. Sigh. Cute vibes though with a blend of rustic, classic, and hint of tropical. DISCLAIMER: Before I elaborate and spill the 'tails, I do want to say that the service was EXTREMELY slow, but the rest of the experience was evidently good enough to retain a 5 star rating. We were greeted by a nice gentleman who asked us about our water preference and returned after a minute with a bottle of spring water and bucket if ice. Everything on the menu sounded appetizing so the 10 minute gap between water and our waiter arriving was much needed, although I still couldn't decide what I wanted. Then the waiter read through the specials and said ""...truffle gnocchi with fresh black truffle shavings."" WOAH. You had me at truffle, sir! I was sure to order that as my appetizer and the Salmone al Forno for my main course. What my family ordered:Sister: Lobster bisque (daily special) & Fettuccine Maiella[Holy cow, for the sake of all who love food, if you're a pasta fanatic, you need to try the Fettuccine Maiella as it is the best fettuccine I've ever had in my life. It's wine infused pasta, like what?! That exists?!?! It is so delicious but very filling. I had to try it because I almost ordered that.]Mom: Insalata di Spinaci (appetizer) and Branzino alla Griglia (main course - very delicious and meaty for branzini)Dad: Bufala (appetizer) and Seafood platter (main course special, which put all of our dishes to shame. I wish I took a picture)The truffle gnocchi was something else. First of all the plate comes with a strong truffle scent, but they come and shave fresh black truffle all over the dish. I was in awe. Fangirl moment because truffle is a godsend! It was recommended to mix the truffle around to get the full flavor - I did just that and will pass on that recommendation to those taking their time to read this! I just ate this and am getting hungry again... ... ...The salmon I had was nothing to go crazy for - simply cooked, but the bell pepper sauce stole the show on that plate. It didn't compare to the gnocchi at all. I was also still praising the fettuccine dish that my sister ordered too, haha.After a while of waiting we decided to ask for the dessert menu because we saw trays being carried around all day. Also, who DOESN'T ask for the dessert menu? We each decided to get something different and ultimately decided on: Creme brulee - very delicious. Thick and creamy as it should be with the perfect sugar flamed top.Chocolate souflee - too chocolately (I don't think that's a word) for me, but the almond ice cream that comes on the side was out of this freaking world!!!!!Tiramisu - served in a cute cup. It wasn't too shabby. In my opinion, tiramisu is very easy to ruin, but they weren't close to doing so.Italian meringue cake - much like Kendrick Lamar's new album, DAMN. The best dessert there! I felt like I ate a cloud. It looked so heavy, but was very light and so scrumptious! If it's on the menu, do not hesitate to get It!The items aren't terribly pricey, but depending on how much you order, the bill could run high.

5.0,4/28/2017,"I rarely venture into Long Island City, but I think I've found my new favorite restaurant in the area! Immediately upon entering, the atmosphere is very welcoming and the aesthetics are totally on point. Happy hour ends at 6:30pm and it only applies to cocktails FYI...and you have to pay separately from the dining tab. We were a table of 4 and got there around 6:30pm and it wasn't overly packed. We got a table near the Pepsi sign so we were able to kind of watch the sunset (the whole place is large windows everywhere). To start off, we ordered the oysters (3 east and 3 west which were great and there was no hint of that sandy taste whatsoever), calamari (not overly fried like many other places), burrata (the other reviews were right...it's a must try), and carpaccio (probably could have used a little less cheese in order to better enjoy the actual flavors of the dish). For 4, that was a decent amount according to our waiter (who was also great by the way even after all our questions), but I think we can also order the board next time (which you can also substitute one of the cheeses for!). For entrees, we did the famous fettuccine, the fra diavolo (just the right amount of spiciness), lamb chops (not dry at all), and sea bass (special of the day). Everything was great and there were no complaints...except I wish there were even more truffles on my fettuccine because who can ever have enough right? It was also really fun to watch them cook it in front of you table side (gimmick or not) and the chef explained each part of what he was doing and engaged in some conversation. Usually we order one dessert as a family and call it a night, but we each ordered a different one and each was awesome. So between the 4 of us, we got the chocolate mousse, Nutella pizza (only managed to finish 3 slices and had to wrap the rest to go. The hazelnut gelato was a bit too sweet IMO), Italian cheesecake, and the tartufo. All desserts are made in house! So between all that, half bottle of wine, and a few other drinks...we totaled up to about $400+ with tip and tax. It's definitely worth it...slight splurge, but we also ordered so much so we were very content. I think maybe it was one of the owners...he walked around to different tables to talk to people. He didn't stop by ours, but whatever. We got to walk around after to take photos outside while we waited for the valet to pull up (great technology too being able to text them to bring the car over). All in all a very enjoyable night and will definitely come again since it's also nestled in a cool neighborhood too. Slightly far form the subways, but it's definitely a nice walk from the ferry stop on a nice warm day. They even have 2 different private rooms to host events (the big one fits about 60-70 and the small one fits about 30-40 according to the hostess).",1,0,0,Samantha W.,"New York, NY",270,259,145

Finally, I asked how much longer until the table would be ready. The manager replied that the party at the table had paid the check over 30 minutes ago and that they would not ask them to move to the bar to make the table available for the next group (my party of 8) I then asked for the owner. I tried to explain my concern and reason for being upset, but before I could say anything and explain he told me that people are grateful to be at his restaurant and that if I'm not happy ""there's the door.""

The decor was very refreshing, with a beautiful outside patio and view of long island city facing the FDR. We started off brunch, with 3 assorted brick over flat bread pizza's that were out of this world. 2 of the 3 pizza's were a bacon and egg pizza and a margarita pie. The bacon and egg pie was my first and was out of this world. The second item that came out was gnocchi which was also really good. Im half Italian, so i love gnocchi even though it is very fattening lol. The final meal was french toast with sausage and potatoes. The french toast was nothing special, but thats also cause I'm not a french toast guy. The sausage was good with the 4 lil potatoes i got lol, but overall the combination of food was weird for me. It was picked my my friends wife wife, so we had no choice of what we wanted.Overall even though it was a funky food selection, the food was good and the staff was great. The ambiance as well as the environment was fantastic. This place is great for dates and the location is money.

1.0,3/11/2017,"Awful experience tonight. Main room half-empty at 6:00pm, our reservation time. No window seating available as early diners were already there. Our party of two was taken to one of the ""private party"" spaces and when we mentioned to the hostess that our reservation asked for window seating we were informed that window seatings are unconfirmed but she graciously told us that she would ask if we could seat in the main room which did not have window seating available but still a better option than inside a ""private party"" room. She came back and gave us a table in the main room. After we had ordered cocktails, a very rude, ill-mannered man came to our table and told us without preamble or apologies that we ""need to vacate the table"". Supposedly a large party was expected and they needed to put together tables and we were in the way. This individual was extremely vulgar and left us wondering what was he doing working in the hospitality industry. He wanted us to sit in a corner at the end of the room and indicated that the rest of the empty tables around us were for four people and that we could not sit there. We left our cocktails on the table and walked out right away. Evidently parties of two women are not welcome at Maiella. My husband and I have been to Maiella before and had better service and dining experience but tonight my friend and I were showered with a display of rudeness and discourtesy that left us speechless.

For apps we also had meatballs and burrata with prosciutto - each of these were also amazing, but I can't stop thinking about the gnocchi. Desserts: we had creme brulee, tiramisu, and a slice of cake. All outstanding - but creme brulee was my #1. I was stuffed but couldn't help but finish this dessert. As for entree, I had chicken parmesan which was not bad, but not as awesome as other dishes at the table - the pork special was outstanding!

That got me a bit distraught and confused, I felt stigmatized and so I made the reservation on the app. I then proceeded to show the hostess my reservation that I made on OpenTable.

3.0,2/15/2017,"I'm sort of torn apart writing this review as I had such high expectations for this Valentines date night. We reserved about 2-3 months prior because we took a look at the menu and thought everything looked very good and knew the reservations would go fast given the atmosphere and amazing Manhattan views. We had a feeling there would be a fixed menu for Valentines, but we figured it would be totally fine. Once the menu was announced we were a bit disappointed because the dishes we would have gotten were not on the menu and $75 a head seemed a bit steep. We decided to keep the reservation and give it a try because the place seemed very romantic with the ambiance and city views. We arrived at the restaurant a couple minutes early and approached the hostess stand. There were 3 hostesses talking among each other and it took them like 30 seconds to realize we were standing in front of them. It was pretty bizarre, but it seemed like they were stressed so I will stop nit picking. I gave my name and they just said OK and nothing else. So we just stood there awkwardly for a couple minutes waiting for direction. Then, what seemed to be one of the owners came and gave my girlfriend a rose which was a very nice touch. We then waited a bit longer and were shown to our seats. So a huge reason we stuck with Maiella for Valentines Day was the ambiance and city views, as i stated before. Unfortunately, we were sat with absolutely no view of the city. I should have been more specific in the reservation, but they were packed and couldn't move us. Extremely disappointing after reserving 2-3 months in advance. Now I'll get to the food. 3.5/5Starters - Burrata, Eggplant with spinach, mozzarella, and a tomato sauce. We were both very pleased.Entrees - Short rib & Polenta, Spaghetti Fra Diavolo. My Short rib dish was decent. Not much flavor from the polenta, but the short rib was pretty good. My girlfriend thought her dish was OK. She said the lobster was good and the dish was spicier than she thought. Dessert - Chocolate mousse cake & the saint honore cake. My mousse cake was fine. It said that it came with a mixed berry sauce that was no where to be found. The saint honore cake was much better. Our server was overall pretty attentive and we had some other people make sure our water and wine were filled. I understand that for $75 a person you are paying for more than just the food, but for the experience as well. Unfortunately our experience was not worth a 5 star review. Overall a 2.5, but I'll round up to 3.",5,0,0,Shane P.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,2,1

Booked a reservation for the following night for 7PM on OpenTable with no issues. Came here with the boyfriend last night for Restaurant Week. He ended up wanting to try the suckling pig dish called Maialino Da Latte which he said was delicious. I thought the portion didn't look big (and a little fatty for my taste) but he said he was full off of it plus a dessert (Chocolate Mousse). His two items cost $42, which was the price of the Restaurant Week dinner and he said he'd rather have gotten 2 things he really wanted for the same price. I got the Restaurant Week dinner item with Burratina Maiella, Ravioli Ai Carciofi and Gamberetti and Torta Alla Meringa; all of which were delicious and surprisingly, big portions. Our server was Andrew who was excellent. He was very patient and informative, answering all of our questions.All the staff inside were pleasant and there's plenty of room inside. You're not sitting on top of each other. If you have any leftovers, they will pack it for you and give you a ticket stub to pick it up at the front desk when you are exiting. The decor inside the restaurant is very nice and if it was actually warm outside, I would have definitely opted to sit outside. You're literally behind the Pepsi Cola sign. Parking is a b*tch in this area so either do valet or you'll be spending some time looking for street parking.

We sat near the window sort of that had a pretty great Â side view of the Pepsi sign and the twinkling lights of NYC great view. Â As we were seated we may as well have been carried to our table that is how helpful the staff is at Maiella. Â Anyway, we were there to partake in the restaurant week menu to check out the place. Â So we get seated and had ordered our drinks i had the Vagabonda (I think) it was different like booze with bacon. Â As we waited for our drinks the couple next to us had wine well the gentleman decided to pour his better half a glass and lost control of the bottle and his wine hit me all over my left side. Â Lets face it i Â should have been pissed but it was an accident the wine actually went in my hair and on the side of my face my left arm (I really liked that blouse too). Â Anyway I got over it and decided to enjoy my time at Maiella. Â When I think of it, I have to laugh I take an hour to do my hair and make up for a night out and for what.  Moving on the bread and the spread they leave on the table is sinful so good. Â I had the shrimp ravioli it was awesome and my friend had the chicken we were so satisfied with that but wait there was cake, honestly I don't know what it was but it was a huge chunk of white awesome cake melted in my mouth. Â I will be going back for sure I almost made a reservation for the next day. Â Considering how every table is full I did not feel rushed out and they way they run that place it is like a seamless show of sorts my doggie bag take out was the cake which you pick up on your way out at the coat check and the lady who works the front helped me get that.

My car was just as warm as I left it and almost two gallons were used idling. Food can be summed up as salty and buttery. If that's your preference you'll enjoy the food. I personally did not enjoy the branzino, polenta, or pizza. List of positives:Busboy was friendly and attentive. Shrimp ravioli was great. I would not come back at the price point. Dinner for two with wine came out to 150 after tip. Not worth it.",0,0,0,H I.,"Bayside, NY",0,6,0
5.0,2/4/2017,"This is a great place that I visited since it participated in restaurant week. Â The valet parking is expensive at 7 bucks, but may be worth it since parking is a horror show, The dress code Â is casual to a little dressy Â The ambiance is nice, great views of the united nations and the midtown skyline. You are directly behind the Pepsi sign. The service is very polite, attentive and friendly. Anthony who is an owner or manager Â comes around to personally make sure you are happy with your meal. The food is a bit noveau, not red sauce Italian, Â but very tasty and good portions. For dessert they gave a giant piece of this cream like cake that was impressive taste and size wise Â on a price fix. Â Wide selection of wines and beers.

Not worth the price though. Ordered the Filetto di Manzo (filet mignon) medium rare... unfortunately they served it well done. I couldn't enjoy it... The chef was walking around the restaurant so I guess that is maybe the reason why my filet was well done instead of medium rare. The rest of my party was satisfied, but agreed upon the price vs value perceived.-The service: The hostess and the guys at the bar were friendly. As for the server, I would give him a poor review, he showed attitude for the most part, kind of rude guy. The other two people who brought drinks and food to the table were nice.We were over charged with things that we didn't order, but after telling the rude waiter, he removed them from the check. We did not like the way he handled the situation. He got upset and cut me off, even though I was being polite.

On the waterfront, Maiella has stunning views and makes for a great date spot if you grab dinner and take a walk on the waterfront with a lovely city scape to admire while you digest. My husband took me here for my birthday. It wasn't very busy at 7pm- but it was the day after a holiday. As per the photos of the interior, we dressed up and felt bit out of place as diners showed up in jeans and sneakers. We were here for a total of 3 hrs which was a bit long. Service, when you can get it, is great but we definitely felt ignored. We had 2 or 3 waiters who came to serve us and none of them communicated with each other. We actually had one server who noticed we were being ignored and took us on despite us being in a different section. He was very kind and led us to ordering things we would not have normally considered. We started with a charcutterie plate to share which was a nice change of pace from the standard Caesar salad. We followed the starter with a table side pasta dish cooked in red wine and tossed in a wheel of parmesan cheese. The dish was topped with generously shaved truffles - probably my favorite dish. We then decided to split the lamb entrÃ©e which proved to be too much in our full bellies. They brought out a slice of Venetian cake. Out of everything this was my least favorite. I am not really an ice cream person- especially after having a rich meal and this cake was layers of cake and ice cream that just felt too rich.

The service is equally polished, refined and attentive, especially when delivered by Juscard, our waiter, who set the tone and pace of our meal with expert finesse and precision. Â Juscard's pacing, recommendations, explanations and ever accommodating manner lived up to the elegance of the restaurant. Â And speaking of elegance, the restaurant is just that, elegant, lush, lavish, romantic, modern, yet rustic at the same time, all with a billion dollar view of midtown.I was particularly impressed by the innovations of the restaurant as well, at least these two items were new for me: Texting the valet service 15 minutes before the meal was over so your car is ready and waiting for you, and, leftovers being held for you at the desk so you can pick up the bags as you leave. Â Two small things that make a huge difference is a dining experience. Â OK, so all of this doesn't come cheap, but what great restaurant in NYC comes cheap right?For your money you will enjoy a wonderful wine list with delicious and approachable wines and a host of freshly made pastas some prepared table side.

This place holds a good amount of patrons although would recommend reservations. The turn over is pretty quick as while seated we saw one table change customers twice. Onto the meat & potatoes as people say Wine, Apps, Dinner, and Desert. Â  Â  Our waitress was great as was the boss man walking around. An excellent recommendation of Red wine selection Siglo. Nice smooth and not dry leaving a good aftertaste. We order a couple of appetizers:Palpo - Grilled Octopus, Grape Tomatoes, Chick Peas, Black Olives & Red Onion.

My husband hates sundried tomatoes, but here he loved it so much, ordered twice. The Manager was pretty friendly describing the dishes as we were having limitations being vegetarians. The Melazane tasted really delicious. Then ordered Gnocchi with cheese sauce for EntrÃ©e. Oh, the portion was quiet big and delicious as they divided the plate into 2. It was pretty filling that had to cancel the second EntrÃ©e, as to save the room for dessert. Instead of a dessert menu, they showed all the options on a serving tray. Looking at everything, it tickles your taste buds and increases your appetite. We ordered the smores gelato with a twist of chocolate ice-cream instead of vanilla. They decorated in a very nice way with a candle and Happy Anniversary written with a smoked marshmallow cream. So, instead of a traditional cake cutting, we did a nice smores gelato cutting.

We requested to sit by the window with a view of Manhattan skyline and it was fulfilled. Our waitress on the other hand..didn't look too pleased and gave us a weird vibe and a few reluctant smiles here and there. We ordered:1. Prosciutto Pizza - It was huge..ate 4 small square slices and took the rest to go. It's probably equivalent to 2.5 regular triangle slices. This tasted great, better than what I was expecting. It still tasted great the next morning after microwaving it. The dough was still soft and chewy!2. Pollo Parmigiana - can't go wrong with this platter. nothing special, tasted good! 3. Salmone al Forno - strip of salmon with some baked potatoes and roasted peppers. Also good. Â 4. (Off the menu special) Spaghetti with lobster, mussels, and some other seafood I forgot $42 - My father liked this..but there was NO lobster meat at all, just the head and tail. We noticed another table with the same dish and she had half a lobster with meat....Desserts: Instead of a paper menu, they brought a platter of waxed-imitations of the desserts. 1. Napoleon - I was expecting a soft and flaky puff pastry..but instead, it was stiff and resembled cardboard. A bit disappointed. 2. Creampuffs - comes in 3 with your choice of vanilla, chocolate, or pistachio ice cream. The creampuff wasn't as soft as I expected. It was stale..or maybe because it was in a freezer.

4.0,12/11/2016,"I planned a surprise birthday dinner for my husband here because Italian is his favourite cuisine and this place came highly recommended by a friend. Their location in Queens is a pretty decent drive from Yonkers so it was convenient for all the guests who were coming from the Bronx, Westchester and Long Island. Upon making the reservation, I noticed that they offer valet service for only $7 so we arrived with the intention of valeting the car. You pay upfront, so carry cash for the cost, plus tip. As we pulled up, the valet came over to us to give our ticket as well as to take my cell number so that they could text me a link that would allow me to request my car while we're finishing up our meal so that our car would be ready upon leaving. Best idea ever.We were brought to our table which was set up in a nice, quiet separate dining room, away from the larger dining area but with an exceptional view of the skyline. Our server, Antonio, was so very accommodating. He constantly checked in on us to see if we were ok and he offered good suggestions from the menu. First, they served us some warm bread with a tomato spread that was so good we had to ask for more. The items we ordered were executed exquisitely:Calimari: Crispy, not too oily, served w/ a tangy marinaraGrilled Octopus: Tender and charred w/ a lovely smokey flavourMeatballs: A hit at the table but I passed since I don't really consume porkPasta Bolognese: Â A hit for my girlfriend's fiance (he's picky so that says a lot :)Rabbit Pappardelle: Rabbit is a new love for me and this special hit the spotVeal Parm: Our cousin enjoyed it immensely but could not finish the huge portionChicken Parm: Hubby loved it and I'm thankful he enjoyed his birthday meal.Almond Semifreddo: So silky and tasty. I loved it.Creme Brulee: It was OK. Not my favourite dessert but it tasted alright.The items we asked to have boxed to-go were waiting for us at the hostess' podium and we basically picked them up using a claim ticket. I think that is most ingenious and efficient. It's nice to enjoy the remainder of your meal without having huge bags all over the table. While we paid, I used the valet app to request my car and by the time we were walking out the door, our rides were pulling up.

1.0,11/9/2016,"My expectations were heightened coming to this restaurant when it first opened its doors in 2015. First off, it was led by Trattoria L' Incontro's Rocco Sacramone who is a well-acclaimed chef. Secondly, their circular bar with a rustic chic setting is inviting, not to mention its premier location along the thriving waterfront of Long Island City. All three of my foodie friends dined here for the first time and to start we ordered tuna carpaccio, polpo ( octopus), and a burrata for our antipasto. I am a fan of tuna carpaccio and was beyond disappointed when they served me two or three pieces of microscopic slices of tuna buried in mesclun salad. They may as well rename the dish as mesclun salad garnished with tuna carpaccio bits. The octopus was hard, overcooked with not much flavor to it. Thank goodness the burrata was decent. But let's get real, who can mess up a burrata? My main entree was a glazed pan seared duck which was another big disappointment. The meat was hard and bland, couldn't even eat half of it. The salmon that my friend ordered was overcooked and didn't taste fresh and it was obvious that their seafood are frozen. I went back to this resto on another occasion and that visit reinforced the fact that there isn't anything solid in their menu that will keep me coming back for more. Â They have no dish to offer that sets them apart from any top restaurants in New York. They are advertising that they serve classic Italian food with a modern twist when there isn't one classic solid dish in their menu. Their wine by the Â bottle menu I shall say is good but not comprehensive. The wine by the glass menu is mediocre and it needs to be revamped. Having dined at great Italian restaurants in Italy, I realized that I have to be fair. This restaurant gets 5 stars for ambience however the atmosphere detracted the overall quality of their food. I came here for the food therefore my palate gives them a one star rating. Lastly, I have to say that the bartenders need to be trained in which wines the restaurant serves. Most of them couldn't recommend a good wine and not familiar with the wines on the list. Maiella fell somewhat a victim of expectations, a restaurant whose quality of food and service were compromised by its dÃ©cor.",53,22,48,Geraldine G.,"Queens, NY",5,29,199

5.0,10/27/2016,"Here is my two star review for Maiella. Why do I give it only two stars as opposed to the majority 4-5 reviews you ask? Here is why.Pros: Aesthetically pleasing decor.  Â  Â  Â  Â  Proximity to the water of city views.  Â  Â  Â  Â  Over abundance of workers , both Â  Â  Â  Â  Waiters and runners.  Â  Â  Â  Â  Excellent menu and interesting drink Â  Â  Â  Â  Â List. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Large Organic menu. Cons: The over abundance of workers  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â are all tripping over each other.  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â There needs to be better  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Management of floor duties.  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Even though you are asked about  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  the preparation and taste of your  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â food multiple times, Â they are not Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â at all concerned with your Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â response.  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Over priced menu. I ordered the chicken in clay pot along with a side of pasta. Â After I started eating it, I noticed that the chicken was prepared with an abundance of salt. Â When my waiter approached and asked how my food was , I mentioned that even though it is tasty, it really was prepared with too much salt. After a few more bites , I decided I could not eat any more of it. Â Then one of the managers whom I can't recall his name, but wore glasses and almost completely bald , was walking around asking customers how things were going. As he approached my table and asked me , I mentioned about the chicken being prepared with too much salt. The Mgr. Responded by saying he will talk to the chef about it right away. I was hoping to hear back from him and maybe expecting either a comp. or request for another item. I didn't get either one. Â After we paid our bill and were walking out, I intentionally walked in front of him to see if he would say something. He only said, "" have a good night .""I then said to him, "" So what ever happened when you mentioned to the chef about my chicken ?"" Â He looked puzzled and then his exact words were,""Ohhh, yea, he said he Fucked up."" Â Exact words. I them said, "" Oh really , well don't you thing maybe someone should have come to my table and said something ?"" He said "" Oh, yea That's on me."" Â I shook my head in disbelief since this is not a typical restaurant and I expected much better service than that. He then said ,"" Can I get you a drink at the bar?"" I responded with, no I already paid already, and just like that he walked away. Mind you, he walked away as if saying , "" What ever, problem solved on his end."" Â Very disappointed. I would not recommend this place to any of my friends or coworkers.

3.0,10/21/2016,"My husband and I came here tonight for his birthday dinner. I made the reservation through open table and noted that it was his 30th birthday dinner and requested a table with a waterfront view. We arrived 10 minutes early (we live in the neighborhood) and were seated in a nice section close to the water (excellent - they read my comment and acted on it). Now why am I giving three stars? Our waiter wasn't the best. More like subpar. When giving the specials he stopped half way through to talk to one of the staff who was serving one of his other tables (I'm assuming about who ordered what meal but still a little rude). When he returned to our table he couldn't remember where he left off and basically ran through the specials again. While giving the specials, his eye contact was 20 percent to myself and 80 percent to my husband. A minor complaint but something I definitely noted and didn't enjoy. During our meal more attention was paid to the other tables than ours (only one check in immediately after our meal was served). After we finished our meals we waited LITERALLY 25 minutes for the dessert menu. The table next to us was given the dessert sample platter to choose from and my husband and I were excited to see the desserts and decide on one ourselves. Well after waiting 25 minutes and never being checked on or offered the desserts we decided we weren't in the mood for them. We never saw our waiter and instead flagged down the very nice drink waitress and asked for our check. As my card was being processed the Maitre d' came in the room so I flagged him down to let him know we were never offered dessert.

The rhythm was odd, the staff generally friendly but poorly trained and the management happy to overlook their mistakes. We had an early reservation and were seated promptly. After explaining the specials, he rushed to take our order. The food came promptly (a tip off that it was dished out rather than prepared). Shortly after the first course arrived, they were trying to clear it away. They came three times in three in three minutes to ask if I was finished. When my lovely companion confessed to the waiter that she was feeling a bit rushed, he seemed concerned. But after a long wait for the main course, Â we hardly had taken a bite before we were being asked if it could be cleared away. I mentioned to the waiter that we were still feeling rushed and he expressed concern, but did nothing. At that point the ambience had been ruined, so we passed on desert.

5.0,10/14/2016,"Honestly.. I do not even know where to start. From start to finish, Maiella was an amazing experience. The restaurant is spacious which allows ample amount of room between the tables allowing the guests private conversations to remain private. Maiella is eloquently decorated and the ambiance is delightful. If spectacular city views and top notch service are what you're looking for, then this is certainly a place that you should highly consider for an enjoyable dining experience.Everything on the menu was mouth watering. Here are some of the menu delicacies that we tried. We started with the Gnocchi al Tartufo Estivo, which is Maiella's home made ricotta gnochi with truffles. These are not your traditional potato gnocchi that are heavy on your stomach, but ricotta gnocchi which were lighter. Absolutely delicious. For our main courses, we ordered 3 entrees and we all shared the deliciousness family style. We had the Galleto in Crosta di Porcini, which is the oven roasted, porcini encrusted organic cornish hen. We had the Corta di Manzo and the Carre' D'Agnello, which is the braised short rib and the pistacchio encrusted Colorado rack of lamb respectively. The presentation on all 3 dishes was picturesque. The taste was beyond words, and immensely satisfying to our taste buds. Like they always say, there is always room for dessert. To accompany our cappuccinos, espressos and digestifs, we had the house special Venetian Merengue. If you want to end your meal in the proper fashion, this is how you do it.Truthfully, I have not had a meal at a restaurant like I did at Maiella's in a very long time. We will definitely be regulars at this gem of a restaurant, and is now on our short list of goto places. There is something on the menu for everyone.

5.0,10/13/2016,"So after more than a year of not coming back to Maiella, my wife agreed to give them another go. All I can say are good things this time. I went here on a Thursday after work for a 6:30PM reservation. We were seated right away, and since I had my wife and baby in a stroller with me, we were sat in a more open area in the middle of the dining room. The manager, Brian (if I remember correctly) even assisted in taking the stroller down couple steps towards the dining room. What a gentleman!As soon as we were seated, we were offered drinks. My wife had a glass of wine while I just had water since I was driving back home. For appetizers, I ordered scallops which were pan seared while my wife had a yummy salad with caramelized pear. Both dishes were amazing! I had a seafood pasta for my entree which had a kick to it. It had everything on it like lobster, clams, mussels, shrimp and squid. It was a huge portion of goodness. Had I known beforehand I would have shared the meal with my wife. But it's all good because she got duck entree which was really well cooked and came with an awesome sauce on the plate. Beautifully plated as well. At that point I was full, but my wife had to ask for a desert menu which up to now I don't understand, but am thankful for. They don't have a ""desert menu"", they have a desert tray with actual display of what they offer. As I was full, I told my wife I was gonna pass. She opted to get the hazelnut pumpkin tart which both of us usually don't get ever... BUT SHE LOVED IT! Oh yeah, she also ordered a chocolate salami desert for me. Haha! Even though I was done eating. It came with strawberry syrup to compliment.Overall, I'm glad that gave Maiella another shot and that the staff and owner, Tommy, really turned everything around for us.

5.0,10/12/2016,"I went to Maiella with the wife last Saturday evening for her birthday. Even though Maiella is a bit difficult to get to from our apartment in Brooklyn and it was pouring that night, Maiella was well worth the trip. We ended up arriving 30 minutes after our reservation because we weren't able to get a car in time, but the restaurant was accommodating when we called.Long story short, both the service and the food were OUTSTANDING. We ordered two items off of the specials menu - (1) a pumpkin puree with mascarpone cheese and truffle slices and (2) the lasagna - both were spectacular and it was obvious that a lot of thought went into each dish. The pumpkin puree had lots of flavor and had the perfect sweet and savory balance. Every bite of the soup tasted different depending on the ratio between the soup and the mascarpone cheese in your spoon - this is important because it kept the dish refreshing and interesting from the beginning to the end.The lasagna was equally delicious and was prepared (or finished) to order. Each slice of lasagna was individually baked and the melted cheese came bubbling hot. It may be too soft or heavy for some people's taste, but it was perfect for me.The other two dishes we ordered were the calamari and a pasta dish with pesto sauce. While these two dishes were both good (especially the pasta), we preferred the specials.Our server's name was Giscard. Giscard is extremely warm, caring and professional. He was attentive but not overbearing. Upon learning that my wife was feeling a bit under the weather after our meal, he offered both of us hot tea on the house (this was after we had already paid the check). My wife instantly felt better afterwards and we were able to walk around the park behind the restaurant - which had a great view of the Manhattan skyline. I would highly recommend taking guests from out of town to Maiella just for the view.We have recently visited a couple high-profile restaurants in the city but none compared to our great experience at Maiella last weekend. It is our new favorite restaurant and we intend to go back to try some of the other dishes very soon.Also, the pricing was very reasonable for the level of service and the quality of food. Each dish averaged about $20.",2,0,1,Al H.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,22,0

The service was impeccable, drinks excellent, and food absolutely delicious! Our table shared the special pumpkin ravioli as an appetizer. Very different from other pumpkin raviolis I've tried, but the taste was great! For my main course, I had the cornish hen. The hen was not too dry, the brussels sprouts created a balance with the potato gratin. Overall excellent restaurant and I will come again!",1,0,0,Kim D.,"Brooklyn, NY",390,67,28

Burrata wrapped in prosciutto and pizza (bread) great starters, the mussels in red sauce were very good but I've had better at an Italian restaurant. I had the seafood risotto and it was loaded with delicious seafood and perfectly cooked risotto. Desserts looked great but was too full to consider. One thing to note, but not a deal breaker, they switch up waiters throughout the meal which can be confusing as to what's been communicated and the rapport between customers and wait staff, but everyone was pleasant and friendly.",0,0,0,Melanie G.,"Manhattan, NY",47,16,0

Between the location of the restaurant on the water, and the design inside the place it is beautiful. Fortunately, the food is just as good as the ambiance. You have to get the Burrata, it is a must every time I go. Also, the Pear Salad with Black Currant Goat Cheese is out of this world (see pic below). For the main course, my favorite dish is the Corta di Manzo. The short ribs are cooked perfectly and delicious. Not to mention how good the polenta is underneath it. Also, the home made gnocchi is my other go to. Lastly, the service always makes you feel like you are special. Everyone from the host, waiter and busby make you feel at home.

2.0,9/24/2016,We also have been to the restaurant many times and until recently have had a very nice experience. We went Â about 6 weeks ago and the service (while well meaning) was really terrible. Â I finally talked my wife into going again and while not quite as bad was really not at an adequate level. Our waiter did not show up for so long the manager finally took our drink order. Then the waiter came by to apologize and said he would be right back. Again he didn't come and eventually someone else was sent over to tell us the specials. In the meantime we saw another server Walking around with two drinks and trying to figure out which table they went to (eventually he figured out they were ours). Then they brought salad with dressing even though I had asked for no dressing ( due to allergy). For our entrees it was the same problem if the server wandering around the room trying to match them with a table. One other peeve. We are coming from Manhattan and accept that there is a $7 valet charge for parking. But if there is boing to be a $7 charge can there at least be adequate staff so I do not have to wait almost 20 minutes to get my car when leaving?i really feel terrible about giving this review because i think food still very good and staff means well.

2.0,9/4/2016,"A month or two ago, I would have given Maiella a 5 star rating, since it was our favorite place in the neighborhood. Food and service used to be impeccable. Unfortunately, we were very disappointed on our last few visits. Food was just ok, drinks were tasteless, service was average at most. We usually don't make a reservation, since it is easy to take a seat at the bar and we enjoy it. However on one of our last few visits, the bartender who was serving us was somewhat rushed and worried. He made a lot of noise, made us tasteless drinks, and didn't bother sharing the day's specials with us.Considering how the menu has been reduced since Maiella opened, we are looking forward to the specials, since we've tried almost everything on their menu already. Some of our favorites have been gone, which is quite unfortunate.On our last two visits, we requested a table and we were extremely disappointed by the quality and level of service. It was not even comparable to what it used to be. Before, we were informed that, if we are sharing a dish, the chef insists that it is split for us in the kitchen and not on the table. On our last visit (last night), our waiter didn't care that we were sharing. We didn't get share plates and, on top of that, it took quite a while to get our dinner.It was three of us last night, and we ordered an appetizer and three main courses. The main courses were all bland and had no kick whatsoever. Two of our dishes came with potatoes that were rather dry and tasted as if they were cooked the night before and were just reheated for us. The rest was alright, but nothing to write home about.Quite unfortunate for us, Maiella has been attracting a different type of crowd lately - people that Â we mostly see in this neighborhood in the next door bar/lounge/restaurant.I am very sad to write Maiella a such a negative review, especially since I did write a very positive one for them a few months ago for the next Zagat guide. I also do not think that we will be visiting the place soon. After all, there are many restaurants in LIC that offer better quality for the price and they seem to be consistent about their food and sercive.",4,2,2,Gergana K.,"Long Island City, NY",0,37,2
2.0,9/4/2016,"Drinks were eh, we ordered two Moscow mules. They were served in tall glasses. Now I could be wrong, but I have drank quite a few Moscow mules at this point in my life, I feel like they should be served in a copper mug, but whatever. Aside from their serving style, I felt the ginger slapped me in the face and a tad over powering.Food was okay; they started us off with some toasted pita bread with something that resembled a tomato paste. It tasted eh, but I was very hungry, so I think paper would've tasted great at that point. I also noticed that at a certain point they wanted to take away the pita bread. I found that a little weird. As for the appetizers, we had the Melanzane (stuffed eggplant, spinach, mozzarella), Carpaccio di Manzo (Thinly sliced filet mignon, filled with prosciutto, arugula, parmigiano, olive oil, lemon, truffle oil), Bufala (Buffalo mozzarella, tomato, basil, olive oil, balsamic vinegar). I must say all of the appetizers were good. I really enjoyed the mixed various flavors. Especially the way the arugula, olive & truffle oil and thin slices of filet mignon blended well. As for the entrees, we had two Paccheri a la Bolognese (Pacherri pasta, three meat ragout, fresh fava beans, parmigiano). The three-meat ragout tasted amazing, but the pasta was bland. After a bit of mixing the pasta took on the ragout's juicy texture and flavor and it was better. I wasn't a big fan of the restaurant's service. Our waiter's demeanor felt very impatient, rushed and annoyed at all times. He spoke somewhere to the equivalent of an auctioneer. If you're driving do your best to find parking yourself. Even though the restaurant offers valet parking at a rate of $7 per vehicle, my car was returned damaged. Unfortunately, I didn't notice my rear bumper was all scratched up that night, but the next morning when I inspected my car at work I saw there were quite some paint missing. I don't understand how someone can destroy a rear bumper when my car has a pretty vivid rear view camera. It was an interesting experience all around, but I personally will not be returning to Maiella. I'd recommend it to a friend if they want fairly priced Italian cuisine with a view, but I would definitely warn them about looking for parking themselves.",1,0,2,Ruben I.,"Rego Park, NY",2,4,0

Let's start off with our reservation which was made 6 days ahead of time through opentable and I made a phone call 4 days before to inform them that it was my wife's birthday and we would like to be seated with a good view of the NYC skyline if possible. When we arrived for our reservation there was no acknowledgement to my wife's birthday and in a dining room not even half full we were stuck into a corner table as far away from a decent view as possible. We asked to switch tables-why we would be placed there when it was half empty and after making a reservation is beyond me and unacceptable. Our appetizers were great and came out prompt however, when our entrees came out there was no offer of fresh ground black pepper or any fresh grated cheese (which I have never experienced in any restaurant ever) and no one even considered to ask how our meal was. Also all night the floor manager Anthony was circling the floor like a hungry shark and made the whole dining process very uncomfortable. Micromanaging the area and staff won't make the place run well in the long run. During our meal he even proceeded to lecture our waiter on his performance very audibly and in the middle of the dinning room (very unprofessional). Finally when the bill came I was amazed that even with making a call about my wife's birthday they didn't even offer our cup of coffee to be on the house. On the way out everyone from the waiters, bartenders, and the hostesses thanked us and wished us a good night but, Anthony shot us a dirty look and didn't say a word (quite possibly the most unpleasant person there).

Before coming here for the first time I was looking for a great place to take my family and mother out on her birthday. We had to wait over an hour for our entrees and the waitress could've at least done something to make up for it or keep us updated but nothing. The food was a great letdown and certainly did not meet our expectations. My pork tenderloin itself was extremely dry and the sauce was too salty. Two family members were unable to eat their food due to it being undercooked and after waiting so long for the main course, they did not want to order a replacement. The waitress then completely disappeared on us and left for the night leaving us confused and abandoned. We left the restaurant hungry and disappointed. For a place that charges so much for each plate you would expect it to be full of flavor but it was just incredibly small and lacking in flavor. I do not mind paying over $30 for a plate as long as it's memorable but out of 8 plates my family had ordered, I would not order any one of them again. The food was small, tasteless and a disappointment. Italian food at any random NYC pizzeria has more seasoning and flavor. The owner has a great location and potential, but lacking in substance. I would not recommend this place to a friend.",5,2,2,Nestor Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",10,4,0
1.0,8/7/2016,"Went to Maiella last night and was hoping for an exceptional experience. Unfortunately it was just shocking disappointment one after another! Reservations for 9 pm and our food didn't come out until 10:54!!! We had to ask for bread at least four times and it didn't come until we called the waitress over to complain about our undercooked pasta. As soon as we called her over she widely opened her eyes and ran and told another waitress to grab a basket. The bread was burned on the bottom, by the way. I politely told her how disappointing our entire experience was from the extremely undercooked pasta to waiting for 2 hours to the bread. She apologized profusely but then completely disappeared. Never to be seen again. Throughout the night we noticed that ""certain types"" of people were served fuller glasses of wine and received more attention than us as well. This was a party of 8, we ordered cocktails, appetizers and entrees. The customer service is barely existent and the food was extremely mediocre. We left hungry and exhausted.

We asked about the cocktails and he recommended the vagabonda and the maeilla. I had both and I preferred the maeilla. The flavors blended together better for me. The vagabonda had a spicier, smokey taste. The house bread was great along with a tomato spread as dressing. Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed by the food. For an appetizer I had the octopus. It was dry and flavorless. I also had the branzino with asparagus and potatoes. The branzino was under seasoned, Â asparagus and potatoes were cooked perfectly.

The last time we came it was not what we were used to here. The owner personally invited us back and I couldn't be happier we came in. From the second we walked in the door we were treated like family. The hostess, wait staff, and manager all went out of their way to make each guest in house feel welcome. The waiter made excellent wine recommendations for us that set the tone for what turned out to be an incredible meal. We split everything and started with the artichoke and avocado salad which was light, refreshing, and packed with flavor. We next had their signature fettuccine dish. They wheeled out a big pasta station and the chef cooked the pasta for us right there at the table. We've been up and down Italy in search of amazing pasta and this dish was as good as any we've ever had. Topped with fresh truffle too?! Just incredible. Things only got better when our lamb shank arrived. The meat was literally falling off the bone. My fiancÃ© is somewhat of a lamb connoisseur, and she was blown away by how good the lamb was. The polenta and eggplant that came with it were just a perfect complement. For dessert they brought us out a huge spread of amazing looking sweets. We finished up with a piece of insanely good chocolate cake. Not to mention all of this is served in what my opinion is the best ambience in all of LIC.

She left it behind, and once she finished the duck she joked that she was now ready for dessert, and would have the sauce left over as her dessert (not a little sweet, but extremely sweet).Server informed us about 12 specials for the day - specials seemed like an entire other menu, which is something I am not used to, and made it hard to focus and listen in on all of the specials, their ingredients, etc.Overall good experience, and would go back because of wonderful service, but taste of food left me desiring more specially because of the price range here.",1,0,0,Sabrina F.,"Glendale, Queens, NY",306,289,371

My friend recently asked me where to dine in LIC and I remembered that I have been meaning to write this review. I have eaten here twice, and had a fabulous experience on both occasions. The first time I was immediately drawn to the Risotto con Gamberetti & Mirtilli because it is not a typical Italian entree. The plate arrived and people at nearby tables were craning their necks to see what the purple stuff in edible bowl of cheese could be. Shrimp, blueberries and risotto; a strange combo, but surprisingly delicious. It was definitely a hit at my table! The second time I came here was on Valentine's day with my boyfriend. The restaurant was packed and the menu was pre-fixed which usually means hastily prepared foods and rude waiters. Again, I was surprised. Everything we had was incredible, down to the delicious molten chocolate heart-shaped cake that we had for dessert. The staff was friendly and went out of their way to ensure that we had an amazing experience. I ordered wine at the bar earlier and wanted another glass but I couldn't remember the name.

Had a 7:15 reservation and was seated immediately. Staff was very professional and accommodating. Food was all french served and split for us tableside, table was cleaned and reset/plates and silverware were replaced with each course, waitstaff were friendly and knowledgeable etc. What should be expected at a nice restaurant. For apps we ended up going with a Scallop special, the Burrata and The Wild Boar Meatballs. All were delicious. I'm not the biggest fan of prosciutto and mozzarella, but since the Burrata had been raved about we wanted to try it. It didn't disappoint. The Wild Boar Meatballs were very flavorful and the Scallops tasted extremely fresh. Â Also not wanting to miss a highly recommended dish we went with the Blueberry and Shrimp risotto for our next course. I was curious how this one would come because the blueberries seemed like an odd combo, but it blended it very nicely and gave off a rich taste- not overly sweet or tart. The shrimp was very fresh and combined nicely.... the best part of the dish tho may have been the cheese based (?) shell that the dish came in. Totally added to the dish and enhanced the flavors. Probably the best dish of the night.For the last course we had the Veal Porterhouse (MR). Cooked perfectly and came out flavorful and tender altho as is always the case the ""Filet"" side is smaller but better. Super tender and melted in your mouth.Bill for 2 glasses of wine, 3 apps, a pasta/risotto course and a meat course was $150. Very reasonable. Great experience. Would certainly return.

Not that it was bad, but we were greeted and ordered through about four different people. I've seen this complaint before so I was prepared and warned my party. Other than that, this place was terrific.Martini was my drink of choice. They also happened to have stuffed blue cheese olives. Although they served the martini in those new smaller glasses, it was delicious. And the olives, were some of the best I've ever had.I ordered the Carpaccio di Manzo to start which was thinly sliced beef filled with prosciutto, arugula, parmigiano, olive oil, lemon, and truffle oil. It was delicious. Every bite you had a little bit of everything and it all worked together for a great way to start a meal. For my entree I ordered the Pappardelle con Coniglio which is braised rabbit rage with fresh cooked pappardelle pasta. This dish, with a little grated cheese on top, was amazing. The rabbit was cooked so well that it was melting in my mouth. It was an item when looking over the menu where once I saw it, I needed to get it. And I was right. Dessert I ordered the chocolate mousse. Ever since I was a little boy, I have always ordered this when out to dinner. This mouse was rich, creamy, and delicious.

There was a bar by the front entrance and the dining hall once you walk past the bar. 2. The service was so attentive! The waiters came by frequently and they were so pleasant to our family! Thanks guys! They split all our FOR us which was awesome!3. Their steak special (32 oz.) was perfect. Medium rare done to perfection. AGGHH SO GOOD!4. Their Ruchetta con Pera & Gorgonzola salad. The mix of flavors and the slight hint of balsamic vinegar went so well with everything!5. We ordered their seafood special (the scallops) which was pretty good. It wasn't anything special but it was very palatable. 6. Costola Corta. Braised short rib over polenta. My parents looooved this, the polenta more than the braised short rib haha7. THE BREAD THEY SERVE BEFORE THE MEAL? Umm.. we had 3 baskets of them.. Thanks so much Maiella staff for looking out! :)CONS: 1. Risotto alla Mamma Concetta. WAY too salty. They have this little bowl made out of asiago that the risotto comes in was pretty good though.2. Pesce Spada. Our first time ordering swordfish. They didn't think much of it. The tomato salsa on top was where the flavor came from. The fish itself wasn't anything to rave about.Overall, we didn't leave Maiella feeling ""wowed"" as we had expected.

4.0,3/14/2016,"My dinner here was excellent. Â I can see why it is so highly rated. This is a great place for a nice date or to celebrate a special occasion. It's a very big restaurant with a lovely interior and fantastic views of Manhattan. For appetizers we ordered the burrata and scallop special. Both were very good. For my entree I had the spinach gnudi, something I have always wanted to try. It's a small portion, but the perfect amount of food since it is comes in a rich, creamy sauce. The gnudi themselves were light and flavorful. They taste similar to gnocchi, but not as dense since they are made with ricotta. It was so tasty. These were also on special. Â My friend got the rack of lamb. It was cooked perfectly and had lots of flavor. For dessert our waiter recommended the Tiramisu, which was nice. Service was good, although the staff seemed stretched a little thin since it is such a big place and they tend to fill up, especially on a Saturday night. It's a loud atmosphere and not the best for conversation. If you're looking for a quieter, more intimate location, this might not be the best option, but perhaps a week night might be a little quieter. Overall I would recommend this restaurant, but it's pricey so I would suggest it mostly for special occasions and group dinners.",4,1,3,Christina G.,"New York, NY",401,474,103

4.0,3/5/2016,"My husband and I have been wanting to come here forever since it is always booked up solid and getting a weekend resi is nearly impossible, unless you do it a week or more in advance. We came here last night for dinner at 7:15 p.m. and the place was only half full, so I suggest coming here around this time. By 8:15, it was totally packed out. The decor is really nice and it is on the water so that's a plus. The place is gigantic, and very well decorated. The bar area looked gorgeous, and if we return, we will probably sit there next time.Since we got here so early, our food arrived really fast, which was great, and yes, the food was awesome. They have an extensive wine list (we had a delicious bottle of sauvignon blanc), a great cocktail menu, quality cheeses, and good service (there were 3 people waiting on us at any given moment). The food: Their house bread comes with this amazing roasted pepper paste, which I could have eaten all night long. My husband ate it all in about two minutes. The burrata was epic (we could have eaten three orders of it), and my eggplant was outrageously delicious. We also had a margarita pie (thin crust, A +). My husband had the rabbit ragu (ew) and enjoyed it.The only complaints that I have are the following:1- They sat us in a side area, which I wasn't really thrilled about. I kind of wanted to sit in the main dining area and didn't know why we were pushed off to the side without even the option. Its not like the place was packed when we got there.2- Because there are so many people waiting on you, it gets confusing. Frankly, its not really necessary. The waiter kept making comments to the other waiter/busser (?) about what he was doing wrong, and we were asked 3 times whether we wanted wine (twice was after we already ordered) and twice about dessert (after we already told them we were too full).3- The order in which the food came out was disappointing. I figured a burrata appetizer would come out first, or at least the waiter would ask us if that's how we wanted our food to come out, but the pizza came out first, pretty much at the same time as their bread, and that was just kind of weird.All in all, we had a good date night here. Yes, the prices are a tad high ($30 an entre), and the logistics as to food timing might have been off, but we both enjoyed ourselves and will likely come back at a future date.",2,1,1,Mila K.,"ASTORIA, NY",125,87,23

5.0,2/27/2016,"My bf surprised me for my birthday this Tuesday, and I was very pleased with the restaurant he chose. He made a reservation through opentable.com for 9:30pm, we arrived a little before 9:15 thinking it would be busy. To our surprise it wasn't, I guess it was a little too chilly for some people. Not me! The hostess was very courteous, and walked us straight to our table.Then not exaggerating, like 4 other staff members came to our table, one serving water, the other bringing our menus, then another setting our table. I was confused as to who our waiter/waitress was going to be, since they were all taking care of us, so attentive, which I loved!When our waitress came by she pointed out the specials, and recommended a very delicious red wine, as well as the Burrata, which next time we'll order 2, because it was delicious! No sharing next time. We looked over the menu and the selection was good, we were just a little confused with some dishes, we don't usually eat Italian at such a fancy place so we were a bit embarrassed to ask, we didn't want to annoy our waitress with all these questions. So we went with the safer options. I had the salmon, and he had the chicken parmigian. Food came out right away and we enjoyed every last bit of if. For dessert I asked her what she recommended, and for me she recommended the Semifreddo, she said it was her favorite. I trusted her since the wine she recommended was delicious. My bf had the Napoleon.Once again we were WOWED.Maybe because we were one of maybe 4 tables being waited on our service was superb,I don't care, I was just blown away by their service.

5.0,2/21/2016,"Double date, Saturday night. We made reservations a couple days in advance. My husband & I started at the bar while our company arrived. The bartender (tall bald guy) was wonderful! His drink suggestions were spot on. We did not feel rushed to move even when it started getting full. We noticed the oysters and pizza happy hour specials were going around & our mouth was watering!! As we sat, it was not like a normal dining experience in which you feel pressured to hurry up and order. Our waiter came to introduce himself & asked what type of water we preferred. Then he came a few minutes later to read us the specials and gave a few more minutes to decide. We decided on a few appetizers for the table that, when they were served, were equally divided on each of our four plates. I wish I took pictures to show how fabulous its presentation, but the taste was exponentially better! Then the notti (a pasta with vegetable and cheese) was I would say a mini Italian version of a spring roll in a sauce. Delicious goodness which came 8 pieces to an order, they put two pieces on each fresh plate. Then the main course was wonderful, but can we please skip to the dessert? Oh.. well, the tiramisu was one of the best I have ever tasted! And the other dessert was a frozen custard with some kind of sauce with fresh crushed hazelnuts on top. Paired with a phenomenal moscato was HEAVENLY!!!!! The staff is overly attentive which was very refreshing. The layout of the restaurant was lovely, decor was simple yet elegant. The bathrooms were private, clean and well stocked. I really appreciate the authentic Italian style of dining, no rush and in courses. I can not find one bad thing to say, they even had valet ($7), but in that area, well worth it! We found our new favorite date night spot!

4.0,2/19/2016,"Valentine's Day ""Date Nights"" have always been a Surprise Location, and my goodness, I was excited when my husband stopped at Maiella and opened the door for me. [He likes to stop at random restaurants and pretend to head towards to door to fool me].Hello Chef Rocco! (Love Trattoria L'incontro!)AVOID DURING COLD WEATHER*We were seated quickly at a small romantic table for two and just sat down when Maitre D' (I assume) stops by and apologizes for the temperature and announces to several tables that he has pumped the heat up to 90 degrees. This didn't bother us at 1st, but as the night progressed, the heavy gusts of wind on the coldest night of the year kept hitting my back and my hands slowly turned blue. It seemed like the wind was coming in, circling around the bar and hitting the tables. Halfway through dinner, we looked around and everyone had winter jackets on. So much for a romantic date. By the end of dinner, we were both shivering and couldn't get out of there fast enough!FOOD = DELICIOUS*We were disappointed that Maiella only offered a Valentine's Day Pre-Fixe menu, but only until we were served our food. We were very happy with the results. AppetizerFocaccia & Sun Dried Tomato: The Focaccia Â was good cold, but when the 2nd batch came out warm, WOW! It paired so well with the sun dried tomato spread.Porkbelly: This was really delicious and the purees were a wonderful accompaniment.Burrata: Â  Â I'm not a Mozzarella/Prosciutto lover (I know I know) but WOW was this incredible! The fresh mozzarella was stuffed with curd and cream. It was just heavenly. I couldn't get enough, it was difficult to remain ladylike and not fight over this appetizer, haha.MidBaby Kale Salad: Good but nothing crazyBeet Ravioli: Â  Â  Â  Â Another clear Winner! I could have an entire dish of this! Fluffy pillows stuffed with Mascarpone, more please! Â Speaking on which, this portion was huge! It was just about the size of a regular entree (4 large raviolis). I had to stop typing for a while while i reminisced about how great this was... Entree - Rib's Please!Short Rib: Â  Â  Â  Â  Above average short rib, the polenta was Mmmm!Rib Veal Chop: Ooh, this was delicious! Perfectly cooked and the port wine really brought it home. The fig was ok, the fact it was cold threw me off when paired with the veal but overall, great dish. It was one of those, I like my dish better than the other dishes moments- always a good feeling. Dessert!Tiramisu: Â  Â This was typical tiramisu, but good. Soaked in coffee and rum. Semifredo: Semifredo... so... good... we both politely took little bites but lets just say the last bite ""disappeared"" when my husband wasn't looking. He was like ""where did it go?"" because I always offer the last piece to him, well I guess now I can't say ""always"". TAKE AWAY*Maiella is thoughtful in packing take-away, or in our case, a corked bottle of wine, and leaving it by the Hostess Table to grab on your way out. Thoughtful as it was, because we were so cold, we left in a hurry and forgot. We would have much rather had our bottle of wine given to us at the table. Â  Â  Â  Â  The wine that our waiter (who was great btw) recommended was Perfect! Â  Â  Â  Â  I will update this review with the name of it for everyone.We definitely would like to try everything else on the menu, perhaps one day - in the summer - when we can have dinner without our winter jackets, scarves and gloves on.",3,1,1,Alice L.,"Forest Hills, NY",318,811,286

The results were mixed unfortunately and here is the breakdown:1) Wild boar meatballs with porcini mushroom sauce. This was by far the best dish of the night. Â Meatballs were juicy and delicious while the mushroom sauce was tasty and decadent with a touch of truffle oil. 5 stars2) Calamari- nothing special. Marinara was ok. 3 stars. 3) Stinco de Maile. The pork shank was fine but what was clearly disappointing was the gnocchi which was store bought and not fresh. On top of that they were undercooked chewy and gummy. The sauce was tasty but a bit on the salty side. A disappointment for a $30 dish. 2 stars. 4) Ambiance: 4 stars it's a very nice restaurant but the noise level was very high. 5) Service: 5 stars- waiter was excellent and attentive. 6) Positives: meatballs, service, filet minon and veal rAvioli, good selection of wines7) Negatives: Small portions, gnocchi (really no excuse for that), overpriced for what you get.

I had a crabmeat appetizer special and sea bass for a main. The bread they put on the table before hand could have been a meal in itself.

1.0,11/27/2015,"Had a HORRIBLE experience at this restaurant, right from the very beginning :(We had made a reservation earlier that day (Friday 10/26) for a table at 9:30 pm. When we arrived, the hostess curtly told us that the table was not ready. Time went on and ultimately, we were made to wait for OVER HALF AN HOUR without any information from the hostess. I actually went over twice to ask her how long it would take because we could have just gone elsewhere in that time. First, she said the table is still not ready. The second time she GLARED at me and said they are preparing it right now. I don't get why she was talking to customers this way. She (or any of the hostesses for that matter) did not think it important to let us know how long we would be waiting or to even apologize for the delay! At this point, we really wish we had left but were starving and, after finally getting our table, decided to stick it through.We ordered the smoked tuna from the crudo section as an appetizer. This was really good, but the waiter didn't really let us enjoy it. He came with the plate and doled it out as if we were children at a school cafeteria. There were two extra pieces and he was like ""Who wants it?"" I just ushered for him to put it anywhere - I couldn't believe what was happening. Also, I had my bag hung on my chair and the servers kept knocking it over (no apology - they just kept doing it and I had to keep adjusting my bag the whole time). It really seems like the staff was out to get us!Our food didn't take too long to arrive (although it was 11:00 at this point and we had reserved for 9:30). We ordered the mushroom risotto, veal parmigiana, organic panko crusted chicken, mushroom chicken, and a lobster salad. The lobster salad, although beautifully presented, was a tiny portion and I am upset that the waiter did not mention this to us while taking our order (he let us know that there would be spaghetti on the side of the veal but not this?? Ridiculous). Even though the lobster salad was beautifully presented, everything else definitely was NOT. My panko chicken was hidden under arugula leaves and for a moment I thought I had received a salad. The chicken didn't have much flavor and the breading fell apart with the slightest touch. The mushroom chicken and veal parmigiana were alright, nothing special. The risotto, although plentiful and tasty, really looked unappetizing. It really looked like they threw some sort of goop onto a plate. I had thought the food would make up for the horrible experience but it only made it worse.This is my first one star review, so clearly this experience must have been particularly horrific. The 4.5 star yelp rating for this place had really given me high expectations and I was truly looking forward to this dinner. Also, there are some really great pictures of their desserts and I was excited to try them! However, by the end of our meal, we had no appetite left and just wanted to get out of here. Please save your money but more importantly your time and go ELSEWHERE :(",9,5,3,Fatima K.,"Queens, NY",178,80,86
4.0,11/25/2015,"The restaurant is absolutely beautiful. As I walked in, I am thinking what kind of party can I have here? It isn't as modern as blend on the water down the block- but more of a cozy rustic look to it I would say. We were lucky enough to grab a last minute Sunday evening reservation for myself, my toddler and two of my friends. The waiter was friendly and went into detail explaining all of the specials. We went with two appetizers, a carpaccio topped with arugula, balsamic and a parmesan gelato and the butternut squash soup. Unfortunately we weren't fans of either. We were given the specific ingredients of the carpaccio but the flavors just didn't go well together for us. Maybe it was just us? The meat itself was good but everything on top kinda took that away for us. As far as the butternut squash soup, I just might not be a fan of the sweetness added (topped with what I believe was cinnamon) one of our group members loved it so maybe it was just a bad choice for me. We ordered a plain pasta with red sauce for my three year old and she devoured it as expected - humongous portion though which we ended up taking home and given a coat check ticket for so we didn't have to worry about carrying and possibly forgetting the bag of food (love this idea). We had a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc which was reasonably priced and tasty. Our entrees - a spinach and cheese gnocchi type dish, the eggplant Parmesan and for myself a request to make something with an Alfredo sauce. The waiter was kind enough to ask the chef to make something with a creamy sauce for me and he came back to check if I was ok with vegetables being added in. The outcome? A wonderful fettuccini alfredo primavera. No restaurant has to take custom requests, but it didn't even seem to be something they minded at all. Aside from the 10 minute wait for our car at valet (there was only about three tables left in the place) and the off appetizers, I definitely enjoyed my visit and will be telling my family and friends they should give it a shot as well.

3.0,10/5/2015,"My husband and I visited on a Saturday night a couple of weeks ago. We tried to book a table in advance but were advised as it was Saturday night they were booked up, but we could return later as a walk in. As we returned later, I personally felt the host to be quite unwelcoming, I felt like we were looked up & down and assessed. We were advised the only table available would be in the bar area and would be a 30 minute wait. So we took our seat at the bar. We could see there were already 2 available tables in the bar area and they remained empty for the next 30 minutes until we were seated at one of them. Our server was a young lady who was very friendly. We found the prices to be quite high in comparison to other LIC establishments. For example, one risotto on the menu is $30!! As we were seated in Â the bar area we had a view of the street, whereas in the main part of the restaurant you get a view of the NY skyline. I ordered the chicken Milanese and my husband ordered a pasta dish. The food came out in a reasonable time. First impressions were how small my husbands pasta dish was. I got a much larger portion with my Milanese, but in my opinion the food was quite average. It was nice, but nothing special. We decided to order a dessert to share (Nutella pizza), after we confirmed that if we couldn't finish it, that we could box it and take it home. The dessert pizza is priced at $14. After a few slices we asked for it to be boxed & were given a ticket like a coat check ticket. Once we were finished and paid up, we collected our leftover pizza - or so we thought.... Although the ticket matched the one we were given, we were given the wrong food!! But we didn't realize until we had got home, by which point it was too late. We were given a pasta dish instead of our pizza. We were quite miffed, as after spending $14 on a dessert, which we wouldn't normally do, we didn't even get to eat it!!! I did email the restaurant to advise and received a short email in response to say next time we visit the restaurant we will be compensated. The thing is, the prices are so high that we would only be spending more money to possibly get another pizza?! And I'm not sure the food is worth the prices to return, compared to other LIC options, so I'll probably just take the hit.

There's a bar and a center area but also a few rooms set aside for private parties. I loved the eclectic light fixtures and high ceilings. There are also hanging cured meats and other decorations that make you feel like you're in a traditional Italian trattoria. Our staff was attentive and our waiter Douglas handled our large party very well, even when I asked him for his recommendation 3 different times. Most importantly, the food. I was considering ordering the branzino - little cousins only turn 21 once, right? Instead, the waiter recommended this white fish in a sweet pea asparagus puree with a side of sautÃ©ed string beans and potatoes. AMAZING! I don't eat a lot of cooked fish and felt nervous that I'd committed to it for the evening but this is probably the best fish I've ever eaten. Light, a texture only slightly different from poultry, and the sauce was unbelievable. I would have drank it as a soup by itself. The string beans were fresh and gently flavored with garlic. I also had the octopus and arugula salad, fantastic as well. Octopus has a a tendency to be fatty or rubbery when it isn't great quality or isn't cooked properly. This octopus was meaty tasting and had a slightly smoky flavor from being grilled, arugula was a smart choice to pair it with because its bitterness did a great job of balancing the flavor of the meat. My mother got some chicken cutlet salad and I had a little bite - chicken was remarkably flavorful which is hard to do for chicken and very moist. Their chocolate pizza for dessert almost killed me, please share this with 3 or 4 other people if you order it. Not for the faint of heart.",4,0,3,Samantha R.,"New York, NY",36,72,2

2.0,9/26/2015,"I attended a friend's birthday here, and left disappointed. The prices are outrageously high here for what you get in return. I live in Manhattan so perhaps I'm comparing unfairly. I'm unsure of the long lines and crowd on a Saturday evening.We were seated at 5 and stayed until 830 or so, but we're told we 'could stay as long as we want' but later were told that there are a lot of people waiting. Mind you, our cards just had been taken to process. We weren't just sitting there after we paid.Let's discuss the weird bathrooms- individual bathrooms to wait for and why not have stalls in one big space so we can accommodate more? Wine list- too pricey, lowest price for a red was $49. Food. The tomato side and bread were delicious. The family style gave you a piece of mozzarella (where's more?), eggplant, and calamari. You can choose the salad or pasta for the next- I got both as a vegetarian. Pasta was cooked well. Salad was a plain salad with drenched balsamic. Drenched. Main was another pasta, mediocre, and a friend's salmon was terribly cooked. Dessert was our brought in cupcakes but the included choices weren't served.For feel, this place gets a 2. The food, service, and overall experience lacked way too much. Total was $93- overpriced location for sure.",3,0,0,Namrata A.,"New York, NY",289,711,24
5.0,9/25/2015,"I've never reviewed any place before but I had to do it because Maiella is just SO amazing! Everything was perfect, even the smallest details. Service was more than excellent; my boyfriend and I did not have to open one door all night! Our waitress was so attentive and made sure everything was always good. There was not one thing that we ordered that was ""eh"" or mediocre. We started with some appetizers (my favorite part of the dinner I must say) -- the burrata, tuna carpaccio and mussels, all were extremely delicious. Then we split one of the special pastas of the day, also amazing. Lastly we had a steak for 2 that was cooked perfectly and came with a side of broccoli rabe and potatoes and it was all perfection on a plate. Not to mention the dessert was also delicious, a chocolate mouse and panacotta that were out of this world. Wish I had room left to finish it! OH and also, I could eat 50 baskets of their focaccia bread that they give in the beginning. Seriously so good. We will definitely be back very (very) soon.",0,1,1,Olga M.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",0,2,0

2.0,9/21/2015,"We had dinner there on Saturday, 9/19. While this is still a 3 star in my book, Â it is a far cry from L'incontro or even Cavo. The food was standard, nothing special. Of all four entrees; branzino, short rib, pasta special, and risotto we all agreed, just decent. A few issues; we ordered the meat board and teh waiter asked specifically if we wanted mortadella on it and we all wanted it, when it arrived we were told they were out of it. so we got a meat board with only proscuitto and sopressata. i asked what vegetable comes with my branzino and was told broccolini, when it arrived there were string beans, i asked about the broccolini and was told if i wanted it they would get me a side and they did.The decor is perfect, but it certainly cannot offset the food and other issues.the staff was very attentive, but also very inexperienced and it showed.From the moment we were seated, approx. 7:30, Â we felt like they were kind of rushing us so they could turn the table over as quick as possible. we ordered cocktails and when they arrived the waiter wanted to take our order, we were ready but since we were sipping the drinks, we didn't want food coming just yet. after a few minutes, he came back and asked for the order again, we then told him we would give him the appertizer order only and he said that the chef will not accept just that and he wanted it all, we again sent him away without our order. we placed the order about 10 minutes later.you can call it ""destination"" and ""luxe"" all you want, for us at least that does not go in to the decision to return, as we will not be doing so, simply because there are so so many other options that are better. maybe my issues are minor, but they do not add up for me to return.",1,1,1,Pat I.,"Middle Village, NY",34,7,0

5.0,9/20/2015,"We had a great dinner here with friends last night--we used the valet service ($7), which was very convenient (not a lot of parking in the immediate area). Our table wasn't ready so we started off with drinks at the bar, which were all very good (wine, specialty cocktails and dirty martini). The ambience is very nice--open and pretty. My only feedback is that it is a much better experience for the customer if you're able to carry the tab from the bar over to the table for dinner--the hostess came to tell us our table was ready and it took a few minutes to get the bartender's attention (they were busy) and then close out--the hostess was getting impatient. It's just a more seamless experience if you carry the tab over and then everything is worked out behind the scenes. The food was delicious--we started with two appetizers--Quattro Stagioni pizza (light, crisp and tasty) and a special with proscuitto with greens (although I think they subbed some type of soppressata). I liked how the servers split up the appetizers when they saw we were sharing--the service was consistently good throughout the evening. Some tables had visits from the manager, chef, sommelier, etc, but the staff helping us were terrific. Our main courses were great--we all had something different (Pollo Quattro Funghi, Stinco de Maile (over gnocci, which made it filling), a fish dish, and ravioli). I really enjoyed the ravioli, which were stuffed with veal and filet mignon. The wine prices were what you'd expect from this type of place and the bottle was good. We finished with tiramisu and a lemon Italian cheesecake--all were light and amazing. The dinner was paced nicely--not too slow, not too fast. As far as cost, it was about $75/person, which seemed fair considering we had drinks, appetizers, entrees, dessert, etc. One minor setback: At least one of the bathrooms ran out of toilet paper while I was waiting on line. But overall everything was very good and it was a nice experience.",1,1,1,Nicole S.,"Pleasantville, NY",1,16,0

5.0,9/14/2015,"Atypical, creative, fresh and light Italian food. Â Although they have a small section of ""traditional"" Italian items such as Parmigiana, this food goes way beyond the typical sauce joint dishes.This is the perfect spot for a first date or a party if you're looking to impress. It's clean, new and very luxe feeling. Like Manhattan, only better! Â And the food is delicious.Start with the Burrata- it's creamy, salty, tangy, gooey, meaty- literally everything you ever want in a dish. Â We split it 5 ways but I would recommend splitting it 2 or 3 ways. It was the highlight of the meal for me. I could probably eat and entire one myself.The focaccia bread basket they serve is also delicious- even if you're on a diet, just eat a piece! It's worth it dipped in the high quality olive oil on the table. Â We also ordered the baked clams appetizer which were delicious (6 in an order) and the sardines with white beans appetizer (4 sardines). Â The sardines were good and not overly fishy or salty. However they do have small bones in them so it takes some maneuvering. You can apparently eat the bones since they are so tiny but I'm not a big fan of ingesting bones.I had the Pollo Organico which is panko crusted chicken (like a chicken cutlet) topped with a lemon sauce, an arugula salad and little melon balls. I loved it. The bitter arugula, the tart lemon, the sweet melon, all blended nicely on top of the chicken. I also tried the Pollo Quatro Funghi (four mushroom chicken) and it was superb. Light and savory. It wasn't overly filling which was a good thing. You don't feel gross after eating it!Many Italian restaurants serve you massive plates of pasta and chicken heaped with sauce and melted cheese but less is truly more at Maiella. Every dish is well-balanced and the portions are what they should be. The service is worth noting as well. We had a cadre of servers wait on us- someone who read the specials, took our order, fixed our napkins, cleared our table, brought us bread, poured our water, etc. It was kind of fun and made you feel special. The service is spot on and efficient and everyone was pretty friendly too! They all talked to us about our food, offered suggestions, laughed at our jokes, etc. It was a genuinely pleasant experience due to the high level of service we received. They even brought a scoop of gelato for my moms birthday with a candle (we had only casually mentioned her birthday, we didn't specifically request a dessert but they were so super kind to bring it anyway! It was delicious by the way!)I literally cannot wait to go back!! I wish I made more money because I would eat here weekly if I could.

Hadn't expected they would actually help us split them and that they would time it so that Each course would come out one after the other. It helped provide a great dining experience.

I had the veal parmigiana and it was tender, delicious & served with wonderful marinara sauce on perfectly cooked pasta. We couldn't make up our minds about desert so ordered 5 to share between us. The tiramisu and egg white ice cream were the standouts - even though the lemon cheesecake is hard to beat.The service was first class, attentive and friendly - and knowledgeable about wine recommendations as well as helping first timers navigate the tempting menu.We were also enchanted by the location on the East River and enjoyed a lovely walk with a sunset view of Manhattan after dinner.",4,1,2,Sylvia D.,"Hilo, HI",168,40,11

5.0,9/10/2015,"Open Table wouldn't book my reservation on line and asked that I call the restaurant so I did. When you call a recording presents options.

I called back five times right after that but each time instead of the hostess I got a recording saying to call back when they were open (it was 7 pm). It didn't seem like eating at Maiella was meant to be, but I give it 5 stars based on the wonderful things I have read about it on Yelp. But, Maiella made me feel expendable and I can't forgive them for that. Hopefully, management reads their reviews and realizes that little things matter.

4.0,8/30/2015,"Rocco executive chef and proprietor of L'Incontro hit another homerun with this Long Island City newbie. Plenty of familiar faces both run and dine at Maiella most notably Tommy and Danielle (formerly of Sapori D'Ischia, Uncle Jacks and L'Incontro). This is a destination spot and people pack in on a Saturday, which happened to be when I last visited. The food was great but the restaurant was bustling with activity--too much for my taste. Nevertheless the food was great and the staff--while overwhelmed--made time to be pleasant. Not an easy task to do when every table was demanding immediate attention. I'd suggest you swing by early in the week to really enjoy the culinary alchemy.Ordinarily I don't gravitate towards veal because of my pseudo-ethical treatment of animals leanings. Yet on my last two visits it was all about the veal and a great bottle of Pasqua Amarone. Too big of a wine for veal but it is so delicious that I didn't mind violating oenophile conventions. The first time around I had the veal porterhouse in a masala and mushroom sauce. Last night I had the veal limonata. Trying to judge which one was better is tantamount in difficulty to choosing between who is hotter Adriana Lima and MIla Kunis? But if I must pick one dish under duress I would gravitate towards the veal porterhouse. Both times I started with the beef carpaccio arugula salad with aged parmigiana cheese and truffle aioli dressing. On my second visit my wandering fork found its way to my fellow diner's impeccable risotto tempting me to immediately cease my low-carb intake and seize her plate. In order to shed some poundage I skipped dessert but my eyes were nevertheless fixated on the mouth watering tartufos and panna cotta zipping by me on trays en route to other tables. C'est la vie...There's a reason I swung by twice last week and that's because I didn't have time to stop by more often. Need I say more?",11,7,5,George M.,"Manhattan, NY",4994,531,706

4.0,8/22/2015,"So, first and foremost, this place is solid. Don't second guess coming here, because it's well worth it. My 1-star deduction came from a service hiccup in a 'disappearing' leftover/take home rack of lamb, which made me sad...because the food was that good. Otherwise, the service was great, and Chef Rocco even indulged our inquiries into the origin of ""Maiella"" and how one of our party was from the Maiella mountain region in Italy, which was quite intriguing. While the place looks fancy, the staff...and even the chef, are quite humble and down-to-eatFor appetizers, we ordered the famed burrata, the polpo al brace (grilled octopus), and the tonno bianco (tuna and froie gras pate). The burrata lived up to the hype - not doubt there. The stuffing with sun-dried tomatoes and pine nuts was fantastic. The grilled octopus was cooked wonderfully and delicious. The tuna, however, was a bit disappointing - small serving, served in tasting spoons...and I think the tuna and froie get lost in the greens. But...again, the burrata and octopus were delicious. Oh, and the bread basket (I think the bread is from the pizza dough) with the sun-dried tomato paste/sauce is flat out awesomely yum. Keep that coming. For mains, we got the Cernia All' Orsognese (sea bass), Costata di Agnello (the rack of lamb), Filetto di Manzo (filet mignon), and the Margherita pizza. Fantastic yums all around. I ordered the filet...and needless to say, there was nothing left to take home. I tried each of the other ordered entrees, and would have been completely satisfied had I ordered those instead. I was, however, disappointed, when the wait-staff lost the left-over rack of lamb. However, at the end of the meal, the General Manager Daniel gave us a credit for a free rack of lamb the next time we come back (and we definitely will). For dessert, we ordered the Neapolitan and the nutella pizza. The nutella pizza was friggin yum. Get it. The Neapolitan was also great, and a nice contrast, more restrained/less sweet alternative, to the somewhat decadent nutella pizza. I also had an Irish coffee, which was a nice compliment to the meal.All in all, this is a great addition to the neighborhood, and assuming some of the few remaining service kinks are worked out (re disappearing lamb), looking forward to many future visits.

5.0,8/16/2015,So my boyfriend and I finally made it here we had heard so many good things well it was all that and more â¼ The place is beautiful Â sexy and Â  Amazing staff we were greeted at the door and Anthony immediately walked us to our table We started with the Maiella Â famous cocktail very good We then ordered the Â stuffed eggplant and delicious meatballs Omg Â  They were both amazing The pear salad was another great choice Everything was served as a separate course with time to digest  There was no rushing us out here It was great service that impressed us But I wouldn't expect anything less from Rocco  We then had the lobster Â mint pasta one of my favorites and believe me I never eat pasta out and never enjoy it This is something I want to go back and eat again and again  Then followed by the rack of lamb Delicious Tender and tasty Ever course was split for us in the kitchen without even asking This place is definitely one of the finest places and amazing tasting food and friendly staff  Just made another reservation in 2 weeks to bring my friends they will love it here â¼Just another excuse to eat the pasta Â lolThis time I will have to save room for dessert never made it to that course last nite Great place Rocco,1,1,1,Maria G.,"Manhasset, NY",0,24,6
1.0,8/16/2015,"I'll start by saying I already had a biased opinion of this place. I live in the building that it is in and on my way home, patrons of the restaurant are always standing in the middle of the sidewalk smoking or carrying on loudly. They're also always dressed like they're going to their junior prom...not a restaurant. On top of that, their valet attendants always have to leer at every girl that walks by. It's annoying. Anyways, I finally was talked into trying the food last night. The manager himself was extremely accommodating, as was our waiter, and the table bread was delicious. The bar staff was impatient and seemed annoyed when we asked her what bourbon she had. It was so loud we had to ask her to repeat herself and she rolled her eyes. I can't actually fault her--it is really loud and it was busy. Still. We were seated at around 9:00 and we ordered at 9:30. We literally didn't get our entrees until 11. I can appreciate that it was fresh and again, it was a busy night--however, that's still a little ridiculous. I ordered the fettuccine cadoro. The pasta was great but my portion was a lot smaller than what others had gotten. It was a little too watery and maybe had three pieces of arugula. While the restaurant can't control what their patrons do, they can ask their staff to be respectful (the valet attendants specifically) and up their service overall. The prices were average. I probably won't go again.",2,2,3,Lauren H.,"Queens, NY",1,42,1
5.0,8/14/2015,"This was my first time at Maiella and it was absolutely SUPER ! We had drinks and an appetizer at the bar and everything was first class.The service was excellent from start to finish. Everyone in my party of 4 raved about the food.The plates were empty. I had the veal parmigiana and I must say,I thought I had the best veal parmigiana at Chef Vola's in Atlantic City about a year ago but tonight I think I met its match.

2.0,8/13/2015,"In a nutshell, more queens and less manhattan . The hostesses are rude , the waiters are very nice but clearly nervous by the hovering suits. The food was good enough Italian but there are a million good enough places to eat in NYC and some amazing places . I guess this one doesn't have to compete like a manhattan establishment would. Â The restaurant caters to a certain crowd which definitely effects the ambiance. I can say they are trying to be classy , but sometimes when you try too hard to be something you're not , it's obvious. Unfortunately, not the kind of restaurant we would have hoped for in this neighborhood.",1,0,1,Royster S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0
5.0,8/11/2015,"We had our wedding lunch at Maiella on Sun, Aug 9th. Our gathering was originally 50 people but ended up going to over 70. It was an amazing afternoon to say the least. The restaurant is at a great location, beautifully decorated and the availability of different areas worked perfectly for us. The Owner was very flexible with allowing us to use the outdoor space for our wedding ceremony and moving the appetizers/drinks and lunch to the bar and dining areas of the restaurant. The food was delicious. The General Manager, Daniel, gave us outstanding service. He was constantly on the move, making sure our wedding day went well. Â We were worry free and able to enjoy our special day. There were plenty of very helpful and friendly servers to take care of Â every one of our guests. Many of our party guests made it a point to inform us that they thought Maiella was an excellent choice. We could not have asked for much more.

2.0,8/11/2015,"We thought we were going to get a decent experience, but it continued downhill after about 20 mins. Customer service is not their strong suit. Â Go elsewhere Waiter chastising the hostess in front of us b/c she brought us out too quickly, it wasn't a big deal, but made us uncomfortable. Â Bads: - No napkins, and we asked for them, finally had to get up and get some ourselves from the service cart. - Manager not nice - Wine we ordered was not available, no biggie, they brought a comparable in taste and priced bottle. Â BUT the manager came over to apologize and told us that since they didn't have the wine we ordered, he'd be giving us a good price on the replacement..........he didn't. I mentioned to him that he shouldn't make promises and then not follow through on them, it's not professional, at which point he snapped back at me that ""it was the same price, so what's the problem!"" Â Over the top on his part in his response and was upsetting in the way he spoke to me. - The special we ordered was actually not in fact a special for that evening but was a special only during the week. Â they provided something similar but not what we actually wanted. Â - Asked 2x for the bread to be refilled, it never happened- The waiter didn't charge us for our wine, which we brought to his attention vs. being jerks and letting him take the fall. Â He offered to bring us a glass of wine each for being so honest.....great treat....... he brought one glass of wine for us to split and then poured half of that glass into each of our glasses already on the table which contained different wine. The steaks we ended up having were cooked well, the mashed potatoes were delicious, I believe had a hint of truffle oil. Â Overall they have A LOT of service and customer kindness to work out. Bathrooms could use some attention also. Â A bit dirty for 6pm.",2,1,2,Candice B.,"Milford, CT",27,56,1
5.0,8/8/2015,"This is a truly great restaurant to visit for any occasion. From the moment you walk into the place you are welcomed by amazing staff who cater to your every need. The restaurant has a mix of traditional Italian feel with modern decorations. As a native New Yorker, having visited tons of similar places throughout the city, I couldn't believe how well the staff treated each guest. Even on my way to visit the restroom every staff member I passed by greeted me by stoping and smiling. The waiter was extremely polite and accommodating, and never made us feel rushed although the place got pretty busy on a summer Saturday evening. The food was absolutely delicious. Every single item we tried was beautifully presented & yummy. I highly recommend the nutella pizza for the desert - its on my top list of deserts I loved (and I have a sweet tooth). The prices are not bad considering the location, service, decor and most importantly food. The ingredients used in its preparation are often organic if possible and of high quality. I will definitely continue to refer my friends to this place and will go back as soon as I can. To the owner - please continue to do what you're doing because its amazing.",2,1,1,Ewelina O.,"Ridgewood, NY",2,9,3

3.0,8/7/2015,"Came here with my girlfriend to celebrate our anniversary - we mostly enjoyed ourselves but won't come back. pros:* Excellent decor - modern and upscale without being too flashy.* Big outdoor space that didn't feel remotely cramped, even on a very pleasant night.* Our cocktails were both great. One of the better negronis I've had.cons: * The food was relatively meh. I got the pizza, which was forgettable: the ingredients didn't taste fresh, and the crust seemed undercooked. My girlfriend got the merluzzo al pistacchio - she said it was good, but nothing special. We both agreed the food at nearby Il Falco is much better. * The waitress - when I asked about vegan options she immediately told me I probably couldn't eat anything. This surprised me because any Italian place that serves pizza should be able to serve Pizza Marinara. She told me the crust is made out of focaccia, and when I replied that focaccia is traditionally dairy free (unless topped) she somewhat rudely ""corrected"" me that it is *always* made out of cheese. I asked her to check with the chef/manager, and she came back telling me I could get the pizza. She was both ignorant about the menu and disrespectful about it in the process. Right after this, when I asked about the bread at the table, she replied very huffly ""umm yeah, it's bread"". I was just trying to double check that they didn't put cheese on it, like she previously told me they did :o She also suggested I get one of the seafood-based salads, and when I reminded her that I can't eat seafood she said something like ""ohh you're one of those vegans"". Are there other types? I honestly don't try to be an annoying vegan when I go out, but I felt like the waitress made things needlessly difficult for me. Good Italian places are usually (somewhat surprisingly) vegan friendly because they are heavy on fresh vegetables and olive oil instead of butter. In my experience a solid Italian place with experienced waitstaff will know this, even if they don't advertise it.",2,1,1,Bob S.,"New York, NY",8,18,0
5.0,8/6/2015,"From walking into the restaurant and seeing that gorgeous bar you know they are not serving ordinary cocktails. I ordered the vagabondo and it did not disappoint! perfectly balanced flavors and beautifully designed, clearly created by a talented mixologist, (introduced himself as Patty, very sweet). After, we were seated along the windows, facing the Manhattan skyline and the famed Pepsi Cola sign! They also have a great outdoor dining area that is surrounded by the park's greenery.The managers, servers, and server assistants were so attentive. They had all the knowledge of the dishes and made excellent suggestions that we certainly enjoyed. The burrata appetizer with prosciutto was out of this world and the pasta with lobster was so perfectly cooked. Great portion sizes as well. The branzino was simple and delicious. The manager Anthony brought over a special olive oil infused with lemon and fresh parsley that enhanced the already succulent fish. We finished the meal with the house made hazelnut gelato. Woah! As a pastry chef myself I could not have asked for a better end to my meal. Pieces of hazelnuts were mixed through adding a great texture to the creamy gelato. Not only does Forbes, Zagat, Tripadvisor, and Michelin need to get here but you do as well! Can not wait to bring back friends and family. Also a beautiful walk along the East River after dinner just adds to the experience, because it is not only a restaurant and bar but a place where you are having a dining experience that us New Yorkers crave and love!!!",4,0,0,Michelle A.,"Toms River, NJ",64,1,0

5.0,8/2/2015,"Ok knowing the owner very well I really want his place to do well. I didn't want to tell him I was going to go so he didn't do anything extra for a friend. Well lets start the place looks great! The services was on point. Now for the food. Had some appetizers, the boars meatballs and tomatoes with mozzarella. Very on point.Then had the shank with gnocchi- well lets talk about out the meat fell off the bone and the sauce was great.I had the veal which so light and very tasteful. Now being in the food business a great thing you should hear from the waiter or waitress is ""sorry we are out of.........."" This means two things that one it is a popular item on the menu and people love it. Also it means that the place likes to keep the quality of an item at its best. So they don't freeze stuff or just make things to have. They make a little bit of things and make it well. So we'll worth it. Please inform Tommy the next time I come he owes me a Napoleon cake.

Â All were Â first class. Â The favorites of the main courses were the pork shank, the bronzini, the egg plant parm and and the risotto. Â Although my Sea bass was delicious, next time I will order it with the sauce to the side....To me, It was a bit overpowering for such a delicate fish. My husband, however, Â loved it.

4.0,7/28/2015,"Quick reviews of what I ate and really enjoyed. All in all, a VERY solid meal with great service and great views. Stuffed eggplant almost tasted like a stuffed ravioli! The rest of the table was less enthusiastic but I loved it. Tuna with foie gras was delicious, even though they came in four small spoon sized bites. It seemed quite expensive given the four small bites. Beef carpaccio was surprisingly delicious, fresh, and bright! I'm not a huge fan of raw beef dishes, but this was outstanding. I only wish there was more beef, it was 90% arugula. The tomato, strawberry, basil gelato salad was incredibly refreshing.The mushroom risotto was by far the best dish. We were very confused by the presentation in a taco shell bowl, but the portion was huge and the creamy, truffle-y, mushroomy flavor was perfect. The lobster pasta had a great sauce. I would order this again. The duck and pasta special of the day Â (fettuccini with parmesan and fresh truffles) were solid choices, but not particularly outstanding. I wouldn't order these again. Dessert was by far the weakest course. The cheesecake wasn't particularly flavorful or smooth, and the semifreddo tasted more like dense frozen cream than the creamy and frothy ice cream-like texture I was expecting. Both desserts were good, but I'd probably head elsewhere for dessert.",4,2,2,Stef S.,"San Francisco, CA",132,779,6
3.0,7/26/2015,"I came here for dinner with a group of 7 on a Sat evening. The decor of the restaurant is fairly cool. It's got a modern trendy feel. But I feel like it miss matched a little with the type of service/feel. The waiters seemed to be acting more upscale (they were very good at filling water glasses and covered the stains on our table) but with the environment it seemed a little over the top in my opinion.They have good bread to start with though I wish they would have just given our table more than one basket instead of us asking for the refills. The food itself was just ok in my opinion. I tried the veal ravioli which was very good but $22 for only 6 pieces felt a little pricey though they did have a decent amount of meat. But you wouldn't really be full from it. Also tried the chicken parm which was fine but not outstanding. Finally the nduja pizza. I accept blame for misinterpreting the menu, but I was very confused because the menu mentions sausage but when you get the pizza you see no sausage. Apparently the sausage is pureed but as a result it kind of just tasted like a weird sauce Pizza to me. The manager came out and explained the dish and offered for me to order something else but I decided to try it anyway. Based on that I can't really recommend their pizza though the crust was good (made of the same bread that we received when we first sat down).Overall it was just ok in my opinion. I think they still have a few kinks to work out as the restaurant is new, but it is near the water and I could see the empire state building out the window.",2,1,1,Siri C.,"Frisco, TX",53,225,0

5.0,7/24/2015,"One of the best places to eat on the Long Island city waterfront. I've eaten here two times so far and do not know why this is my first time reviewing it. The design of this place on the inside is sick. They put a lot of time and money into many details of this place. The location alone would render any restaurant a success, however, this place will only gain more and more followers and regular customers. The drinks are so on point that I don't mind waiting for a table if necessary. Even a classic vesper martini is perfect. The food is sooooo tasty. I'm a foodie and like to talk bad about things when they are bad and good when they are good. This place will becomes staple in this waterfront district of LIC. The fish the meat the pasta, all fresh, all tasty. The bread and the spread they give you in the beginning is an orgy of flavored in your mouth. The octopus is very very tender. When I asked them why it's so tender, they responded that they beat the hell out of it and then lovingly massage it. I always finish my meal with espresso. Unlike most Italian restaurants in the city that end up giving me the most bitter of espressos, the coffee here is fantastic and a great finish to my meal.

We had a great view of the city, which you do from almost every table in the place. We shared the fettucini crudo and the organic chicken. Both dishes were amazing, and we were full enough sharing both dishes. Their bread and dip are also very tasty. The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars is because as much as the service is VERY attentive, it is almost too attentive.

The food was of course superb as it always is (the zucchini flowers are heavenly). But the service plus sitting in the beautiful patio is what really made the experience.

5.0,6/28/2015,"We enjoyed every moment of eating at this restaurant. Â From the moment we walked in to the time we payed the check, we had a great experience and were treated with great service. We grabbed a drink at the bar until our table was ready. Â I had a Barometro, a rye-based drink, which was absolutely delicious. Â The bartenders were extremely helpful and accommodating.When we sat down at the table, the server was knowledgeable and offered excellent suggestions. Â They informed us of the Chef's recommendations (most of them we followed and they were on point). Â The server was knowledgeable and super friendly.Now onto the food...We got a Carpaccio di Manzo as an appetizer. Â I've never had better. Â The combination of the beef with proscuitto was an excellent choice.For main course, we had the Pan Seared Duck and the Pork Shank over gnocchi. Â The server continued to give us the Chef's recommendations on the best temperature for the duck. Â The portions were big and we brought home a lot of the Pork Shank/gnocchi. Â It was really good that I didn't want to stop eating it.I would definitely go back and recommend this place to everyone.

5.0,6/28/2015,"SO HAPPY that another excellent restaurant is in our neighborhood in LIC. Nothing better than good Italian food. I've been here a few times and everything I've tried so far is good; let me list out a few musts: - burrata (MUST TRY. I REPEAT, MUST TRY) - shrimp & blueberry risotto (don't let the purple color fool you; it's amazing) - grilled octopus - GNOCCHI (melts in your mouth, is magical)the fruit prosecco is also yums . servers, hosts, managers are all friendly. Also -- the most beautiful restaurant space in LIC for sure!",4,2,2,Jackie K.,"Long Island City, NY",2,43,38
5.0,6/27/2015,What an amazing place. Came here for a big birthday party. The blueberry risotto was out of this world. The caldo and ravioli were phenomenal.

5.0,6/27/2015,"From the moment you walk in you can appreciate the attention to detail that was put into this place. The bar and mixology staff are on point. The drinks are creative and revitalizing. Everything I ate at maiella was out of control delicious. There was literally nothing that was ""just ok""( yes I have tried everything from the blueberry risotto to the lamb chops and the Nutella pizza).

3.0,6/25/2015,"I went on opening night. The decor is beautiful. The entrance and space is elegantly decorated. The hostess was very friendly and inviting. The staff was friendly. The round bar near the entrance is really nice. I like how the main dining room is separated from the bar even separated by steps. The main dining room is nicely decorated. Very elegant. I made an rsvp and requested a table with a view. The request was made. The table for 5 was the closest to the window to see the views. The food on the other hand was not up to par. I had really high expectations and the food did not blow me away. My friends felt the same way. We ordered as apps the octupus and the eggplant. Both dishes were ok. As for the main course, I ordered the fettucine maiella. It was nice because it had italian sausage but it needed more flavor. It was a tad bland. The ambiance made the night. We skipped dessert. I hope to give it another chance in the coming months. Hope it gets better.",5,1,2,Amy C.,"Flushing, NY",135,308,2008
2.0,6/24/2015,"Service was impeccable. The problem is that the food is extremely overpriced. I had the pizza with the sausage bread and cheese, it was nothing great.my wife had the gnocchi and it was just okay, really lacked flavor and taste. My total bill for the two of us was $65 including tax and tip and one drink which we shared. We are still left hungry after this meal",1,5,1,Alon X.,"Austin, TX",5,314,7
3.0,6/24/2015,"I had great expectations out of this place. Especially for the price rating and all the hype. Don't get me wrong service was excellent. The location, decor and ambiance superb. It's truly a beautiful place to go on a date. But the food just didn't measure up. I went with a group of 5. Having also dined at Cavo which is also run by the same the same owner I went in with certain level of expectations. We ordered the octopus Â appetizer and the portion was by far smaller than normal. It was also cut up already into tiny pieces and it just got lost in the midst of greens. I would recommend that they leave the octopus whole and present it on top of the greens. Creates more of an impact. The taste, also nothing that special. Again, having tasted the octopus at Cavo which is very tender, served as a long tentacle portion and very flavorful, this one fell pretty low. Mind you that I am not biased to only appreciating Greek food. My family is Italian so I am pretty accustomed to tasting what can be done with octopus when given the Italian flare. I ordered the chicken with mushrooms Â entree. Again, disappointed. If the mushroom sauce was not splat on top the chicken cutlet the piece of Â poultry would have no flavor. I gave some to my friend and she made the remark that it tasted like ""cafeteria food"". I don't remember what the rest of the table ordered but it was the same consensus all around. No one was impressed or enamored with the taste of the food. We skipped dessert. I also noticed when ordering drinks that the half bottle vs single glass pricing really didn't make sense. The half bottle I inquired about only served 3 glasses and was more expensive than ordering Â by the single glass? How that makes sense I do not know. They definitely need to take a look into that. I see subsequent reviews of folks going there after me to reiterate their same experience with the food. The view in the backyard is not directly next to the coca cola sign. I was under the impression that it was from all the ads. There is a yard and further out you can see the sign but it's not part of the restaurants seating area. They also didn't have the backyard open for dinning yet since it was still cold.Since this was their first week I hope to come back several months down the road and update my review with better things to say. For now I recommend you go there for drinks and the ambiance. Parking is difficult in the area in the evening. You can either park in a lot or Â go further up looking on the side streets .",5,2,2,Carolina B.,"Washington, DC",292,193,7785
5.0,6/22/2015,"We went for our wedding anniversary dinner to Maiella last Saturday night. Â The place is beautiful, we had to wait for our table a little because we were late (couldn't find parking). Â So, we sat at the bar where we meant Michael (our Â bartender) who made wonderful recommendations on our drinks. Â I had Maiella which was so yummy, tasted a little bit like orangina but with vodka, my husband liked his drink as well but i don't remember what it was... Â We didn't have to wait long before our table was ready. Â We sat right by the window but b/c of the fog couldn't see much. Â My husband ordered the grilled sardine appetizer which he liked and I had arugula & pear salad which was very yummy. Â For main course, I ordered chicken with mushroom sauce which was alright and my husband had cod that he really liked. Â Btw, the bread is so fresh and delicious that we kept asking for more and it comes with a really yummy tomato paste :-) Now to the best part, dessert was absolutely amazing!!!! We ordered napoleon and hazelnut ice cream, both were delicious!!! Napoleon was so light and fresh and probably one of the best desserts I've ever had and trust me I love my dessert!

We started off with the Carpaccio di Pesce, the Buratta (one of my favorites) the strawberry salad with Basil Gelato which was unlike anything I have ever had before! The service was outstanding; knowledgeable and friendly staff. I am still dreaming of the Blueberry Risotto, which is an absolute must and the chicken parmigiana was outstanding.

Great food, love the drinks and the buratta is amazing! We also ordered the fettuccine, branzino, gnocchis, and the braised pork. Al was delicious. Lacking stars because of the service, waiter was a bit odd and could barely hear what he was saying. And he even told us when we wanted to first just order drinks and just an appetizer that we needed to have are whole order ready at once before he could place our appetizer order. Very odd, left me a little unsettled. And we were going to try dessert but he dropped the menu off and we did not see him for another 20 minutes. So we opted to close out are tab and head to the bar. Much better service at the bar then in the main dining room.We will definitely be back to give it another shot.

3.0,6/15/2015,"We live in the neighborhood, so naturally we have been waiting in anticipation for the grand opening of a new restaurant on the block. The dÃ©cor is beautiful. Combination of a classical and modern styles. Exposed wood ceiling gives it a very warm and homey feel. We made a reservation for Saturday of the opening weekend. The service was great. We were seated right away and had water and menus on our table in no time. We got asked about our dining experience by one of the managers, who expressed sincere interest in making us happy customers. All in all, great.We started our dining experience with cocktails. I had the Maiella (Stolichnaya vodka, strawberry and fig infused Carpano Bianco, fresh lemon, club soda) and my husband ordered Barometro (George Dickel rye, maraschino, Fernet Branca, Peychaud's bitters, Amaro Montenegro). Both drinks were great, each with distinct tastes. Maiella is on a sweeter/fruitier side and Barometro with more sweet and sour notes. Just enough alcohol to feel it but not too much. Now on to the food and the reason for three stars. We were off to a good start with Carpaccio di Pesce (tuna carpaccio, mesclun, avocado, olive oil, lemon, ginger dressing). Both, presentation and taste were great. Perfect appetizer for a light, summer night. For entrees we ordered Pesce Spada (seasoned grilled swordfish, olive oil) and Pollo Quattro Funghi (organic chicken, four mushroom sauce, touch of truffle oil). The presentation of both dishes was very simple. Now, while it is not the most important thing, it is something extra that we have come to expect from a $25 - $35 entrÃ©e. The other thing that stood out is both entree's were garnished the same way - two small baked potatoes and green beans. I am no expert on pairings, but I would think that there are different ways to 'balance' the flavors of the Meat vs. Fish dishes. Lastly, the taste. While both entrees were prepared very well, they did not offer much complexity, or depth of flavors. The restaurant sets itself up for high expectations with impressive dÃ©cor and hefty price tags, but falls flat with simplicity of the dishes. If they want to stay in the high price range, main entrees will need to offer more. Otherwise, food as is would be more appropriate in the $20 range. Considering that we visited in their opening week, I am sure the menu will evolve with time and the restaurant will settle into it's own unique identity in the neighborhood. Looking forward to trying more dishes in the future!",8,3,3,Olga W.,"Glendale, CA",26,15,23
5.0,6/15/2015,"As a neighborhood resident, I've been eager for Maiella to open. Â Finally got to try it for brunch this weekend. Â The brunch menu (as of now) is the same as the dinner menu, and I was glad to have the same options. Â Everything lived up to my hopes. Â The space and decor are lovely (roomy, light, rustic but contemporary), service was excellent (a tad over-solicitous?) and the food was great. Â Highlight was my main course, the pollo organico, which is essentially chicken milanese. Â One of the best pieces of chicken I've had in a long time.

Had the special cocktail, vodka, strawberry with the strawberry fig carpaccio. Appetizers: top notch. Calamari fritti and the special app with figs, arugula (I think) and parm reggiano. EntrÃ©e: ordered the sole. Was delicious but not very hot. It was warm but on its way to cool. Opening night. Dessert: one was good the other not so good. Panna Cotta: spot on. Chocolate pizza: I would loose this from the menu. Execution was not good. Too dry and chewy.Decor: love the space. The lighting is amazing and overall ambiance feels modern and rustic at the same time. I would loose the salamis hanging by the oven. Scale is wrong.I will definitely be coming back to Maiella.

Â We had the chefs tasting menu I cannot express enough how good the food was. Â We tried 4 appetizers, 2 pasta dishes and 2 entrees they were all fantastic. Â I highly recommend the braised short rib and the black Sea bass. Â The home made pasta in a lamb ragu sauce was out of this world. Â For desert I recommend the Nutella pizza and the semifreddo.

We started off with drinks: I ordered the Maiella and my boyfriend got a whiskey drink. Both were nice, flavorful and strong. For our first courses we ordered baked clams (pretty good) beef carpaccio (excellent) and lobster salad (best of the three! exceptional!). For our entrees we ordered filet mignon and the shrimp dish. The shrimp were basically mini lobster tails they were huge. Nicely cooked. The whole time the service was great, everyone was very friendly.

5.0,6/3/2015,"There are times when you go to a place and hope for the best but expect the worst. Especially when a place is brand new and you know in the back of your head that some kinks need to be ironed out.Rest assured that Maiella is not one those establishments.Having had the pleasure of visiting last night, I can tell you that everything from the decor to service, to drinks and food was meticulously researched and delivered with absolute excellence in mind. How could they not when the head chef is Rocco Sacramone of Trattoria L'Incontro? (27 Zagat rating)The decor reminds you of a modern day Tuscan restaurant, yet with a rustic feel. There is an incredible view of the Pepsi sign and Manhattan in the back, tall, black iron doors everywhere, and a brick oven pizza with fresh cured meats hanging from the cieling.As for the food... Well we were totally blown away. Must haves are:- Venison/bison/ostrich meatballs- Buratta- Beef Carpaccio- Strawberry Salad with basil gelato (INSANE!!!!!!)- Dover Sole- Fettucini MaiellaLast but certainly not least, and my favorite... The drinks. I can't begin to describe to you how epic the Sarrono Sour is - I think I had 8. Look for it on their cocktail menu. Some people had the Fizzantino 75, which is Prosecco based, it was great as well.All of us in LIC have been anticipating the opening of Maiella for quite some time and they came out swinging.
