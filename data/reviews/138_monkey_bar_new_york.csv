4.0,4/29/2019,"Came here for drinks Friday night and had a great time! We made a reservation for 10pm but ended up sitting at a booth in the front (first come first serve) since the front of the restaurant seems a little more casual than the dining area in the back.The service was a little slow but everyone was happy with their cocktails and the few small appetizers we shared. We ordered the shishito peppers, prosciutto and pita chips - they were all yummy!  The atmosphere is fun with the monkey decor on the walls - really seems like an old time NYC bar! Someone was playing live piano for a bit when we first arrived which was a nice touch as well.",0,0,0,Morgan F.,"New York, NY",224,103,33
4.0,4/20/2019,"Whenever I feel like some judgmentally made yet fancy cocktails I head to the Monkey Bar. The bartenders are funny and I witnessed the most terrible first date I've ever seen while sitting at the bar enjoying a French 75. The food is pretty good, I wouldn't specially say to come here for the food but I wouldn't say avoid it either. It reminds me of a solid neighborhood bistro. You have your pastas, your steaks, you gin. All good things. The mural is fantastic. If you eat in the back restaurant area make sure you sit facing it! Service in the restaurant area is wonderful. Professional and swift.",0,0,0,Jamey B.,"Arlington, VA",130,336,174
1.0,4/18/2019,"Zero stars. I'm not the one to be a harsh critic, but this place needs to wake up and smell the coffee. They use the ambiance and murals to sell a welcoming environment rather run a complete sham. To point out , the waiter staff is great, however, the management and kitchen are quite the other side of the spectrum. Not only did my friend get cut off from drinks, because he stumbled down the stairs, while going to the most inconvenient bathroom in a restaurant ever, but they gave me a well done steak on a medium rare order and then proceeded to spill a martini into a pasta dish.  Being a born and bred New Yorker, I'd appreciate if establishments treated customers with more care then the harsh treatment, as if were tourists. Mind you, I don't respect harsh treatment in any circumstance, it's even more unwelcoming when you were raised here. Everyone who is a native New Yorker or business patron in midtown east, should avoid this bar, as it only exists to serve itself and doesn't embody the true nature of New York. Hope it's shelf life is as short lived as Cheap MTA fares.",1,0,0,Tarun D.,"ASTORIA, NY",36,4,0
3.0,4/15/2019,Met a business colleague here for quick drinks.  Noise level is not 'average' as advertised on Yelp.  Bartenders were strangely avoiding eye contact with any patrons which meant much longer wait times for drinks.  Over all it felt like a noisy dungeon with some really well dressed finance people.  Not coming back anytime soon for drinks.  Bar seating is limited.,0,0,0,Maddy R.,"New York, NY",9,70,19
4.0,4/12/2019,Where did my review go? I eat here twice a year or so for lunch. I love it. Graydon Carter is there a lot. It's like David Mamet at Farm Shop in Santa Monica. Sort of his commissary. Classic New York elegance. Beautiful room. I LOVE the food but today UGH. The new salmon is terrible. 38 (I didn't pay) for a Weight Watchers meal. Grilled broccolini (practically raw). Boring. Healthy. Wild rice I affirmatively disliked and left. Salmon? TOTALLY worthless. Miso glaze. Thin. The worst entree ever had for that price anywhere. I am a bit miffed because I asked the server about it and he said he loves the new preparation. Makes me think they bought too much of this stupid dish and want to offload. I should have had the scallops or the burger. Or the appetizers. I'm up in weight so it's not the worst thing for me to have a boring clean lunch but I don't go to Monkey Bar for a diet meal.

1.0,3/2/2019,This establishment was against youths thinking that  all those who enter are up to no good. This is dispicable and disgusts me to my core. My waiter was not tolerant of such persons.

2.0,12/22/2018,"This must be a place for tourists or people who don't care about food. No one who actually enjoys food would ever step foot in here willingly.  (I came for business, did not choose this place and did not pay)The only positive was the ambience. Nice decor and overall feel. Value was atrocious with really high prices ($30 pastas) for very low quality food. Nothing seemed fresh. Halibut was so basic (and fishy). Pastas were really gross - some of the worst I've had in the city. Came to nearly $150/pp after tax/tip. Don't go here. Bottom 10% of all NYC restaurants.",1,1,0,michael d.,"New York, NY",103,24,1
4.0,12/10/2018,"I think this place is adorable. It has a very vintage vibe about it. Service is great. I've been here twice, once for drinks and once for dinner.  Drinks were slow when we went, but it was a busy Saturday night. When we came for dinner it was a much more pleasant experience. The dining area is in a very picturesque old New York area in the back. Decorated with Monkeys. The first thing that comes out is monkey bread which is cute (I've been  told it is very good, but gluten allergy, couldn't try it myself). I had the chicken paillard for dinner and it was delicious, just ever so slightly too lemony. My friend had the lamb chops, which were fabulous.

3.0,11/27/2018,"Love the restaurant ambiance and design - old school lounge- heavy on the testosterone. Clubby and comfortable. Historic, which is one of my favorite things. But - whatever you do avoid the Eggplant Parmesan. I lied to the waiter and said it was fine - my mistake and my weakness that I can't confront. But the waiter was very sweet and I didn't want to disturb him or make him feel bad in any way. Horrible dish. But I'm guessing there are other wonderful things to eat. This is a crowd with money and they could obviously go elsewhere. They like it here. So give it a chance, just DO NOT get the Eggplant Parmesan.",0,0,0,Sue B.,"Manhattan, NY",1,25,0

The ambiance is very old school (think a place where 80's bankers would hang out). The service however was very pleasant and the dining experience overall was nice.  The food however was overpriced. I ordered the tomato soup as a starter which was nice, and the fish course which tasted good. But definitely not worth the price.

3.0,8/15/2018,"There are a lot of things I love about Monkey Bar, including the great waitress Emma, and Edward, a waiter/barman. But why do they keep messing with the bar menu? It was a big disappointment when they took the sliders, pigs in blankets, and the truffle popcorn off of the bar menu, but the sausage rolls were a tasty substitute. Now those are gone, too. Why can't they have decent bar snacks? Yes, it is an upscale place. Appropriate bar snacks (emphasis on bar) and upscale are not mutually exclusive",0,0,0,Patricia O.,"Manhattan, NY",2,47,2

We ordered cocktails and our appetizers came and as our minuscule entree came we had to flag our waiter down for said cocktails. Dessert does NOT include coffee/tea. Hostess walks around asking tables how everything is. Very robotic. When we told her that we were very unhappy she blinked, and said ""Oh..."" and walked away with her hands in that supplicant pose and just continued on to the other tables asking ""How is everything?"" She isn't programed for complaints. Bravo! You had us in and out in 45 minutes. Phooey on you . Never again! How dare you! HOW DARE YOU!!! $130.00 for the ""bum's rush!

1.0,8/13/2018,"I just had a miserable experience with The Monkey Bar's ""Restaurant Week"" offerings. I am not a novice to Manhattan's Restaurant Week -- I am well aware that the menu is extremely limited and the portions are smaller than usual. However, there is ""small"" and there is ""insulting,"" and tonight's offerings left my husband and I stupefied. We ordered the Roasted NY Strip Loin and Grilled Chicken Paillard. The meals should have been served with a magnifying glass. I have ordered cold cuts from a deli that were thicker than these cuts of meat. When the waiter put the plates down, I just about looked around for the hidden cameras -- I figured it could not be possible that this was what they called dinner. The chefs must roar with laughter as they assemble these ""dishes"" for the Restaurant Week suckers. What an insult to their customers! It would be better to not participate in Restaurant Week at all than to serve these meager, pathetic portions -- which still cost $42 per person (drinks separate and coffee not included). The purpose of Restaurant Week should be to introduce your restaurant to people who are not regular patrons, and to hopefully entice them to return. We left the restaurant feeling taken advantage of and slapped in the face... and although we have been semi-regular patrons in the past, will likely not return after tonight's fiasco.",2,0,0,Kris B.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,2,0
5.0,8/2/2018,"The Monkey Bar wasn't crowded on a Saturday night when I showed up.  The decor is fun.

We waited over 40 min from when we were finished with our main course for dessert & I spoke up about that, stating the obvious.

Wonderful for drinks, burgers and cocktails with an upscale ambiance and smart, put-together professional crowd that shows up after office hours and stays a few hours. Always mobbed for happy hour, the dinner crowd is split between the casual Monkey Bar, (if you can land a table or booth) while some spill into the adjoining dining room of the Hotel Elysee.   The ambiance here is reminiscent of Bemmelmans Bar at the Carlyle Hotel, only more casual. The artwork on the walls is similar a only with a monkey/ exotic animal theme. The music is light and jazzy -- all of which adds up to a casual sophistication that's becoming harder and harder to find today.

The restaurant is very cute - all dim lighting and lots of finance heavy people were in the restaurant (which makes sense given its location). We ordered a glass of pinot and a glass of cabernet. The wines were $20-$22 per glass which is pretty expensive, but the more disappointing part was that my drink (the pinot noir) was old and too aerated. There was a copper taste to my drink.We ordered the special braised octopus to start. The sauce was decent but the whole appetizer was very sub par. The octopus did not taste fresh. As entrees, I ordered the NY strip and my friend ordered a filet fish. The NY strip was one of the worst steaks I've had. The rare I requested came out to be medium rare, and the steak itself was stiff and awful. The entire meal came out to be near $200.

We had the Wedge Salad (split for us by the kitchen), Branzino (European Sea Bass), Smoked Spaghetti, and Sticky Toffee Pudding.The Wedge Salad was so delicious. The tomatoes were so sweet and juicy, and the Greek goddess dressing was DIVINE. I could eat that dressing every day! The Branzino was perfectly cooked, with the skin crispy and the meat flaky and pure white. The spinach it came with was not overcooked (thank goodness), and the sauce was a perfect compliment for the entire dish. The Smoked Spaghetti, per our server's recommendation, was AMAZING. I usually order better dishes than my boyfriend, but this time, he took the cake (but it's not really fair since the waiter highly recommended this dish). The pasta was so delicious and wonderfully cooked, with a slight bite. The shrimp and scallops were fresh and flavorful, and the sauce was amazing. But I need to talk about the Sticky Toffee Pudding. I could die happy if I had that for a last meal. Our server was AMAZINGLY accommodating, and after mentioning that we had a show to go to, he made sure to have it out and ready for us within minutes of ordering it. It was hot and fresh, and so perfectly baked that I couldn't believe it didn't come directly from heaven. I have made numerous sticky toffee pudding recipes, and (pun intended) this takes the cake. Wow. The molasses and dates were perfectly balanced throughout the recipe, and the sticky toffee was not overly sweet but gently soaked the cake and made it just that much more divine. The ice cream that came with it just really took it to the next level.But hats off to the wonderful, knowledgeable, patient and efficient server that we had.

Their drinks outstanding, and appetizers were delicious.  We went back there for a business lunch last summer.  Food was good, but the waitress was a wee bit unfriendly and service somewhat slow.  The worst experience was from today.  We spent a total of 45 mins waiting for a waiter and food, during our lunch hour.  On top of that, he got 2 of 4 orders wrong!  They were not even super busy.There are so many places nearby, we could have done better with any of them.  Disappointing.",0,0,0,K C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,24,3
2.0,12/2/2016,"Had drinks and food at the bar, have not eaten in the restaurant. I'm basing this review on 2 things: 1. Service It wasn't that busy but there was only 1 server for the whole bar area. I didn't get a warm inviting vibe from our server. He was very young and maybe tired but when I asked for his recommendation or a question he sighed and gave a short answer like I was bothering him. I ordered their signature drink and some oysters. The menu said the oysters came in the 1/2 dozen so I asked for 1 order. A cook came out with only 1 oyster. I was confused and said I thought I was getting 6. He takes it back and tells our server. The poor cook. The server chewed him out loud enough for everyone to hear. The server said ""I asked her two times how many she wanted and this is what she said!"" Wow man it's not a big deal. When the server walked by I tried to joke with him, I even apologized for the confusion and he just looked at me and walked away. Not cool. 2. FoodI eventually did get the oysters and they were wonderful. I ordered another appetizer and it was ok. Someone else got the burger and that was awesome. The drinks were good too.

I can't say this dish is a usual for me, but I would definitely get it again. Nicely seasoned and served with a type of wasabi sauce and crispy chips. Entrees included salads, chicken paillard and my crab cake sandwich. The crab cake was very nice with little filler.

When I was getting near finishing mine, I noticed that I was starting to find grit in my mouth. After a couple more bites to be sure, I turned to my colleague to tell her. She replied that she was experiencing the same thing. So we called the bartender over to tell him what we were experiencing, and actually showed him some clear evidence of grit on the sides and bottom of our salad bowls. I said that I was pretty sure it was dirt that probably came from lettuce that was not sufficiently washed. After studying the evidence for a bit, he said he would show the chef. A few minutes later he returned to say that they would comp our glasses of wine! No apology, no offer to make us new salads, plus the wine cost half of what the salads did. This was a totally unacceptable response to serving us a spoiled dish. We'll not just think twice about coming here again, we won't come at all.

1.0,7/23/2016,"There is a first time for everything-  a no star review (even though I can't seem to eliminate the one star above)  because this once iconic midtown landmark is literally a zero. We made a reservation for a Saturday to celebrate our Mother's birthday. The restaurant was aware of the occasion when we made the reservation. She is an elegant senior citizen who loves the hustle and bustle of Manhattan and is remarkable for her age. Well we arrived only to find the main dining room closed. The manager claimed he had tried to call all week and inform us there would only be dining in the bar. Well I have an office, a receptionist and voice mail-no such message was ever left. Although we'd made the reservation on Open Table no one tried to contact us by the new revolutionary form of communication called e-mail either. The manager claimed the restaurant did not have my address. This was bad enough for a restaurant that puts on airs requiring a credit card for reservations of five or more and charges you if you don't show up. Worse, though there were five of us the retaurant tried to seat us at a table for four at the front of the bar with one seat protruding into the doorway's entrance. But that wasn't luxuriant enough-the table was so rickety that a waiter and bus boy could not stabilize it. So we left having enjoyed some terrific new york tap water on a stifling hot night. But all's well that ends well.. Parents, children and grandchildren trundled four blocks south in the delightfully humid dusk and enjoyed a wonderful birthday meal at Maloney & Porcelli which I highly recommend if the thought of going to the Monkey Bar ever crosses your mind. By the way I suppose I should mention that at least the Manager offered us a free drink when we arrived because of the snafu but I can't because he didn't.  Well the water was great!

The fries are decent if you're wanting a greasy snack, and the simple green salad is also decent if you're needing something a little lighter and healthier. The cheese plate is also a good choice, although I would pass on the arancini. The fried risotto balls served with a bit of tomato sauce missed the mark a bit in the flavor and texture department.

What: The Monkey Bar is an establishment full of history. The decor of the venue is a cross between timeless class and a tropical vacation.

I finally got a chance to go last night with a good friend, and overall it was a great experience.The decor is cool. There are monkey murals all over the place, old fashioned red and white checked tablecloths to give it a kitschy feel, and lots of beautiful dark wood that reminds you you're in a NYC power restaurant. The servers are very nice. The bartenders took care of me while I waiting for my friend. I had a champagne cobbler (a little on the sweet side), and the seasonal Red Delicious, which actually turned out to be much better than I thought, given it's made with cachaca (not my favorite.)Where I have to take stars off is the food itself. The ""bread basket"" consists of hot delicious rolls that were maybe one of the highlights of the meal. I had the clams casino for a starter, and they were fine. Not great. They didn't taste super fresh and there were too many dry breadcrumbs in the stuffing part. I had the smokey spaghetti for a main course, and it was lacking in flavor. The small shrimp and scallops were cooked well, and the spaghetti did have a smokey flavor, but I felt like it should be a bold, zesty flavor, not a sweet, watered down flavor. All in all not the best meal.Dessert was the cookie plate to share--again, nothing to write home about. Cookies were warm but dried out. One of them, the chocolate one, was too dry to eat on its own. Maybe would've been better with coffee.I'm very glad to have tried this place. I'd love to go back to the bar and hang out, as it had a fun, welcoming vibe.

My friends and clients have dined here. I ""thought"" it was the perfect nook for my partner and I to experience after seeing the Rockefeller Christmas Tree. Boy, was I wrong and should have trusted my instinct. When we arrived to The Monkey Bar we felt we were in the perfect place. The ambiance was rich with Christmas decorations that blended into it's beautiful decor. Our table for 2 was perfectly set in a corner booth in the main dining room. The table was even available upon our arrival time from booking with our Opentable Account. Unfortunately, this was the only exciting part of our experience. Everything went downhill from that moment. I understand we looked similar to tourist that evening. Due to our site seeing holiday preferences. The insulting part is to be treated as foreigners. We had to hale a bus boy for service after waiting 13.5 minutes for a hot tea. This is because we received no introduction from the waitress nor wine sommelier. When the waitress did finally come to our table. We received no apology nor name introduction. I still don't know her name, but she was petite, with slicked back blonde hair, and blue eyes. She was extremely rude in her demeanor, not attentive, and short with her words. Even after her introduction, I was put in the situation to ask for the tea again. (It's been now 22 minutes now and very uncomfortable.) The whole experience was far from enjoyable. The list goes on with even dining forks missing when entrees were served, and having to wait....and so on! I do not need to explain any further we catch the drift. We may not be regulars, but for 2 people we gladly enjoy a substantial dinner of quality and substance. This is not what we received. It was disappointing and I reached out to the restaurant the next day to give feedback, and no one has contacted me.

1.0,8/14/2015,"I came for RW.  Granted, that is probably not the best indicator - but unlike some other fine spots that WILL serve food from their regular menu on their RW menu, Monkey Bar did not. Furthermore, they will be extremely particular about absolutely no substitutions to this menu (I happen to come when I'm doing a pretty hard sugar detox diet).The food was mediocre at best. The appetizer - a simple raw crudo, was actually very nice, except there was what looked to be a dairy based sauce on the plate (that I was able to avoid), though the waitress promised the sauce was a just a simple oil and vinegar.  It really annoyed me that she did not get that right after I explained my strict diet.  Her response, when she asked how everything was later on, was to basically ask if I were allergic.  It really matters not if a customer is allergic to something or not.  If a customer does NOT want something, she should NOT have to tolerate it! I did not appreciate that attitude. For the main, the only option I could get was the chicken breast on what was supposed to be spinach - but was so brown, tough and salty, it might have been kale.  The chicken was dry and salty, but substantial.  I did get a bit extra spinach, since I could not have the faro it came with. I had to skip dessert.  At another RW spot, I was able to substitute that for an extra side dish, but not here - that's just blasphemy!Service, needless to say, was extremely subpar for the establishment.  When me and the first of 5 guests arrived, the waitress seemed anxious to serve and checked in on us three times.  Once our friends arrived, however, service became very slow.  Finally, as suggested above, I did not like the attitude.The setting is cool and feels fun.  Too bad the unhappy server doesn't let you enjoy it.  Of course, coulda been a fluke day for her.Prices on the regular menu are just laughable considering how poor the food was off the RW menu.  I should think RW is a chance to entice customers to come back.  It did the entire opposite for me.",7,5,1,Joan H.,"New York, NY",213,485,3

4.0,8/12/2015,"went last month for RstrntWk dinner menu. looking at the recent reviews, thought I should give my 2 cents:+ Food was excellent, as usual. done RW for the 3rd time here. Arugula & Fennel salad very refreshing, and the Flatiron Steak was just right. Cocktail list is first class.+ Ambience: the unique murals in the dining room (the bar side is very casual and diff atmosphere) are always nice to see, and the red leather banquettes are really nice seating. can't say we've tried to photo the murals, but no issues with taking pics of our food...+ Service: contrary to others' experiences, the front of the house greeted us and said good night on the way out. our waiter was fine, patient with our questions and attentive.* really a nice spot, good buzz. it's unfort some have apparently not had a similar, enjoyable experience.",1,0,0,Ja F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,22,13
1.0,7/24/2015,"MONKEY BAR, A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF A VERY BAD AND RACIST RESTAURANT!!!! Initially, I heard good things about this place to why I decided to take them there. As we walked in the staff stared at us without a pleasant greeting. I honestly didn't think anything of it (I actually thought that it was because we looked beautiful) lol... While waiting for the food we decided to take pictures the manager abruptly told us we are not allowed to do so and did not explain the reason why. A Few minutes went by and I asked one of the waiters who by the way I thought he was the only nice guy there to take a picture and he does. The manager rudely told him off in front of us which I thought was very unprofessional. The waiter explained the reason and we understood and put the phones away. I am already feeling uncomfortable with the situation the manager continued to look at us, speaking to her staff and looking at our table. I decided to look around and we were the only Hispanic people there. I am still giving them the benefit of the doubt because I am a restaurantholic. While we were placing the order, I asked the waiter to recommend their best wine, and he replies ""Oh here is the cheapest one"". I  was very insulted because he mentioned the price when  I asked for quality. By his response he implied that we couldn't afford it. I have been to better restaurants than this one and I never encountered this kind of treatment. We ate fast because we wanted to get the hell out of there and the bill came, the 20% of gratuity was included when the waiter came he had wrote in the gratuity himself. While being there I thought awwww how nice I innocently called him over and asked him why did you add the tip I wanted to give you extra he said is ok you don't have too. The 20% was almost $90 and I delete the amount he wrote and gave him an extra $30 which was $120 in total. As I am walking out and my back is turned, He says, ""THATS WHY YOU DON'T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER!!!!!!!!!!"". I wasn't offended by the ""no picture rule"" but his inappropriate comments as I was leaving, I found that to be very disrespectful. To top it off the food wasn't as delightful as I was expecting and I would NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone, in addition to its poor customer service, the experience itself was uncomfortable, the atmosphere seemed very judgemental from beginning to end. Honestly, I have never written a bad review about a restaurant before, but this experience was so awful that I had to warn others.

This drink is a magnificent blend of rye, coffee liqueur, syrup and orange bitters (I believe I got the combo right) that is strong but sweet and very pleasing to the palate! Well worth the hefty price tag ($18). We had a reservation but were never rushed to our table, allowing us to savor our cocktails at the bar before being sat. Once at the table, we were served by the friendly and attentive Eddie. I ordered the cream of mushroom soup (superb!!! Not too salty, perfect amount of creaminess), the Bass (very tasty, not too fishy), and the creme brûlée (had a strong orange flavor, I wasn't a fan) from the restaurant week menu. My friend ordered the hamachi (she loved it), the cavatelli with lamb ragu (probably the best sauce I have ever tasted and perfectly cooked pasta!) and the toffee pudding (SO delicious! Very sweet). Our other friend ordered off the regular menu. The baby beets and goat cheese was awesome. The chicken pallaird was overpowered by the huge amount of greens on the side, although he thoroughly enjoyed it and cleaned his plate,I thought it looked more like a salad than a main course.

The atmosphere was classic old New York and absolutely charming, perfect for a romantic date with your significant other.We ordered drinks (which were just okay and a little pricey, but this is NYC) and when he returned with them we ordered our dinners: 1 steak tartar with fries, 2 butternut ravioli with chopped macadamias, brown butter sauce with truffle oil and foie gras and 1 smoked pasta. After ordering our waiter returned with a plate of rather cold rolls.Our food all came out simultaneously and was nice and hot. The portions were not large (which was just fine with me), and every single bite of the tartar and fries and ravioli were yummy, but the smoked spaghetti did not have the scallops it boasted in the description and had microscopically small shrimp (which really disappointed my husband).

It's surprisingly difficult to spot easily on 54th Street. The front bar area is cute and seems like it would be fun for a date. You go toward the back and down some stairs to the main dining room, which feels very old New York. There are wide booths, murals on the walls, and another bar in the back corner.The service is thoughtful, if a bit slow. Our waiter made great recommendations. We started with octopus, the saffron risotto, and the heirloom tomato salad. The octopus and risotto were great; the heirloom tomato salad was fine, but the ""homemade"" mozzarella cheese was a bit of a disappointment.For entrees we had the duck, the roasted chicken, and the lamb. I loved the kale cannelloni that came with the lamb. The duck looked delicious. I tasted the chicken and it was perfectly cooked and quite moist - not at all dry or bland.We didn't order dessert, but our waiter brought us this small bowl of mint chocolate malt balls, which were phenomenal.

However, the food is pretty important when rating a restaurant, and unfortunately, brought the rating down to a three. The restaurant is very cool, you walk into a small and crowded bar area that feels as if it were once a speak easy (i've heard that it actually was back in the day). In the rear is the main dining room. The wallpaper gives off a somewhat cheesy vibe similar to that of The Palm, but the ambience is nice. Comfortable seating and not too loud. I started with the wedge salad. It was great. A fresh ball of lettuce with creamy dressing and large chunks of fatty and perfectly cooked bacon. Off to a good start in my book...For my main course I ordered the Dry-Aged Bone In Rib-Eye ($55). My first complaint was that it came with a side salad of mixed greens. It was an eye-sore and I wasn't interested in eating a side salad with my steak, especially after just ordering the wedge salad. SIdenote: the NY Strip Steak came with fries on the side, which I thought should've been applied to the RIb-Eye as well. Enough about the side salad though. The steak was average at best. It came out warm, not hot, and while it was cooked to my liking (medium rare) it was very tough, and lacked the juiciness a top notch steak should provide. I hear the burger is great and was upset I didn't order it. The dessert was probably the best part of the meal. I ordered the Beignets and the Bosc Pear Cobbler. Both were great, but the Beignets were really special. Tender, doughy, with delicious side sauces of strawberry preserves and vanilla custard. A must order if going to Monkey Bar.

4.0,8/6/2013,"Monkey Bar is a very old school, traditional kind of Manhattan power restaurant. I've been there on a date and for work drinks. Dinner, wine and a split dessert cost about $180. Most of the wines by the glass are around $17. It's darkly lit with dark wood. There's virtually nothing on the menu for vegetarians and probably nothing for vegans, but I love the vibe of the place if you need to meet Wall Street types for business drinks. The sauteed mushrooms are amazing (I bet they're cooked in butter, but didn't ask).",0,0,0,Dawn K.,"Manhattan, NY",4,28,4
3.0,8/4/2013,"Love the monkey wallpaper and monkey lamps. The clubby, exclusive ambiance is everything I would've expected from a place owned by Vanity Fair magazine editor Graydon Carter. The prices are beyond my wallet but I was only there for drinks and a snack with a friend who picked up the tab -- the only way this place is manageable on a budget. We stayed clear of the pretty dining room, which serves $19 chopped salads and $29 chicken entrees. Instead, we had a table in the bar area, which is right there when you walk in the door. Cocktails and wines by the glass are in the $17-$18 range, and go much, much higher. There's an 18-page booze menu on the restaurant's website.I remember the initial reviews for the food as being mixed. In my humble opinion, that's still the case, at least for the bar menu. Save your money and avoid the threesome of meatloaf sliders named for the late, great writer Nora Ephron. Like her last  work, the Broadway show ""Lucky Guy,"" these sliders are mostly overbaked, over-seasoned and not very filling unless you like crusty, dry buns. The fried corn fritters were crispy but not distinctive in any way. You'd think we couldn't go wrong with the cheese plate. And yes, it was okay -- although the thin slices of dried kiwi fruit and strawberry that came with it were chewy and strange. But food is not the focus at Monkey Bar. If you want to hang out with the city's media power crowd, stop by for a week night, after-work $27 glass of champagne.

I don't care about whether you take it back or not but at least pretend to check with the manager or tell me kindly that you can't take it back. Then when I was visibly upset, the waiter STOPPED SERVING US. I had to get the attention of busboys for glass refills or anything else.

My only complaint is that the portions were very small - only 3 smallish scallops (which I guess made sense considering it was the restaurant week special).  For dessert, we shared all 3 dessert options - assorted sorbets (the banana was awesome), chocolate cake and carrot cake.  Of the 3 options, I liked the carrot cake best.To drink we split a bottle of wine and a round of cocktails.  My $18 martini was very good and definitely one of the better parts of the meal.Side note: I loved the decor!!

The beautiful dining room/gross food combo verges on the Le Cirque dining experience, except there are less men entertaining their mistresses, I've yet to eat anything that was actually disgusting, and the servers aren't even half as rude (actually, they're pretty nice.)I love it when this place is on RW menu because it would really shock the conscience to spend more than $50 for lunch and a glass of wine here, but at the Restaurant Week price the so-civilized dining room makes up for the food for me, hence the three stars and my multiple past and likely future visits.",0,0,0,Laura H.,"Manhattan, NY",82,22,0

The atmosphere immediately was awesome. Just a classic NYC bar, which was perfect for my out of town guest. Brian the bartender was simply great. You don't mind paying $12-15 for a drink when they are unique, and masterfully prepared. I started with an easy one, a martini a bit dirty. One I saw him mix up a few other drinks for other patrons, I knew he was serious. I asked him to make me up a drink, and within a few questions to me, he knew what direction he was headed. After sampling his creation a few times, he knew it was ready. It was a fantastic bourbon based drink with a hint of bitters and orange zest. Damn...nailed it. As far as food, we did try an app as I was a bit peckish at that point. We had the fried oysters with jalapeños and garlic. One word there: killer. Overall, I can surely vouch for the bar.

2.0,9/25/2012,"There is something very special about the iconic dining room and famous murals of The Monkey Bar, and if you're in the mood for a fabulous cocktail in a warm, supper club like, upscale space that harkens back to another time and you want to have that experience in midtown, well then The Monkey Bar is an excellent choice. (Though if you're going to spend $18 on a martini why not go to Bemelmans). The bar is cozy, with a few red leather booths along the wall covered in red checkered tablecloths. The bartenders are skilled and welcoming. Unfortunately everything falls apart at dinner. It's a beautiful space to dine in, and while you're paying extra for the chance to eat classic dishes in this space (think a $22 burger, a $19 chopped salad, a $26 roast chicken) none of that would be a real problem if the waitstaff had their act together. The Monkey Bar clearly had their moment a few years back when Graydon Carter did the redux and it was impossible to get a table--it seems that now the VIP's have moved on and so has the top notch service. The food is good, if overpriced. Rule of thumb is to stick to the classic dishes and avoid the overly fussy preparations that don't always hit their mark. But the real problem is the waitstaff. At a recent meal we were made to wait for long stretches of time despite the fact that there were only three or four tables occupied in the large dining room. (This was a Monday, but still--I don't think it's too hard to get a table these days.). The drinks all arrived at different times, which made toasting a special occasion awkward and endless. The meals arrived out of order and to the wrong people so that we were left shuffling plates around like we were at a diner. We were never greeted, welcomed to the restaurant, checked on, or asked if we'd like anything else. In the words of one of my dining companions it felt like we were at a Chili's, not a top Manhattan destination. Bottom line: I'd highly recommend the bar and skip the restaurant.",0,1,0,Dana C.,"New York, NY",1,65,62
4.0,7/17/2012,"What pretentiousness? What snobbery? What haughtiness?I needed to book a last second dinner so I hopped on OpenTable, filtered by Midtown East and prayed for a high class restaurant that had prime availability the night of. I saw Monkey Bar. The name definitely rang a bell. My extremely sophisticated friend, Donghao B. had mentioned the place in passing, saying it was an exclusive restaurant with a storied past that commoners like us could sit to stargaze. That inkling of a memory was enough to sway my decision for dinner.When I met my friend for dinner, we entered the bar and it was just that - a bar. It was narrow, bordered by couple booths on the left and the bar on the right. I had no clue where we would sit. Thinking I literally booked a regular bar for dinner, I panicked. I mentioned we had a reservation and I was lead to the back, where I entered the grandiose dining area engulfed in a red hue.  We were seated in a relatively quiet area and started our dinner as I wiped the nervousness from my face. The fried oyster and Berkshire pork with kimchee caught my eye. I'm usually skeptical about Asian fusion dishes, but as esteemed entertainer, Aubrey Drake Graham, would say, YOLO. Seriously, if I could live only once, then I would make sure I had this dish at least five more times. It was a classic play on a Korean dish, but that extra fried oyster just added enough flair to the relatively commonplace combination of pork and kimchee. The buttery fried oyster was crispy to the taste and the pork, of course, was cooked to perfection - the melt in your mouth kind. Don't you just love it when a complex dish clashes texturally yet harmonizes and plays the perfect tune to your taste buds? I sure do.For entrées, we went with the duck and the lamb and they were also presented uniquely.  Each meat was prepared in two ways, i.e. the duck had a duck breast and a duck leg confit. Basically, two cuts of the same.  This presentation definitely made me feel like I got my money's worth and it is rare to receive such great value at a high end restaurant, so for that, I applaud Monkey Bar. However, I couldn't say the duck or the lamb was top of the class, which is why I'm only giving this restaurant a four star.This place is a great for dinner after a busy day at work. It's right in the hustle and bustle of Midtown East and sometimes, as I'm told, you can catch a celebrity or two and I'm sure you don't have to be a TMZ fan to appreciate dining with the stars.",3,2,3,Larry L.,"New York, NY",357,187,103

The dinning room has a warm, comfortable feel to it. Our server was Yarrow and she was spectacular. We had some strong personalities in our group and she handled us perfectly. They have a nice wine list in which you can find pretty much anything you want.  I can vouch for the chopped salad as a starter. It was very flavorful (and healthy!). As for mains, My wife and I split the beef sirloin, halibut and we also tasted some potato gnocchi. They all tasted very good and had a good presentation. Each were cooked properly as well. We also ordered the roasted mushrooms and french fries as sides. Again-Very good.  I was worried about the food after reading some past reviews but our experience was excellent. We ordered some sort of salted chocolate cake/ice cream for dessert.

A special cake was brought for the bday celebraish and the host said either we could eat the cake afterward or be charged a crazy per plate cake fee, great. Maybe this is commonplace for Ny bdays but this seemed a bit ridiculous to me. Our meal was rushed and the food was mediocre, the bar scene loooked ok but as far as the dining room goes I would advise against simply on this poor and rude service especially for a bday dinner!",1,0,0,JD D.,"Manhattan, NY",2,38,1

Day.It will make you hate your favorite restaurant, let alone one you don't know.OK.Saturday night, 8 pm reservation, seated immediately in a booth. First time here.Food menu had a good selection, typical ""New American"" without any oddballs or Asian Fusion. Cocktail menu looked terrific. Over the course of the meal, I had the Monkey Gland (unique and delicious), and the Pep Talk (good, but settles, so bitter at the end). We did not have wine, and so can't comment on the wine service.Speaking of service, the timing of the kitchen was okay ... the appetizers took a while, and when my oysters came out, I wasn't told which oysters were which - a peeve of mine. But the waiter came by shortly after, and after noting that the oysters were plated randomly, could point out which oysters were which on sight. That sounds unimpressive, but if you saw the oysters, you'd be impressed, too.Another note about unusual staff knowledge - when my lamb came out (perfectly cooked), I quickly asked the plate runner where on my plate the stinging nettles were (always wanted to try those!) He was able to describe to me how they were prepared and plated, as if he were our waiter. Nice touch.Food was delicious, though the mushrooms that came with my rack of lamb were oversalted. Wife's chicken was quite good, with a nice broth. Dessert was very nice, especially my wife's rhubarb parfait.Decor is classic - the murals in the bar area are original, which is authenticity that is hard to find these days. That's a short summary, but it's the decor that really sets this place apart.The pricing knocks my rating down a star, and almost two stars. Ouch.

This is also a review about how women are always right.The dining room is stunningly gorgeous.  It is both whimsical and something out of a dream I once had when I was six. I loved it.That, I believe, is where the compliments end.  The menu they set up for Valentine's day was insipid to say the least.  The courses were sad, bordering on pathetic.They had a salad, some poached oysters, and a soup to start.  As a mid course, they offered salmon with lentils, lobster, and a little pasta.  For mains, they offered a steak, a pork chop and a duck breast, and for dessert they offered donuts and a souffle.It sounds scrumptious.  Rest assured, it was not.  Everything was either underwhelming at best, or served lukewarm at worst.  Mala was served the salmon twice.  She insisted she had ordered duck as a main, and the mistake was corrected after we had finished our main dishes.  Which were served to us in miniscule portions.  Keep in mind I like small perfect portions.  These were small, almost cold pieces of meat.  I think our cats would have liked them...I did not.  The best part of the meal was the desserts, but by then it was too late to salvage the wreck of an opinion I had formulated of the 'famous' Monkey Bar.  I may have been right about it being a very off night.  There was a couple behind Chris who broke up, rather passionately-not with each other- but with the restaurant that night. It was, unfortunately, seemingly permanent.

2.0,11/30/2011,"I should start off by giving credit where it's due. The clubby, historically-rich ambiance at Monkey Bar transports diners to a different era, and in a good way. It's the kind of restaurant you see in classics; a place where Greta Garbo would have lit up a cigarette as Benny Goodman poured out a swing tune. Even better, the menu brims with exotic, brilliantly paired ingredients. The whole place makes you want to fall in love. We visited mid-week. Upon entering, the host and servers were warm and inviting. We had resolved to take our time, so initially it didn't bother us that the service was somewhat inattentive. As time progressed, however, our efforts to order a second round of drinks were stifled by our inability to get the attention of any server, all of whom were concentrated intently on larger parties. Eventually we got the drinks. By this point, quite some time had passed since our arrival so we asked the runner to get our waiter to take our food order. Another twenty minutes ticked by, and our concern turned to frustration. It was only after we flagged down several passing wait staff that we were finally able to order. I opted for sea bass and my date got the lamb. When the food finally showed up after what felt like several more hours, I was encouraged by its thoughtful plating. It could easily have contended for the cover of a foodie magazine. Adornments of celery leaves and razor-thin sourdough crostini suggested the long wait had been worthwhile. As we started eating, however, it quickly became apparent that everything had been sitting out at room tempurature for quite some time. My fish was a solid piece of rubber and I struggled to cut it apart. The accompanying cockles were sandy and exuded a strong fishy taste and odor. The menu had promised guanciale but it was nowhere to be seen. In fairness, perhaps it had been liquefied and therefore accounted for the briny, lukewarm dishwater concoction the fish was soaking in. My companion's Colorado lamb was gamy and overcooked. It was surrounded, purportedly, by ""heirloom"" beans that bore a striking resemblance to garden variety cannellini. Summarily, all of the food we consumed was awful, but we dared not send any of it back for fear that we would end up sitting around for several more hours. Sadly, the food and service at Monkey Bar are no match for the wonderful environment. And even by Manhattan standards, it's not exactly a cheap night out.I will not return until the ineveitable kitchen overhall.",7,0,0,Bradford O.,"Santa Monica, CA",17,30,2
4.0,11/25/2011,"A ""Killer Entrée"" away from 5 starsWhile staying at the Elysee Hotel  a 5pm reservation for the special Thanksgiving set menu for $115 per person = World Class Service.Staying  at the Hotel, all you  have to do is walk down and you are there.  My plan was to eat early and go down to Rockefeller Center to see an event at 7pm. And knowing New Yorkers eat late.  This plan worked out well.  Every dish finished,  was taken away within seconds.  Anytime I looked up, someone would be there asking if I needed anything.  5 stars on Service.The ""Bread""  is great!   If you are from Hawaii ... think,  Bravo's  Garlic Balls , with a little sweetness of Leonard's   Madasadas  , with  a bit of saltyness on top.  Wonderful  combination.  I ate way too much of these. The specialty $17 Monkey Bar martini had a familiar Hawaii flavor to it. Reminded me of  a Li Hi Mui Martini.   So, I Loved it.   Problem was I had two(2).  It was sweet and VERY Strong.  So, strong that when  back in my room (after dinner) I fell asleep and missed the night events at Rockefeller Center LOL.  But, woke up 6 hours later I felt refreshed.  :)   Next,  Winter Chicory Salad, Warm Pears, and  liked the Argan Vinaigrette.  The Duck and Foie Gras Terrine, Stewed Fruits  nice   ...   a very good start.The Entrée is there weakness imho.   My view on this is, if you are a  active yelp-er  going to all the New Hot Trendy  Restaurants with Creative TOP Chefs  there Entrée choices will not blow you away.    look at it this way ...  It's like you are watching  American Idol ,  two performers  singing a old classic   ... * One does a great job, true to the original and sounds just like it  ... * the OTHER will take that classic and makes it there own, creates something completely fresh and contemporary.    I favor this, above the other.  (and is why in Hawaii I am more of a Roy's  and Allen Wong's kind of guy)    ...  The Monkey Bar Entrée  tried  (Dry Aged Sirloin , Salmon)  though good, did not impress.    (could have also ordered Organic Eberly Farm Turkey)Now, the combo of sides that was served family style  was very Good ... Sweet Potato Puree, Oyster and Pork Belly Stuffing, Brussels Sprouts Toasted Walnuts and Bacon,   and my favorite roasted Winter Vegetables.As was the Desserts ...  Seasonal Fruit Crisp Brandy Anglaise,  and a selection of Ice Creams and Sorbets was my fav  ... the mini cheese cake and Pumpkin Pie just ok.IF,   the Entrée  could only wow me  ... this night would be 5 stars  ...  but the Entrée  failed to impress or even attempt something different.   So, as they say on American Idol , how  will you stand out?4 stars  for the restaurant  ...   5 stars for the Expensive Cocktail and  Bread.   And for the great night sleep in one of my fav NYC hotels. :)p.s.  yes it's kinda a Brooks Brothers suit place",1,0,0,Ross H.,"Ewa Beach, HI",175,66,176

After we finished those, my Mom wanted another order of Oysters Rockefeller, but my Dad wanted to try the Lobster Thermidor. However, he was extremely disappointed. First, the lobster was too tough and chewy and second, the dish was covered in too much melted cheese. The restaurant manager was extremely nice though and took the lobster off of our bill and replaced it with an additional order of Clams Casino. My Dad was a very happy camper. We also got a side of steamed asparagus which I dominated--I love asparagus!As if we weren't full enough, we of course got some dessert, the Eton Mess--homemade whipped cream with chopped berries.

I was so excited to try Monkey Bar after finding out that they are one of the only restaurants in the city to serve Lobster Thermidor. My hopes were high and I didn't let the tacky pizza shop tablecloths in the bar area discourage me. The meal started off nice with some of the freshest vegetable crudites that I have had. The dip was a bit on the watery side, but these vegetables were a hit. Then the monkey bread...oh the monkey bread. It was a cross between a donut and a dinner roll and I loved it. It was dense but in that oh so good way. Monkey Bread makes me happy. Now on to the paid courses. We shared the highly recommended oysters rockefeller and I am not a fan. I haven't had it before but I don't think they were supposed to be as watery as they were. The flavor was meh and I barely finished two before letting my friend take the third one. I thought, hey maybe it was just some bad oysters...but then the lobster came. It looked ok, nicely presented in the shell, but after further inspection it seemed dry. In a nutshell it tasted like dry overcooked lobster with some cheese melted on top. Even if it was cheaper I wouldnt have been a fan. What little sauce it had was thin and watery and the flavor overall was just bad. Also, it was obvious that they prepared our two entrees at the same time in one pan, because upon splitting it into our two lobster shells, my friend got stuck with 90% mushrooms and hardly any lobster. Sloppy. At the end of the meal we wanted the peach melba (even though the meal was so disappointing we did want to end with something sweet) and at 830pm we were told they had run out. Ummm, lets just call it what it was and say that they didnt have it at all today. Disappointed we just asked for the check.

I also loved the setup of the main dining room -- the individual round tables makes it feel very private even when the place starts to fill up.Now onto the most important stuff -- the food! The monkey bread they bring out is warm, moist, and just plain delicious. My mom and I shared the fried green tomatoes with feta and the grilled veggies with crispy polenta to start; both were good but the fried tomatoes really stood out.  The birthday boy had steak tartar and thought it was well-executed.  For my main course I went with the chicken paillard, accompanied by a lovely arugula salad with lemon and a side of creamed spinach (a personal fave, and done nicely here).  My husband had the lobster thermidor, and is still drooling over it days later.

3.0,12/17/2010,I went to the Monkey twice in one week! The food was good but needed a little more seasoning for my taste maybe a spice or two.  The tuna and the steak tartare was excellent and the Lobster was delicious! I was treated amazing the first night and the second night not so much due to a waiter who seemed as if he couldn't handle the pressure. But he was kind. Michael the maitre D was Friendly and made sure that you had the best experience in his control.

And we loved him.  He did have favorites like the tartare's and pointed us to the spaghetti and meatballs and the risotto (see below).  We did see film star there and he was sucking the face off of his date.  It was a very NY'ey night in an amazing setting. We had salmon and beef  tartare WOW who needs to go to Nobu after you eat this here. I think my date wanted to order a 2nd round but we had already ordered entrees.  We also had the pasta special which was spaghetti and meatballs.  Again it was fantastic the flavor, the sauce the noodles.   I had the salmon which was probably the best I ever had it was cooked perfectly with a bit of crispiness and I ate every bite.  Shelly who is a vegetarian opted for the risotto I think it had mushrooms and fava beans in it. That had to be the most flavorful of the night and Steven dropped his spoon and said he wanted to come back just for that and or be buried in that risotto. We had desserts too, loved the Banana Split.  I'm going back and I'm going to order the salmon tartare then the risotto (I hope that's a regular dish because it should be, it's so mouth watering good and I won't be sharing ;)",0,0,0,Molly S.,"New York, NY",2,18,0

I waited 15 minutes for a manhattan because the bartender ""Jeremy"" was hitting on a customer. When I got it, AWFUL. The recipe calls for a cherry- not a squirt of grenadine. THAT'S what nearly $20 gets you at this place. When we were seated, the manager Chad came by and started spouting off about his wine knowledge, which frankly seemed to be more based on his French pronunciation than any real knowledge. Not surprisingly, his recommendation fell very short of the goal paring horribly with our Steak & eggs.

What I do love is having dinner in the front bar area. The booths are comfortable, relaxed and well lit. I have eaten at MB a number of times and I have settled into a few favorites. The salmon tartar is really fantastic, one of the best. The fries are great; well salted. A side order of brussel sprouts are very savory. The sea scallops are pretty good; this coming from a serious scallop lover... One night they had an egg white omelet with creme fresh and caviar that was DELICIOUS.

Lobster cocktail with -- would you believe -- green goddess!  Only the chocolate soufflé is missing from the menu, and I bet you can order it special in advance.  The bar is very loud, with people seeming to be in a shouting contest, probably due to the small space and hard walls.The ambiance is definitely conducive to people-watching, and having grown up in Chasen's, I fancied that since we were seated in front -- where you can see who's coming in -- we were favored.  Besides Graydon Carter, who was hiding out from the blowback of his Wednesday Massacre at Vanity Fair, we didn't see anybody we knew, though everybody looked like somebody we should have known, except for the loud and vulgar stockbroker we had the misfortune of being seated next to.  We might have spied Dominick Dunne, if he'd not died just a couple of weeks previously, which is too bad, since I was looking forward to dropping a few names by him.Oh yeah, the food was done flawlessly, the exorbitant Krug (anniversary/birthday) was ice cold, and the service quite cordial and cute.  A close-to $600 dinner for two, which is about par for a top table in NYC or LA.  Consider $200 of that a cover charge.By the way, I notice that some of the poor scores are from a while back.  Carter recently replaced the chef, and even the Times critic says the food has improved.  Maybe a revisit is in order.",2,1,3,John M.,"Vero Beach, FL",0,59,1

3.0,10/13/2009,"Is it true that you can go blind from spanking the monkey?See No EvilEasy on the eyes indeed. Graydon Carter has done a number on this place with soft, indirect lighting, brass railings lining myriad red leather booths, and wall-to-wall murals depicting old New Yorkers of a bygone era. The ambiance is both sultry and comfortable, with the booths affording a modicum of privacy, both real and imagined (lest one forget that Carter is a man about town and rolls deep with celebrities, glitterati and a cadre of hand-selected paparazzi).   Hear No EvilMonkey Bar is billed as Midtown's old school supper club, and while it is open to the public, they still seem to want to play hard to get. The imposition of a cumbersome reservation process (email-only for advance reservations) and an implausibly long recorded phone message left me banging my head against my desk. Despite booking weeks in advance, I was still uncertain whether I had a reservation until the appointed day when I received an email requesting confirmation. Really? Email? If they'd sent me a tweet, I might have been impressed, but my spam folder made quick work of their reservation system. Luckily, it was a Monday night, and Carter and his posse were taking the night off, so we were granted access.Speak No EvilBusiness dinner that it was, I laid down the law with our order: one app and one main course, followed by dessert(s) - a minimum of least eight different plates. The ideal opener: OYSTERS Rockefeller. These mellifluous mollusks did NOT disappoint, and while I may have chosen a different variety of oyster (slightly larger), there was no disputing the kitchen's deft measure of parsley, butter and cheese which decimated the last vestiges of my pathetic diet. Their HAMBURGER was grubulicious. Taking a page from Minetta Tavern's book of bovine wisdom, the Monkey Bar used dry-aged beef, which lent just the right modicum of complexity to the flavor. Topped with a molten slab of Cabot cheddar, the burger exploded with juice when bitten, and there was no shame felt in allowing it to drizzle down my chin. A mini-bucket of crisp, flakey fries distract the pallet momentarily, like a gasp of air before diving back into the meat mélange. You don't consume, you make love to this burger, and your entire countenance will divulge it after the fact with heavy eyelids, rosy cheeks and flecks of cheese and juice lingering on the corners of your mouth.Eat More EvilUnfortunately, the climax of the burger was swift and ended all too soon.  The rest of the meal felt like torpid, indecisive foreplay. Really?  That's IT?!  (Suddenly, I could empathize with housewives everywhere.) Their Scottish salmon tartar was gummy and had the consistency of wet cat food; arugula atop beef carpaccio was harmless, but also mostly flavorless; the skate Grenobloise was grenoblasé - the freshness (or lack thereof) of the fish was barely masked by the oil and capers; Nora's Meatloaf, despite a valiant attempt at a cover up with a tasty mushroom wine sauce, was as interesting as the name suggested, a loaf of meat; and the steak and eggs (a breakfast item on a dinner menu) was mezzo mezzo, with a beautifully poached, light and delicate farm-fresh egg atop a mostly uninteresting and bland cut of sirloin.Dessert was a step back in the right direction, with a sticky TOFFEE PUDDING erasing most of our memories of the other courses (except the hamburger and oysters, of course). Despite misgivings of being overly sweet, the caramel/molasses flavors of toffee were traced marvelously in a pudding that would have made Bill Cosby weep.I'd revisit Monkey Bar just for the ambiance, but only if it were convenient. I never sampled ""the bar"" as it was business, not pleasure that brought me there, and they were in the midst of revamping their bar menu anyways. Still, for the prices you pay in Midtown, there are plenty of more alluring options, and you can't escape Monkey Bar without dropping a cool hundy.Oh well.

4.0,6/25/2009,"I have had a regular weekend table at The Waverly Inn for almost three years now and have enjoyed it thoroughly. It's the best restaurant in NYC. You will not find a better combination of food, service, decor, atmosphere and clientele than The Wave. When I heard that the team of Graydon Carter, Ronald Perelman, Jeff Klein and Jeremy King were revamping the legendary Monkey Bar, I knew this was going to be some place very special. On Wednesday afternoon, I got a phone call from the Office of The Editor at Vanity Fair inviting me to a prime seating for Saturday night. It was quite an honor to be asked but well deserved I must admit. My friend Mala and I had tickets to the theater, so dinner at Monkey Bar would be a great finish to our night. Graydon and his team have given it a chic and classy makeover. The new Monkey Bar is, in a word, glamorous. It is definitely the grander, uptown sister to The Waverly Inn. It evokes memories of the posh Stork Club and El Morocco. Originally opened in 1936, this rejuvenated Midtown supper club is tucked away on the ground floor of the Hotel Elysee. Mr. Carter has preserved the Monkey Bar's famous murals by Charlie Wala, depicting monkeys with human features riding elephants and mixing up daiquiris. But the new boss has added his own artistic touches as well. There's a brand new Edward Sorel mural which, as of this review, is almost completely finished. It is similar to but larger than the one at Mr. Carter's Waverly Inn in Greenwich Village, but with a more uptown cast of characters, including Fred Astaire, Duke Ellington, Mae West, and Babe Ruth. The bar holds 75 patrons and the dining room seats 150. The lobby to the restaurant has a formal reception desk and a spacious coat check room. To add to the exclusivity, all the seatings are pre-assigned. I met Brad, the gracious host, and he greeted us with a welcoming ""We have been expecting you."" There is only one entrance to the restaurant and it is akin to walking down the runway at Fashion Week. You are absolutely on display when you enter Monkey Bar. The restaurant has three tiered seating levels, all of which are lined with beautiful red leather banquettes, mirrored columns and bronze monkey themed lamps. The perimeter along the walls offers the largest banquettes with the best view of the restaurant. If you are seated in any of these you can just about see everyone without turning your head. There are a few columns that might obstruct your view, but not too much so. The lowest level known as ""The Pit"" is just as plush and offers the best view of the entrance staircase. It would also make a great ballroom dance floor for special occasions. The lighting is perfect and everyone glows in soothing amber light. The servers are attired in snow white-vintage style waiter jackets and their professionalism is fine tuned and attentive. My only concern is that the noise level was a bit loud especially considering the restaurant was only about one third full. The acoustics in the room are very strong and I am wary over what it may be like with this place filled. Mr. Carter has replaced Chef Elliott Ketley (Soho House, Le Caprice) with Chef Larry Forgione (An American Place) to helm the kitchen and he puts out some of the best high-end comfort classic dishes I have tasted since..well..John DeLucie's menu at The Waverly Inn. There is a wide range of selections to choose from and all are carefully crafted. Soups include a minted pea and chicken vegetable. The Clams Casino I had were wonderfully juicy and savory. There are numerous choices of salads to sample. Mala enjoyed her herbally light salad of arugula and parmesan. Eggs are featured as well in the forms of a soft boiled duck egg with foie gras and rhubarb eggs with fine herbs. The main entrees are highlighted by a yummy Nora's Meatloaf (named after Nora Ephron) with creamed potatoes and mushroom gravy. The seared diver sea scallops with creamed corn and bacon and sichuan pepper-crusted salmon were perfectly cooked.  You can have your fill of great steaks, veal chops and a spot on Chicken Paillard. The wine list is very thorough and moderately priced. I was impressed to see an offering of a Finger Lakes Riesling; one of my personal favorites. The luxurious and stately bar offers Old School cocktails of which we tossed down a tasty Brandy Alexander and Grasshopper. The dessert menu is getting notoriety for its strawberry shortcake and the luxurious sticky toffee pudding which is a great choice for a guilty, late night treat to share with all. Just like the Waverly Inn, there is of course the ""scene"" factor. On this first visit, we had the honor of meeting and conversing with Chef Tom Colicchio (Craft, BRAVOs TOP CHEF), Chef Joey Campanaro (The Little Owl) and actresses Joan Collins and Elizabeth Hurley. Graydon, my friend, you and your partners have hit another ""home run"". The Monkey Bar will surely become a regular haunt for me.

4.0,4/1/2009,"Well, I went last night - it's open to the public.  The front bar area was a nice space - think dark, secret rendez-vous meeting kinda space.The room has been changed in that instead of the old Monkey Bar which was a little sleeker & more modern, it seems they've made it into a more old school, blue-blood, moneyed kinda space: the wood is still dark, the walls are now painted gold w/these animal scenes (monkeys, of course, zebras, etc) with dark monkey sconce carvings.  (Space seemed smaller to me too.)  The back dining area is layed out as described at eater, and the back area is much brighter than the front.  We sat at the booth in the front bar and a very nice waiter came over and when I asked for a cocktail list, he politely told me, ""there is no cocktail list but they can make anything.""I couldn't resist and I had to reply with a ""really, ANY-thing?""  but I'm boring, I got a prosecco which was $12/glass - which is pretty average for NY in price.When I left, I quizzed the door man (who was very friendly) about the future door policy, to which he replied, ""it's open to everyone.""I looked at him & said, ""EVERY-one?""  (I was doing a lot of repeating last night...huh?)  and he laughed and nodded.The eye candy (as far as extremely handsome men) was abundant last night, if this continues (please-oh-please) I may have to keep going there for a drink or two on a regular basis...We'll see.",1,0,1,K P.,"New York, NY",73,106,3

3.0,9/23/2008,Love the Monkey bar.  Especially if you are just getting off work or meeting friends getting off work.  You know the kind of getting off work vibe I am talking about.  Decor is really nice.   Great place for a date.  It is not loud and does not get overly crowded...at least when ever I was there it was not bad.  I highly recommend the Monkey Bar.,0,0,1,Sean T.,"La Jolla, CA",100,100,9
3.0,7/27/2008,"Bogart used to drink here, really? Well he probably didn't have a cell phone, because there's no reception. I always find that rather annoying, in this day and age? No reception?The drinks were ok, depending on who made them, they were either very strong or very weak. The menu was annoying and I refused to order from it. I'm sorry, $28 for lobster kung pao? Kung pao is never supposed to be more than $5, and should come in a Styrofoam container with fried rice and an egg roll. The meat should be of questionable quality, and the presentation should be lumped together at best. So, yeah. I would perhaps return for drinks, focusing on the bartender that made them well, but I'm still annoyed about the food.",2,1,2,Irene F.,"Pleasantville, NY",687,1833,7
3.0,5/13/2008,We checked out the famous monkey bar  during our stay at Hotel Elysee.  The wall mural with monkey scenes in the bar area was sort of interesting.We also dined in the restaurant for dinner with friends.  Its food was sort of creative Asian fusion style but unfortunately not our type.,0,0,0,Ile F.,"Redwood City, CA",7,292,78
3.0,4/10/2008,Proximity to the place where I earn my living AND the fact that this place has been around for 70 years (an ostensible anomaly among watering holes) - one star.Fulfilled the need for a stiff drink after a not-so-dreadful-but-totally-pointless 4-Hour CLE - one star.Not too crowded and allowed me to decompress with good friends - one star.

3.0,10/8/2007,"The Monkey Bar has steadily evolved over time.  I remember trekking down from Columbia with friends from the b-school and j-school who enjoyed the hip setting with an endearing simian theme.  Scandalous stuff went on here, I was told, but I witnessed nothing beyond the discreet meetings involving a random selection of New Yorkers in the dimly-lit setting of the bar.Fast forward to 2005 and later, during the early evening after-work scene, the restaurant and bar are chock-full of the homogeneous 'midtown monkey' crowd, suited up in Brooks Brothers pinstripes (if you wear Brioni and still go here, shame on you) and carrying briefcases.  They all look uniformly important, but their conversations, while amusing, sound anything but important.  Hence the 'midtown monkey' moniker.                                     Homo Erectus                                   Homo Geneous                       (Random crowd)                              (Midtown monkeys)                                ,~~~.                                                       ~~~.                              /     6 6\                                                   //c   ''_\                              \C   -  _)                                                  \__   |                              )      (                                                        - -----\                                    /          )                       ____ | \                 /           \                           /         \    )                    |____    )               | |     |     \                            ( (      /   \   ) \\//_                       | /           __| |__|__  \                            \ \     \   \__| |_)                                  | briefcase | /                              /  /     /        \ / banana                      |________ |              _____ (_(___)_______________________|___)________I haven't partaken of many of the food items here, except the chopped salad and noodles.  The menu might be termed Pan-Asian at this time, although it had a steakhouse feel to it in the past.  They have some interesting dessert options.  And I fancy the Monkey Bar Banana Split cocktail with sambuca, although it is on 'special order only' now.I give it three stars for the memories.  The bar is generally good for quiet conversation.  But I would not recommend you go here unless you love monkeys more than you love food and drinks.",22,35,29,Srini V.,"Manhattan, NY",467,463,97
3.0,10/2/2007,This bar is practically hidden!  You could walk right pass it without noticing. I went there because the bartender is a friend of my friends. The atmosphere is laid back - allows for conversations. I really liked the bowl of crunchies (a mix of peanuts with various crisp) that they served complimentary.And i highly recommend the mango mojito. I usually hate mojitos but the mango mojito here is deee-licious! and our bartender friend is just the sweetest friendliest bartender there is. Come here if you want to be able to talk with your friends-or the cute bartender.,3,1,3,Vi V.,"New York, NY",16,127,164
3.0,9/26/2007,"I really want to like Monkey Bar.  The decor was wonderful, the lighting pleasantly low, the bar comfortable and inviting.But the bartender was having a hard time.  I heard him complain to a co worker that there should be two bartenders working.  No, if you could figure out how to pour a drink efficiently then you would have no problem.  Searching the bar for certain liquors instead of instictively reaching for them.  Making drinks one at a time instead of lining them up.  Making and carrying drinks to the server station 1 at a time instead of making 2 or 3 then making 1 trip across the bar.  Not putting tools like shakers, strainers, and muddler back in their proper spot so the next time you need it you don't have to search for it.  He had to be the most inefficient bartenders I have ever seen.It was actually kind of painful being a bar owner/manager and watching this poor kid struggle his way through what should have been an easy night.  He was nice enough.  Even offered me a drink on the house when he forgot he was running my credit card and left the card and receipt sitting on register for a good 5 minutes.And I wasn't the only one.  One of the servers had to come behind the bar several times to make her own drinks.  The young ladies sitting next to me sat for at least 10 minutes before he got their order.  He apologized profusely then proceeded to make other drinks before making theirs.5 stars for the ambiance and comfortable setting and for having Flor de Cana rum.  But, a 2 star knock down for having a practically incompetent bartender.",1,0,1,David H.,"Santa Ana, CA",76,139,22
4.0,5/14/2007,"this is the kind of bar that I would describe as very discreet. it's the type of place that, for some reason, you will never bump into anyone you know (even though a hefty portion of the people i know are located within a 5 block radius of the monkey. if you are looking to have an affair, i would pick this place as the meetup spot for your dalliance. not that i can say this from experience, but certainly if i were asked to advise upon a proper location to commence a tryst, the monkey would be the spot. they have pretty good wines by the glass, and by the bottle, though i cannot comment on the price since i have never paid for myself while here.  the apps are good too-- a bit of a creative and fun bar menu. the decor is pretty cute-- there is a mural of various monkeys hanging around, monkeys that are not hearing/seeing/or speaking evil, and eating bananas (who knew!!)risk: one day you might have to pick up the tab herereward: nice calm atmosphere perfect for catching up with an ""old friend""",2,2,1,Lily O.,"New York, NY",277,109,1
