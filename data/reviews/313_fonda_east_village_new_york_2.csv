2.0,4/30/2019,"The place to come for a boozy, party brunch!! I made reservations for 4 at 1:00pm and the place was in full crunch chaos when we arrived. The wait staff operated as if they had never had this type of crowd before and everything from start to finish took forever! I ordered the Frozen Hibiscus Rosalita to drink, which was lovely and very dangerous!  For my entree I ordered the Tamal de Elote (tamal, roasted mushrooms, poblano peppers, queso fresco, salsa verde and cilantro). It lacked an flavor or spice and was an overall let down. If you are coming here for a party then by all means, if not then you can do better.",0,0,0,Kaitlyn K.,"Yorkville, Manhattan, NY",45,90,91
1.0,4/28/2019,Terrible reservation service. I went in last night for my reservation for dinner and was shown bar seating in the front which looked like a TGIF restaurant (bar stools/ lack of ambiance). I asked for dining room seating in the back (regular dinner seating/ better ambiance) since I made a reservation to dine and they came back saying all that was available was what was in front in the bar seating area. They explained all seatings are the same which I could not comprehend if the vibe and actual seats are different. I declined and took my business elsewhere and don't plan on even trying to come back for a bunch of idiots that can't distinguish bar seating from dining room seating!,0,0,0,Alan V.,,0,10,0

1.0,4/10/2019,"Terrible just terrible. I haven't had such an awful experience in a while in Manhattan. Starting from the fact that our drinks took 1 year to come to the fact that they kept on giving away all of our food to the table next to us... and not forgetting that my friend literally expressed he doesn't eat meat at the beginning of the dinner and we get a chorizo queso mid way our meal....We literally had to move around dishes constantly because staff wasn't  capable of figuring out how to fit 3 plates on our table.. let's not forget that we never got our sharing plates for our food..Cherry on top: once we complained about the not so great service to the waitress she chose to ignore us for the rest of the night.. well done.

Starting with the hostess, we had a reservation and she still told us we had to be out by a certain time which just didn't seem right to me...I work in the industry I understand how out-by's work but not when you have a reservation, that's just rude. Then as we are sitting there enjoying our 1.5 hours of unlimited brunch drinks, our server tells us ""last call"" as we still have 20 minutes left...my friend asks him why this is when we have 20 minutes left of our 1.5 hours. He insists this is policy and ""we have to give the table back anyways so we wouldn't have enough time to have another drink"". It was just rude.

4.0,2/6/2019,"This review is for take-out.I ordered at the restaurant on a Monday night and the order was ready within 20 minutes. The restaurant was pretty quiet and empty otherwise. I ordered guacamole to share and the two most popular taquitos dishes.Guacamole: Wow this was great guacamole. When they say it feeds two people, they really mean it. There was a lot of guac, lots of chips, and tons of salsa if you can't decide which one you want to try (not that I'm complaining). Taquitos Carne Asada: Nothing super special about these but they were delicious and filling.Taquitos Al Pastor: I don't usually like fruits in my main dishes but the pineapples added a lot of flavor to these taquitos. Overall pretty satisfied with my experience. The only downside was that they didn't give me any napkins in the bag. The bag was completely sealed so I didn't realize until I was ready to eat. Otherwise, service was good and food was solid.",0,0,0,Elizabeth L.,"New York, NY",19,99,237
4.0,2/6/2019,"I had a wonderful dinner date here where we got a 3-course meal for $42 (each) during restaurant week.The space was very intimate and I loved it, it was dimly lit around the bar and each table had tiny lit candles as a part of the decor which was very cute and romantic. The service was amazing, our waiter was very friendly, very attentive throughout the night and helped to make the food experience even more enjoyable.From the special Restaurant Week menu, we ordered the Flautas Ahogadasas as an appetizer, Arrachera con Rajas (grilled skirt steak plate) and Salmon con Piña as our entrees and both Morenitas and Arroz Con Leche as our desserts.The Flautas Ahogadasas was supposed to be made with chorizo and potato but we were told that they had run out of the chorizo flautas, as a substitute they offered to serve us chicken flautas instead which was no problem in the slightest (Some may have been turned off by this but I thought it was great that they at least offered an alternative filling instead of just saying we had to pick something completely different off the menu). I'm actually glad that we were given chicken flautas, the flautas were outrageously delicious and so was the salsa that came with it - My taste buds were in love (I'm a girl who loves flautas and knows that not all flautas are not created equal).Our entrees were delicious - My salmon was cooked perfectly, crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. The sweet potato mash it was served over and the pineapple sauce had my taste buds singing with joy. The Arrachera con Rajas (Grilled, sliced skirt steak with melted cheese and creamy poblanos) was also delicious - cooked perfectly and the cheese and seasonings complimented the meat perfectly.Now, as someone who isn't big on sweets or desserts, I LOVED the Morenitas which was a warm chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream topped pecan and caramel drizzle. The brownie was warm and extra chocolatey, and the ice cream with its caramel sauce and pecan were a nice added touch.Personally, I wasn't a huge fan of the Arroz con Leche (rice pudding) because it had a very citrusy taste to it, but my friend enjoyed it so the quality of that depends on one's own personal taste, I suppose.I also ordered their signature margarita, the Rosalita, and thought it was great. The bartender certainly was generous with the tequila and the flavor of the hibiscus and the lime blended very well together (I never knew flowers could taste so good).Overall, Fonda is a place I'd recommend for a cute, intimate and delicious date night, especially if your date is into Mexican food but you want to take her/him to something more upscale (So, shout out to my date. 4 stars for him and 4 stars for Fonda restaurant). The service was great, the atmosphere was romantic and the food was delicious - What more could you ask for in a restaurant? *I'm giving the restaurant 4 stars instead of 5 because of the flauta portion size, you're only given 2 flautas and as someone who loves them, I would have preferred 3 at least. And they ran out of chorizo for the flautas which I found a little odd, but it ended up being a win for me personally because I love chicken flautas but a bit of a bummer because I would have loved to try the chorizo and potato originally on the Restaurant Week menu*",0,0,0,Amanda M.,"New York, NY",18,24,30

3.0,11/8/2018,"I went here for a surprise birthday dinner for one of my gfs.Reservation experience: 10/10 Making reservations was very easy. They do ask for your credit card and do a $20 pp if no show or less than 24 hours cancellation. I think that's a bit steep, granted they won't do this charge as long as part of the party shows up. I also had to change my party from 9 to 11 and they were super accommodating. Space: 5/10This place isn't that big. Although they were able to up the dinner guests to 11 as per my request, they basically gave us the back booth which seats 10 comfortably (5 on each side). The 11th person basically had to squeeze into the booth. Food: 7/10We started with 2 Dbl Guac and had more Guac than chips. It was impossible to get a server for more chips. We also had to mix the guac ourselves because it came out very chunky.I ordered the Al Pastor Tacos and they were not my favorite. The Asada Tacos tasted a lot better but it was still okay. I believe the Dinner Chilaquiles were too soggy and my friends weren't crazy about them.Drinks: 7/10I wasn't a fan of my Rosalita but everyone seems pretty content with their drinks. Cost: 5/10I do think the food is overpriced. Granted it is the city and prices are extremely high. They also charged a 20% gratuity. Is that standard now? Hospitality: 4/10I had other big birthday gatherings and I had friendlier service. I won't count this against them but I often had places take off the dessert charge if it was for a birthday. It also didn't help that we didn't get our extra chips for our guac. Overall: 7/10I think this a OK place to go. I wouldn't bring a party bigger than 10 for space reasons.

Now 2 dollars isn't much, but that is on top of the $35 brunch cost already. That means that for $35 you get drinks and a chilaquiles consisting of chips and sauce. That's crazy! Meanwhile, my wife's dish had to have at least eight eggs on it. Now your saying Scott, I checked the menu, and it says it includes eggs. The menu online does include eggs, the menu in the restaurant does not. The menu online is actually quite different for brunch, so factor that in.The quack was made fresh in a goat mortar and pestle. For the ""double"" order it cost $21 bucks and also was not unique.The unlimited brunch included drinks, and they were good, I only had beer, but the other drinks were well received by the group. They were having trouble with the frozen marg machine so can't speak to that. The server called ""last call"" and brought us a round but, not the check. We had to sit and wait for the check for a while after we finished our drinks. Overall my experience was mediocre for the price.",0,0,0,Scott B.,"New York, NY",9,176,234

5.0,7/15/2018,"4.5 stars rounding up to 5!Came here for my birthday brunch with a group of 7 people. We all went bottomless and for some reason, they said for groups of 7+, the price goes up to $40/person, which is more than we expected to pay. Kind of annoying, but we made it worth it. Wish they would've said that that was the case up front. Anywho, we ordered the burrito, omelette, and the chicken torta! Everyone seemed to really enjoy their meals. I feel like when you do bottomless, the food often sucks; however, all of us thought the food here was pretty good. Also, they brought out free rice and black beans to come with our food, which tasted great! Reminded me of cuban food and I would low key go back to brunch here just for the rice and beans. The drinks for brunch were amazing! They had a choice of the signature rosalita margarita, which was a beautiful pink frozen margarita. Super strong and the drink itself was really pretty! I also tried the classic margarita, which was strong and was really good as well. Others got the mimosas, which were good and they refilled them fast and the bloody mary, which my friend thought was too spicy. I loved this place for brunch, because usually, they just have mimosas or champagne, but here they have margz and strong alc! Would totally recommend coming here for bottomless brunch!

And it wasn't even that busy.  This was mostly due to the fact that it took the server 30 minutes to take our order.  But the worst part of our visit, was when a busser BROKE half a dozen glasses on top of us- showering us with water and glass- and nothing was done about it.  My husband was Still soaked when we got home.  They mumbled an apology and we moved ourselves to a new table- and that was it!  I worked in fine dining for years- and this would never fly.  I understand accidents happen- but a manager should have come by to check on us- they should have checked to see if we were cut by the glass and help us dry off.  And at the very least they should have offered us a free round of drinks or an appetizer...if not take care of the whole bill.  And from that point on- the service should have been top notch and fast.  None of this happened.  In a restaurant industry as tough as New York- this place will never last if they don't have basic hospitality.  It's really too bad, because the food was quite good.  But we will not be returning.",0,0,0,Jules C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,11,1
3.0,6/19/2018,"We were craving Mexican food and stumbled upon this on yelp, which had decent reviews. It was a million degrees outside and we had a table inside that was right next to the large open window. It would've been nice if the air conditioning was stronger. At least it was happy hour all night (Monday's)! We started off with drinks - my friends both had the white sangria ($7 HH) that was super good and you couldn't taste the alcohol. I tried the frozen rosalita ($8 HH), their house special margarita and I'm not sure why everyone raves about how good it is. It was purely tequila and I couldn't taste the hibiscus, the drink just stained everything it touched.We started off with one order of guacamole and it was amazing! It was meant for two people so it was devoured pretty quick when we got it with our drinks. The guacamole came with chips and tortillas (super weird because I have never seen that before). We ordered 3 types of taquitos that comes with three each: carne asada, al pastor and campechano. I honestly thought they were all very good! My favorite was al pastor - the pineapple complements the marinated pork very well. We also ordered a mushroom quesadilla - I was honestly confused because it came out looking like tacos and was not impressed. My friend also wanted to try the sopes - also not recommended. The service wasn't terrible but not great. One of my friends water cup had some weird red substance on the rim of it, looked like one of their sauces and it took someone a long time to swap it out for a new cup. Our water was refilled once and it was when our cups were empty. The bus boy brought us our other food and didn't even think about taking away the empty guacamole bowl that was taking up space on the table. Also, the waiter commented that we ordered a lot of food - they were all small dishes.... guess we proved him wrong because we finished everything except the sopes. Will I be back?

So basically if you don't take a reservation, you aren't in.Next time I made a reservation at 2PM on Sunday for brunch when the restaurant was half empty. I walked in around 2:07PM and apologized for being a bit late. The guy gave me a weird look and tried to find my reservation and he basically said he can't see a reservation with my name. I showed him my OpenTable reservation page, and he said ""Are you sure your name might be something else?"" I use Opentable a ton of times, and how can I not know if my name was something else there? Then he seemed to argue that he doesn't see my name, and I made it a point that I did make a reservation. Then he goes down the list and he apparently checked in a party of 3 with my name?

I suggest the Rosalita which is a hibiscus infused margarita which come frozen or on the rocks.Food is well presented, creatively prepared, and there are a  couple of vegetarian options as well. Given the price I was a bit underwhelmed by some dishes as they didnt really wow me with their flavors. I would say though that all in all its a nice place for drinks and dinner.",0,0,0,Yoni D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",88,26,8
2.0,2/21/2018,"Cockroaches. Cockroaches everywhere. Now don't get me wrong, NYC has cockroaches...pretty much everywhere. But I don't expect restaurants to be infested with them. I first found one behind my friends seat...which I killed because I didn't think it was a huge deal. Then I saw there was a whole cockroach family cuddled in the corner. I kid you not, an entire lower east side familia with their kids and their nannies and their nanny friends with their kids. Everyone was so apologetically nice and gladly moved us to a new table while the busser smashed their little legs and dreams to smithereens. With a complementary gauc on our table, we tried to start anew. In the brighter light we were horrified to see cockroaches crawling on the table, on the wall, and waving hello from the lights. It was at this point that we realized why the restaurant had recently taken a hiatus. Now I could have stuck it out but my friend looked like she could've fainted so we downed our drinks, paid our bill, and bid adieu to the city of insects.Drinks were really good.Service: 5/5Food: 1/5Atmosphere: 1/5",3,2,0,Alex W.,"New York, NY",7,41,0

Many of the things we wanted to try from their original menu was offered for the restaurant week menu which was pleasantly convenient. Their tequila menu is superb! Drinks were really appealing and tasty. They know what they're doing. They offer so many different kinds that this may be an ideal spot to come and sharpen your tequila knowledge. The ambience was so chill and welcoming. The staff was very attentive and respectful. Now for the food!We started off with fresh guacamole with tortas and chips. There was enough for the 3 of us although I wish we had more tortas hehe. Next came our main dishes. I had the Enchiladas  Vegetarianas. I would order again, although I'd prob ask for some extra sauce with maybe more of a kick on the side. The sauce is not overpowering either 8/10 overall rate. We had a side of maduros (sweet plantains) which went extremely well with my meal. My friend had the Flautas de Pollo which looked amazing!!! Unfortunately they were a bit cold but that didn't stop her from digging in. We had a bowl of beans and rice to share. Finally, we finished off with the super delicious bread pudding!

Also, Happy hour is only at the bar and they won't let you take drinks back to your table... So not only are you spending more when you sit down and order a full meal but you're also paying twice as much for drinks as the people at the bar.

We split a Huevos Rancheros for $15 and a Guac for $13. The huevos were cool, kinda small.. it was literally one egg and hella sides of beans and rice. Uhhh I honestly wouldn't get it again. The guac was actually reallyyyy good but I'm not gonna come back and pay $13 for it. Ok to give some context I was running late for a flight so maybe I was just stressed.

4.0,1/23/2018,"Booked a reservation on Saturday at 1:00 PM. It wasn't too crowded and the decor of the restaurant was very aesthetic.  We came for the bottomless brunch where you can choose one breakfast dish out of 10 selections and have unlimited drinks of Mimosas, Margaritas, Bloody Mary, Beer, and Frozen Hibiscus Rosalita for $35.00. The price may be a bit steep but if you can drink enough it would be worth it.For the appetizer, we got the guacamole with tortillas, chips, and salsa. You could definitely taste the freshness of the guacamole but it was a missing a kick so it should have been spicier or more acidic. For the entree I chose the Huevos Rancheros, which are eggs with black beans covered with salsa ranchera, topped with crumbled chorizo, queso fresco and crema. The presentation is a work of art, however the portion is pretty small for the price. The rancheros were good though, the salsa ranchera was definitely the highlight of the dish. I think the most filling dish was the Burrito Texano which was huge and delicious.As for drinks, the margaritas were strong but delicious. You can definitely tell they were handmade instead from syrup. The mimosas had a good balance of champagne and orange juice and were good. The frozen rose hibiscus was sweet and hard to drink because you can get a brain freeze. It didn't lack in liquor however. After 6 drinks, everyone was pretty tipsy. We didn't get to try to Bloody Mary or beer however.Overall,  it's a great bunch place for drinks Taste: 3/5 for food and 5/5 for alcohol-Recommend getting Burrito Texano for food and Margaritas/Mimosas for drinksService: 5/5Bang For Buck: 3/5-A little pricey for a $35 Bottomless brunch, if some of the appetizers were endless it would have been more worth it.",1,0,0,Daniel D.,"Burke, VA",495,48,118

We ordered a double portion right away and were served fresh made corn tortillas with fresh chips, we were in heaven! Our waiter was extremely funny and friendly, telling us how everything is made in house, ingredients are shipped in and all sauces are prepared fresh daily. The menu is very authentic and has a twist on all items, not a classic Mexican restaurant, which I really liked. We ordered mole chicken enchiladas, esquites and short ribs.

Among our group we ordered 6 different dishes and each of them were satisfactory. The beans, rice, and tortillas sides were a good bonus. We ordered guac to share, and they really bring the heat if you ask for it. The portions were standard, nothing too big or small. If you want something bigger though to get your bang for buck, order the burrito. The alcohol was also delicious and strong, like others say. The problem was that our group had to flag down the waitress often in the beginning when our glasses were empty. They said that they only had 2 bartenders for the restaurant so mixed drinks come out slower than the mimosas. The bloody mary was strongest if you're looking to get boozy fast.

3.0,11/16/2017,"Came here from Brunch with my gf and we learned the hard way the dangers of unlimited drinks at brunch (lol). Honestly though it wasn't our fault. We had reservations and once we were seated our 2hr ""bottomless time"" starts. Issue was that the first few drinks we ordered were very light so we kept going, then BAMB the last drinks was very strong and thus we were screwed when we got hit with the cumulative dose. My friend sent back the bloody mary (I didn't try it) because it did not taste good-tasted like salsa sauce or it was too thick.The Mimosa was very very light, Margarita (plain) was decent. The Frozen Hibiscus has to be my fave. Our first serving for the Hibiscus was light and when we ordered it again it was way stronger.We had the guacamole which was okay. Not as great as I would have expected. For our meal we both got the Chilaquiles Rojos (1 chicken, 1beef)..it was def interesting as I never had this before but my friend recommended it. It was okay, not sure I would order it again. Personally I didn't like the  combination.

Unfortunately, only Frozen Hibiscus Rosalitas was okay. Margarita was overwhelmed by the excessive alcohol. Bloody Mary tasted disgusting...like over salted salsa. Mimosa was made of very low-quality sparkling wine. The only thing that impressed me was the roasted tomato sauce in Huevos con Nopales. It was just spicy enough to open the morning appetizer. I have a very high spicy tolerance, so I was impressed when I could actually feel the spicy chili. But the poached eggs were very overcooked. The yolk was close to that in a hard boiled egg. Guacamole - mediocre. The tortilla and chips were in good quality, but it's common in any good Mexican restaurant. French toast - too soft.

Very frustrating and unprofessional. We should have taken this as a sign but decided to go anyway. The guac was $13, incredibly pricey and we almost didn't get it but really wanted it so decided to order if figuring it would be a large portion given the high price. However, it was so small. There was barely any guac. Though I rarely complain at restaurants, this was ridiculous. We told the waitress and she just said it was a deep bowl and there was nothing they could do about it. That there were two avocados in there. I am a devourer of avocados, so I know exactly the quantity of two avocados and this was NOT two avocados.

3.0,10/7/2017,"Just wanted to start by saying I rarely rate poorly based on service/atmosphere, unless it's something big. The service here overall was good, and our server Brenda was very kind and attentive. We also didn't sample any of the booze, so take that into account as well.I'm from California, and my best friend's mother would make us chilaquiles for breakfast whenever I slept over. I dream about those tortillas. And while I never expected anything close to the homemade goodness of a Mexican mama's cooking, the food we had was pretty disappointing. I've scoured all of Boston and only managed to find something closer to spicy arepas, so I did my research before we arrived in NY. We started with the zarape de pato, braised duck in a habañero tomato sauce on a soft corn tortilla. The duck was juicy but the sauce missed the mark- there was a mealy sort of taste we couldn't place, and it lacked any acidity/brightness. Still decent, overall. My boyfriend had the enchiladas suizas, which ended up being the best of the three dishes we tried. Actually, they were a little dry for enchiladas, and the amount of chicken in them called for more sauce. However, the flavors were all there, and I was happy to help him finish them.The worst thing, unfortunately, was what brought us to Fonda: the chilaquiles. I was disappointed to see they just used tortilla chips like a lot of places do, and when I dug into my dish my fears were confirmed. The whole bowl had already turned practically to mush by the time it made it to my table, and even the pieces that were on the top and edges were very soggy. My initial excitement at discovering half an avocado on top of my portion turned to dismay when only the very outer bits were even ripe enough for consumption. All the pictures I saw of the dish with the optional skirt steak upgrade ($5) depicted with the steak sliced on the side, but mine was chopped up in the sauce underneath the tortillas (of which there was entirely too much. No wonder they were so soggy). The sauce here too was lacking- savory in a good way, but otherwise short on flavor. The bill seemed a little high upon first glance until we noticed that our cokes were 4.95 APIECE. I love Mexican coke, it's made with real sugar. But for a twenty ounce bottle of soda? What a rip off.

5.0,9/19/2017,"Really tasty Mexican food for brunch, lunch and dinner. I've been to this location multiple times over the years and they consistently deliver. For brunch (I mean BOTTOMLESS brunch) I usually get huevos rancheros. It is always popping during this but thankfully you can make reservations. I recommend that you do. It is a good vibe, tasty eats and top notch NYC daytime drinking. For brunch cocktails, I prefer the mimosa/bloody mary over the rosalita because the latter is a bit sweet for my taste and frozen, which slows down your drinking. And this is important because they have a rule that you cannot order another drink until you have finished your last. So rather than get a brain freeze and miss out on precious liquor I usually stick to my trusty savoury and unfrozen beverages. P.S. I swear I'm not an alcoholic, I'm just strategic ;-)For dinner I usually get vegetarian enchiladas. They are de-lish. They provide complimentary rice and black beans that are oh so good. One day I'll come in and just order those and then get also get my freebie one, and then I'll die of a Mexican induced food-gasmic happiness. In the meantime I gorge on these and try to save some enchiladas as leftovers so I can enjoy them the next day. The guac is also excellent, there is just never enough of it. Avocado addicts of the world unite!For dinner cocktails I'll go with a margarita or one of their innovative mezcal or tequila drinks.

1.0,7/3/2017,"I do not recommend anyone to visit this establishment at anytime. Unfortunately, My friends and I had to go through a tough situation where the bartender took sides and provided free shots to the other party. For Miguel to have done this and Jeneane as the manager to have allowed this it is unacceptable. I must say that I felt discriminated against when this occurred and for the workers there to not have fully known the entire story that took place and react this way is unfair. My friend mistakenly dropped a drink at the bar and it spilled on the handbags of our neighbors who hung them under our seats. They quietly reacted to us cursing and In a derogatory manner and no one noticed. For us to have reacted and defend ourselves by telling them it was not on purpose and for them to still be combative and treat us this way it is unacceptable. I will never bring my friends here again. I have been a consistent customer and invited my friend here for the first time. Fonda should treat all guests fair and equal!

When I got there, the hostess with dismissive/rude and made my whole party wait 35+ minutes before seating us, claiming they were ""cleaning"" a table. My party was on time and we were forced to stand in the cramped space near the bar. We asked if we could start off with a drink while we waited and she kept saying ""no."" The waiter who attended my table was fantastic but definitely seemed overwhelmed by the number of tables he was taking care of. Our table was small and cramped in the back of the room and the food was bland and the portions were small.

Guac was in point of course and they serve it with smoky sauce & little tortillas as well as chips. We also had the Mar y Tierra which is basically surf & turf. It was anything but basic as the dish came in this smoky tomato based sauce with skirt stake and jumbo shrimp. We also ordered the chicken tacos but those were kinda dry and a little basic but they came with a green sauce that was awesome.

The guac is a must--comes with hand pressed tortillas and chips. There is nothing too spectacular about the flavor, but it def. leaves you wanting more! It was my first time having flautas, which I admit are taste the same as tacos. Not that impressed, but they was worth the try. The tacos were pretty good, once again nothing too spectacular but they were so flavorful. Even without an entree, my friend and I were super full after sharing the three appetizers. And the bill only came out to be $43, which is awesome! Service was 5/5, well at least our waiter was super attentive and patient.

There were only a couple of open tables, which we were told were for incoming reservations. So, we sat at the bar. We both ordered a margarita. I got the pinata. While good and strong, it tasted like a regular margarita. I couldn't taste the pineapple and orange flavors. My friend got the Rosalita and didn't love it. We started with guacamole. It was a great size and came out with warm chips and homemade authentic tortillas. The guacamole was good, but a little too much spice and I couldn't taste any of the garlic or lime. For my entree I ordered Carnitas de Fonda. Cast iron skillet braised pork shoulder, salsa verde, pickled poblano peppers, charro beans and tortillas to build your own tacos. The pork was outstanding! Tender and so much flavor!And so much food! I brought 2/3 of it home!My friend ordered Pollo Norteno.Boneless achiote marinated chicken tossed with melted Chihuahua cheese. Served in a skillet topped with chiles serranos ""toreados"" and cured red onions, with warm hand pressed tortillas. She loved it! I tasted the chicken and it was great.

3.0,5/12/2017,"Ok, I've visited this location and the Chelsea locations and there are pros and cons to both.At this location you save about $5 on the brunch special ($30 here, $35 in Chelsea) for an entree and 1.5 hours of drinks.  Get the rosalitas, they're super strong (more than 2 and you're going to be buzzed for hours). The vibe here is very different from Chelsea's: on the west side, it's brighter and more open, here it's like you're hitting up the club right from brunch - blaring EDM music and much darker decor. Our group showed up a few minutes late and was very bluntly told that we would still need to leave the table by 1:00 pm (our reservation was for 11:00 and we were there by 11:10).  Ok...They also kept trying to take our plates away when we were still eating (about an hour before our table time was up), and there were plenty of empty tables in the restaurant so I'm not sure what the rush was.  We didn't feel particularly welcome here.  They were good about refilling water but not the bottomless drinks. In contrast, the Chelsea location was amazing about refilling bottomless brunch beverages, and overall more warm and welcoming.  Worth the extra $5 in my opinion.The Torta de Pollo and the Huevos Divorciados are both excellent brunch options at either location.",0,1,1,Sarah B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",202,138,297

I wasn't ready for a bottomless brunch so early (11am) but my boyfriend and I both had a margarita. They make great margaritas but the bottomless also includes your choice of mimosa, hibiscus rosalita, bloody mary, and beer for an hour and half. Since, we weren't doing the regular brunch we got to choose from the regular lunch menu. I opted for chicken tacos with a side of rice and beans while my boyfriend chose huevos rancheros which looked delicious. I loved their rice an beans and ended up splitting the tacos with my boyfriend. He did offer my a bite off his rancheros and it's a great option for brunch. The other times I've been here I only ordered their small plates and ordered their mimosas once more. They're so delicious. We ordered guacamole which they prepare by the bar. I wanted to order the guacamole for brunch but they only had one size which seemed to fit a table of 3 or more. Although, the amount of chips they gave was kind of little, the guacamole was delicious and you should definitely order it. I ordered their taco as a smaller portion it was good since I wasn't that hungry while my boyfriend and friends order the bigger entrees.Make sure to have a reservation if you're going here because it gets very crowded during brunch and the wait can be long but it's worth it for their bottomless.

It's high on lime and flavor though their spicy option didn't stand up to its name.Their red enchilada sauce was the freshest I've ever tasted. The chiles relleno uses the same sauce and was good too. Wouldn't recommend the corn dish on the side.It was surprisingly easy to get a dinner reservation for 9pm on Saturday by calling 30 minutes in advance.It's a bit on the expensive side and the entrées aren't great enough to justify the price.

It is also reasonably priced at $35 for your entree and bottomless mimosas, bloody mary, frozen hibiscus margarita (SO FREAKING STRONG), classic margarita and beer for 1.5 hours. Decor is really pretty and there's bumpin music playing the whole time- can't ask for much for boozy brunch.

3.0,3/22/2017,"I've been to Fonda twice now and would probably come back in the future in a pinch. It's not the type of brunch place you come to when you're looking for good conversation, atmosphere, elegance. It's more like the brunch place you come to when you're expecting to wind up drunk in the middle of the day in ABC City. My first brunch at Fonda I had the AYCD in 1.5 hour deal. I ordered an omelette and got delightfully tipsy. Unfortunately, the omelette was actually sorta terrible but I was drinking bottomless mimosas so my drunken state did not give AF. But still, that bad omelette kept me away for a year... until this past weekend.Every other brunch place (Poco, Root & Bone) had terribly long waits. Fonda sat us immediately. They were bumping EDM and the service was fast paced.I didn't go for the bottomless drinks this time because I couldn't handle being drunk at 2pm on a Saturday. I made up for this by ordering a yummy appetizer off their main menu!I've never met a queso fundido I haven't liked and this was no exception. The queso fundido came with soft corn tortillas. It was bubbling and hot, topped with chunks of bacon. Three of us shared the appetizer and it was GOOOOOD! Cheese meets bacon, genius every time.For my entree I ordered something off the main menu again - steak tacos at the recommendation of our waitress. She didn't steer me wrong! Normally I stay away from steak tacos because the meat is usually tough. Not the case here! That meat was tender and given in generous portions for a taco! It was topped with pineapple, peppers, ""chihuahua cheese"" and a sauce. Three came in my serving and it was amazing! While my first meal at Fonda was marred by a shitty omelette (how can you make an omelette BAD?) my second time at Fonda was yummy and delightful!

2.0,2/27/2017,"I had a reservation for a birthday dinner party of 15 (which eventually ended up turning out to be 12). When I made the reservation a week before the event, the woman who took it - including my credit card information - said I would get a call from the party organizer. I didn't receive one until four days later, two days before the event, in the evening, when I could not answer. The caller left a message about determining a prix fixe menu. When I called back the next day, I was told she was gone for the next weekend, & as a result, there would be no prix fixe menu available. Additionally, my reservation was not on record, despite them having taken down my credit card number. Luckily, they were able to take down my information again & the spot was still free.Upon arriving at the restaurant, the first thing we noticed when we sat down was that it was freezing. They had blocked us off a long table in the very back of the restaurant where the fans blew straight at us. We politely asked them to turn it down a little, but they said the fans turned on automatically whenever the kitchen was hot. (On a busy night, the kitchen will . . . always be hot, so they will always be blowing? Not having a separate cooling system for the kitchen & the restaurant appears to be poor design in general.) We wore our coats the entire time. If you come here, I advise you to ensure you are not seated in the very back of the restaurant for this reason.Wait staff was not as attentive as we would have liked, even towards the end of the evening, when the restaurant had cleared out a bit. Food took a while to arrive, even considering the fact that there were 12 of us. One of my friend's food came out 10 minutes before the others, so we told her to eat it before it got cold. When the food finally did arrive, it was delicious, but certain dishes were so spicy as to be inedible, despite our request for mild spice. Those in my party who were lifelong enjoyers of spicy Mexican food found multiple dishes inedible, which was disappointing, as they were fairly pricy, especially considering the lack of prix fixe offered. My friends kept having to go up & ask for certain items, like more drinks, & finally the check. Total, we spent about 2.5 hours here.I booked this place because of its location & the rave reviews from other people who had had large gatherings here, but my experience was not nearly as wonderful as theirs. Perhaps this restaurant is better for brunch, happy hour, or romantic dinners, but I would not recommend it for large parties. If you do decide to have one here, I advise booking well in advance, locking down a prix fixe menu well before the event, and reconfirming the reservation, even if you have to call them back multiple times to do so.",1,0,2,Jennifer S.,"Brooklyn, NY",155,6,0

My friend had been there before and said their guac and chips are great too, but it's apparently huge so we didn't go for it (next time though...).We both opted for bottomless brunch: $30 for an entree and unlimited beer, mimosa, Bloody Mary, margarita, and/or frozen hibiscus rosalita. Literally how could you go wrong? She got margs, I got rosalitas. They were little but STRONG (and unlimited, so that they were little doesn't really matter).Fonda is a wonderful choice for brunch.

For Dessert, we ordered the banana (good) in addition to the chocolate dessert (basic). Especially for RW, there portions were very generous which made it totally worth it!

5.0,1/31/2017,"Is there anything bad about this place? No, there isn't. You have your answer. Come here, and you won't regret it!I came here this past Saturday for my cousin's gf's birthday brunch with about 16 people at 2:30 pm, and everything from start to finish was phenomenal. As we were waiting for our tables, some staff came around and asked us if we wanted mimosas while we waited, and of course that was a BIG plus!! After we sat down, they immediately ordered our drinks. I started with the frozen hibiscus margarita, and boy was that strong! I've learned from past experience not to drink strong drinks on an empty stomach so I asked our waiter to give me a mimosa instead and stuck with that throughout the rest of the brunch. The rule here is to finish your drink before you get another one, even though it is bottomless. But it's totally understandable. They then gave us 4 bowls of guacamole on the house, and those were delicious. They gave chips and mini corn tortillas with that, and the tortillas made me really happy. They also let us add two types of enchiladas to our brunch menu since many of us were vegetarian, which came with rice and beans on the side. The one with the verde sauce was delicious! Towards the end of our brunch, they started to just hand us our drinks even though we weren't finished with our other ones, and then at the very end, they gave us 25 patron shots (on the house, again).

The sauce that came with it complemented the empanadas really well.For entree, I shared the carnitas de fonda. This was sooooo amazing. The pork shoulder was so tender, juicy, and packed with flavor.

Noise level is at a comfortable level and the ambience is chill. Drinks - I got the hibiscus aqua fresca which was not overly sweet and had a hibiscus, sugar coating on the rim. The coating was sweet and sour - nice balance. The actual aqua fresca had bits of hibiscus soaked hibiscus leaves, which added a nice surprise near the end of my drink. The scallop and shrimp dish which was accompanied by a hazelnut purée was delicious! I wish I remembered the name of the dish. The only desire is if the seafood was properly cooked - some of the pieces were over-cooked and resulted in an overly chewy texture.  Only reason this review doesn't have the fifth star. The rice and beans were surprisingly delicious. Usually, I don't go for these two things at Latin restaurants due to his generic taste, but the beans were extremely creamy and tasty.

This is a STEAL considering they are constantly checking to make sure that your glass is always full and the food portions are generous. The vibe resembles the wildly popular Poco across the street that you 100% won't be able to get into if you haven't made a reservation 3+ weeks in advance, so COME HERE AS AN AWESOME 2ND CHOICE.

I tried the mole enchiladas with chicken special as an entrée, which turned out to be a solid choice.  Several others in my group were fans of the ""Pollo Norteno.""  I stuck with classic margaritas on the rocks with salt for alcohol consumption, while others liked the spicy blood orange margarita.I recommend trying this place if you are in the area with a hankering for Mexican cuisine!",6,1,3,Chris M.,"Manhattan, NY",830,157,161

5.0,5/8/2016,"Why didn't I give Fonda five stars the first time around?! I don't know. I was young, cynical, foolish. Now I know better. So much better! Fonda is everything I said in my previous review and more. The food continues to get better and better. Everything is perfectly balanced and flavors are elevated without feeling like it's taking Mexican food to a pretentious nouveau level that makes you want to duck out and head to your local Taqueria. No, Fonda makes you want to stay and have another Margarita...and another...and another... and that fourth one that you didn't technically order yet but your waitress isn't gonna let you miss out on last call. Because at Fonda service is well-intended and matches the exceptional quality of the food. If you have the pleasure of sitting in Mindi's section during brunch, you are in for a lovely day!As for the food, as always guacamole is a staple. If you think you like spice, test your limits with Fonda's guacamole. I like mine mild because it still comes with a kick. I also enjoy the medium spice guacamole and it tends to satisfy the table with all different spice tolerance. I enjoyed the Huevos Mexicana but I must admit that the one bight I had of my friend's Torta de Pollo had me seriously jealous. It was moan worthy good. Even the tortillas are flavorful! Honestly, I can't think of a place I've ever been where I would eat the tortillas as is, plain as can be, and be totally satisfied. The brunch special is a great deal as it includes unlimited refills of standard brunch drinks. That could be dangerous but with a little planning it's well worth it. Although the Sandia hasn't been put back on the summer drinks menu (and it's very much missed!) the classics still hold down the fort and the new drinks are fun to test out. The classic Margarita is especially well worth it. Never watered down (even during happy hours and specials) and always packs a punch. Fonda never disappoints and with the warm weather coming, more fun brunches will be too.",1,1,1,Kristen M.,"Brooklyn, NY",76,188,103
1.0,5/8/2016,"I went there today because of all the good reviews and regret it. The food is good, but nothing amazing. The Carne Asada con Hungo is probably the best dish out of what we all ordered. The portions are on the small side, and come with no sides (my carne asada was literally just a strip of meat with sauce and veggies) so if you go there hungry you'll probably leave unsatisfied. I was prepared to order a couple of drinks and some flan, but unfortunately the staff came out and cleared our tables, and the waiter brought us our check. It was extrememely rude, especially seeing as there wasn't even a crowd waiting, or any reason to explain the rush. Then they went ahead and gave themselves an 18% tip, which I did not feel was warranted. Will most probably not be going there again.",0,0,0,Raquel R.,"New York, NY",0,1,0
2.0,5/2/2016,"FOR DINNER AND HHWe made reservations for 6:30, was not able to be seated until the whole party was there. (Though I saw that someone got to sit without their whole party being there). Another point being that probably only 3 tables were seated, while all the other tables were empty. I understand that its policy to not be seated until your whole party has arrived. But come onnnn that really only goes for crowded restaurants, and since there is no room to stand or seats for the waiting, you really might as well seat people. HH is also only at the bar $7 drinks and appetizers. Since it was so crowded the waiters got annoyed that we were standing in their way. That isnt the customers fault. Trust me we didn't like manuevering around you either. My party was late, so we hung out at the bar for Hh; had guac, mushroom quesadillas, and this chicken thing. The hostess guy came up to us around 7 and asked if we still wanted to keep our reservation, but we would have to be out by 8pm. (6:30-8 thats kinda short for dinner, it takes time for food to come too). We stayed, but he seemed confused cuz we werent done with our bar food. We had to ask if we could manuever over to a table to finish. He got someone to bring the food to our table. Then we ordered another guac(this time there was a lot more. So there is a difference between HH guac and dinner guac sizes). The food was good, better than mediocre but not amazing enough for me to rave, crave or return for. I recommend the Carne Asada, can never go wrong with that.The pork shoulder was a bit hard, and my friend ate something on the plate that she found gross and had to spit out. Couldn't quite tell what it was since is was dark. We stayed a little over 8pm. We were not asked to leave, probably because there were empty tables. (if you werent booked then why ask us to leave at a certain time, why cant we enjoy a nice dinner with drinks and catchup time without having to be told that we have the table til 8) The only nice person was our waiter.

I sipped about 1/4 to 1/2 of each drink before ordering another one..and passed it on to my husband to finish haha..they were great about bringing me drinks even when I was not finished with mine and making sure we understood when it was last call..We started off with guacamole.... 3 guacs for a table of 15...was actually a lot... and we did not even finish it, but wow was it good! I got the Texas Taco which is actually a burrito and btw I am from TX and our tacos are actually tacos...but I guess they were doing a joke with how everything is bigger in TX.... Ha.  I didn't love my burrito.. I did however love the sauce on top.... I ended up eating more of the sauce with chips and guacs...the burrito just needed more meat it just tasted like it had only eggs in itWe also had a little mishap with a cockroach crawling on the wall and then falling near my husband....he had to kill it with a napkin and throw it away.  The waitstaff and manager came by to apologize and make excuses about the weather and that's why the cockroaches are in their restaurant.  That's gross.Anyways, we got our bill and the whole table really wanted them to comp something because of the cockroach and they were kind enough to comp all 3 of the guacs.....Overall great spot... Maybe other food items will be better...but even a few other people did not eat much of their meals...one person got the tortas, and someone else got chiliques and said it was soggy on the first bite.....Maybe come here for HH instead??",5,1,3,Neha M.,"Garfield, NJ",846,1124,396

I made a reservation via open table and they called to confirm. Although they really do need to work on that phone (it was so hard to hear what was being said and what was lost in translation through all the static). Hostess was friendly (staff was def friendly) and stalled our seating when we told her to - because there is a 1.5 hour all you can drink policy. The brunch drink offerings were strong!

2.0,2/28/2016,"Literally writing this review in between waiting for someone to check on us during the bottomless drink experience which isn't much of an experience. Food was very good, torta de pollo was very flavorful. The Juevos Rancheros was also very tasty as well. They also get props for offering mimosas, Bloody Mary, cervezas, margaritas, and the trademark Hibiscus margarita as part of the 1.5 hour bottomless drink special. It is a nice variety in theory...In theory until we get to service which was my issue with brunch at Fonda. The first half an hour with our male waiter was good with constant refills and attention. The last half hour of the first hour of what is supposed to be an hour and a half was awful. We went twenty minutes with every table around us being tended to while we were virtually ignored. I am not sure if our table being the only table that had actual Latinos had anything to do with it but it started feeling that way. Finally, the waitress came over and told us our time was almost up twenty five minutes before we were scheduled to be done. The waitress even passed by our table to grab the final check to check out her tip at another table while we were left high and dry. As a side note, the servers (waterboys) were on top of their game with cleaning up and water. Maybe they should be the ones taking orders instead.Anyway, great atmosphere, good food, decent drinks except for the Bloody Mary which is pure tomato juice, but really bad service. By the way, finished the review with five minutes left in our bottomless drink special while being given the check fifteen minutes ago, lol. It is a shame because I really wanted to love this spot.

Though the ""hibiscus"" part of the drink doesn't really go beyond the pretty pink color it is a cooler alternative to a regular on the rocks margarita. The happy hour menu is $7. Drinks are 7 bucks and HH food is also 7 bucks. Only at the bar, which can suck if you don't get a seat. The HH food is tapas style, small dishes but super flavorful. I had the beef tostadas, and though the beef was sort of chewy which made it real unsexy to eat (thank goodness I wasn't on a date), it was flavorful and that's something I can appreciate! The best part of all?! The guacamole is also 7 bucks during happy hour which is AMAZING...I'm obsessed with guacamole. In fact, I could probably eat it EVERYDAY. Avocado over everythang!

FYI, your whole party doesn't HAVE to be there at the time of your reservation to be seated, but they SHOULD be. Your unlimited drinks time (1.5 hours) will immediately start when you are seated, so if you have tardy people, their time will also be cut short. When we were seated, our server immediately asked us what drinks we would like. Our brunch was already off to a great start. :) Then he gave us time to look over the menu, but asked if we would like guacamole to start off. The way he asked it kind of implied that it was complimentary, but just as a warning, it's not!! But definitely get the guac, OMGG words can't describe how delicious it is. It serves up to 3 people, maybe 4 tops. There were 3 of us and we devoured 2 orders of it LOL. I think guac for brunch is perfect.. Actually, guac anytime of the day is perfect!! Anyway, we all got the huevos divorciados, which are two sunny side up eggs smothered under two different salsas. Soooo good! This is one of my favorite Mexican brunchy dishes.

Waited about 10-15 minutes in a relatively empty place before we had to ask someone to come over to take our drink and appetizer order.  He seemed very confused when we ordered asking us to repeat ourselves several times. About 15 minutes after that our waitress came over and asked for our drink and food order.  We placed our entree order but there seemed to be a general lack of what was going on as we asked about the rest of the order.  About 5 minutes after that, someone asked if we had a reservation. We let them know of this when we checked in.  We finally received our appetizers.  They were delicious.  We got the ceviche and guacamole.  Both were generous serving sizes and distracted from our still missing drink order for a bit.  Finally we asked a few people and they were able to track down our missing drinks. Drinks were ok, I got the hibiscus margarita and my boyfriend got the mi casa.  Entrees came out and I got the shrimp and scallop dish while my boyfriend got the chile relleno.  My dish was ok but the chile was amazing! Very flavorful and portion size was great. Also, this is a veggie dish!  We continued the process of getting another drink (again took an extremely long amount of time) and finally we asked for our check.  We were a little shocked to find our bill was charged full price for our drinks.  We asked the waitress and she said that cocktails are $9 but margaritas apparently aren't included. Not sure when it was determined that margaritas are no longer considered cocktails.   Would have been nice if this was clarified at some point as I'm sure the two of us weren't the only patrons who were misled by this.Very disappointed as I really wanted to like this place.  Margaritas and guac, how can you go wrong???

I had the Burrito Texano- Texas style breakfast taco; flour tortilla filled with eggs, chihuahua cheese, potatoes and chorizo covered in a creamy tomatillo sauce.My fiancé had the Chilaquiles Rojos- Crispy tortillas tossed in roasted tomato-habanero sauce with your choice of scrambled eggs,shredded chicken, or grilled skirt steak. Both were really delicious and the portions were huge! Chilaquiles definitely being my favorite! Really spicy, which I love. Drinks were also really good. Strong but great, and the amazing staff kept our glass filled the entire time! Great service! Great food! Great drinks! I'm sold!",2,0,1,Don R.,"Brooklyn, NY",67,52,471
4.0,1/13/2016,"definitely fonda of good Mexican food, but don't call me Jane or Peter. seewhatididtheremost people know Fonda bc there are three of these joints: one in the Slope, one in Chelsea, and one in Alphabet City. i am frequent customer of the ABC location.and let's be real most people know FONDA bc of its banging boozy brunch. AYCD (all you can drink) for 1.5 hours + an entree for about $28.50. though FONDA (in Alphabet City) seems to have cut its boozy brunch from 1.5 hours to 1 hour and raised the price to $29.95. definitely call ahead and check this out bc 1 hour of AYCD is just okay not the awesome insober-ing 1.5-2 hours.the boozy brunch is/was bananas. if you do the boozy brunch deal the entree you get is savory and filling...like the huevos rancheros, chiliquiles rojos, burrito texano...the entrees w/o the booze option are about 14-15 on their own so basically your paying about $14 (not including tax and tip) for the unlimited booze option for whatever time limit it is now. if you're doing drunk brunch, definitely get the guacamole, it feed 3-4 people well and comes with chips, tortillas, & some tasty spicy salsa. booze options for the unlimited: rosalitas, margaritas, bloody marys, mimosas, and beer. there used to be more options before. oh well. PRO TIP: boozy brunch on the early or late side...so your drinks get to you quick. if you DRUNCH during primetime hours...the bar is going to be slammed there fore your drinks will be delayed. the bartenders rock here but there are capacity issues when all tables are full. you were warned. Fondas looks small from the outside but the dining room and table set-up stretches way back. the ambience is tastefully festive without going overboard. there is some shine and a nice color palette to the space. it's slightly muted to keep the dining experience in-line with a classy dinner experience as opposed to a loud ( in terms of color) chain restaurant experience. the decor is still very evocative of Mexico without delving into the typical Americanized tropes of Mexican culture etc. in any case, even without reservation for brunch--you should be able to snag a table with a little bit of a wait. the restaurant works well for brunch (small or large groups); casual dates, family dinners, and entertaining out-of-towners downtown. in terms of dinner, this place is solid and delivers on warm comfy eats on coldish nights. not sure i'd hit this place during the high heat of summer bc the fare can be a lil heavy. do try: apps like the GUAC (as i rec'ed above), ceviche, fish tacos. also try entrees like the carnitas fonda (crispy pork yo!), guisado di castillo (short ribs Son!), fish tacos are also served as an entree at a higher price than the appetizer version, & the chiles relleno. not really a fan of the sides or salads at Fonda ehh. apps run between $9-12 and entrees $21-$28. so it is a lil pricy, but the quality of food is top-notch.the service and staff? excellent. fast. friendly. answers q's without upselling. brunch booze service is pretty quick and does not lollygag. the dinner service is awesome. i really like the waiters here. they work hard to make your experience a good one without hovering over you. is this the most authentic Mexican food i've had? nope because i've been to Mexico a lot and i ain't talking about Tijuana. however for NYC it's really good. the flavor and spice notes really hit some of the eats i had in Mexico without introducing weird Americanized ingredients (like kale, and other rando boojee ingredients etc.). that said, Mexican fare and your love of it is largely going to be determined by the region or regions that the chef and kitchen are pulling from like Fonda feels like it's more Mexico City style. idk and i'm no expert. so if you like food from Guadalajara and Oaxaca or elsewhere you may feel this isn't Mexico you know...however if you like food and are not a food critic in the making...you'll enjoy FONDA!drop mic because it's rude to freestyle while eating.i out.zzzz",29,27,28,Ruwan J.,"New York, NY",458,772,32909
4.0,1/12/2016,Brunch at Fonda's was the best. Came in with a group of 6 w/o reservations and was seated promptly--thankfully because the restaurant filled up quickly! We went on New Year's Day. Bottomless drinks was fantastic. They were both delicious and boozy. I ordered the Pan Frances which is the sweeter dish on the Brunch menu however not cloyingly sweet. Banana custard soaked brioche with almond toppings was soooo good. Would definitely return to try more dishes. Our waiter was very friendly.

5.0,1/10/2016,"brunch review: My boyfriend lives on Clinton in the LES and on a Sunday afternoon we were looking around for a brunch spot, after some wandering in winter 60 degree water (no complaints here...) we walked passed Fonda and see how packed it was (good sign) we figured we would give it a try. I was a bit concerned since it was prime brunch time on a lovely Sunday afternoon but we were seated without any problems. Brenda was our waitress and she was Amazing!!! We obviously participated in the brunch special. My boyfriend ordered a bloody mary and steak chilaquilles and I ordered a mimosa and the torta de pollo (chicken sandwich) with no avocado from the brunch menu. We also ordered 3 al pastor tacos as an app ( I cant go to a Mexican spot & not try the tacos!) Our drinks were great! My boyfriend usually prefers a bloody maria (with tequila) but he did a regular bloody mary and he loved it! My mimosa was great, perfect balance between champagne and OJ. Lemme tell you about these tacos-- THESE TACOS WERE ONE OF THE BEST TACOS IVE TRIED IN NYC. the meat was marinated to perfection not to mention the pineapple which always a great addition to any taco. The green salsa which is pretty spicy was greatt! I will definitely go back for these tacos! Our entrees were also great-- the steak on the chilaquilles had a great flavor, as well as the chicken on my sandwich. Service: Brenda made sure to come and refill us right on time. With our entrees we got 1.5 hours of free refill for our drinks. She Was very attentive and made sure we were content with our meal--- service was 10 with Brenda! Atmosphere was perfect for a brunch.

3.0,12/28/2015,Amazing brunch option in the village . Opted for the unlimited drink brunch with one entree and 1.5 hours of unlimited cocktails. The brunch entree options all seemed to be identical . The variety could have been a little more I would have also liked to se some sort of taco option as well.The guacamole and spicy sauce that came with it was quite good . They hand make every order and the ingredients tasted fresh .I ordered the chilaquiles  as my entree and was very impressed with the flavor. I do prefer a little more sauce to chip ratio but it was good none the less. We received a side of rice and beans with our entrees and the rice was very tough and seemed over cooked . The refried black beans were standard. Service was fine we were checked on several times during the course of our meal however it took forever to get of bottomless refills. I would probably come back for hh it's 7 days a week and there were plenty of seats at the bar on the tail end of our 2:15 brunch .,1,0,1,Aaliyah P.,"Philadelphia, PA",310,588,500

(the chase bank around the are was closed). we ordered the huevos divorciados, huevos rancheros, and burrito texano. I had the divorciados dish and it was a bit spicy for me. however the eggs and bacon complimented the two sauces. the drinks did not disappoint. the waiter was kind enough to come to our table and constantly refill our drinks every 10-15mins. we had the hisbiscus rosalita (tequila base drink), margaritas, and mimosas.

I promise you it's probably the best idea you'll have all week, apart from the idea to come here in the first place. The guac is always served with fresh and warm tortillas. The best guacamole I've ever had. For entrees, we decided to share two for the table. We got the chicken tacos and the pollo norteno. Both were extremely delicious. The pollo norteno was served with warm tortillas as well.As for drinks, I didn't order one since I wasn't feeling well. Can't remember what my BF and his cousin ordered, but they definitely liked it.

It was busy, so I would recommend getting a reservation, otherwise you will probably have quite a wait.The brunch includes and option of their 'signature' drink, the rosalita, you can also opt for a classic margarita, bloody mary, mimosa or beer. I like that they have plenty of drink options and it's not only mimosa's. I had both the rosalita and the margaritas. The drinks were strong with is a great plus. Food wise, 3 of the 4 of us opted for the huevos rancheros. I thought it was a delicious dish and the sauce had a nice kick to it. The other person at the table ordered the chiquillies (I probably butchered the spelling of that). She wasn't overly thrilled with her dish, so lesson learned, follow the waitresses suggestions ;)I would have given this place 5 stars, but we had a couple issues with the service.

2.0,10/4/2015,"My friend and I came for brunch on a rainy Saturday and had to wait approximately 20 minutes for a table in this loud, boisterous environment. Come ready to party, because it's that kinda spot. He had the brunch burrito and I had the chicken torta. My sandwich was gross - I bit into a weird gross part of the ""meat"" (maybe a tendon) and I was done eating after that. I only have 1/4 of my sandwich but didn't complain bc I couldn't even find the waitress.The service was soooo slow. A bus boy was bringing around drink refills, which was fun. I understand they don't want to over serve but we barely had three drinks at an ""all you can drink"" brunch before the waitress said our time was up. I asked if we could have one more round, considering there was no warning and I wanted a Bloody Mary and she refused us. My friend tends to over tip, so he left her a $30 tip on a $70 bill which is crazy for two people. She still didn't bring us another round, which was really disappointing.A positive is that the mood here is high energy and fun, for sure.

The drinks were great as usual, but our entrees were highly over salted (both my friend and I seemed to have been served the same batch of the Camarones Adobados)--which you can imagine was disappointing.

This was new to me since in DC there is no limit on time, but I understood since it was a small restaurant. I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was good, but nothing special.

It's great to try out but not so much something I would order again. However, I really enjoyed the Sandia. It's a margarita made with muddled watermelons.

It's one of those places where for $28, you can get an entree and unlimited drinks. Pretty good deal. My problem was that the service was somewhat lacking. They weren't too quick with the drinks, and when you're on a time crunch, it's essential to be quick with the drinks. We started with the guacamole which was good, and I had the chilaquiles with a side of skirt steak.

We were a little late for our reservation, but then waited another 20-25 minutes for a table. We were given complimentary mimosas while we waited. The food is decent, although I'm not a big fan of Mexican style breakfast foods as they usually don't include a lot of meat. My boyfriend ordered his dish with added skirt steak and that was great but an additional $6. Everyone talks about how good the guac is so we ordered that too for an additional $12. Each person in our party paid around $40 with tip so not super cheap for what we were looking for. Drinks came very slowly to the table and they weren't crazy about the idea of us ordering another once we were served, you're supposed to only have one at a time. If you know boozy brunch in NYC, you know the drinks need to be flowing especially with 1.5 hour drinking limit. The Rosalita was strong as hell and it got the job done for sure.

3.0,7/21/2015,"3.5/5 stars for me here.  We were in the mood for mexican and wanted to try a new place in our neighborhood....new to us, not to the neighborhood as Fonda has been here for a few years now. Sadly we have never been and so we headed over to Ave B and 3rd street to try it out. We had a 7pm reservation through open table and walked right in. We were seated in the back, which we asked for, as it was super humid out and we didn't want to be near the door. Within just a few seconds, the waiter pointed out a restaurant week menu, which looked great. We ordered from that, what a great way to experience a few dishes on a menu for a pretty reasonable price for lunch or dinner. Those that don't know about it should look it up in NYC and other cities! Back to the review...It's a dimly lit place but not spooky or romantic, somewhere in the middle but very comfortable. We were served water right away and the waiter asked if we wanted guacamole, which we did. The place smelled fabulous. The guac was served with hand pressed tortillas, chips and pasilla de Oaxaca salsa. The salsa and the hand pressed tortillas were out of this world. The chips, like many, were quite salty. To start, we also had the Flautas de Pollo which are two crispy tortillas filled with shredded chicken, topped with salsa verde, pasilla de Oaxaca salsa, queso fresco and crema. I was not a huge fan of this and stuck with the guac. Finally, we had the Jicama Botana which was a really refreshing salad that included Jicama, cucumber, carrots slices orange wedges with lime juice and chile de arbol. For our main course we both had the same dish....Pollo Norteño. The waiter said it was his favorite dish. It included Boneless achiote marinated chicken tossed with melted Chihuahua cheese. It was served in a skillet topped with chiles serranos ""toreados"" and cured red onions. By the time dessert came around I was stuffed and couldn't eat but my sweetheart had the Tres Leches cake served chantilly cream and fresh berries. She said it was quite delicious. I will be back here and would recommend it to those in the area as well. Until next time...",0,0,0,evan r.,"New York, NY",9,131,7

4.0,7/7/2015,"Copious amounts of alcohol and I have never gotten on that well (sans a few sporadic incidents...), so I'm always happy to find a happy hour in Manhattan that not only offers drink specials, but edibles as well. Fonda was one of the strong contenders for a much-needed catch up with a few friends of mine, so we opted to stop by the East Village location on an early weekday evening. It should be noted that they have three locations throughout Manhattan (Park Slope, Chelsea, East Village) and menus and prices vary between the three; unsurprisingly, Chelsea will take the highest chunk of your wallet.The East Village space is quintessentially Mexican, featuring terra cotta-hued walls, a lengthy bar counter, and plenty of two and four-tops. We were able to take our seats at the bar and as there were only a handful of other guests present, were immediately greeted by the bartender and handed menus. While the dinner menu is quite tempting, we combed our way through the abridged happy hour selections, and opted for drinks and a handful of shared appetizers.First, Fonda serves up a serious margarita, which are available in several varieties; I opted for the Mango, which was just the right amount of sweet and tangy to counter the tequila, and the sips that I had of my friend's Frozen Rosalita (hibiscus, cointreau, lime juice) was just as delicious and refreshing. Although I'm certainly not the best judge, one or two of them is certainly enough to get your night off to a good start.As for the food? Don't skip out on the guacamole, which is creamy, tart, and customizable in spice (low, medium, high). It's not completely blended through, so there are still a few surprising chunks of avocado in there, blended with tomatoes, lime juice, chilies, and cilantro. The portion is quite generous, and the staff is more than happy to refill your basket of chips to make sure you can scoop out the entire base of the bowl.Also worth an order are the Tostadas de Carne, which come three to an order. A sizable tortilla square is topped with habanero-infused shredded beef, black beans, lettuce, onions, and radishes. It's a daunting bite, to be sure, and I'd recommend that diners tackle it first with a fork before biting into it. The flavors are spot-on, with the habanero making a noticeable presence, and the dollop of cream serves as a welcome foil to the savory-spicy components. Just as tasty are the Taquitos San Andres, which are soft-shell tacos generously filled with carnitas and black beans and garnished with aromatic cilantro and onions. The pork shoulder is braised to a commendable tenderness while retaining its flavor, and the additional tomatillo sauce adds dimensions of spice and acidity to each bite. Clearly, our plates were clean by the end of the evening.While I can't speak to Fonda's overall menu, I can vouch for the strength of their happy hour. A casual environment paired with well-priced drinks and small plates certainly encourages guests to enter and linger - and certainly, you'll know where to find me the next weekday I can get out in time...",9,4,8,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827
5.0,6/30/2015,Brunch is probably one of my favorite things to do! Me and my boyfriend came here on a busy Sunday they had no tables available but let us know we could have brunch at the bar we opted to patiently wait and soon enough we had a table we ordered the guac to start it was really good and fresh no complaints there. I ordered the huevos rancheros it was so good the eggs were perfectly cooked nice and runny in the middle no complaints there my boyfriend ordered the huevos divorciado if I could tell you what was in it I would but all I know is that the sauce they use was the bomb.com we had the all you can drink brunch and tried almost all the drinks my favorite was the classic margarita it packed a punch!! The hibiscus margarita seems really popular and it was really good but I'm a salt on the rim type of girl. The only thing that I wasn't too crazy about was that after an hour they asked us to move to the bar and finish our meals there since they had another reservation even though the menu said brunch was 1.5 hours long we didn't have a reservation to begin with so I guess I had to suck it up other then that we shall be back!,0,0,1,Jen R.,"Elmhurst, Queens, NY",2,20,1
5.0,6/27/2015,"Fonda, the Mexican equivalent of the French bistro or the Greek taverna. While it might be a small space, trust that there is bold flavor oozing out of every crevice. First of all, let me just say that it warms my bitchy little heart when the hostess and servers are all so genuinely happy to greet and interact with you. The young lady taking care of my threesome gave us suggestions, explanations, offers to customize certain dishes, never let our drinks dip below the halfway mark before checking in to put another order in at the bar. On POINT!! And you know what else was?? The food, of course.My callos y camarones was perfectly cooked. Silky textured scallops danced with my spicy chorizo and tomato cream sauce. My god! My mouth was on fire and so happy. You may want to order a side of something starchy to compliment the protein fest, since the dish doesn't come with one. Enter platanos fritos and my friend's side of rice that she happily shared from her fish taco plate. My tongue was on sensory overload and the classic mezcal margarita did little to tame the festival happening in there. I decided the perfect remedy was the plate of 3 sorbetes. I devoured the coconut one, but the other two didn't strike my palate. My friends shared a slice of the Coconut Cream cheese cake, which honestly was the lightest version of cheese cake I have ever tasted. Like a coco-pillow to rest your lips on; no wonder it was that evening's desert special.

The happy hour deals were at the bar only but great deal to come and have a drink with a side of their guacamole. The guacamole came in various levels of spicy. I love spice and so we asked for very spicy and boy was it addictive. As for foods, I ordered the skirt steak which was seasoned deliciously. Their was a light sauce that came on top that paired very well. Rice and beans also came as a side to the dish but I just ate my skirt steak as is. The environment was great. I came here for date night but would be fun for girls night as well. The place does get very loud though.

I'm usually extremely harsh with Mexican food places having grown up in Mexico City (MXC) so this review is for me quite special.My first impression when walking in the restaurant was that I had been teleported to a cool bar in colonia Roma (trendy nhood in MXC). Then I looked at the menu and eyes several dishes that you don't usually see in New York. Crema de elote, ensalada de nopal, jícamas, boing juices? Nice, finally someone figured it out. So I've been coming back a few times to try those specific plates, so far with great results.I have yet to come for a full meal such as their renowned brunch or maybe have a dinner date here, which I'll try to do soon.

For the main entrees: Pan Frances (delicious sweet bread - definitely a must try while you're here), Huevos Divorciados (mmm!), Burrito Texano (really, really good), Huevos a la Mexicana.  They were all really good and worth trying; I'm sure everything else on the menu would be great too.  And we all enjoyed the Frozen Hibiscus Rosalita - a delicious, creeper of tequila mixed with a juice slush.

Served in a skillet topped with chiles serranos ""toreados"" and cured red onions, side of charro beans and warm hand press tortillas.  The food had no flavor , I don't know the spices weren't good and on top of that it was 20 bucks . I don't care about the money , I really don't. I care about taste and if is worth it.  My girlfriend had Taco De Pescado which isNorthern style fish taco in a soft corn tortilla with cabbage, smoky salsa, avocado salsa and pickled relish the entree which is 21.00 dollar for fry fish with no effin taste just fried frozen fish to me.  She's half Mexican and she was disgusted.Overall  the food was horrible ..

The usual Triple Trouble group needed to gather for some early May / Cinco de Mayo-esque libations, so we arranged a trip to Fonda. Posted up at the bar, the afternoon sun warmed us as we decided upon drinks. Happy Hour specials are pretty amazing; drinks range from $4 - $7, with all Happy hour bar menu items clocking in at $6! Because of this, we were ample to sample many items amongst the three of us. We opted for a bowl of gaucamole, Taquitos San Andres, and Tostadas de Carne. The gauc was on point, coming with both chips and a side of housemade tiny blue corn tortillas. I could have consumed a few baskets of those! (I LOVE corn tortillas.) The taquitos boasts some succulent carnitas. The tostadas definitely have a kick to them; they aren't joking about the shredded beef being habanero spiked! As far as drinks so, I can vouch for both the mango (which I stole some sips of), and the frozen rosalita, which gave me the perfect post-work buzz. The bartenders were quite personable and awesome as well, though I'm glad they weren't quite persuasive enough to make me get a second drink.

We were all very disappointed with the limited items on the set menu they created for us. They listed around 8 items on the menu for us but they all looked and sounded the same! it's all scramble eggs with tortilla chips, scramble eggs with beans n rice, scramble eggs with veggie..the list goes on.Out of the 8 items listed, only 1 had meat in them and it was a chicken sandwich. and the best part of it all was the price tag. It was $45 per person for a plate of scrambled eggs and whatever they can throw along with it. Needless to say, we were all very disappointed. I guess my suggestion would be to avoid this place for brunch if you have a large group. For the price we paid, we expected more then just scrambled eggs. Now for the drinks, the mimosas were on the weaker end. My lightweight friend didn't even feel the slight buzz after 4 glasses. FOUR GLASSES! However, their margaritas definite packed a punch. It was strong. I guess that's the only reason I gave them an extra star instead of 1!

The tacos were great, the steak was cooked perfectly and the salsa that came with it was tasty. But the duck was just a little tough, and the cream sauce was really bland, none of the habanero comes through. It's not a bad dish, but with all those amazing ingredients I was expecting some ""oomph"".My friend ordered the special and had a similar issue. It was red snapper stuffed with shrimp and other things, with a tomato based sauce, but it just didn't pop despite all those great ingredients. My skirt steak however was the star of the show. It had a sweet corn mushroom sauce and green beans. So great! Nicely cooked steak, fresh mushrooms, crisp green beans, with just a hint of spice. The rice it came with also had to be some of the best Spanish rice I've ever had. Service was awesome, from the busboys who constantly refilled our water, to our engaging waiter. I had ordered the spicy blood orange cocktail, which comes with a whole serrano chile floating in it. Since the seeds are inside the pepper it's really just for show, but somehow my waiter got me to agree to take a nice big bite out of it.

1.0,3/27/2015,"Went for the first time last night and I'll never go back. I have never experienced such a blatant attempt to over charge. Everything was fine until the bill came. We were charged for 5 drinks we never had. When I tried to clarify with the bartender and let him know there was a mistake, he was rude and condescending. Saying no you drank that many drinks. I'm very good at keeping track of those things and consuming 2 drinks over a few hours in no way clouds my mind. I know what we ordered. I think this guy just decided to try and take advantage and see how many drinks he could convince us to pay for. We ended up having to pay the bill because he was completely uncooperative. I was in such disbelief with the situation. Carefully check your bill here.",0,0,0,Aileen C.,"Alphabet City, Manhattan, NY",0,3,1

5.0,3/25/2015,"No complaints and definitely one of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to in the city. Shared the guac in the beginning. Don't worry about getting the 'spicy' version. It's totally mild and if you can wolf down sriracha, you can wolf down this guac. Also ordered the cheese with chorizo as an app to share. This was great and comes paired with tortillas...though the chorizo servings are on the lighter side. For main dishes we ordered an assortment, but I can say that my chicken dish was spot on. The serving size was on the smaller side but it's a heavy dish and will definitely fill you up quickly. Overall if you want a safe and delicious Mexican place to try out, I'd definitely recommend this spot.",1,0,0,Henry Y.,"New York, NY",376,801,1

The moment I walked in I was hit by vibrant colored walls and some cool things hanging from the ceiling. The host was warm and very welcoming. He totally understood that one member of our party was running late, so he invited us to wait at the bar. Our table became available while we wanted and he didn't at all rushed us or hound us. Instead our table stayed free until the last person arrived and we were seated together. Now if you're a regular city bruncher (totally not a word) you know this often never happens.  Let's talk $$$28.50 brunch this includes an entree from the selected brunch menu and bottomless Frozen Hibiscus Rosalita, Classic Margarita, Mimosa, Bloody Mary and House Beer.

We all enjoyed everything we ordered. Absolutely delicious!!!! We ordered guacamole for the table. I kid you not its the best damn guac I've ever eaten. It's made to order FRESH! Served with chips & mini tortilla. Alright so this is what we got...2 Burrito Texano Chilaquiles Rojos - for extra I had it with egg whites & steak. It's usually either or...

When I asked if there was any chance the volume could be lowered they did... For 30min, then it was night club loud all over again. Our waiter (whom was very good and very much on top of his game) was personable and patient with us as I had to ask him to repeat himself multiple times because of the music.We would have stayed for dessert or more food but alas, with the music back at full blast we decided to call it a day.",0,0,0,Jes A.,"Manhattan, NY",16,5,2

Luckily I was able to snag the last 2 barstools, and I'm so glad I did!Happy hour at Fonda (5 to 8pm) offers a selection of bar snacks/small plates for $6 and awesome drink specials as well, ranging from $4 for a beer to $6 for margs. I got the Rosalita ($6), basically a hibiscus frozen marg. It was delicious, strong, and the hibiscus salt around the rim was a nice touch.Since it was Taco Tuesday, Fonda also offered a selection of mini tacos, $5 for 3. We tried the pollo, carne asada and al pastor- the carne asada was definitely the juiciest and our favorite, but the other two were flavorful as well.The real star of happy hour, however, was the guacamole ($6). You get a choice of mild, medium, or hot, and it's made fresh to order in a huge mortar. The guac was a little heavy-handed on the cilantro, but came with both tortilla chips and fresh blue corn tortillas to scoop it up.

5.0,3/1/2015,"My two girlfriends and I decided last minute to have brunch this past Saturday.  Although it was Thursday when we started looking for reservations, we were able to get reservations for 2:15 p.m.  at Fonda.  Brunch at Fonda was overall one of the best brunches I've had in the city.  First, the staff and management are very accommodating and laid back.  We had to wait a little bit for our table to be ready and the manager on duty brought us three mimosas to chill with while we waited.  That's great hospitality.  Once the table was ready, they sat us right away.  The place was packed.  The restaurant was very clean and modern.  We sat right by the front of the restaurant where the large windows are.  It allowed the sunlight to come in, which was really nice since we finally had some sunshine this Saturday.  Our server was phenomenal.  She promptly came by to take our order and when we weren't quite ready, she was patient and said she'd come back.  It seemed she was handling the whole section where we were sitting and we rarely had to wait for anything.  She checked in on us often, made sure our drinks weren't empty and even made suggestions for what my friend should get instead when she sent her food back to the kitchen.  Now, the food.  We had the guacomole to share.  We got the spicy level because all three of us at the table love spicy food.  Being Korean, I have a certain tolerance for spicy.  My friends enjoyed the guac but I think I liked it the best because I thought it was the perfect amount of spiciness.  I had the breakfast burrito covered in spicy cream sauce.  Oh. My. Goodness.  It was out of this world tasty!!!  The sauce made it.  They also give you sides of spanish rice and refried black beans to share.  We really enjoyed our food (minus my friend who didn't love her dish).  We overstayed our 1.5 limit and not once did they rush us to leave.  When the drinks time limit was up, the server politely asked us if we wanted our final round and that it was last call.  We were able to sit and digest a little before we left.  For $28, you get a large amount of food, very stiff drinks (the mimosas tasted more champagne than fake oj, which is always a plus) and awesome service.  This restaurant has it together.  Definitely coming back here for brunch (and even dinner) in the near future.  Can't wait to bring more friends!",0,0,0,Robyn C.,"New York, NY",87,136,36

We felt shame and embarrassment.  What you say is, ""I'm sorry, we are not open yet, well be open in a  half hour, please come back, thanks"".  We are NOT open with an emphasis on NOT and head shaking back and forth like we were naughty little babies.   CHANGE YOUR WEBSITE.  IT SAYS YOU OPEN AT 11am!  OR LOCK YOUR DOOR!!!

4.0,2/25/2015,"So I have apparently been to one too many bars in our fair city:Last week I got my favorite kind of text - ""Hey you want to boozy brunch Sunday"" my response was of course ""I live and die for boozy brunch, name the place (insert a few hundred beer mug and fire emoji's here)"". But here's the catch; both spots that were offered up as suggestions, I had been to....I just didn't remember that I had graced their presence with my ever charming drunken shenanigans. The first choice was La Flaca, which is far and away one of my least favorite brunch spots in town (the brunch beer is flat, food is meh, etc. etc.). Unfortunately I was blinded by brunch eyes (read: an overwhelming feeling of joy pertaining to the prospect of an awesome Sunday, such that nothing else really matters), and did not do my due diligence in scoping the place out beforehand. I waited until no less than the day before we were going to meet up to yelp the place. Bad call. One look at their page, and I remembered the wasted time I had spent sitting there, wishing I was anywhere else. Enter the all too familiar scramble to find a new bruncherie (brunchitorium?) A million places were traded back and forth before one of us had enough, and booked a place; Fonda. Yet another place I had forgotten I'd been too, but this time the realization was one of bliss. I love this place; the happy hour is great, the staff is cool, and the food looked amazing the last time I was here (it was a happy hour visit only, no food). Walking in, we found a packed house of people enjoying one of the finer boozy brunches in town. Through the glass façade a huge party of 12 could be seen reveling in the awesome ambiance Fonda offers up; chic, laid back, boozy fun. We were told that our table would be ready in a few, but that we could hang by the bar, normally this is where brunch begins, in that most places will give you a drink while you wait. Unfortunately Fonda doesn't do this, and we had to pay for a drink (we were waiting on our last bruncher to show up, and were getting thirsty - 100% don't have a drinking problem....cough). That minor shun aside, when we finally got to our table we were greeted with the kind of laid back treatment I've come to love from the best spots in town - No rush, order when you want, drinks keep coming without you asking. The food selections were on the limited side, nine out of the ten items were egg based and if you wanted meat it was almost always an up-charge. Turns out it was worth it though, their shredded chicken I had on top of my crispy tortillas was awesome (ask for a side of hot sauce, its SUPER good here). We all needed a cup of coffee - they brought us a French press full of tasty beans, which I though was a really nice touch. The drink selection was better than at most places; beer, frozen margaritas, and normal margaritas were all included on top of the usual mimosas and Blood Marys. Good stuff. This place is absolutely worth checking out for brunch; the food, drinks, and atmosphere are better than most bottomless places -  just make sure you have a reservation (it gets packed).",29,29,31,Chuck C.,"Brooklyn, NY",629,359,2618

5.0,1/20/2015,"Let me begin by saying I can only review Fonda for their boozy brunch. I have never been to this location for dinner before, it is kind of far for me to travel to for dinner. But the boozy brunch is really exceptional. Lets begin with the fact that they never leave me waiting for a refill with my drink. They do allow you to interchange your cocktail options but usually i stick with the mimosa, but I have also tried the margarita and that was delicious. Aside from the stellar drinks, you can usually get a reservation when you need one. I never have to wait when I go in for my table. Some boozy brunches are very frugal with the refills on the drinks, they should take note of the service at Fonda. I HATE feeling rushed and I have never felt that way here. Okay enough of me making myself sound like a complete alcoholic.... I promise I am just a social drunk ;) kidding.I have had a few different dishes and they were all delicious. The polenta, the huervos ranchero all delicious. We have ordered guacamole before, but be aware it is not included in the brunch pricing.

2.0,1/13/2015,"I would consider myself an avid bruncher - not an obsessive bruncher - but avid. Being into Brunches, I used my friend Google to see the best brunches in NYC under $30. Fonda came up as one of them. The bottomless brunch is $28.50 (give or take 50 cents) + tax + tip. Staff: nice, but didn't seem to pay attention to much. We would finish drinks and they would not come over to check, or get us more drinks. By the end of the brunch I had only had 3 drinks with my brunch.Food: We split Guac (medium) for the table. It was just right - a little bit of spice - not sure if it was worth $12 but we didn't complain. It came with chips and mini 3 inch diameter tortillas. For main meal, I got the Torta de Pollo without the beans. The sandwich had a 4 inch diameter and was pretty good - but nothing to phone home about. The salad that came on the side I could have done without, but it came with the sandwich. The food was good - not impressive though.Atmosphere: The place is pretty small and got really crowded as time went on (we had a 12:30pm reservation and when we got there it was completely empty). When the check came, the waiter charged us for one more bottomless brunch than we got (which was odd because the order they missed, we made a big deal about the free yelp drink offer they were getting).IN CONCLUSION - I think there are other brunch places that are better than this place with better prices as well.

I really enjoyed the food, we had the french toast dish and the huevos divorciados. The green sauce was fantastic and the portions were decent. We ended up ordering the brownie for dessert, it was small but pretty good. Overall it's a bit overpriced but it's a good choice for bottomless brunch with margaritas.My main complaint is that it's very loud during brunch. The music could definitely be quieter but something about the space just makes it feel loud even when people are just talking.

3.0,12/31/2014,"I was excited to come for brunch after seeing the great reviews. However, I personally did not understand why Fonda was so hyped up afterwards. Maybe i'm giving 3 stars because I didn't get the 'all you can drink for 1.5 hours' deal and didn't get loud like the other tables while I was trying to catch up with an old friend. But our waiter wasn't very polite either. Without even introducing himself or welcoming us, he immediately asked if we wanted guac on the table, as if guac was complimentary. The Yelp deal you get if you check-in (free glass of Rosarita) is only free if you get an appetizer, according to our waiter. I don't know if I believe this..he was just so rude. I got the Huevos con Nopales which is basically ""eggs poached in roasted tomato sauce with nopales, topped with queso fresco, cilantro, and crispy pasilla peppers"" according to Fonda's menu...thought I would make it easier for the readers :) I liked the dish because it was different. I never had something like it. The tomato broth was clean and the ingredients were diced up in small sizes so it was easy to eat, no slurrping needed. I probably won't get it again because it did have much substance in the dish. I dont' think a big eater will be full afterwards. I do think it's worth a try if you like to try different things. My friend got the Torta de Pollo, Ancho marinated grilled chicken served in a toasted roll with Chihuahua cheese, black beans, avocado, pickled jalapeno and a mixed green salad. I thought this was cheesier, more filling and tastier than mine.

Skirt steak was cooked well but clearly a subprime cut, difficult to cut and a bit chewy. Three star flavor. Drink service was attentive but not awesome.As I said at the beginning, the service really brings this score down. I was with a party of 7 and as we were getting ready to leave the manager came by and asked us to please leave quicker as a bigger party was arriving. Incredibly unprofessional, incredibly rude! We just spent a significant amount of money on your at-best average food and now your management is encouraging us to leave?

The most recent time, I went for my birthday brunch with a decent amount of people and everything was perfect. 1) The guac is phenomenal and a must-have. They serve it with chips, mini tortillas, and some sort of smokey sauce so you can also eat it as a little guac taco. Why does no one else do this??2) I've eaten both the huevos divociados and the huevos montados. I've never heard of the montados but it was the bomb.com3) The waiter was very attentive with our drinks during the time limit, so we all left feeling REALLY good.

4.0,11/13/2014,"I'm a recovering Austin-ite...the worst thing I can do on a cold, cloudy day is look at Texas real estate listings after a depressing search on street easy for a dog-friendly apartment with a washer dryer for less than a gazillion dollars...or day dream about Torchy's queso or Trudy's Mexican martinis in a city full of Chipotles and below average tacos made with mission flour tortillas. Which is to say there's really been very little Mexican food that I've found so far in the city that really reminds me of the style and quality I had at home in Austin, and if I ever move back to Texas, it will be because I want to stuff my face every day with damn good Mexican food and do my own laundry.Anyway, I went on a date here and had medium expectations. Maybe, just maybe, this would be a Mexican place worth more than one visit? Well, my dear Yelpers, I would say that yes, I would go here again! I would even go so far as to say that I think this is the best guacamole I have had in the city so far. I think what really sets it apart is the simple fact that they ask you how spicy you want it: mild, medium or hot. We had the hot. Finally, a guacamole in the city that isn't bland! Order it! The margaritas were just ok (the quest for a great margarita in NY continues), and the chicken flautas (appetizer) were also just average. I wouldn't get either again. BUT! The enchiladas suizas were so good. Definitely worthy of an Austin Tex-Mex establishment (very Trudy's suiza-esque). The sauce was perfectly creamy and cheesy, the chicken filling was also good. I loved every bite. I feel like every review needs some sort of conclusion (I guess this is a result of a particularly by-the-book high school English teacher), so in conclusion...all you need to know is this discerning Tex-Mex-aholic would eat here again.

4.0,10/21/2014,"My sole purpose in coming here was to get my girlfriend (in town visiting from Austin) a good boozy brunch experience as she's never experienced an AYCD-type brunch, so this review is strictly about our brunch experience.We started off with the guacamole and chips, which the guacamole was pretty tasty! slightly bit on a on the tangy side, but still good nonetheless. They serve it in the big stone mortar, so that gave it a nice presentation.There was a bit of a slow start as we were still waiting for one more person in our group to show up. So I suppose I can't really fault the service being slow during that time. The boozy brunch is $27 for an entree and your choice of frozen hibiscus margs, bloody mary's, classic margs, mimosas and select beers for 1.5 hours.Drinks we tried:-Hibiscus Margaritas - HOLY stiffness, these frozen houdinis are strong! They're good, not too sweet but I couldn't drink these the entire brunch as they're basically frozen slushies.-Bloody Mary - don't do it. they taste really odd, not the savory wholesome bloody mary you would imagine. just don't. -Classic Marg - it is what it's called, classic. You can't really go wrong these, and they were good hereFood:food was meh, as with any AYCD brunch placesI ordered the Huevos Divorciados, which I actually enjoyed. The other girls thought their dishes were just OK. One ordered the breakfast burrito (chorizo is not the crumbly chorizo you're thinking of) which my friend was disappointed about. The other ordered the Chilaquiles Rojos with skirt steak. I tried it and it was okay, nothing to write home about.Service:Service was pretty consistent. Drinks were replaced pretty quickly and by the end of it, we were all pretty drunk ~ success.Atmosphere:It was a fun! Lively but loud, and it progressively got louder.

I think it had more green onions than I would have preferred, but the flavor was good. It also comes with a smokey red sauce that tastes great with the guac and adds some extra heat. I ordered the fish taco. It also is one of the better fish tacos I've tried. Nicely crisp fish, an additional crunch with the tortilla shell and all around great flavor. Didn't really have to add much lime as there was no fishy taste to it. We got the tres leche for dessert. Yum!!! It is my favorite Mexican dessert and they do not disappoint.

It was a festive, spacious place and we were tended to right away.  The group had Tecate and Michelada (was nice and spicy- I made mine with Corona.) We started with a double mild guacamole which was pretty good with housemade small tortillas and chips. Wish they gave us more guac, though. We then went into our mains; I enjoyed my Pollo Norteno which was grilled cubes of succulent chicken, cheese, chipotle sauce, with warm tortillas and sautéed onions. It was a lot of food - $19.  Kind of like fajitas. BF got the chicken enchiladas with the black mole sauce, which looked pretty but he didn't like it the sauce so much, it was kind of a sweet mole.  One from our group wanted the same but couldn't go for it because she's gluten free and the mole had flour in it.  So, she asked to get plain chicken enchiladas with just cheese. Unfortunately they came out with just cheese so they had to remake it.   So points off for that.  The server was very nice about everything, though.Others in our group had some good looking chile relenos (stuffed poblanos with goat cheese, pine nuts, raisins, etc), vegetarian enchiladas, and grilled shrimps and scallops dish (this looked yummy)We had rice and beans for the table. All in all it was a more authentic, cozy version of Rosa Mexicano.  I appreciated the warm hospitality but I think unless you get what I got, some of the dishes could be a miss.  They do have more interesting items on the menu, like a red snapper and a roasted pork shoulder so if I came back I would try some of those.

2.0,6/30/2014,"Boozy brunch anyone?  I've been searching for a new place to try out (not that Cafe Cortadito isn't still my #1) and Fonda came up.  Their brunch options are slightly on the spicy side for me but I just asked for them to take it easy and they obliged as much as possible.  Thanks to plenty of Rosalitas (their hibiscus margaritas) I managed to make it through the spiciness.  The only hiccup was that this place is known for all-you-can-drink rowdy brunch yet some of the patrons were annoyed with us for being loud.  I tend to feel like you should know what you are getting into at a place like this and should avoid the typical Sunday brunch hour if that's not what you are looking for (not to sound like a jerk).  And we kept it contained to our table.  One person sitting at the bar got in my face about not tipping on the bill which was completely untrue per our waiter who said we had left a very generous tip and frankly none of her business in the first place.  Unfortunately, that really tempered my experience and was enough to make me not really want to come back.",1,1,1,Laura H.,"Sydney, Australia",412,394,3
1.0,6/27/2014,"To shorten things as much as possible, I had an awful experience trying to reserve the place for my best friend's birthday. First, I contacted the Park Slope location and spoke to the manager. (I will be leaving out names to try my best not to make this personal.. Though it is.) He had given me some options which sounded amazing. As he explained, they have an event planner who takes care of the rest. I had a week to plan the party and I didn't hear from her for about 5 days. I had called the manager everyday and was ""politely ignored"". 2 days before the party, I had finally met with the event planner at the Ave B location for the final steps of reservation. Let's just say most of her promises the day of my deposit were broken on the day of the party. Extremely disappointing to have other tables served in an area I was promised would be closed off. The worst part of all was that the person upfront who was WELL aware of the surprise party in the back ruined the whole thing. When the birthday girl walked in with her boyfriend, he had asked if they were here for the big party. Needless to say, no more surprise. I had e-mailed the event planner with all my complaints and had asked for a reply if they care for customer satisfaction. Since I never got one, I assumed they don't. I waited a month for a response before writing this review. I think that's more than enough time as a courteous customer. The food was good. Maybe it would have tasted great if I didn't have the bitter taste in my mouth from my experience. Giving this place 1 star is being VERY GENEROUS. There are plenty of restaurants with great food AND great experience. I shall proceed eating at those.",3,1,1,Lelde N.,"Brooklyn, NY",77,102,0

4.0,6/17/2014,"Oh my deliciousness! I had my birthday dinner here recently and have heard nothing but good reviews from friends. I knew it would be good but it surpassed my expectations. As a California native, Mexican food is a sacred, treasured part of life. It isn't a traditional taco/burrito joint that I'm used to hitting up but it's amazing in it's own way. Let's start with the happy hour drinks - great, especially for the price. Get the mango marg or pineapple drink ( I forgot the name). Obviously order the guac as an ""appetizer"". For my entree I ordered the shrimp and scallops, in the life - changing hazelnut chipotle mole. The shrimp and scallops were cooked to perfection... Like buttah! Everyone at the table had to try the sauce. I also tasted the carne asada, pechuga rellena, and camarones adobadas - allFantastic! My dish was my favorite! All meals come with beans, rice, and tortillas for the table. We also ordered the platanos fritos to share. Make sure to order extra! The crema and queso was delightful. Everyone enjoyed their meal and basically licked their plates clean! I became happier with every bite.Service was also exceptional. The servers put up with our large party and gave us a great table in the back with lots of room. The only reason I gave Fonda four stars is because of the desserts. Believe me, it was hard to exclude that last star from the review. The desserts were decent...I just love me some delish tres leches. It was good but not amazing. Surprisingly the dessert that stood out was the pudin de banana. The guava sauce was insanely tasty and quite the twist on the expected ""average"" dessert.We had a memorable experience at Fonda.

3.0,6/15/2014,"Really liked it  Can't say I loved it--Nice selection of Margaritas--I started with the Classic, my wife  got the pineapple with chili sugar--both very good.  Skipped the guac for the queso with chorizo--delicious--and what may be the best corn tortillas I've ever tasted!  I had the camarones adobado and my wife had the  Chiles rellenos.  The shrimp,  cooked just right, were dusted in adobo which was mostly chili and garlic powder, kinda unremarkable but served on a delicious bed of green rice and a black bean mush.   The rellenos were stuffed with nuts and raisins and , not deep fried, and not covered with cheese--which made them much healthier ( and maybe more authentic-I don't know) , but just not as scrumptious.  They were served in a spicy red sauce, that has my mouth watering as I think about it.  There were certainly elements here of an excellent meal, but having had similar ""authentic"" Mexican food at Rosa Mexicano or Dos  Caminos (as opposed to Maryanns DF or Bennys)  It was not as groundbreaking as I hoped for.  I will definitely come back and will try a few more entrees though, and I'm sure I'll get a delicious meal.",1,1,1,Tom B.,"New York, NY",22,20,3
2.0,6/9/2014,Meh. I really used to like this place. I've ordered delivery from here multiple times but tonight will probably be the last. I waited an hour and a half for my food .

For the entree I had the vegetarian enchiladas which were light and clean, the portion size was huge.

When we talked with the manager, he said he would get us on the next table. After 8:15, we decided to leave.

I was a little worried upon arrival because we got seated at a table close to the bathroom and it smelled REALLY bad, but they ended up moving us. Crisis averted. They also had a different Restaurant Week menu than what was on the nycgo website which was kind of sad considering I liked what nycgo had better...We got guac for the table - the guac serves two people and there were five of us but two orders were perfect. It was SO fresh and they even give you soft tortillas as well as chips. For my app I got the chicken flautas and they were HUGE. One had red sauce and the other green - both delicious and spicy just the way I like it! For my entrée I got the pollo norteno - chicken tossed with melted Chihuahua cheese served in a skillet topped with chiles and red onions, side of charro beans and warm tortillas - crazy good! The chicken was spiced fantastically! For dessert I got a brownie topped with ice cream. Would've been better if the brownie was warm, but I could barely finish it because I was so stuffed.

Not sure if this is always the case, but it worked for us and we were happy.  The restaurant is colorful, petite, and clean.Food: -Drinks: $27 for bottomless brunch for 1.5 hours. Entree and choice of frozen Hibiscus Rosalita, Classic Margarita, Mimosa, Bloody Mary, or House Beers. Downside is you can only stick with one beverage the entire time (i.e. you can't order a margarita then get a mimosa). The Hibiscus Rosalita is like a flowery frozen margarita. It was refreshing, not too strong, and just the right amount of sweet. It is rather filling though, so in my 1.5 hours I was able to take in two of them. My friends, on the other hand, indulged in like 10 mimosas - they're crazy. Food: I ordered the Huevos Divorciados (Two sunny side up eggs separated by two sauces, salsa verde and ranchera sauce, served with black beans, crispy bacon, queso fresco and crema). Holy balls, this was one of the most delicious Mexican dishes I've ever had. Not only is it visually appealing, but the ingredients ran well together, nothing was too overwhelming, and that crispy tortilla hit the spot. I was sad it was over when I finished it.Service: Awesome.

3.0,2/2/2014,"Fairly good experience - 3 stars because it was ""really good"" and falls a little short of ""great"" or ""amazing""-Fast service. Maybe too fast? 7:15 reservation on Saturday night. Felt early in the night, we happily got a table for 2 next to the window. We had drinks, an appetizer and entree all by 7:50. While I enjoy quick service things felt rushed (e.g. server frantically slides down appetizer and runs away so I had to shout after him awkwardly for a request) -Food was again, really good, but nothing earth shattering. One of the better Mexican experiences in NYC (I'm an LA native so its tough to find good Mexican in this city). We had the pork tacos to start, chicken enchiladas in mole sauce and the cod special. I'd recommend all of it, but there's nothing itching at me to return for these dishes-Wine selection is on the cheap side. Good if you're looking for $8-9 glass, bad if you're looking for higher quality... Decent date night spot, decent food. Worried about the B health rating. Would recommend if you're in the mood for Mexican food, but wouldn't be a go-to recommendation overall.",1,1,2,Melinda A.,"New York, NY",138,62,22
3.0,1/29/2014,"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and we had a great meal! We asked for the guac spicy and that's exactly how it came out - it was really delicious, but had a little too much cilantro for me. They also brought a hot sauce that was really yummy and flavorful. We then split the Tacos De Pescado and Duck Zarape, which were both incredible. The fish was fried perfectly and not too heavy, with some delicious sauces. The pulled duck was my favorite item of the night; the tomato-haberno salsa was out of this world. For entrees we split the Enchiladas Suizas and the Carne Asada Con Hongos. The chicken enchiladas were good but not as flavorful as they could have been, and the steak was not what I normally think of as carne asada but it was tasty. It was in a mushroom sauce that tasted more Italian than Mexican - there were no Mexican flavors in the dish.

1.0,1/26/2014,"I hadn't been to Fonda since I wrote my last review, and came back with some girlfriends about a week ago. The experience was night and day. I noticed their restaurant health grade was a B when I walked in, but chose not to think too much about it.Big mistake, apparently - as we finished our food, a COCKROACH crawled across the table next to us!!!! They killed it and freaked out and left (obviously!). We had already finished our food, so we just wanted to get out of the restaurant. The manager came over and apologized and asked if he could get us anything else (heck no) but we just asked for the check. At the same time, a couple sat down next to us and could see that people were stirring and whispering around the restaurant. They asked us if something just happened and we reluctantly told them and apologized for ruining their dinner. By the way, the dead cockroach was still on the floor - no one bothered cleaning up the space.The manager brought over our bill and hadn't discounted it or anything as an apology, which he made it sound like he was going to do when he walked up to our table. I brought it to him and told him we weren't happy to pay the whole bill as it wasn't a good experience AND the cockroach was still on the ground. His response to me - ""Well, I'm not happy you're going around telling everyone there was a cockroach."" Seriously... no apology, no understanding, just defensiveness. They clearly don't know what they're doing at Fonda from a managerial or a health perspective. Won't be going back.",8,4,2,Jenna K.,"Manhattan, NY",184,274,69

Most of us ordered the enchiladas (of all varieties) and everyone was happy! The guacamole came in a 10-pound mortar bowl, which must be the reason the servers' arms are so toned (hehe). It was delicious and was served with chips AND homemade mini corn tortillas.The restaurant was lively on a Friday night and got pretty noisy, so don't plan on coming here for a quiet weekend date. But if you are looking for a fun, affordable, and yummy night out, this fits the bill perfectly.",1,1,2,Kirsten S.,"New York, NY",132,335,1
4.0,1/12/2014,"I'll start with a disclaimer - I'm from the Boston area, not Manhattan, so I may not write this review with the appropriate amount of critical perspective. However, since Mexican food has been my favorite cuisine for thirty years and I seek it out throughout the country, I think I have many experiences on which to base my comments.Drinks: My gf had 'their Paloma', which has Mezcal and passion fruit. She found the smokey character of the Mezcal played off the sweet passion fruit very nicely. I had the red sangria which I found had the right amount of dryness, but which my gf found a little sweet.Selection: I am (now) a vegetarian, so  my choices are usually limited by my dietary restriction in a restaurant with a traditional menu. I usually opt for enchiladas or a chile relleno, Fonda offers both. The menu offers a variety of traditional dishes, and some not so. Do not come here for burritos, they are not served. I passed on the guacamole, not because I don't love it, but because it is made with a whole avocado and my gf did not feel up to sharing it.Authenticity: I selected the vegetarian enchiladas and asked that they be topped with the Oaxacan mole. Yeah, I know the mole was *probably* made with chicken stock, but I followed the 'don't ask - don't tell' policy since I *really* wanted to try this mole. I also order a side of esquites. My gf ordered the same, but with salsa verde on the side (she has a super-sensitive tongue and can't eat hot food). The vast majority of the time, in fact, every time except for three times over the past ten years, I find a restaurant's mole to be one-dimensional and usually not very good. This mole at Fonda was excellent. It was complex, rich, dark and spicy. Perfect. I sampled the salsa verde, which was too hot for my gf. It was a very good classic tomatillo salsa. I am not sure about the authenticity of the esquites, but I loved the way the corn dish was prepared.Value: Not inexpensive, but well worth the prices for a good meal. Don't think of Mexican as  'cheap' food, but as a cuisine for which quality sometimes means shelling out a little money. Portions were generous; I finished my food, but did so with some trouble. Dessert would have been an impossibility.Service: My gf and I visited on a Saturday night with no call ahead or reservations. We walked in and were immediately ushered to a table in the rear of the dining room. Since we only passed one open table on the way through the dining room, we felt a little lucky to have been seated so quickly. The waiter was excellent - professional, flexible, knowledgeable and attentive.Ambiance: Dining area is in front of, and behind, the bar which is situated along the middle side of the dining space. Decor not spartan or overdone. Lighting is date-night appropriate but the noise level is a little high. Since I am somewhat hearing impaired, you might actually find the noise to be a bit more than 'a little' high.Overall: Excellent experience, start to finish. Good selection, fresh ingredients and authentic preparation. Great staff. Excellent mole. Did I remember to say that I liked the mole? A lot?",2,0,0,Dan D.,"Auburn, NH",0,21,0

However, as we were finishing up our meal, the table next to us hopped up screaming. We wondered what it was and found out that a COCKROACH has just crawled across their table. If a restaurant can't even manage to keep their main floor clean I don't even want to know what's happening in the kitchen. Such a shame as the meal was so perfect until that point.

5.0,11/27/2013,"Fonda is phenomenal. I came here on a cold and rainy Tuesday night with my girlfriend and left so happy I didn't mind walking the half-mile back to the subway. Our server, Bernard, was great the entire meal. Upon learning that it was our first time there, he immediately suggested chips and guacamole. OBVIOUSLY. I like that the guac came with small fresh tortillas - it allows for you to make guac and chip mini tacos (completely normal activity) and also to scrape the bowl completely so no morsel of guacamole goes uneaten. Anyway, definitely in my top three guacamoles ever. Will be ordering it extra spicy upon my inevitable return. Entrées - I got the pork shoulder and my date got the Pollo Norteno. Both were excellent. The pork was extremely tender, moist, and flavorful along with being spiced very well. The chicken came with a spicy salsa on the side and more small fresh tortillas. Portion size originally looked a bit small but by the end of the meal I was stuffed and I am a bottomless pit, so I was wrong on that count. Well played, Fonda. Checked in on Yelp for a free dessert, which ended up being banana bread pudding. It was definitely good (though not as amazing as the rest of the meal), but it was free and refreshingly sweet after the spicy main courses.

The majority of reviewers are correct. The guacamole is pretty spectacular here. Very tasty. Got the medium spicy but wasn't too spicy. They give you both chips and soft flour tortillas for it. I ordered the pork shoulder for my entree and it was delicious. Very succulent and tender. It mixed well with the black beans that came with it and also the sweet plantains I ordered on the side. Notably, the plantains had cheese on them which gave them an extra oomph. Had a trio of ice cream for dessert that came with peanut brittle sprinklings. Not what I think of when I eat at a Mexican place but it was most welcome here.

Fonda is not like that. You also can get extra spicy salsa on the side to add (although they already ask you how spicy you want it made), and you get fresh tortillas besides to chips to eat it with! I love tiny, delicious tortillas so this a nice touch.I've had the guacamole, the sopes, albondigas, and taquitos. All very good appetizers/happy hour food. I've also been here for dinner and I tried a special, fideo with shrimp. Very spicy, but if you can deal with it it is delicious.

I can't imagine coming here for brunch or whatever other ""all you can drink"" deals they seem to be offering. Brunch + unlimited drinks = 95% probability of stupidity. But, that's probably just me being a crank.Also, the guacamole is especially noteworthy. I get it medium spicy and it's got a kick and is fresh. If guacamole and margaritas were a balanced diet, I would be here every afternoon. Maybe it is, can someone please do a study?",1,2,0,Bradley T.,"Manhattan, NY",1,24,0

Mind you, the whole place is watching the game and various customers are asking to put the volume on.Here's a hint. Authentic Mexican places will play important national games on their tv.

We had relatively earty reservations, so we got a nice table by the window, and started out with the guacamole. It didn't disappoint, and was even pretty filling when using the mini tortillas instead of just chips. The smoky chipotle sauce was a perfect add-on, giving it a kick. We went with a couple different drinks off the specialty menu, and they were each strong enough to give you your money's worth for NYC. As for the food, we got a skirt steak, some pork shoulder, and the uber-cheesy chorizo/cheese appetizer. All three were done to perfection, and it was a big hit with my mom (who seldom ventures into the city from the boonies in NJ).

4.0,7/27/2013,"Birthday dinner. I noticed in the reviews here, that people mentioned something about a yelp check-in and then you get a free dessert. I looked for 20 minutes for where to do this on Fonda's page and even went back now and still can't find it. Where do you click on yelp check-in?!! Anyway, I met my friend here tonight. First, I have to say, this is the loudest restaurant I have ever been in. Well, at least by the bar, which is where they sat us. Perhaps, in the back, it's quieter. It was difficult to hear my friend at all. And then this guy at the bar kept backing into me at the table. If I come here again, I'm definitely not sitting in the front area. The food, however, was spectacular. The duck Zarape, tlacoyo, chile relleno, shrimp and scallops were all delicious, as were the rice and beans. Also, the Tamarind drink was delicious. I told the hostess and waiter that I had tried to find where to ""check-in"" with Yelp  but couldn't find it. They said I could do it there on an i phone, which I don't have. That's annoying. We asked, since it was my birthday, could they honor it anyway. They refused. In fact, they didn't do anything nice at all...no candle, etc. The Tres Leches cake was fine, but not the best I've had. That would be Coppelia's. Our waiter was capable, but had no personality whatsoever and couldn't even wish me a happy birthday. I think he thought I was lying. I wasn't.

More than half of our party had never eaten at Fonda, and before they had a chance to even open the menu, our server came over to take our order. When we said we weren't ready, she said that they had other reservations and that we had to order. She gave us a lot of attitude and made us feel so unwelcome. My husband and I felt embarrassed in front of our guests because the restaurant was our idea and we've spoken so highly of it. The employees kept mentioning that they had other reservations-SO DID WE!!!! Once we ordered, we got our food quickly (even BEFORE our appetizers) and our bill came just as quickly.

4.0,4/30/2013,"The last time I had Mexican food in New York was in the late '90's and I vowed never to do it again.  I'm a Southern California native, after all, and couldn't believe what passed for Mexican food in the Big Apple.  14+ years later, however, a lot has changed.  I was recently in NY for one weekend only, so needless to say, the question of where to go for brunch was one of high importance.  I was hesitant, of course, to waste one of two possible brunches in the big city on a New York version of Mexican food.  I mean, I live in Los Angeles, after all, and am lucky enough to be constantly surrounded by some of the best Mexican food outside of Mexico, with some of the freshest and best ingredients.  But I went along and I'm glad I did.  I guess one of the benefits of globalization is that one can actually get GOOD Mexican food in NY.  (Unfortunately, I'm afraid it has yet to cross the pond to London, though....)Anyway, I have the Huevos con Nopales (Two Eggs poached in roasted tomato sauce with nopales, topped with queso fresco, cilnatro and crispy pasilla peppers) and it was quite unique and very tasty!  Kind of soupy, but it worked, as it was served with some delicious and seemingly-house-made corn tortillas.  Others had the Huevos Rancheros and the Chilaquiles, both of which were (apparently) very good. All in all, the Mexican food seems to have more of a Texas Mexican flavor, as opposed to a California Mexican flavor, which actually ended up being quite refreshing to me. The brunch special is a great one because the $25 price tag includes all you can drink for an hour and a half.  (We managed to go through quite a few drinks in that amount of time.

4.0,4/7/2013,"GREAT brunch! Nothing cures a hangover like unlimited mimosas. For $25 you get a delicious Mexican breakfast entree and all you can drink mimosas/specialty cocktails. I decided for my group that we needed to get the guacamole because it's made fresh in a stone bowl. I think that was the best decision I made that day. The guacamole came out perfectly seasoned. It was accompanied by some chips, warm mini flour tortillas kept warm in a straw basket, and a side of spicy red sauce. I'm drooling just thinking about this guacamole. Maybe the best I've ever had?? Maybe I was too hungover to really know. But that's beside the point. It was the best I've ever had!!! I was in a chilaquiles mood and was glad I got some solids in me. Chilaquiles were good, but not as good as this place I get it at back at home. Decent sauce though! But I'm not too sure I'd order it again. I had some of my friend's Huevos Divorciados and it was good with the bacon AND chorizo! The beans and rice were very flavorful as well.We were lucky enough to top our meal off with a free dessert courtesy of the yelp check-in. We went with the tres leches cake and was not disappointed. It was different than I've had it before since there was citrus zest. But the zest brought a brightness to the dessert that was surprisingly a nice touch. Service blew me away.

It was a sort of green Mexican chowder, with mint, parsley, jalapenos, and seafood which had the taste & texture of ceviche. It was of a light, creamy consistency and had a great balance of subtle seafood flavors with the crisp, spicy greens. The guacamole, fish taco, and arugula salad were similarly well-executed.

4.0,3/31/2013,"Fonda made me feel like I was back in San Antonio at one of my favorite mexican restaurants -- this is the first place I've found in NYC that actually sticks to the Tex-Mex basics and doesn't commercialize guacamole. It should be lumpy with real bits of onions and tomatoes in it, guacamole is no sour cream substitute, it's an art form of its own. And Fonda has that all figured out. After the rant, on to dinner: I had the POLLO NORTEÑO (Boneless achiote marinated chicken tossed with melted chihuahua cheese topped with chiles serranos ""toreados"" and cured red onions, side of charro beans and warm hand press tortillas) Mouth watering, yet? My eyes rested on this option because it sounded like one of my favorites from my favorite San Antonio breakfast/hangover joint, so I decided to give NYC's version a try. HUGE success. The chicken was perfectly seasoned, the serranos were not overly spicy for my tender mouth and the warm tortillas were (excuse the girl in me), like, omg, so freakin' delish.Then we topped it off with the Morenitas for dessert. Do you like chocolate? Do you love cake? Do you love when molten chocolate and cake are combined? Look no further.For drinks I had the Paloma. It is essentially a skinny margarita with grapefruit soda. Smooth, easy down the hatch and extremely refreshing. My fiance had the Rosalita (the signature hibiscus marg) just to try their signature cocktail. It was amazing with a more floral taste than fruity. It's not over sugared, but rather just rolls down your throat with a finish of ""mmmm."" Oh and they have true Mexican beers on draught which is SO rare! Dos Equis, Negro Modelo and Pacifico!The wait to get in wasn't terrible - about 25 minutes on a Saturday at 8pm. The atmosphere is casual and great for catching up with friends, but it is pretty loud.

I have wanted to check out this place for some time so I invited my gfs to come along. For some reason everything we got ( there was 3 of us ) ended being on the spicy side. It started with the guacamole. We asked for it mild but every bite my  mouth was on fire. I like spicy. This was too much. The margarita definitely helped sooth the spice. For our main dishes we got the vegetarian enchilada, the scallop and shrimp dish, and the fonda burger. We all agreed each dish was spicy. I didnt enjoy my food and every else thought it was just ok.

Had a great experience and really hope they stay; I will say that something felt a bit ""off"" or ""missing""...not sure if it had to do with it's ambiance for the location, and the sparse attendance for brunch, or what.  Not usually the kind of spot I think of when I'm all the way over on Avenue B.  Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with everything from the food, the service, the ambiance, the presentation....would definitely be interested in coming back for dinner.    I think they might fare better in a different 'hood, but it's a good option if you are that far east and want a decent meal.

The hibiscus and cucumber margaritas were killer, as was the esquites (corn side dish). The guacamole was very fresh and made excellent. And FINALLY, a place that serves guac with fresh warm tortillas AND chips AND extra chipotle spicy hot sauce on the side, for those that endure extra kick! The mole enchiladas were superb; presentation, taste, authenticity and portion!  To our delight, I didn't even see that beans and rice came with the entrees. Being Mexican, everything could have been a little more spicy, but very tasty for all you gringos. My girl had the chile rellenos, muy bien!!  She doesn't really like beans too much, but loved the refried black beans! We sat at the bar and service was quick and the food was served prompt and accurate.On a side note, I've learned from Yelp that anyone who mentions something about a bathroom before the food in their review is an ass and one shouldn't read past there, as it's probably someone lonely loser who thinks by posting about a toilet makes them a great critic on restaurants. This site isn't about bathroom reviews, and if you mention a bathroom in a food review, just like the bathroom, there's just a lot of crap in there (your mouth).Lastly, the only thing I could recommend is a better name than Fonda (spanish for small restaurant), as it's quite roomy with tables all the way to the back.This Mexican approves this message and restaurant!

First - in the interest of full disclosure - we were probably the most obnoxious guests possible on Friday. I dragged 5 guy friends along and we managed to do all of the following: 1) Expand our reservation on the phone an hour in advance2) Show up late with an incomplete party3) Push back our reservation 4) Rush order our food all at once because we had ""somewhere to go"" 5) Take lots of pictures with flash6) Eat the food improperly (i.e. guac tacos.) 7) Eat almost all of our food with our handsI could go on, but you get the picture. Despite these transgressions the waitstaff were incredibly accomodating, so that alone puts Fonda in a good light.

3.0,1/21/2013,"I'm torn on this review.  The good: The food here was excellent.  The guacamole was delicious, very fresh with a wonderful combination of spices.  My main course was the divorced eggs, which are two poached eggs, one with a tomatillo sauce and the other in a mole sauce with queso fresco on top.  I could have eaten four, they were so tasty.The bad:  The service was deplorable.  We were a larger party (eight people), but not overwhelming.  We were seated on time for our 12:30 reservation, and it took the waitress 20 minutes to take our drink order and another 15 minutes to bring it over.  Since we were there for the 90 minute unlimited brunch, we figured that our clock started at 1:05 pm when our first drink was served.  WRONG.  At 2pm, our waitress came over to inform us that our time was up and that we were on our last drink.  When we said something to her that it took us a long time to get our first drink, she was very insistent that we were wrong with the time.  We eventually talked to the manager, who sent us one more round and apologized.  My final take: I'd come back for dinner since the food was good, but not for unlimited brunch if the service is going to be slow and the clock isn't going to be started right.",2,1,1,Megan L.,"Manhattan, NY",18,79,0

The food was all delicious... homemade corn tortillas made me remember the ones I had while studying in Mexico.  The chicken dish was marinated in amazing spices, which made it so moist and delicious.  I usually never order chicken because I think it's boring, but this was amazing.  The atmosphere was warm and pleasant.I am really writing this review also because of the great service we had.  During our main course, I spilled most of my full glass of red wine onto my daughter's dinner.  They ordered another for her, and then when I told them to cancel because my son couldn't finish his dinner which was the same dish, they ended up taking it off our bill.  And they refilled my wine.  This was really above and beyond given that it was completely my fault and not theirs.  And the last thing, I left my scarf on the chair and someone came out and gave it to me.  Clearly, this was not my best night ever, but Fonda was amazing through it all.You should go eat there because I live in Boston and need to live vicariously.  But I will definitely be back when we go back to NY... good to have found the perfect Mexican place.",0,0,0,Kerry D.,"Boston, MA",138,56,0

The guac is good, but nothing more than your typical jalapeno-salt-lime-cilantro blend to kick it up to amazing.  Entrees were tasty and definitely rose above the classic enchilada/burrito standards, with the chef making veg-friendly replacements on a dish or two without any hassle. Tres leches was top notch. If you're not with a group, though, please don't let them sit you in the back - the space seems to multiply the sounds of the large groups doing tequilla toasts to a distracting level.

I will never come here again. It's a shame because there were some other desserts on their menu that I would have liked to try. I cannot fathom how a restaurant can provide such mediocre and slow service.

We ordered a chicken salad (the salad was $8 and adding chicken is +$5) and a Huevos Rancheros. How long does it take to put together a salad and eggs with sauce? Apparently, it takes this restaurant 30 minutes. That's ridiculous.3) My salad was served, and I realized the chicken was missing. I caught sight of the Manager, and he had been carrying over a plate of sliced grilled chicken.

There's no governing body to differentiate the claims of a real restaurant versus some joint that has chips and guacamole next to chicken parm on its menu.So, one would be justifiably skeptical walking by Fonda - especially in a space that's had its share of failures in the past. From the second you peruse the margarita list, though, you realize you're in for the real deal. The ingredients pop off each page of the menu - chayotes, cactus, guajillo pepper, banana leaves. The preparations are equally as satisfying: a spicy hazelnut mole, a sweet passion fruit sauce, an achiote marinade on the pork shoulder. A special the other night had calamari and shrimp in an open-faced quesadilla splitting a roasted tomato sauce and a velvety black bean sauce, and a avocado cheesecake to finish it off.

The place was pretty full, but did have some open tabkles. The whole menu looked delicious, it took a while to decide what to order, but the servers were extremely nice and patient.When we finally decided, we started with the chips and guacamole, which you could tell were fresh, You could taste the avocado in the guacamole and I'd be shocked if they didn't make the chips there daily. For our entrees I got the Chile Reanos and my friend got a shrimp dish. We were both extremely pleased with our meals. My meal, had just the right amout of spice and the filling was perfectly complemented by just a bit of blue cheese. My only complaint was that it was too dark, so it made it hard to see the menu and such. I will definitely be back here!",1,0,1,Michelle B.,"Manhattan, NY",23,30,0

4.0,7/1/2012,"We went there on a Saturday night for a friend's birthday dinner and drinks.The place is small and quaint, with bright dark orangish red walls, and VERY FLAVORFUL food. Their margaritas list is really good. We tried the Tamarindo, Pepino and the classic and I loved all 3 of them. The bartender is also friendly enough to have concocted the recipes to our personal tastes - less/more sweet, less/more sour! We had their grilled cheese with chorizo, watermelon salad, guacamole, and a black bean appetizer and they were all out of this world. These weer served with teensy fresh corn tortillas - which were made to perfection.For our entrees, we had the Camarones Adobodas (essentially seasoned grilled charred shrimps on green flavored rice,) (my favorite), chicken nortena (again spicy and delicious), baked grouper - and we had absolutely no complaints ! All very well cooked and absolutely delicious. Desserts: tres leches cake, banana pudding (my favorite), and citter sweet chocolate pudding with walnut crunch - its a crime to make desserts that good :-);Needless to say, all this food was shared amongst 4 people - you know we were all overloaded with delicious food, good drinks, and very friendly staff.

It's the ideal dining setting.Waiters and staff are very attentive and polite.The food is great, with a variety of mexican and mexican american dishes listed on the menu.Overall, it is a must for mexican food lovers.The only downside I would say is the correlation between portion size and price.Chances are you'll be tempted to order a second dish after realizing your already done with your first.Still, it is highly recommended and fairly new.",1,0,0,Brennan O.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0

2.0,5/13/2012,"I was really disappointed with the shrimp & scallop enchiladas.  The mole was was very heavy & there was too much of it.   It was spicy, but bland at the same time.  The shrimp & scallops were tiny & I didn't like that there was tomato inside.  It just didn't go with the mole - not that I would have expected it to.  I do not recall seeing tomato in the description of the dish - if I had I would not have ordered it. I wish I'd read other poor reviews of this dish before wasting $19 + tax & tip!  My second star is not for the enchiladas, but for the rice that comes with them.  It wasn't award winning, but I thought it was a better side of rice than I usually get at Mexican restaurants.  (The beans were very heavy & taste was just average.)",1,2,1,Danielle R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,79,0
4.0,5/13/2012,An intimate mexican food restaurant with great ambience. But considering the size of the place thats to be expected.

4.0,5/11/2012,"Finally got to try this place out last night with my boyfriend. I had a voucher from Amazon Local, which we were able to use with no problems, making a slightly pricey meal more than reasonable :) We had to make a reservation to use the voucher, something that I hadn't paid attention to when I bought the voucher. It wasn't an issue though; my boyfriend called and they gave us a reservation for 15 minutes from the time we called, so that worked out nicely.We ordered guacamole, and then they said it was coming, but then it didn't... it was odd. The amazing duck zarape more than made up for it though. We split the pork adobo for the main course, which was very good, but a little bit tough. More than enough to share, although it looked small when it was delivered to the table. Finally, for dessert, we had the budin de banana, which was completely awesome. I wish there were more caramelized bananas in it though, those were the best part. Service was good- very attentive, full of helpful suggestions, and the food came out very quickly.

The Guacamole was pretty standard, and the Fish Salpicon was an interesting take on cerviche (it had a good spicy kick to it). Though I was disappointed on the size of both dishes for their price.

The guacamole is a great starter as you peruse the menu, it's served with a dish of smoky sauce, chips and warm tortillas. The appetizers and mains are creative, delicious and filling - we loved the enchilada suizas and the chicken norte, and the chile rellenos were smoky and gigantic over a swash of creamy sauce. The staff fussed over us in the nicest way (weeknight dining pays off). The bar is very busy, having happy hr food/drink specials that could constitute dinner.

3.0,4/13/2012,"Went in because of the great reviews... well gave it a second chance actually because of the great reviews.First time I went in the hostess was not very nice and almost seemed annoyed or maybe overwhelmed and told me that she would call  me when a table freed up.  It was only about 7:30 on a Friday night.  I never received a call.  I've gotten calls back from any place I've gave my number too... once at Standard Grill they called me 4 hours later!Anyway BF and I were walking by and I checked out Yelp ratings.  4.5 stars... pretty impressive so we went in.  Again hostess was not the friendliest.  Whatever.  Drinks- I had a glass of Torrontes, BF had Guava Margarita.  Wine was ok.  The Margarita was super thick and gelatinous.  Not bad but strange.  Michelada- too spicy for BF.  Perfect for me.  Super saucy on the bottom.  Guacamole.  Super chunky and came with tortillas and chips.  The Guacamole was excellent!!  It saved this review!!  5 stars!  The chips were soooo good too.  AND super bonus was the hot sauce that came automatically with the guac.  Yes I love my hot sauce and hate asking for it over and over again!  Meals- Veggie Enchilada.  Don't even know what was in it.  It was ok.  Loved the rice and beans on the side though.  Shrimp and scallop enchiladas.  What kind of scallops are those??  They were nickel sized little ones.  Blah.  Didn't like the nutty mole sauce either.  Sort of bland and heavy.  The waiter was super friendly and all of the food came out super duper fast.  A bit too fast in fact.  We were still working on the guac when the mains came out.  If I ever go back, I will order the guacamole only to eat as my main.  I will also sit myself at the bar as to not have any interaction with the hostess.  I will also drink the super saucy and spicy michelada.  Then I might give this place 5 stars.",1,3,1,Jane K.,"New York, NY",72,267,1
5.0,4/11/2012,"This may be my new favorite Mexican restaurant and it was recommended to me by a friend who grew up in Mexico. This means it's held up to a ridiculously high standard. The staff was amazing, extremely attentive, friendly, and helpful. The guacamole was the best I've had, fresh, the perfect amount of citrus and salt, served with homemade tortilla and chips. We had the duck zarape which was fantastic for an appetizer, tortillas stuff with braised duck and smothered in habenero sauce. The camerones and enchiladas were also great. The pollo norteno would be the last bite I would eat to remember my meal with it. The chicken was so tender it fell apart and it was spiced to perfection. The drinks were also creative and well made.

4.0,4/8/2012,"Stopped in for a random casual lunch on the tail end of their brunch special on a Saturday. The staff was so pleasant and it just made me feel right at home. Surprisingly, it wasn't too crowded and we had a choice from of lots of seat options. Fonda has a mix of high tables and low tables.Though the menu was filled with lots of ""optiones de huevos"", (I did mention it was the tail end of brunch time right?) I decided to forge ahead to the all American burger topped with salsa and avocado and served with a side of sweet potato fries- yum. Great pairing choice Fonda! Side note- I think that any restaurant looking to top the standard fries of McDonald's (love those fries!) that does not want to add crack cocaine to the recipe should just do something different so I love the trend of sweet potato fries in restaurants. I digress. Everything was on point. He was not as famished as I was and opted to order the guacamole and chips that I still shared...hey I think one of us is greedy. I actually watched them make this guacamole fresh at a prep station just a few feet away our seats. They put a bit of a spin on it by adding in some white cheese- I dig it. Fonda offers lots of margarita options in addition to a full bar. These were just ok, but I'm certain that I just haven't found the right one for me yet. The manager and waitstaff consistently checked on us without making us feel rushed. Looking for laid back quality meal, good service and decent prices. Try it. The 4 stars is really tentative for me. I feel as though I need to taste one of the more traditional plates before bumping it up, but I'm feeling really good about this place and now have a reason to go back.",0,1,0,Nyota W.,"Brooklyn, NY",317,710,124
5.0,4/6/2012,"""I like a cook who smiles out loud when he tastes his own work.Let God worry about your modesty; I want to see your enthusiasm."" Robert Farrar CaponJust like there are different kinds of Mexicans there are different kinds of Mexican Food. I think many Yelpers in NYC think for Mexican and Chinese food it has to be a dirty trash hole to be authentic , but that just is not true!I found this on Billy Wonka's page. yelp.com/user_details?us…I am very critical when it comes to Mexican food and only gave one Mexican restaurant in the Bronx 5 stars for authenticity. Though the one in the Bronx isn't really a 5 star restaurant it's 5 stars as it compares to the slop holes of Corona and Sunset Park. And the restaurant in the Bronx has maybe the slowest service of any NY restaurant I can remember. It isn't neglectful service just slow and under staffed. Fonda doesn't have any of those glitches.The owner of Fonda was there and came to the table and introduced himself. He was over seeing everything at the restaurant and they said though he also visits the Brooklyn location he spends more time in Manhattan now. Remember the quote at the  start of my review  by Robert Farrar Capon, ""I like a cook who smiles out loud when he tastes his own work.Let God worry about your modesty; I want to see your enthusiasm.""We met the chef and the servers were all enthusiastic about working there. The servers were all Mexican and loved the food. I peaked into the kitchen , it was clean and  the servers were eating the food. That's a good sign!I have been to Mexico City and this does remind me of eating there.Each entree and dessert was excellent! We started with home made chips! They were great and salty the way I like them!The stand outs were the steak and fish as well as the duck appetizer and my husband's banana bread pudding. The pork entree was a mole based sauce. That one wasn't our favorite but was of good quality. It wasn't our favorite because it had shredded meat not a big deal but the other entrees were so outstanding that it just paled a bit in comparison. I do not think that is a bad thing, I think it is because the other entrees were so incredible that by the time we tried that one we had the other tastes on our brains. The steak was grilled and it was juicy on the inside and seared on the outside. The fish entree was delectable as well. It consisted of Pan seared filet of (catch of the day) over guajillo passion fruit sauce, served with potatoes, asparagus, roasted red peppers and red onions. It was a white fish of some kind. The sauce was zesty and if you read my reviews regularly you know  I am not into sauces for fish. But they masterfully blended the sauce. It had enough bite to have a Mexican taste but it also had the Passion fruit taste. It tasted very tropical.Here is an article about the Manhattan location. dinersjournal.blogs.nyti…It just opened in February. Though the owner chef was thinking there might be a different clientele than the Brooklyn location, that may be true but as a New Yorker and even regular Yelpers know people will travel for good food. Most of my Yelp New York friends are 5 Boro Yelpers. Me included. This location is larger and cleaner and more elegant. The chef/owner is hoping to make it a neighborhoody type of place like Park Slope. My prediction is it is probably going to be more of a destination restaurant than the Brooklyn location.The decor and ambiance are warm, friendly, elegant and festive without being kitschy or having  a theme restaurant vibe. The bathroom was really clean and the size of an East Village apartment. (that's a good thing!)I can no longer say NYC has no good Mexican restaurants. I am not from California but I have been around and know as big as the Mexican community is here residents of NY do not demand good Mexican food. But now Fonda has arrived and if asked by a tourist where to go for good Mexican food in NYC my answer will be Fonda.The service was warm, friendly and professional. The service was so good that at the end of the meal the server asked is there anything else I can do for you? My husband said yes my neck hurts can you rub it here? The server played along and said yes! It was pretty funny.I am looking forward to going back to try more dishes.",12,4,10,Pinky And The B.,"Manhattan, NY",847,1467,5796
4.0,3/25/2012,"Finally stepped in last night and was very pleased. Ambiance: Formerly Octavia's Porch, they kept the same basic idea - a few tables up front, a big bar, and more tables in the back. Intimate lighting and chill music at a low enough volume to easily have a conversation. Non-pretentious yet upscale at the same time. We sat by the window and let Saturday night in Alphabet City entertain us.Cocktails: Margaritas were muy delisioso. My friend ordered one made with chipotle-infused tequila. Presentation: What I loved most about this place was the pride the servers took in presenting everything. An order of guac for the table was presented in a giant mortar with chips plus a stack of tiny little corn tortillas. Additional hot sauce was served on the side for even more flavor tinkering. Always say yes to guac. The broth of my friend's tortilla soup was poured into her bowl with the other ingredients. A nice touch that lets you know it how freshly prepared it is.My enchiladas arrived with sharable-sized servings of rice and beans. Taste: Yumz. Guac was topped with some delicious cheese and was pretty much amazing. The enchiladas suizas hit the spot, taking me back to some of the best Tex-Mex I've ever had. The tortilla soup was not what my friend expected - it had a dark and smoky broth that was good, but perhaps a little intense. Still, the fact that they poured the broth tableside ensured that the tortilla strips were crispy, making it more fun to eat.Service: Everyone was so friendly. Our bus boy recommended some of his other favorite Mexican spots in the neighborhood. Water refills were frequent. We felt very welcome and taken care of. Will def be returning soon.",1,1,1,Israel B.,"Manhattan, NY",29,2,2
4.0,3/20/2012,"Growing up in Virginia Beach, my exposure to Mexican Food was pretty straight forward. You had El Rodeo and Plaza Azteca. The food was simple, the chips came with white and red sauce, and the sweet tea was southern style.... aka ridiculously sweet. All and all, I loved it, and considered myself a fan of Mexican. So... around the time I turned 20, I had only eaten Mexican at one of those two restaurants. I finally decided one day to leave the confines of my home town and go out and see the country. I traveled from Florida to Texas to California, and all across my travels I never ate Mexican that really spoke to me. Nothing that set itself apart from what I had experienced so far up to that point. Sure, I had a killer Burrito in San Diego and had enchiladas that made me extremely warm inside in San Antonio, but nothing that seem overly different from anything I had growing up, maybe a little better, but not by much. Fast forward a few years and now I'm a shitty hipster living in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, how fucking original right? Well I started to realize one thing about Manhattan... all the best food from around the world is right here. But here's the thing, you have your basic Plaza Aztecas and your El Rodeos (which are you staples), but then you have serious Chefs who cultivate the medium and bring it to it's next level. Places like Itzocan Cafe (RIP), Mole, and Barrio Chino, are on a whole other playing field, and made me realize there's a lot more to real gourmet Mexican.So, this is the part where I tie Fonda into the review. They're following in the proud steps of those other gourmet style Mexican spots, and really delivering next level food. I had the Chicken Mole Enchiladas the other night and they were incredible. Also the guac and margaritas were fantastic. Check them out and if you're in Brooklyn they have a site there too.",5,2,2,Curtis W.,"Virginia Beach, VA",260,204,35
