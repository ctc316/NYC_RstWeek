3.0,4/14/2019,"This place has a lot of want to, but in the end seems just old and tired. Even the sushi chefs behind the counter - dressed up and lots of decor, but looking tired, with plastic wrap boxes in front of the view. Poor lighting also makes it a poor atmosphere. Friendly and helpful service, but it could not make up for the atmosphere and so so food. I had a below average shrimp tempura appetizer and Japanese style steak (promised as the best steak I've ever had). It was obvious the fryer oil needed to be changed, and the shrimp also came out somewhat soggy. Not the best start. Coming from Austin, the Japanese steak looked similar to (almost identical in appearance to) beef fajitas - right down to the accompanying onions and peppers! It was not, however, beef fajitas, although that might have been better than what I got. There was a distinct lack of flavor that without a doubt put it squarely off the list of best steaks I've ever had. Too bad. This was really close to my hotel (AC Hotel). I should have heeded the average reviews on Yelp. Next time for Japanese I'll try something else.",0,0,0,Brian W.,"Austin, TX",43,83,190

1.0,3/27/2019,"I have been to this restaurant before and it was great, so a co-worker was leaving and we decided to go for dinner here.  We were deciding between the $60 or $80 multi-course menu.  Our waiter said he could put together a better menu for us for the same price.  So he wrote down our preferences and never referred to the menu.  Checked in on us and said he would offered a special gift at the end of the meal.  Food was enjoyable but when we got the check at the end we were scammed, instead of $60pp (total $180) the waiter ordered the expensive signature items on the menu, so 20 pieces of sashimi, one grilled small whole fish, one small Wagyu steak to share, grilled vegetables and pudding with fresh fruit for a total for 3pp to share cost $475, no drinks. He charged us $36 for the dessert, he had promised was complimentary.  Beware this waiter (Lert) he is a con man and dishonest do not believe anything he says.  He takes advantage of customers by padding the bill with high price items under the guise of ""putting together a better menu"" for the same price as the pre-fixe only to be slammed at the end with a padded bill well over the promised price.",0,1,0,Cris C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,16,0

We were planning to go to Bougaria across the street and couldn't wait for one hour to get seated so just came here. We immediately got a seat at the bar and was able to experience the ""batata"". The food is definitely on the pricey end but I love the traditional sense of it.

3.0,2/26/2019,You know the toro was on point and the tuna roll was pretty standard we all liked the spice on it but the spicy salmon roll was bad and tasted Pasty.

4.0,2/25/2019,"A bit on the pricey side, but to be expected, I suppose, for the location.My husband and I enjoyed the atmosphere of the place, and right around the time we were leaving, they were doing mochi-tsuki, or pounding the rice cake the traditional way. Kind of an interesting performance.Food quality was decent. Not the same quality you would get in Japan for the price, but being in Manhattan, I suppose you can't ask for more.Recommend?

4.0,1/31/2019,Being a restaurant in new york city they do not disappoint in terms of decor and service. Upon walking in at the front door you have the wait staff interacting with the customers and pounding away at fresh mochi which was so fresh and so delicious. When seated I can see all the staff is wearing some kind of matching authentic Japanese uniform.I ordered the omakase and I got 9 pieces of sushi plus a roll. I feel like the quality was fresh but it didn't really give me a wow factor for the price I paid. I was debating between the omakase ($60 - 9 pieces plus roll) and the nigiri sushi ($34 - 7 pieces). I went with the omakase cause I thought what the heck I'm here already anyways and my friend gave a good review. But in the end I really felt like I should've went with the nigiri sushi. Overall the food was good but not a must try in my opinion. I think the only factor that would make me go back ia the fresh mochi they serve.,1,0,0,Sandy K.,"Flushing, NY",269,34,17
3.0,1/16/2019,"The restaurant itself was a great experience. I enjoyed the atmosphere but was expecting more of a show/flare to the cooking then it really was. The staff was good, but not very helpful for a first time coming here. They basically just pointed out the two meal menus ($65 5-course meal & $85 6-course meal) and said for two people that's all you need. They didn't really explain a single thing to us. The majority of our meals were actually sushi/sashimi and not the expected BBQ experience, although our meals came with some BBQ. I got the 5 course, my date got the 6 course and we shared it all.  The food was good, no complaint there as we were satisfied, although we both said that if we went back, we wouldn't order a set meal but piece meal it together to experience more of the BBQ specialities. Finally, cost wise, it was on the expensive side, both meals and 2 drinks apiece was over $200.",0,0,0,Vincent T.,"Glen Head, NY",51,42,0

1.0,12/4/2018,"I thought the pricing was way out of control and I'd like to think I know.  I have lived in Manhattan for 29 years and been to different types of restaurants.  The sushi deluxe meal pictured in another review (sushi combo photo in the Cynthia H. review of 8/17/18) is $53.  This dish goes for $23 in any other regular Japanese restaurant here (8 sushi pieces and a tuna roll) and they didn't even include miso soup or salad.  My tuna roll didn't have so much meat in it either.  That incredibly higher price to me is completely unacceptable!  Upon leaving I felt like someone just robbed me!I went back to the hotel to tell the Hilton Club staff person since they promote this restaurant honoring a small discount.  She pulled out their menu.  Her price said $43 but it was a menu from 3 years back.  So they jacked up the prices even higher from their regular crazy high prices within this small time period?  My guess is they are not getting the numbers so are doing this to attempt to stay in business. Additionally I asked my waiter for a napkin and since he never brought it, I had to grab one from another seat.  I am pretty certain he heard me (I made it clear) so the service was subpar too.  Upon leaving, another waiter came to give me the check.  What happened to my waiter?  He was probably embarrassed to give me the bill!  I don't blame him honestly!  The dish also came on a cheapo plate and the presentation was poor. It would have been nice to get one of those wooden ones or something grander!  Right?  The quality of the food was just OK; nothing that stands out as so savory and delicious and I was hungry too!  Everything should have tasted fabulous then!  I was so disappointed to say the least in so many ways!For these prices, I'd rather go to Blue Fin in the middle of Times Square.  Their huge Chirashi Bowl is $33 and Mmmm delicious!  The quality is overwhelmingly better!  Even Nobu has to be more reasonable!  In short, after you get past the grand sushi bar and staff members walking and standing around doing just about nothing in the overhead kitchen (see Shawna B. 11/13/18 kitchen photo), there is little left to be had except to experience that you have just been had!  I definitely do not recommend this place and quite honestly think they should be ashamed of themselves!",0,0,0,A T.,"Irvington, NY",0,54,0

3.0,9/15/2018,This restaurant is all about impressing tourists but in the process has forgotten about the food. Every time a new set of diners arrives the wait and cook staff utter out loud something we could not decipher. After the 6th time is became kind of funny. Our waiter was terrific too. The cook staff serves you with a long paddle that reaches far from behind the sushi bar.

4.0,8/15/2018,Happy hour (Mon-Fri 4-7pm) only applies to the alcohol bar area NOT the robata bar. When I arrived Tuesday 6pm the place was not busy. I decided to not do happy hour and sat at the robata because happy hour beer is almost the same as regular prices ($7). We shared spicy tuna on crunchy rice. It was delicious with a good amount of spice. Not worth $3.50 per piece though. The restaurant was spacious and clean. The service was great and the staff was very professional. But the food/drinks are overpriced. I think it's a good place to try just for the experience.,1,0,1,Melanie R.,"New York, NY",88,232,485
4.0,8/11/2018,"Most convenient spot to have dinner with a group of 9 that's close to The Nederlander Theater. If you get a reservation on OpenTable, they will seat you by the bar so I suggest to make a reservation by phone if you want your party to sit together at a table. You're greeted with a warm welcome by staff as you enter. A large U-shaped bar is located at the far back of the room where you can see food being prepared and handed to the customers via a long wooden paddle. Besides their standard menu they had several menu options available: $42 NY Restaurant Week menu, $58 5-course menu and $70 6-course menu. I ended up choosing the 6 course menu mainly for the whole lobster. The portion sizes of the 6-course menu are very generous. The first plate that came out was the tofu salad. I was surprised on how large it was. I definitely had help finishing some of the other dishes. The whole lobster was good. I had to order a side of rice to go along with it because you don't get anything else with it not even butter. It was a bit tricky using the lobster fork and chopsticks to pull the meat out too. All in all, the price for a 6 course meal was fair with the amount of food that's given for each plate. The service was excellent too. Although we arrived 30 minutes late and had an extra person join us, they accommodated all of us to a larger table. We also told the server we were short on time and had to catch a play right after dinner and he made sure everything came out fast enough for us to make the show.",5,0,1,Jade B.,"Brooklyn, NY",255,151,477

5.0,7/26/2018,"I came here for my girlfriend's birthday during restaurant week.  I've seen some pretty good things here and both of us were pretty excited to see what the hype is about.  We were greeted immediately as we walked in by all of the chefs on the grill in the middle of the room as they saw us walk in.  The host already noted that we were here for a birthday as soon as we walked in and got us a seat around the grill.  While there's also table seating, we felt sitting in the middle of the action would be more of a fun experience.  The food was all wonderful (special recommendation for the Tofu salad and Spicy Edamame) while the grill provided a great atmosphere as the chefs handed you your entrees on giant wooden spatulas as it comes off the grill.  The staff also prepared a special birthday celebration/surprise for us which added to our experience.  Finally they asked guests to come help them make fresh Mochi which they served you as an additional desert at the end.  All in all, it is a great experience and a wonderful date night.  Thank you for the wonderful experience!",3,0,0,Charlie Q.,"Manhattan, NY",81,5,6

We also got the fish of the day and duck slices which were good as well but again the portions here are all fairly small.

It was an experience to be served over the counter with long paddles. It was fun and interactive. If you ever come to Inakaya definitely request the robata bar for the full experience. We ordered a variety of grilled vegetables and mushrooms. Including okra, shishito peppers, eggplant, Japanese sweet potato, enoki and shimeji mushrooms. Followed by the grilled oysters which were delicious. We also ordered the giant shrimp, squid, and lamb chops seasoned in miso paste. Lastly we had the Kinme-dai (Golden Eye Snapper), which is a must for anyone who enjoys quality fish. It takes 40 minutes for them to prepare the fish so order in advance. Also they may or may not have it since is a seasonal fish which is rare. If you stay late enough there is an interactive mochi making session which customers can participate in. At the end of it, everyone who participated gets to have some mochi on the house.  Atmosphere: 4.5/5It's a nice space to sit down and enjoy a meal.Customer Service: 4/5At first when the server didn't think we were going to spend a lot he was kind of indifferent. But when we ordered the the kinme-dai his tone immediately changed and the service was great for the rest of the night. Also they got the entire restaurant to stop and sing happy birthday. Food: 4.5/5The food was really good, my only complain is that they didn't check their oysters very well and we got one that was going bad. They replaced it quickly and apologized for it. The dessert was very good in both taste and presentation. This restaurant is popular with tourist but I wouldn't say it's a tourist trap.

The rice was slightly too hard in my opinionDessert: Mochi ice-creamFor some reason the ice-cream was not completely wrapped in the mochi skin, so it was almost impossible to eat it without separating the two. Also the mochi skin was very thick and there was too much chocolate syrup. Would not recommend.Environment was okay and the waiters were very friendly.

1.0,1/20/2018,"A very cheap fake Japanese restaurant. Our waiter has a fake and awkward smile but apparently knows nothing about his menu. We ordered several from their daily specials, sashimi and roll. Food: roll was among the same levels that you can get from shabby groceries. The rice is stale and too cold, even a bit flaky. Sashimi on top of the roll was def not fresh (frozen and fishy). Uni sashimi was prob from Maine, very fishy. Tuna/rice appetizer, one of their daily specials, tuna was those chopped ones you can get boxes of from groceries; fried rice ball on the bottom is cold and tasted like leftovers. The only okay one is soft shell crab, which they only offered for 2 pieces. Right now I've had all of above, filled up and waiting for a $98 kinme-dai, which the waiter claimed to be limited.

We had a good time the last visit during NYC Restaurant Week, so we were excited to go back for the second time.  We both ordered their Inakaya Course that comes with six course, including a dessert. We started off with couple of cocktails. I ordered Shiro Spritzer and it was actually quite tasty.All the dishes that we chose were good, but small portion. I am not sure if the price tag matches the amount of food we received. Quality was high, and we enjoyed them all, but I am not sure it was something I would gladly pay for again.  We had a nice dinner here, but we felt a bit rushed. From before we got there, we were told on the reminder call that we had one hour and a half since they were busy on that evening with other reservations. Once we arrived, we were told the same thing again by the hostess. When we got seated, we were told the same thing again for the third time by our server. The course menu items came out one after another, without a good resting period for our stomach. Not as relaxing as our first visit. Other than that, the food was good, service was good, and we enjoyed that part of our dinner. The whole rushing part did not really made us want to go back again... Well, not too soon, anyways.

1.0,1/4/2018,"Came here for dinner on Christmas Day. I had purchased a Groupon for the 6 course tasting for myself and a girlfriend. The experience started off great. It was easy to make a reservation and we were greeted by a lovely hostess. The meal started to go downhill shortly after we were seated. We were ignored by our supposed waiter for a good 20 minutes before we were allowed to order. During this time, we didn't get any water/tea while other counter sitters seated after us ordered with their waiter. In addition to the 6 course, we opted to also get the live scallop sashimi ($16) and the grilled squid ($12). Our wait time in between courses was MUCH longer than the people around us. For example, we waited 40 minutes between the entree course and the rice/noodle course, meanwhile it came out fairly quickly for other diners with a different waiter. We repeatedly had to hunt down someone to get more tea/water and our dipping sauce for the scallops didn't come until after we had already finished it. Not sure if it's because we paid with a Groupon or if our waiter just didn't care but service was awful, and I truly regret tipping the 25% (because it was Christmas) on the total bill ($170) instead of what I was charged (~$40). Food was also mediocre. I will not come back again.- Live scallop sashimi: very good, but very little quantity-wise. They do a nice touch of grilling the sides and giving it to you in a little dish along with the sashimi.- Grilled squid: good, average.- Seared tuna salad: okay, we both got it. Tuna was a little fishy.- Trio carpaccio: very fishy, did not like at all.- Spicy tuna on crispy rice: Good if you like spicy stuff, bad if you have fragile teeth because crispy = hard. - Grilled vegetables (both sets): One of the better parts of the meal, can't go wrong with either set.- Grilled oyster & jumbo shrimp: The sauce on the grilled oyster was delicious! Salty but delicious and oyster wasn't sand-y. Shrimp was really tough and complicated to eat. Would pass on this. - Meat trio skewers: Meh, I'd pass on this too, nothing exciting. Small portion and overly salty.- Marinated tuna & avocado don: Not sure why this took 40 mins to come out. Just okay, tuna is also fishy.- Cha Soba (hot): Again, not sure why this took 40 minutes, but delicious! Probably my favorite part of the meal. Very simple but warming.- Homemade pudding: good dessert. Wanted to try monaka but they were out and it was too cold for ice cream.",0,0,0,Christina Y.,"New York, NY",100,39,31

Our reservation was for 7pm, got there a few minutes before 7pm and we still didn't get seated until closer to 7:40pm even though we saw 2 4-tops and a 2 top table available. I asked the hostess about those 3 open tables and she said they're keeping them open for larger parties, just in case. I tried to plead my case that we have a 7pm reservation, not just a Walk In, and she still wouldn't budge.When we finally got seated, our waiter didn't bring us any water even after we got our alcoholic drinks. We had to remind him twice! I also noticed that other people were getting hot towels to clean their hands right when they sat down. I guess your experience with this place, as with a lot of restaurants, will vary greatly on whether you have a crap server.When our waiter finally brought me my Sapporo beer, the head on mine took up 40% of the pint. I asked him if he can pour off some of the foam and give me the rest of my beer and his response was, ""That's how beer comes."" I was so annoyed at this point that I felt that arguing would turn into a sh*te show.The food itself was absolutely delicious. But it was hard to enjoy since there were so many fruit flies buzzing about.

5.0,12/13/2017,"Mmm, this place was sooo good! I was concerned this restaurant would be another tourist trap in Times Square, but it was definitely the real deal! The food was fantastic, and we both left stuffed!First, you might want a reservation if you want to sit on the counter/grill section (where they serve you food with a large wooden paddle), as it seems to fill up first before the tables are. Actually, you might want to make a reservation regardless if you're here for dinner on Friday or the weekends. While the restaurant itself is fairly spacious, the seating is more limited in comparison.I had the seared tuna salad, which was good if you remember it's just a salad. The searing was light, but the tuna was pretty tender for what it was. My partner got the (silken) tuna salad, which was tasty too (particularly the dressing)!I had the spicy tuna on crispy rice for my appetizer, which I still have dreams of. SO GOOD! Not what I expected, but the crispy rice was so spot on, crispy on the outside while still being chewy on the inside. The slice of jalapeno was a nice touch. My partner had the kakuni (braised slice of pork belly), which I didn't taste.The grilled vegetables were solid. I mean, they're just vegetables, so keep that in mind. But the grill they use really does them justice.We both went for the gindara and beef skewers. The black cod was probably my favorite. There were a few fish bones to pick out, but no big deal considering I'm used to picking at whole fried fish with chopsticks.By the tempura don came, I was starting to get pretty full! If anything, I wouldn't have mind if they held the rice. Also, the eggplant tempura could've been sliced up thinner (admittedly it was well presented, almost like a flower). My date had the cha soba, which tasted as good as it sounded! It reminded me of udon, but with soba noodles (which I personally like a lot more).Mmm, Asian places are not known for dessert, but it ended the 6 course meal very well. The homemade pudding was tasty. The only big problem I had with it was that it was too tiny! I was almost tempted to run around the corner to Paris Baguette for more pudding because it was such a tease! The monaka was a standout from what it usually is - was like a tasty ice cream sandwich.

I had a Groupon for two and brought one of my friends along.Upon walking in, we were greeted by a friendly front desk and waited around 3-5 minutes for them to get the bar-side table seating ready. Decor made the restaurant seem like I was in Japan! The regular menu was pretty extensive on top of what we chose to order.This higher-end six course meal was one of the best ""bang-for-your-buck"" dinners I've had in NYC, and I'll tell you why:First course was a seared tuna salad: tuna melts in your mouth and sauce was delicious! Second course, Spicy Tuna over Crispy fried Rice: For all of you spice lovers, this is a great dish, with spicy mayo on the bottom of each piece and half a slice of jalapeño to top it off. Delicious with bold flavors. Third Course: Set B mixed grilled veggies: This was alright, tasted slightly salted and grilled. Simple yet satisfying. Fourth Course(Entree & Winning Dish): one WHOLE lobster. Absolutely delicious and grilled to near perfection! Fifth Course, Tempura Don: Came with assorted tempura places over a bed of rice and miso soup that was not bland and more concentrated with miso paste, delicious and shows they didn't slump out on ingredients. Sixth Course, Monaka Ice Cream: Absolutely delicious and might have been one of the best desserts I've had in a while. Fresh fruits, creamy Monaka ice cream, over a melted chocolate fudge that had a hint of coffee flavor. Creamy, sweet, and the perfect ending to my meal.Tip: When buying the Groupon deal, note that this does not cover tax and tip. Look through your email for any promotional codes. Instead of paying $72 with the Groupon, it ended up being only ~$23-24 each for both my friend and me. for a 6 course meal which included a whole lobster.

4.0,11/19/2017,"Espectacular food and service!! I would recommend it any time. The quality of the products and the simplicity of the plates makes it the perfect place to really taste a true Japanese experience.The 6-course dinner is the way to go. It's a ton of food and every little single thing is delicious. You might be expecting sizes like tapas but every dish is a full plate full of food. Appetizer size and entree size.We were so satisfied that we couldn't finish the dessert and some portions of the entrees.So you know what I mean, you get a whole lobster as an entree. Yes, a WHOLE lobster! Incredible...The seared tuna salad has the perfect dressing. You think some greens would have no taste but the dressing makes it all plus the seared tuna that is unbelievable.  Then the trio carpaccio and the spicy tuna over crispy rice. This last one was something special. A little bit on the spicy side but full of magical flavors. The grilled vegetables are like a piece of meat or some delicatessen because you'd never guess those vegetables would have that taste. The cook is definitely a grill master!Then the entree, a WHOLE lobster. I have to emphasize this because probably that lobster costs the whole six-course dinner itself. How much do you pay for that at a fancy restaurant? BUT to me, my favorite dish was the black cod that came with the kobe beef which was as spectacular as the fish. Soooooo tender! The cod was like butter, it melts in your mouth and it explodes in flavor. First time having kobe beef too and man, it did not disappoint.Continuing the extensive dinner, a tuna and avocado don which had the perfect tuna. Loved it!Last but not least, a custard pudding. A great option for a Japanese or Asian place (I'm not a fan of Asian desserts). This one was pretty close to a flan. Really good! And it came with an incredible orange wedge.

So a limited menu and people having a birthday show every 10-20minutes is more than less ideal.The food:The skewers were okay and the price of a NYC izakaya? 9$ for two skewers, somewhat expected.

2.0,9/14/2017,"To be clear: This is not the place to go to for an authentic Japanese culinary experience. I came here for an early weekday lunch and sat at the counter in the middle of the restaurant. I was drawn by the convenient location and the promise of meat and veggies cooked on a robata grill. We started with the shimeji and eringi mushrooms as well as shishito peppers (because they confused our order of shimeji with them). I had a hard time deciding on my main but went with what seemed like a safe bet... the meat lover's selection of skewers. I was really disappointed with all of the food. The vegetables arrived barely singed and the caramelization caused by the robata is essential to this kind of cuisine. A few, but nowhere near enough, portions of the vegetables were adequately cooked but overall they were too chewy and lacked the crispyness which I am accustomed too. The skewers suffered from the same problem, not raw but plain undercooked and missing the black streaks. They also arrived close to room-temperature and this is unacceptable. Maybe the grill is actually gas-operated, they go to great lengths hiding it from customers with the vast counter and then the cooks grilling hidden behind booths. The rice was not well made and lacked the fluffyness of good Japanese rice. The miso was also watery and subpar. The location is great and the venue is quite a sight but this perfectly encapsulates Japanese cuisine packaged in a way that is more palatable to an American audience. It is also expensive, especially considering the poor quality.",4,1,0,Timothy H.,"New York, NY",3,78,102

5.0,7/16/2017,"Went here for my husband's birthday dinner with our 11 month old son. Booked our reservation via OpenTable where it received glowing remarks so not sure why Yelp rating is 3 1/2 stars because this place exceeded our expectations. We were a little nervous about having a little one with us, but the staff were so accommodating and entertaining.  They have the patrons help with pounding mochi which is a Japanese tradition and, of course, the birthday boy was given the honors to pound away. The staff then gives all the patrons samples of the mochi. I've had ""real"" mochi before and this was the real stuff. The food was excellent! Everything we had was really tastey and we highly recommend the spicy tuna on crispy rice, fried baby octopus, Kobe skewers, and their sushi. We only had the rainbow roll sushi, but the fish was probably the freshest we've had compared to the sushi served in Hawaii. My lychee martini was very yummy. Our son started to fuss during dinner so I carried and rocked/walked him around our table without any issues or bumping into anyone. They don't appear to try to pack this place like most NYC restaurants so there's ample room to move about without getting funny looks. At the end of the night the entire staff did a special Japanese birthday greeting (spoken in Japanese and translated in English) along with serving my husband this green tea mochi desert with azuki beans that was delicious! It was a perfect birthday dinner celebration! Definitely a returning patron. Important to note: this is NOT a place for diners who want a quiet dinner. It does get loud in there which was perfect for us with a baby.",1,0,1,Jenilynne L.,"Old Bridge, NJ",7,19,17

No matter - I knew the robata grilled vegetables would win them over and I was right. They loved it and our waiter Lert was wonderful in helping us order and getting the right amount of food for such a big group. They also did a really sweet celebration for my mom and made her feel really special on her birthday.Everything was excellent and the only reason that it didn't get a full 5 stars is because it is quite expensive and while every dish was delicious, the portions were quite small and our big teenagers were still a bit hungry at the end!",1,0,0,Kris R.,"Glen Ridge, NJ",0,6,0
4.0,7/12/2017,"Always wanted to try this place but it was tough getting in without a reservation. Sunday night about 7 pm was easy getting in w/o reservation. There were 2 tables with large groups, one was a birthday celebration. We were seated at the bar/robata. The robata chefs greeted us with bows. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to bow but I nodded my head. Lot's of writing in Japanese so we were lost the first few minutes until a waiter stopped by and handed us food and drink menus. I ordered Shochu thinking it was sake since I did not see the list of Sakes on the menu. I should have realized Shochu was whiskey when the waiter asked if I wanted ice. It was very good but not as strong as whiskey. I also tried the house sake which was poured by the robata chef from a huge sake barrel into a wooden box to drink from. The food was mixed. The grilled duck was a bit dry and had a beef flavor but nicely marinated. The atuage(fried tofu) was also dry. The best dish was the Nigiri sushi and grilled squid. Complimentary mochi was served at the end of dinner. That was a nice touch since we watched it being pounded by a wooden sledge hammer as a side show. The asked diners if they would like to take a whack at it which was fun to watch.Servings are small so expect to pay a lot or leave hungry. They do have 5 course and 7 course menus for $58 and $70 which may be a good alternative than ordering a la cart.Overall it was a nice experience and fun place to go for a birthday celebration.Almost forgot check out the bathroom they have one of those cool Japanese electronic toilets.

No handle on toilet flusher. Not good feeling. Bathrooms are important to me. 2) Friday night 7pm. Not full. Feels a bit grimy. Maybe that's a robata thing, but wasn't impressed. 3) seats are gross. Is it leather or pleather but all cracked. Wife wore a skirt and it hurt her legs. That's strange. 4) food is good but only real novelty is the paddle serving.

Then, the server did not know what he served and asked what we had so far. After a few minutes later, only thing they said was "" kitchen is busy."" Hmmm... I do not think so. The table(came 15 min after we were seated) next to us already got their main dishes. And the receptionist came again and apologized. Lol. I assumed that my server totally forgot about us. I was expecting better service...was very disappointed. If you like entertainment then, come and enjoy. If you are food lover, you do not want to try at all... the food was way too pricey compare to quality of foods. Please, look at the picture I posted below.

The explanation of the host: ""they made their reservation days before we did and therefore will be seated first"". Seriously! She added that our seats at the counter were not ready yet.

5.0,4/16/2017,"I LOVED THIS PLACE! Best fine dining I have had in years, even better than some sushi omakase places I ended up paying $200-$300+ for and ENJB. I got the six course living social deal through my sister on my birthday and had to use it up before it expires. $70 for 2 people dinner-bet you can't beat that!!! The place was very open with upbeat music and if you go here, I highly recommend sitting at the bar. They bring your good out freshly prepared via a giant paddle from behind the sushi bar which was very interesting. Service was impeccable. They kept refilling our tea and cleaning our table, supplying warm towel, and lemons whenever we asked for them. The entrees and desserts were so enthralling. The presentations were also beautiful. Also they included some Japanese cultural elements such as clapping these giant sticks together and thanked their customers earnestly and wished us all good health. I think the pictures speak for themselves. They mashed mochi with a large hammer in a stone bowl with cues and rhythmic form and even let customers try it out for fun. My first time having the biggest shrimp and grilled oyster I've ever seen in my life, not including choices of whole live lobster, and Kobe beef, beef tongue, etc. For the truly gourmet lover.

5.0,4/4/2017,"I've gone here twice, both times with a groupon for a 6 course tasting menu.  Make sure you sit at the counter, as that is where all of the action is at.  There's fresh seafood on ice surrounding the counter that you can watch the prepare, and they server the food to you right from the grill on a wooden board.The first time I went was a while ago, so I dont remember everything I had, so Ill just review the things I had more recently.First course:               Me:  Grilled Tuna Salad               Friend:  Tofu Salad               The salads were the same except for the tuna/tofu.  They had this great ginger-peanut dressing that was super refreshing.  The tuna was very fresh, and just slightly seared, with 4 big pieces on the salad.  The tofu was really creamy, which I liked, but was kind of hard to eat with chop sticks.  It was very fresh though - possible homemade?   This was a great starter course.Second Course:               Me:  Pork Belly (with a japanese name I dont remember)               It was AWESOME!  Perfectly sweet, salty, and tender.  Its fatty, which some might not enjoy, but if thats your case then don't get pork belly.  This is a great prepparation of it.               Friend:  Spicy Tuna on crispy rice squares               YUM!   I never had anything like a cripsy rice crackers.  They are fried and soft and delicision.Third:               Both:  These 2 selections of veggies.  We got one of each.  They were both really good.  The mushrooms tasted deliciously like butter, and the (yams?  sweet potato?  it was yellowish with purple skin) was reaaaaaallllllyyy good.   Fourth:               Me:  Giant Oyster and Shrimp               Friend:  Whole Lobster               Sadly, this course really disappointed.  Especially since it seemed like the main course of the meal.  The oyster was delicious, but only in the way that things smothered in garlic and butter are delicious.  The giant prawn was grilled whole, head on, which is OK, but they didnt split the shell and they way over cooked it, so it was impossible to peel and then super dry inside. I swizzled it in the oyster butter, but it was still pretty bleh.  I think it just really needed to be cooked less.    The lobster was quite small, but I suppose that is in line with the price and amount of food for 6 courses.  It was split in half ans they did do a nice job cracking the shells for easy consumption.  Again, this was just cooked way too long so the meat was very dry and very stuck in the shells.  I think the problem is grilling vs steaming. We had to ask for butter to dip it in but that didn't recover  it (and butter recovers everything!).   There was pleanty of food overall so it wasnt too big of an issue that this course was bad.  (Last time i went, i had the beef skewers which were frickin good)Fifth course:               Both:  Tuna Avocado Don               SAVE ROOM FOR THIS COURSE AND DEFINITELY PICK THIS!  Its a bowl of rice with marinated raw tuna and avocado.   It is so fresh and light, and the tuna is marinated perfectly.  It sits on top of the rice, whcih is good bc at this point in the meal you probably won't eat all of the rice.   Everything about this is so delicious and simple.   I'd go back just for this.   We also got miso soup just before this course.  Dessert:               Friend:  Green tea ice cream.                 In general its not my favorite thing, so i cant fairly review.   It tasted like macha.               Me:  The ice cream waffle (It had a japanese name that I forget starting with M)               Praise Baby Jesus! I thought I had no room left for dessert.  I ate every bite.  Its a thin waffle ice cream sandwich, with chocolate and caramel drizzle and hoemmade whipped cream.   My friend and I split it and it was enough for both.  It was the perfect meal ender.Overall:  The one bad course was not nearly enough to take away the 5 stars that the other food, service, and atmosphere deserve.   I see them on groupon often so look out for a deal.  I will definately be going back!  Its a great place to go pre-show in the theater district.",0,0,0,Angela D.,"Union City, NJ",0,5,0

It was a bit pricey, hence the $$$, but not totally unreasonable. Ambience - 5 starsBeautiful decor! We sat by the counter where the chefs handed us our food on a paddle. Service - 5 stars Attentive and fast service all around. Food - 3.5 starsFirst course:Seared tuna salad - The tuna was seared nicely and tender.  The highlight was that dressing they had on the salad. It was so good! Made sure to cover every leaf with it.Tomato avocado salad - What can I say? Simple salad of tomato and avocados. Fun part was the gingery jelly they crumbled on top.Second course:Kakuni - Braised pork belly done right! Tender, fatty, and topped with a little bit of the wasabi smear. Trio Carpaccio - Fresh, thinly sliced sashimi. Third course:Grilled vegetables - we ordered one of each and the star was definitely the sweet potato!! I don't know what they did but it was sweet with the perfect texture and hint of grill. The little slab of butter that came with this put the potato over the top.Fourth course:Whole lobster - This definitely turned a few heads! The outside of the lobster was salted and had a grill flavor. It was a little overcooked so the meat wasn't as tender and slightly hard to remove from the shell.  Gindara & US Kobe Beef Skewer - Gindara was great, but the beef skewer was not.  It only came with one skewer and 3 cubes of beef. Slightly tough to chew. In comparison to the lobster (size and taste), this doesn't compare. Fifth course:Marinated Tuna & Avocado Don - Big chunks of tuna! Kind of stringy so hard to chew apart and the marinade is a bit salty for my taste. This also came with miso soup!Cha Soba - Green soba topped with tempura bits and scallion. Broth was delicious and my sister liked it!Sixth course:Homemade pudding - One of my favorite dishes! So simple and so delicious. Not too sweet and had a light creamy texture. There was a brown syrup on the bottom making it look like an upside down flan. Totally recommend!Monaka - This was like an ice cream sandwich with a wafer shell on top of chocolate syrup. The ice cream was good and went well with the chocolate, but when does that combo ever go wrong? The wafer wasn't crispy and was unfortunately slightly stale.

4.0,3/10/2017,"Inakaya is a fun, unique Japanese fine dining establishment right below the New York Times headquarters.  Would definitely recommend sitting at the bar to get a fish market vibe. They will serve everything to you using an elongated paddle if you sit at the bar as there's quite a distance from the chef to the customer. A quirky novelty. They do a short theatrical performance every evening consisting of patrons and chefs clapping in synchrony wishing good health and happiness. As for the yakitori, they don't use a charcoal grill. There are other better yakitori establishments out in NYC for that. Inakaya definitely ramps up the luxury factor though by offering Kobe tongue/beef skewers. Rec: (+) Chawamushi: steamed egg custard with chicken and shrimp cooked with a savory broth. (+++) Grilled oysters: Oh my word. These babies are HUGE. Largest oyster shells I have seen in my life from Maine. (+++) Kinme-dai fish: imported Snapper from Japan that is salted and grilled. Market price. Ours was $75. The eyes are ginormous. Together with the size and the beautiful presentation, it's definitely a ""wow"" factor and highlight of the night. 1 fish is enough to share between 4 people granted if you order other food as well. (++) Seiro meshi with salmon and salmon roe. A definite for seafood lovers. 1 box is very filling; it's enough to share between 2 people and still feel satiated. (+) Taiyaki dessert: pretty eye candy.They have this special offer where for every $100 you spend, you get to roll 3 dices. If you roll certain combinations, you win a discount.

Note:  It's in the middle of the block, just a bit from 40th/8th.  The food is, at once, traditional and thoroughly modern.  The music is just hip enough to make you feel like you're in The Ginza, and the traditional Japanese greetings and overt and enthusiastic gratitude for your business make you feel like your in a truly old-world Japanese locale.We love our beer cold, so the waiter brought an ice bucket with several beers in it.  We only paid for those we drank (all but one), so we had what we wanted, and just the right amount!  Our waiter was very helpful in negotiating the unusual items on the menu.  He also encouraged us to order as we went along, so as not to overdo it.  We had some of the ""usual"" items we enjoy on a regular basis, and tried some other items that were new to us.  All of them were carefully prepared and precisely presented.  Delicious!When I ordered one thing by mistake, our waiter encouraged us to try it, saying that it was popular and delicious.  He did, however, encourage us to get something else in it's place (no charge) if we didn't like the first item.  Not necessary... the Elephant Garlic IS delicious, sweet and subtle.   He even, discreetly, kept a running tab for us so that we didn't go over our budget (prepaid card).  Miso soup was rich, and felt very much ""home made"".  Seriously, everything we ordered was delicious!  And more than that... everything we saw at other tables even looked delicious... and everyone around looked so content.Synopsis: This is a wonderful place near Times Square, but not IN the madness of Times Square, with delicious and stylishly presented Japanese food that makes you feel like you slept through the flight and you're somehow, magically, in Tokyo.  Domo Arigato!

1.0,12/30/2016,"If you are going to go, sit down either at the bar or at the robata station or you are missing a lot.I was here once or twice prior to eating here. They sell very good albeit pricey brands of shochu though I can get better in other places. Anyway, I went here once for dinner and I won't plan on trying again, especially with the much better Ootoya nearby. After pondering whether I should get the smallest tasting menu (probably should have) i decided to order 3 dishes. I ordered Grilled mochi which I assumed correctly would be fine, Chazuke which I found to be bad enough that I already was reducing the rating hard, and a really overpriced Hotate from their Robata section.Grilled Mochi (5.00): They served 4 of them for 5 bucks. To be honest, this was pretty good and easily the best thing for the value that I had. Properly grilled and properly sauced. A bit salty but otherwise fine. After trying this dish I hoped the rest of the meal was adequate. 3.5Umeboshi Chazuke (6.00): Things went downhill fast here. The soup is green tea poured over rice with seaweed/a couple of other toppings. I chose Umeboshi as my main topping, a usually super sour plum which works perfectly for this soup. With the green tea and sour plum, where was the flavor? The soup itself was very watery and mostly tasted of OK seaweed. I'm curious if they used something like Lipton or super watered down Japanese tea (I don't really know which is worse.) I can get more flavorful green tea soup for 4 bucks in Penn Station, let alone a fancy Japanese place like this.  In terms of the Umeboshi, it wasn't sour in the slightest. The texture was off as well. I'm curious if it was old. The rice was fine but clumped. 0.5.After waiting a good long period one of the waiters told me it would be a bit longer for the scallop. After waiting a bubbly hot broth with a few scallop pieces came out.Grilled scallop/Hotate (18.00): As you can see from the image, the portion size was tiny for the price. I understand it's near Port Authority/it's in Midtown but really, they could have served a little more. Scallops are usually quite sweet and grilling them helps. Here it wasn't sweet at all. The weird sauce that was paired with it was super watery and really not needed. 1.55.5/15, or 0.33, I'll add another .5 for the good shochu selection.Been swapping between a 1 and a 2 for a bit, mostly a 2 for the mochi and shochu. I'm going to reduce it for two really bad dishes. I mean they messed up Chazuke which is really difficult and the scallop was a joke for the price.0.88",7,0,2,Glenn C.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",208,1266,376

While I can't comment on the sushi in general, I did try a couple of hand rolls and they were just ok--good, but nothing spectacular. We saw some people order whole grilled fish, and based on everything we tried, I would definitely go back to give that a try too. Giving 4/5 stars bc  I'm on the fence about the price. A little high?

Bottom line up front:Location 5Atmosphere 5Food 4Service 5Value 3We wanted to eat at a place where we could walk to the show. This worked perfectly, it was a 5 minute walk through the crowded streets to get to the theater. Made a reservation easily via Open Table, worked well. We were a party of 6 and the app only allowed us to reserve up to 5 people. I phoned the restaurant and they kindly modified the reservation, no problem.Open Table showed the address as being on 8th Avenue, we couldn't find it. Finally our kids texted us that it is on 40th, as shown in Yelp! so we were a few minutes late. Walking in, what a spectacular atmosphere! Huge open food prep area, they serve people sitting in the bar area using long paddles, how fun!Great server, fun, smiley, accommodating. Added to the pleasure of the dining experience.We ordered sushi for the 6 of us. Sushi was delicious. To me it was way above the standard sushi fare I have had, spouse felt it was good but nothing special. I really liked it. However, the prices are ridiculous. Server said that the $70 sushi special is really meant for one person. That's nuts. But, it's NYC and near the theatre; around the corner John'a Pizza serves a small mushroom pizza for $20. So if you don't want to pay the price, don't eat in Times Square. We wound up ordering enough for everyone to have sushi and not feel hungry, so all were 'satisfied', but nobody left full. Some had miso soup or salad, and we got some beer (2) and a warm sake. Because we were a party of six, restaurant added in the tip, 16.5%, reasonable enough. Total bill was $220 + tip for a total of $256 for six people, or $42/person and not full and only three of us had alcohol.

Then they make mochi by poinding it with a giant mortar and hammer made of granite with more yelling and grunting. It's nice when the women wait staff gets into it as well. You actually get a couple of pieces of the mochi to try after they finish grunting, which is a nice touch. The food was quite good.  Though the first time I tried it (2 yrs ago) was way better.  Seems like the quality went just a notch down but yet still a good experience.other than the show which is a nice novelty, there's better food elsewhere.

This was a suggestion made by a friend and I promptly complied without a second thought. Since this place is right where there is foot traffic it is bound to get busier during peak hours. So if you need reservation plan ahead or walk in and be ready to take a seat at the bar. Which is exciting and good experience. I was seated promptly and was given the drinks and the food menu. The items listed on the chef's choice are too much for $56 and most likely if you order off the menu you will spend under it and be satisfied. Its an upsell they are trying to make!Anyways, I had the pork bun which was good. Not out of the world but good. For two reasons I did not fancy it too much, one the pork belly was all fat! Like fat dripping out of the bun fat and the bun seemed to lack flavor. For my entree I had the chicken udon and it was delicious. Not too spicy and not too much overloaded.

It was around 6pm and the restaurant was empty except for a small group of 4 senior Asian women and men. When we walked in, we were asked if we had a reservation to which we replied we did not. The host then shouted something in Japanese I'm assuming, which then made everyone including the cooks stare at us as we walked to our table on the other side of the restaurant. We came to learn that all the employees just talk/yell to each other loudly in the restaurant with no regards to the people eating there. It was just a weird environment. The waiter was super friendly and checked up on us just enough but not too much. That is probably the only good thing I have to say. The beef skewers look like half of a small appetizer, which were $34 dollars, the asparagus appetizer had 2 stalks cut up and was $9. The miso soup $5 bowl is the size of a small coffee cup and the ""steamed rice topped with mixed vegetables"" is actually a small bamboo bowl filled with rice topped with boiled scallions and onion bits....The menu is NOT a good representation of what you'd expect. Everything comes in small portions and is wayyyy over priced. I probably wouldn't be so upset if the food was actually good, but it sucked and was cold. I don't know how this place is still standing, probably from all the tourists that overpay too much for anything.

The options were well rounded and I thought I would for sure get my money's worth. The ambiance was great. I really liked the decor and the energy was amazing. But, sad to say, the food was a bit lackluster. I know it's a restaurant week menu but I would expect the same quality as the normal menu. Restaurants should really take advantage of this since it can be a gateway for patrons to return and try other things on the menu.I ordered the sashimi appetizer and my bf, the beef tataki. The fish was alright, nothing amazing nor memorable. The beef lacked flavor and was overcooked.For entrée, we tried the sushi and Kobe beef skewers. Again, I was not impressed. The rice in the sushi was too mushy for my liking and did not compliment the fish. The Kobe beef was overcooked again and I was quite annoyed with that.I think this is a great date place because the atmosphere is very trendy and welcoming.

And, your in prime NTC, so I forego the high prices and order only interesting things, like the live scallop at $16.00.

5.0,2/21/2016,"Came into Inakaya at 7 on a Sunday night with my girlfiend and man were they packed. We waited for about 5 minutes to be seated at the Robata Counter. That itself was so interesting, being able to watch the chef's cook your food right in front of you. Our waiter was so friendly and nice.Food: The food was fantastic. I had the Medium Fat and Fatty tuna sushi, tamago, some cold soba, the US Kobe skewers and fried mochi. The fatty tuna was possibly the most delicious piece of sushi I have ever had, it was so delicate and it just melted in your mouth like butter. The medium fatty tuna was also delicious. The cold soba with their sauce was perfect, just the right amount of salty. The US Kobe skewers were probably the best tasting piece of meat I have ever had, they were so juicy and just was fantastic. The fried mochi was interesting, it was gooey like a marshmallow but with no taste, but the seaweed wrapper definitely helped with that, it gave it a nice salty taste. If anything, I wish the portion sizes were a bit bigger. My girlfriend had there Edo Course, which for $55, was well worth it, it was a lot of food and by the time we were finished we were both pleasantly satisfied. Ambience: The restaurant is a bit loud, but thats because there were so many people in there and the restaurant has good acoustics. There was a birtthday celebration which I found very interesting and entertaining. Service: The service was great, we were seated almost immediately. Our servers name is Aung. He is so funny and nice, he definitely helped make it a great eating experience. He offered suggestions on what to order and even managed to read my mind on what I wanted to order at one point.I would definitely recommend this place to friends, its definitely an experience and I would definitely come back here again.",3,0,1,Sam W.,"Gravesend, NY",51,12,20

Between our seats and the chefs were displays of food covered in ice. Thus, the chef had to pass our food to us with a large wooden spatula type deal.. which made for exciting pics and videos! Ordered the chargrilled oyster appetizer which came with 2. As the waiter put it, ""each oyster is the size of an iphone 6s."" And he was pretty accurate! They were cut up into pieces and soaked in a garlic butter sauce in the shell that was delish. Also ordered a yellowtail scallion roll and an uni hand roll. The handroll had a generous amount of uni and it was so fresh! Our meal was accompanied by cold sake in a wooden box that was very enjoyable. Did not catch the name of it but it was titled the December special off the menu.  Overall, this is a great atmosphere.

My dinner - seared codfish was amazing but could have fit comfortably on a saucer. And why after explaining that I have celiac disease and cannot have regular soy sauce or anything with flour or wheat, did the server bring me a rice ball cooked in regular soy sauce and acknowledged that it was made with regular soy sauce and then  ask me if he should take it away?

A bit dumbfounded, repeated the drink name a few times then he left only to come back and ask did we want anything in the martini?

I had actually called not once, but twice to confirm that we would be seated at the counter.Her attitude was unapologetic, basically insulting.We kept on explaining our grievances to the manager but nothing was resolved and no seat was available yet.My husband said that everyone makes mistakes and all he wanted was an apology from the hostess, however, she was still unwilling to admit that the whole fiasco was due to her laxity in not writing down the original reservation and her terrible attitude towards customers. As the manager was willing to take responsibility but reluctant  to ask her to apologize, I told him that his duty was to manage the business, yes,  but also  the staff  and that the hostess is the first person we meet upon entering the restaurant.When we told him that we would mention the terrible treatment we had received on Yelp and that the restaurant would be affected by our negative comments, he spoke to the hostess who came back to us, yet still had that terrible attitude and instead of admitting to her mistakes, this time she said "" I am sorry my manager made a mistake.""

I felt like I got ripped off when I was paying for food.Their nigiri tasted like onigiri rice ball but they were selling 7pc of nigiri for $25. I meant if it was good quality of sushi then I wouldn't complain yet it was something like you could get from Whole Food Market salad bar. I wasn't too hungry, and just wanted to try few appetizers with beers. When I finish ordering, wait staff was replying ""That's it??""- which sound like ""is that only you ordering?"" which makes my feeling not comfortable at all. I still ended up paying $70 plus tip thou. It left me only feeling of wasting my time and money. Never going to try this spot again.",0,0,0,Kyle Tweil K.,"New York, NY",169,64,44
4.0,10/27/2015,"It has been awhile since I have eaten here so it looks like they have changed the menu especially the a la carte items. I was stoked when I saw they offered spicy tuna with crispy rice and pork belly buns. The pork belly buns were excellent and pretty much on par with Ippudo's. The pork belly is juicy and love when they put the Japanese mayo in it. One thing that makes them kind of unique is they literally brand their name on the buns. The spicy tuna crispy rice, however, was not what I expected.  I thought it was crispy rice sushi rolls, which I've had at other places. But it's actually a small rectangular shaped block of crispy rice slabbed with tuna on top. I mean it wasn't terrible but there was nothing uber exciting about it. The highlight of the meal was probably the Yellowtail Collar Fish, as recommended by our overzealous waiter (will get to that later). I'll give our waiter the credit for recommending this because it is absolutely delicious. Unlike a regular fish fillet, the collar has a lot of meat and it's juicy. I also love the way they pan-seared the skin. It's very crisp. Be warned, it's a huge portion so it's a perfect dish to share. As for the service, I thought our waiter was trying way too hard to please us. I mean, I get it but it did get a bit awkward when he started to intrude our personal space. With that being said, I can't really give them a full 5 stars yet.",1,0,0,Rowena Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",480,1179,549
3.0,10/13/2015,"Came here at 645p on a Friday night with reservations for the counter. It was the start of a long weekend, so we didn't think the city would to crowded, as Friday nights out often are in NYC. Our table wasn't ready, so they asked us to wait until the couple paid their bill. At 7p, we were told that we could have a high table but counter would be longer since they had given the table to walk-ins who arrived before us. ???They seated us and another walk-in couple at the same time. Gave them the better seats along the wall with storage space. My sister and I had hand bags, umbrellas and coats -- they put us in the middle of the aisle where bar patrons were hanging out right behind our table -- no room to move, no room for our server and no place to put our things. Annoying but its a Friday. A holiday Friday, though.We had a LS voucher for the 6-course dinner, told the server we wanted one of everything, and were all set to go. Very easy! We also ordered a carafe of my fave sake. Order went in quickly. Later, when we had to order a second carafe of sake, it was just as easy as the first (all I remembered was that is was the sake listed under the one we had ordered, and server was right on the ball, remembering the name). Second carafe came out quickly, and we never had to ask for water refills. I appreciated the attentiveness.Overall, the food that came out was fine. Here's what I recall:*Tempura -- thick on the batter, limited pieces (1 shrimp, 1 sweet potato, 1 pepper)*Tar Tar and Carpaccio -- fine but not so fresh, but expected given this is essentially an izakaya*Grilled veggies -- PERFECT! This was their best dish, not a surprise given their robata grill. There was a nice juicy mushroom, eggplant, and asparagus. Recommended dish*Lobster with Kobe -- lobster was not so fresh, very fishy smelling; kobe was tough and chewy. Disappointing*other entree option was a miso cod, I think, with kobe. Again, meat was tough and chewy, better dipped in sauce. The fish was good but not the best cut of the fish -- more bones than flesh*Steamed rice with mushrooms was quite tasty. This was solid though not rave-worthy.*Yellowtail with scallion roll was mediocre; again, fish is not their strong suit*Dessert was unmemorable: black sesame ice cream (fine, but can you really mess this up? Texture tasted like there was coconut in it) and fruit plate (1 strawberry, 1 orange slice, 1 melon chunk and I forget what else).Overall, not worth $65 per person for the food, but I felt that the service was efficient given the awkward seating space.The vibe here is confused; its supposed to be an izakaya but its in a huge cavernous space with floor to ceiling windows looking out onto W40th Street. Definitely not an intimate izakaya setting. Perhaps we would have had a different experience at the counter, but overall, not a place I'd bring friends or recommend. Its just not worthwhile given everything else NYC has to offer.",1,1,0,Amy B.,"Manhattan, NY",1,79,9

I didn't leave super stuffed but was satisfied.My favorite dishes were the seaweed salad and the double steamed rice. Surprisingly the rice was really delicious! Both the 'surf' choices were great too. You'll have a rough time digging for that lobster meat though. The other choice, black cod, was flakey, sweet, and cooked well! We were lucky to have also been there for the mochi pounding ceremony where the chefs make and pound mochi to later be seasoned and served!

3.0,9/18/2015,"My friend and I were craving Japanese for a pre-theatre dinner and picked Inayaka, located in the Theatre District. It is right by Times Square so I would normally not voluntarily be in that area but if I have to because of a show (they usually start at 7PM), then it's easier to just eat there. I made a reservation on OpenTable for a weekday evening at 5:30PM. We arrived around 5:45PM and it was no problem as there were not many people yet. If you make a reservation on OpenTable, you have to sit at the bar but I actually preferred to sit there because the chefs will hand the dishes to you on a long flat paddle..very cool! The bar is great if you have 2 people because there is still a lot of counter space and privacy but tables would probably be better for larger groups. The hostess and servers were all very friendly and helpful. When you enter, they all chant a Japanese greeting to welcome customers! We shared a variety of dishes:Food:**Pork bun - only came with one pork bun and had a mustard sauce that I didn't like much. Pork was very tender though.**Grilled lamb chop - this was tasty but not much lamb**Scallops on skewer - 2 skewers each with 2 scallops and a vegetable..would recommend this oneRolls:**Negitoro - fatty tuna roll with scallions..this roll never disappoints**SalmonDessert:**Mochi ice cream - The portions are all relatively small so I was still a little hungry after eating the dishes above. The mochi ice cream really filled me up! They served scoops of green tea ice cream on top of each other with a layer of delicious mochi in between. I loved every bite of it and would highly recommend this to Japanese dessert lovers.I would give this place 3.5 stars for food but will give 3 stars because the price seemed slightly higher (is it the touristy Times Square location?) than other Japanese restaurants with slightly better food.

So well seasoned and well-prepared. We sat at the sushi bar, which was an excellent choice, because the way they served some of the dishes was very unique and fun. They also had some entertainment, like pounding a rice cake in front of us, that we then got to eat! It was all so well-executed though, as it did not seem contrived or over-staged. The energy and vibe in the restaurant was excellent, the service was speedy considering all the moving parts, and the overall experience was very enjoyable. I'm not sure about some of the regular pricing, which I imagine might be a little pricey, but everything was so good so I think it would likely be worth it - plus with the added entertainment value, I would definitely recommend.",0,0,0,jessica s.,"Manhattan, NY",50,30,1

Service is all right. They're not super super attentive, but they are accommodating, which is a definite yes in my book. The cocktails are strong, just the way I like them. You can tell this place is legit, the party right next to me are native Japanese, which bodes well for the food here (if the natives don't eat here, you won't want to either). On an additional note, they do this 3-die toss where you can win 20% off your next visit or a $50 gift certificate. Atmosphere is all right too, lively without being noisy or crowded.

Tran then offered to keep my medium shopping bag. Thinking space might be tight at the table I left her my bag.  When we finished dinner 3 hours later, I asked for my bag. It was only then that she realized I'd left a bag worn her.  Before then she was just ready to say goodbye.  She then told me my bag was gone.  I didn't understand. She told me someone else took it. I asked if they took my bag instead of theirs.  She told me they took their bag AND mine. She said she tried to find them but couldn't.  She said they were ""europeans"", walk ins and don't have their contact info.  She said she left the 2 bags on a highchair behind the small reception desk.  She said it's her fault, that she shouldn't have put the 2 bags together.  She had no clue why the ""europeans"" left 1 bag with her but took 2 upon departure. She said the bag was taken while she took her break.  I told her my brother's birth certificate, among other things, was in the bag. She just apologized and said sorry, and she would call if the bag was returned.  This is a very serious matter. DO NOT LEAVE ANYTHING (COATS,  BAGS, ETC) for them to keep four you.  Your items are NOT secure.  They do not keep an eye on anything and will leave the reception area unattended.  Anyone can walk away work any item while they leave the area unattended.  If I knew this I would  never have left my bag with them.  A ""sorry"" cannot replace a birth certificate among other things.  A simple ""you'll get a call if the bag is returned"" is not enough.  My sister mentioned that management didn't even tried to make any compensation to me for their grave error.  My reply was I bet management doesn't even know about this incident.  Tran probably didn't report this to the manager since she had to admit to her mistake and she didn't want to suffer the consequences of her carelessness.I doubt my bag would be returned.  Why world someone leave 1 bag but talk 2 bags when they depart?  I would assume they are greedy and thought my bag contained expensive items. Once they realized the contents were useless to them, thet could simply discard my bag and its content.

4.0,3/28/2015,"I got a livingsocial deal for the Kyoto 6 course meal here. I made reservations a couple days before and the process was smooth. The day of, I was running late and I was able to make changes with no problem at all. Everyone working here was very nice and friendly!For the Kyoto course, my friend and I started with the seared tuna salad. I was really hungry! So it tasted great! I really enjoyed it, though I thought there was a bit too much dressing. So if dressing is not your thing, tell them to go lightly on it. Otherwise, the bed of salad was fresh, the dressing elevated the flavor of the tuna, and the little bits of radish mash was also a nice tingle to the taste buds.Then we had a sashimi carpaccio and a tempura. We had a problem here, because the waiters brought out the wrong order. He took the one prepared away and the next took 15 minutes to come. My friend and I agreed that the wrong one should've just been on the house. Anyhow, the sashimi carpaccio had salmon with sweet fish roe, tuna, and yellowtail. Each had a different sauce to flavor it. And I thought the sauce flavoring was well done to match the different types of fish flavor. The tempura that came later on the other hand was weak. Three measly pieces of tempura the size of my pinky. Was definitely not worth it. I'd say opt for the carpaccio!Then we had grilled vegetables which were decent but not much to comment on. And finally was the main course. Three small pieces of Kobe beef and half a lobster. Nicely seasoned and the grilled flavor was good. They hand you the dishes on this cute wooden paddle thing, since with these courses you'll be sitting at the bar table! Next was the miso soup, yellow tail roll, and grilled rice balls. Miso soup is not your regular seaweed and tofu miso soup. It had parsley and another type of soy thing. The taste was fine though. The yellow tail roll was nothing special. The grilled rice ball on the other hand was delicious and addicting. Nicely grilled to a crispy texture and when you bite down, there traces of teriyaki sauce. It was also served with Japanese pickles to enhance flavor.Dessert was icecream. We got vanilla and sesame. Once again, nothing special. It was just annoying because we wanted to upgrade our icecream and pay the price difference, but they said we can't. So I didn't get a legit dessert craving. It's sad to have such a nice meal and end with such a bland dessert. Icecream is $5 on their menu. And they have other icecream based desserts ranging from $7-10. I would have happily paid the price difference to try something more unique. But oh well... Sucks...Overall, a great experience. Love the atmosphere. It's definitely different. The decor is nice with Japanese and modern fusion feel. The bar area is huge in comparison to its small space. I guess the bar area is their main thing. The staff are friendly and offered to give more tea always. However, there's a $3 tea charge per person which they do not tell you about! So if you don't want to pay that, don't let them serve you tea! Ask for tap water! Another thing is their fancy Japanese style restaurant. The seats are heated and they have a tush washer if you were ever interested in trying it. All in all, if you're here, go for the bar area experience to truly experience this restaurant!",5,0,4,Ophelia T.,"OAKLAND GARDENS, NY",150,173,91
3.0,3/22/2015,"This is a spiced up sushi restaraunt to justify its New York prices. In addition to good food and service, they have random ""shows"" like the mochi making demonstration, the clapping lights, and the singing and shouting at random intervals. It was more questionable than entertaining, but at least they're trying? Service is not fast, so plan on spending a few hours here.I ordered the Standard Sushimi, which has excellent tuna and yellowtail, but very meh salmon. Unfortunate. Rice was extra $2 so I ordered the Chazuke porridge for starch. It was bland for having all those bits of green seasoning, and seemed very ""common"" to me. They ended up giving me a bowl of rice for free, which was nice, but I ended up wasting most of it because I had already ordered too much.My friends enjoyed a few other things, but portions were small so each needed about two entrees to be full. There was an interesting tofu entree that came on a giant bowl of ice (unnecessary much?). Ramen looked good. Mochi nutella ice cream was good, but hard to mess up something with those ingrdients.Huge variety of Japenese drinks and food, & waiter very knowledgeable about menu offerings.

The only reason for them not getting another star from me was the protions. It was a light lunch for me with edaname as an appetizer and the kobe beef skewers. Only two small skewers. Delicious but not filling at all. Service was attentive and good. We had reservations which might be a good idea on most days. It wasn't packed it starting filling in on our way out.

5.0,3/16/2015,"It's been my second time at this restaurant and their food is still great. Inakaya creates an dining atmosphere as if you were dining in Japan. All the staff are super friendly too.I got the Kyoto course which is a six-course prix fixe. I started with the tuna and yellowtail carpaccio and salmon tartar. The fish tasted fresh and the accompaniment of the fish did not overpower the fish. After came the seared tuna salad. It had some sort of miso dressing and tuna tataki. The salad was pretty good. Grilled vegetables followed and that was done nicely. The next course was lobster with kobe beef. The lobster was delicious, not overcooked and I was glad to see the kobe beef with some pink in the middle. Both were great. After I got a wooden box with rice and mushrooms. This was a nice filler for me because all the previous courses were on the small side. Lastly, I finished with a fruit plate.I happened to be there when the staff was making fresh mochi. They even allowed diners to join in the making of it. They brought out two pieces for me. One with a sweet peanut dusting and the other was matcha dusted. Both tasted great.This is a great place to experience how Japanese dining is. I would recommend sitting at the bar as the staff hands food to you on long wooden paddles.

5.0,2/27/2015,"I came here for restaurant week and the choices were amazing! For the appetizer, I had the duck breast and the portion was small, just 3 slices, but the texture of the duck was perfect, not too dry but just enough flavors and easy to chew. For the main, I had the black cod with the rice ball. The cod was delicious, although it looked charred on the outside, but once you get under the initial layer, the fish itself was perfectly prepared, watch out for bones though! The rice ball was a little dry and very tough to chew since the outside was also a little burnt. Since the portions were small, we also ended up ordering some sushi rolls; we went with the Dragon roll and the Futomaki. The sushi itself was delicious, very decently priced for what you get. My favorite thing about the place was the overall experience and atmosphere, perfect date spot! The wait staff was very friendly and attentive, there were tables at the restaurant but the best part is if you sat around the kitchen, they serve you your food on these paddles and towards the end of our meal, and they had a little ceremony to thank the customers!

The entire restaurant is decorated with traditional Japanese items. We requested to sit at the counter because I heard the chefs serve you your food on giant paddles. Service was outstanding-our waitress was always attentive, quick, friendly, and helpful. The chef was also very sweet. For $38, I got to choose an appetizer, entree, and dessert. We also decided to drink their signature masuzake, which is served in traditional Japanese wooden cups. In addition to the items on the restaurant week menu, I ordered grilled riceballs, or ""yaki onigiri."" You get two and can choose from three flavors: miso, soy sauce, or ume shiso. I got the soy sauce and ume shiso. Watching our chef make the rice balls was entertaining; he had so much finesse while putting in so much strength in making them. Next, I got the tofu salad as an appetizer and it was a surprisingly large portion with four large pieces of tofu, lettuce, wakame, and ginger dressing. Next I had the beef skewers, but with just sirloin for an additional $3. Grilled well, I would have preferred a little more rare but tasted great. Finally, for dessert, I had the waffle ice cream, which is usually called ""monaka"" in Japan-not really a waffle but a crispy cone-like box surrounding vanilla ice cream, served with chocolate syrup and whipped cream. The flavors in Inakaya were all authentic Japanese. Definitely recommend to someone who is looking for an exotic experience.",2,0,0,Mia K.,"New York, NY",66,113,181

Upon entering, all the restaurant workers greet you loudly with Japanese. This is what they do in all restaurants in Japan, so I'm glad they did that here because it was my first. With my highly satisfied Japanese American husband, we sat at the counter area where we watched the chefs work their magic. Surrounding the chefs work space were many displays and piles of fresh living crustaceans hidden in ice. As I looked over the menu, I was amused by the lobster who was struggling to get out of the ice multiple times. We also watched the chef fry some fish and turn it into a piece of art by shaping it with sticks. I'm glad we sat at the counter because so much was going on!!!We had the Kyoto course menu: tuna & yellowtail carpaccio and salmon tar tar, seaweed salad & seared tuna salad, the grilled veggies (asparagus, eringi mushroom, & eggplant), surf & turf (kobe beef 2 oz), yellowtail & scallion roll with miso soup, fruit plate, & ice cream. The tuna & yellowtail carpaccio and salmon tar tar was AMAZING. Not only was it a piece of art, it was a masterpiece in my mouth. the tuna salad was also beautiful and was great in my belly.The seaweed salad is not what you would expect, they had 5 different kinds of seaweed with a dipping sauce, and we were new to 3 of the seaweeds; coral, black, & white colored seaweed.. where would I find such a thing in my fellow supermarkets??The grilled veggies were served to us on a long plank that the chef sticks out to us. Pay attention when they hand it to you, because i was busy taking pictures of him when he tried to give me mine Lol. The surf and turf was very good, the kobe beef was on a stick and it was about 3  cubes. I thought it was a small serving, but in the end i was actually full.. which was surprising to me. Everything else was fine, the rolls and desserts were good. Customer service was spectacular. When I headed over to the bathroom, the manager saw and went over to hold the curtain for me. Also they have the sophisticated toilets that squirt out water etc. While we were about to leave, they started doing a mochi ceremony, slamming the mochi with rubber hammers. When we got up to put on our jackets, the head chef stopped us and invited us to take turns smashing the mochi also. We waited for our turn as other customers joined in for pictures and videos. The chef then served us the mochi that we helped hammer. Great experience.I've lived in NY my whole life and I am glad I found this place.

In years past I was always a big fan of Inakaya but we missed last year and got back on track recently (and maybe we shouldn't have).The menu had changed and I should've known things were about to get dicey when I saw my favorite beer (Echigo, a rice beer) was no longer available.We did the one tasting menu (which was much different than the one we used to do in the past) that was almost seafood (except for a cold cube of beef) and by the end of it we were waving the white flag and had to surrender.  Minus one gross piece of fish - nothing was really awful, but a few things were hovering just above the 'acceptable' line.It was our first time to sit at the counter as well - thinking the gimmick might be fun but it didn't really add anything to the experience.The missus said she'd never go back.  I'm not that harsh (but since she usually treats...

Some great appetizers including oysters, but the high point was asparagus wrapped with bacon (you must order that when you go there). I didn't try the crabs legs but they seemed to be very popular.A variety of seaweed salads as well. As a condiment they also had a hot powder. They also had a good Sake selection. The staff was very courteous. This place is very clean. It is also one big open area with a high ceiling that is designed for all of the customers to see what the cooking staff is doing kappo ryori style. Our table was on the open floor. I think the experience would be more enjoyable if you sat at one of the chef tables where they serve your food from a large paddle. Everyone once in a while the manager will come out and staff will go through a routine for the entire restaurant.

The atmosphere is quite nice and the staff is very observant, for example, promptly  clearing plates and refilling drinks. We were fortunate enough to witness the staff make mochi and were even offered a chance to help wield the wooden hammers (for lack of a better word).

We were greeted with the maitre d' and the rest of the staff shouting VERY LOUDLY back and forth in Japanese over diners' heads. This continued throughout our meal whenever a patron arrived (allegedly it meant: Welcome, but probably: Another sucker!) and each time an order was placed. (A lot of orders were placed.)

Quality is all fair and pleasant, and their cheaply-priced sushi sampler (3 rolls for $25) is almost enough to overcome the small bites of average fish.

1.0,7/31/2014,"I decided on this place for dinner since we had some time to kill before Aladdin.  Let me preface this by saying my 1 star is based on the service or lack of service that we received.  Upon walking in, the hostess was pretty friendly so that was nice.  We were seated at the bar and there were a few empty bar seats and some empty tables.  The place is huge and the bathrooms are clean so that was good.  This place charges for tea so keep that in mind.  What Japanese/Asian place charges for tea?!?!  We ordered the RW pre-fixe menu which was $38 before tax and tip.Sushi/sashimi appetizer - this was good and it came with 3 pieces of tuna, 2 pieces of yellowtail and 2 pieces of salmon.  Looking at previous yelp review photos, it looks like this place used to give 3 pieces of each and is cutting back.  This dish was good, but the sashimi wasn't anything special or memorable.Black cod - this cod was delicious and melt in your mouth.  I love cod and this place made it very well.  The size of the cod was a decent size so not too bad.7 piece Nigiri - this dish was good too, but again, the pieces weren't out of this world or anything.  It was definitely nothing like Sushi Nakazawa nigiri.  I wouldn't come here just for their sushi and I would go to a Japanese place that isn't in Times Square.Black sesame and green tea ice cream - tasted good and nothing wrong with it so no complaints or comments.So food aside, which wasn't bad, but nothing memorable, we had horrible horrible service.  There is a chef that is immediately in front of you that serves you your food on a wooden paddle.  Our chef saw I was trying to take a picture and was so rude to us when we tried to take a photo.  I thought okay, maybe I'm not allowed to take pictures, but looking around, the chef that served the people right next to us, was so nice to his guests and stopped and asked if they wanted a photo of him and the paddle action.  I don't know if my chef was judging us or anything, but he had a really grumpy face and was so rude to us.  Each time we tried to take a picture, he glared at us making me feel very uncomfortable.  I was still working on my appetizer and the chef gave us our main entres before we even finished.  I get the bar is big and can fit that, but I felt we were being hurried and pushed out.  Sushi is best when you eat it right away and not let it sit and I didn't want it to be sitting there.  We were also given our bill without us even asking for it (my ice cream was barely touched!) and I was so shocked.  At that point, I knew we were being rushed out.  I didn't appreciate that since it's not like the place was packed and people were waiting to be seated.  There were several empty tables nearby so maybe we were being targeted.  Anyway, we didn't enjoy this place.  The food is over priced and I get this place is in Times Square so I am fine with paying a premium, but it was the service/lack of service that appalled me.  Do not waste your time and come here.  You won't be able to sit and relax and enjoy your meal.  Use your hard earned money elsewhere where you will be treated with respect.  It's really a shame since I really wanted to like this place and the food was decent.  Oh well, I guess you win some and you lose some.",1,2,1,Angeline C.,"Brooklyn, NY",64,623,346

The food was pretty good. But they charged for tea, which is one of my pet peeves. Any place with the balls to charge you $38 + tax and tip for a couple of small plates should give you some tea for free. It costs them a fraction of a penny to do this.I don't have any suggestions other than to order whole-fish dishes, and sit at the counter where you can watch everything go on. And please, don't order a california roll.BTW, in case you think this place is an izakaya, it isn't. Doesn't feel cozy at all. It's all sharp edges, tall ceilings, and business suits.

4.0,3/29/2014,"Fiance and I ate here last night for dinner at around 7 PM. I had a hankering for oysters and sushi and Inakaya fit the bill. Judging by the prices, I worried we might have to grab something else to eat after (always an ouchie when you've already overspent). The place looked pretty busy from the outside so I was expecting a bit of a wait. However, we were seated immediately at the counter, infront of the sake barrel. Nice modern Japanese decor and the atmosphere was fun in particular watching the mochi pounding where several customers participated. Overall, I didn't think the place was overly loud or kitschy.It took a long time before our waiter greeted us, before he actually took our order, and to get the check. He was no where to be found during these times and a huge reason why we were there for 2 and half hours overall. We definitely were feeling antsy at the end when we just wanted to pay and leave. While there were moments we felt kinda forgotten about, I wouldn't say service was completely terrible. The food, after ordered, came pretty quickly and our server did at least try to make amends for his mistakes. He gave my fiance the wrong roll (cucumber instead of salmon) but apologized, gave it to us free, and brought over the salmon roll swiftly. During the latter half of our dining experience, he was very consistent about refilling our water.We started with the Kumamoto oysters with ponzu sauce ($18 for 5.. normally I wouldn't pay that much for oysters but I wanted them so bad XD) and ika shiokara/ raw fermented squid. Both dishes were presented beautifully and the oysters were on a bed of purple dulse, daikon, shiso leaf, and wakame all lightly dressed only in the ponzu sauce. It was like having a side salad good enough for two. The oysters had just the right amount of ponzu already in each shell with a few pieces of negi. The condiments were placed with such a delicate touch, allowing the inherent flavor of the oyster to be the true star. The flavors came together so beautifully that as I write this review I salivate over the idea of eating them again. I've had ika shiokara before and really liked it-- the flavor of Inakaya's version was different a lot lighter and less salty than the one I had prior, but I still enjoyed it nonetheless.For my entree I got the 3 roll combination and chose two salmon avocado rolls and a spicy salmon roll. My fiance ordered plain tuna and salmon rolls a la carte and the salmon chazuke. Every piece of sushi was of excellent quality, fresh, so simple and yet so tasty. Rice to ingredient ratio was good, with the latter making up more of the rolls. I tried out just the broth of the salmon chazuke and it was very flavorful. I think they cooked the salmon in the tea.By the end of the meal, we were pleasantly full (definitely no need to get more food afterwards!) at about $88 (tax and tip included in that). It is on the pricier side and service was really slow at several points throughout our visit but I think the quality of the food made the experience worth it.",3,3,3,Marielle S.,"Manhattan, NY",78,73,16

The miso soup was good too and so were the California roll (but honestly...how do you mess up a California roll?) While the food was good, it was very overpriced. Not for New York, it was relatively average compared to NYC pricing...but it was too much money for the quality of food. Also, the service is SHIT. If you're anywhere except the smack dab middle of the counter, the waiters never come to you. When i went there it took them FOURTY MINUTES to bring our sushi to us (and we only ordered two rolls...I'm sorry, it does NOT take that long to make 12 pieces of sushi...I could have done it faster.)

Oh and when they serve your food, it's quite a bit of fun. They put your food on these long wooden paddles that they pass to you and its actually kinda fun. The food itself is good, but forgettable. Honestly I can't remember what I order there but I can say give the grill items a try. Anything on a stick here is great.

4.0,3/15/2014,"At Inakaya, we always choose to sit by the counter where the central cooking station is. All the fresh ingredients, seafood and veggies, are displayed on the side and labeled. There is also a huge keg like container that stores the house sake. The chefs cook right in front of you and food is served immediately when it's ready with a giant long wooden paddle. They also yell out the food/drinks that they are serving and whenever a new customer arrives at the counter. All of this makes for an interesting experience and you can be somewhat entertained even by just looking at them work.We tried different set courses and the restaurant week menu here at different times. Our favorites include the grilled yellowtail collar - meaty and tender. The grilled chicken thigh and ground chicken skewers are both flavorful and perfectly cooked. Grilled whole fish looks pretty cool - they skewer it in a way that makes it look like it is swimming. As for dessert, we like the Green Tea Mochi in layers with red bean sauce on top.During restaurant week they have a very nice sake flight for $18. You get three different types of sake with matching serving glasses/plates. It's a pretty good deal because the serving sizes are generous, although it looks like they cut back a bit the last time we were there.Overall, we had an enjoyable meal with good food, lively atmosphere and prompt service.

2.0,3/7/2014,"Went here during NYC RW and again it proved my theory that RW is NOT worth it! First of all, as a few yelper mentioned earlier, this place indeed has reservation issue! We booked our reservation through Amex Platinum Concierge. While when my hubby called a few hour earlier to confirm our reservation, THE HOSTESS DENIED IT, and said she didn't see our reservation at all! My hubby was surprised and found the Amex confirmation email, and read the email to her over the phone. She was super rude and argued that the reservation was for Saturday. BUT the email clearly stated the date. She said there was nothing available for the night. However after my husband requested to speak to the manager (also the contact person in the Amex confirmation email), she refused to transfer my hubby and then agreed to find us a table very reluctantly. When we arrived the place, the hostess recognized us right away after my hubby gave the reservation detail. SHE WAS SUPER RUDE AND SHOWING US A HORRIBLE ATTITUDE. The manager was standing not far away and I believe he has witnessed this scene but he didn't do anything. He actually took our order after we were seated and he was showing us a cold face too.We were pretty disappointed at this point, and only hoping that the food could make up the bad service. However, that failed too. We ordered from the RW menu plus some oysters. My hubby also had the paring sake. Everything was just par. The Sushi and Sashimi were okay, only slightly better than those deli sushi on the street. The beef skewers were quite disappointing.  I'm a picky steak-lover and I couldn't even swallow one piece of that meat on the skewer.  They were very dry and bland, and came in big cubes.

The different sake glasses just screamed Instagram material.The food is also made on the spot, with the freshest ingredients.I highly recommend their seared tuna salad (flavorful and juicy), stewed duck breast (delicate yet fatty), kobe beef skewers (grilled quality meat), nigiri sets (fresh and simple) and the monaka ice cream (ice cream filled waffles, basically). While the food was absolutely fantastic, I think their sake is what really goes above and beyond.I had their 3-course sake pairing, and it was definitely the best sake I've had.

I might have given this an extra star if I had never been to the two Inakayas in Tokyo, but having been there many times when we lived in Japan, the NY branch was a bit of a let-down. The food is comparable--veggies and fish which you can't help liking because everything is grilled. We love the mushrooms and the gingko nuts (Although not everyone likes gingko nuts, you should give them a try).  But robatayaki (restaurant where they grill food in front of you) isn't just about the food--it's about the intimate atmosphere of sitting around the grill watching the grillers and getting everything (even bottled beer) expertly served via a long paddle. There is no intimacy at this location--they took over a space with high ceilings, the seats around the bar are too low, so you cannot watch the chefs, and much of the restaurant is made of up tables away from the bar. On the plus side, my daughter, who had no preconceived notions since it was her first Inakaya experience, loved the food. And the prices in the NY location are far more reasonable than in Tokyo.

This would be a better place to come with just 1 or 2 other people so you can sit at the bar which looks like more fun. I saw food being passed on paddles and much more interaction. At our table, service was a bit of a struggle throughout - we didn't see our waiter for long periods of time and had to track down other people to get what we needed.The menu is confusing. It's not clear what the portion sizes are. For example, the scallops are tiny, which you wouldn't know because they are listed in what seems to be the main course section. The Inakaya salad is actually quite large, but the seaweed salad is much smaller. Etc...The seaweed salad was good as was the miso soup. The black cod was just ok and as I mentioned above, the scallops were tiny (and bland). The wagyu beef skewers were not cooked as ordered but those seemed to garner the highest ratings at the table. We were told to order 3-4 vegetable sides. We ordered 4 and that was not enough. I would suggest ordering 1 per person. The asparagus was very good as were the shisito peppers. Eggplant was less exciting.The biggest reason I can't bring myself to give more than 3 stars (aside from the service issues) is value. Not only was everything very expensive, but the portions were SO small. After a seaweed salad and cod ""entree"", I was hungry!",0,0,0,Rachel E.,"Houston, TX",110,983,299

Reasonable portion which will definitely fill you up if you choose to order the 2 preset menu: Edo and Kyoto.  Definitely like their grill rice ball with homemade soya sauce and their bamboo shoot and mushroom steam rice in wooden box.  The food from the grill will be served directly behind the cooking station to guests with a paddle like stick.

4.0,10/25/2013,"Pretttty impressed! The prices aren't too bad-- and they meet the standard the food sets. I had the 5-seaweed salad. Definitely for the folks looking to venture out the ginger salad. Some were good, others were not my cup of tea but I loved exploring 5 different seaweed anyway (sorta like a ""been there done that"" choice). I thought the BBQ eggplant was just OKAY but the outstanding choice here was the sea bass. It was not whole, just the filet, and it was DELISHHHH. It was the robatayaki style. It basically didn't seem like it was touched. Just put on a grill and yet it had such a great taste to it. VERY VERY fresh-- no doubt in my mind. ALSO, order the spicy mayo. One small thing I need to comment on is that if I'm paying for $25+ fish, can you please not charge me $1 for mayo? I obviously can afford it but its just an annoying thing to say at an upscale spot that I will be charged an extra buck to add some kick to my dish. BUT, with that said, that mayo was soo good, I would have felt less insulted if they said $5 for mayo. (I kid). Anyways, I definitely will go back and have some sushi- my colleague loved her sushi. I work in the NYT building so its super close and convenient.

The grilled onigiri was a nice side for the skewers, which were fine but nothing special. They do have a bit of a shtick where the patrons are allowed to help pound out the mochi and everyone in the restaurant gets a taste, but it seemed (as another review said) a bit like a Vegas attraction. Something I'd stay away from when I'm dining usually, but might be good for those who like dinner and a show.

3.0,9/8/2013,"Inakaya is interesting, to say the least. Located on the ground level of the ever so amazing New York Times building, walk in, and you'll be astounded by the size of this place. It's huge, and the place is on the quite fancy-ish side of things. Beneath it all, it's a very casual 'robatayaki', or basically, a Japanese grill-house/restaurant that specializes in barbeque. The upscale style and mixed menu imbues Japanese brasserie. This might be the only one of its kind in the Times Square area. Like those restaurants in the area, the experience can be a bit kitchy and theatrical, especially for newcomers. If you can keep an open mind, you will appreciate Inakaya no doubt. Maybe your wallet won't though ($$$).My coworker and I came here 5PM on the dot, the hour of opening. I wouldn't advise that though; the place was deprived of customers, but they have a ton of staff -- robed servers, robed waiters, a hostess at front. The experience might be more fulfilling if say it were a full house; pretty much a given. For one, you can either sit at a regular dining table, or at the expansive communal table of over 20 seats before the grilling area, where the servers are preparing and serving food in front of you. This ample and open seating arrangement and style makes it an ideal place for groups and larger parties.I unfortunately didn't come to try the barbeque, only for happy hour Sapporo and some sushi. Should you sit at the communal area though, things might start to get theatrical -- They'll serve your food/drinks off a long wooden paddle, extended from behind the grill station. The robed servers start greeting everyone very loudly in Japanese. When your food is served, they'll yell once more. If you get up from your chair, more hollering. The boisterous and animated Japanese will be the soundtrack of your evening. Interesting but semi-entertaining, nonetheless. It's not anything I haven't experienced before though. My guest seemed less keen with it. Yet again, this oversized restaurant was suffering from a dearth of customers at the time.We went with the three roll sushi combination for $25, namely eel avocado, spicy tuna, and salmon skin roll. The sushi wasn't bad at all. Perusing the menu, they have a good selection of items, including dinner Omakase ($60+), noodle and rice dishes, and of course, a variety of grilled vegetables and meats. But really, onion for $5? Mushroom for $6? Those have to be the best grilled vegetables on a stick to garner such price tags. Items such as Kobe beef can run up to $30 for 2 skewers. Overall, expect a pricy menu. Inakaya, to encapsulate, is one of those restaurants that are more about the entertainment value than about the menu. If you are around the Times Square area though and are looking for Japanese barbeque and/or just food in general, then it's a place to consider. I'm not sure if there is much reason for me to return mainly because I know of other places to get Japanese barbeque and sushi that would be just as good or actually better and at much cheaper prices. It's certainly a great place for larger parties though. Obviously, the commercial and thematic appeal of Inakaya is meant to attract tourists and newcomers.",3,0,0,Sara L.,"Manhattan, NY",721,552,3545
2.0,9/3/2013,"The word ""Omakase"" gets thrown around too loosely these days.  I walk by this restaurant all the time and had been meaning to check it out for a while.  When I saw an Omakase dinner deal for two on Bloomspot, I was excited by the prospect of finally getting a sense of the restaurant and the chef(s).  I came away from the experience with almost no impression at all.  The ""Omakase"" dinner consisted of just two plates- a plate of sashimi and a plate of sushi.  The sashimi plate was a little better than the sushi plate, but the fish selection and presentation were unremarkable.  Many of the same types of fish were included in both courses (mostly maguro and salmon).  I have no complaints about the quality or freshness of the fish, but it was just nothing special- an utterly unremarkable experience.  We did not know what to expect going in (and you probably shouldn't when ordering Omakase) but had we known that the ""Omakase"" dinner was just sushi and sashimi, we probably would have ordered additional items off the menu (e.g.- miso soup or something from the grill).  We were never given the opportunity to do so.  The waitress did not even ask if we wanted dessert.  The entire dining experience took 45 mins and we came away without any sense of how this restaurant stands out from the pack of Japanese restaurants in NYC.",2,0,0,Eugene K.,"New York, NY",0,15,0

The nigiri sushi was very fresh and delicious, but in my opinion the whole meal was overpriced and portions were small.

2.0,8/26/2013,"Welp, it looks super fancy, I'll give you that. Oh and they serve food on a giant paddle, that was interesting. This place is pretty mediocre in my opinion, despite their fancy appearance. Their service was a par and the food was just the same. At the rate they charge you for a roll of sushi or a carafe of sake, you would hope that it's one of the better place for it, but it just isn't there. The sushi was mushy and didn't really have the right texture you would find at a good sushi place. The sake was a minimal and unsatisfying.They have the right idea, but the price you pay for just mediocre food and drinks is not worth their fancy decor.

We had table reservations and there were plenty of tables available upon our early arrival; however, the hostess seated us at the worst (the highest traffic) table in the place--all others were reserved!? Although the table assignment was disappointing, we stayed and ordered from the Restaurant Week Menu. The quality and taste of the food was excellent; however, the portions were small. The service was attentive enough, but with the waitress upselling the menu: for an additional charge more you can get two skewers of kobe beef instead of one and tongue; for an additional charge you can get green tea instead of the house (buckwheat) tea; etc. The dark and wooden decor with no music playing in the background made for an ambience that seemed to be lacking positive energy.

The smell of the dish washing soap was present and overpowering the food!! When we request for a seating change, they said there is a big party of 8 coming in. However, there was NEVER a 8 people party instead it was 3 parties of 2- 2- and 4 of all Western ethnicity. Moreover, the 3 parties also came at different times, so the 8 center seating were never occupied at the same time.A while after we had put in a seating change request, two more customers of Chinese descent were brought to the seating next to us by the kitchen...which is also very strange....(sign of racism)During the whole meal, we felt like we were treated very unfairly.

I don't think it's racist to maybe wonder if they couldn't find a Japanese hostess for authenticity? My friend and I visited during NYC Restaurant Week, and for $40, the fancy prix fixe sushi was worth it. Obviously, the portions weren't overwhelming, and we ended up supplementing with side orders, but each bite was transformative. Even though it was Restaurant Week, it wasn't too busy when we went (around 6:30PM on a Sunday), and the hostess was able to seat us at the sushi bar. The sushi artists worked in front of us and served the plates on giant wooden paddles. Service was good and we drank lots of hot green tea (free).

It makes it feel like a fun occasion, in a festive way. I got the prix fixe deal for $40. In retrospect, I somewhat regret that decision. The sushi was fantastic, but the other things were so/so, small portioned, and basically just amounted to garnish. There was a meat item in the form of a patty which had something unintended in it which unpleasantly crunched when I bit into it, a small rock or maybe a bone, I don't know. But to get back to the sushi, it was absolutely fantastic. The thing I liked best was the tuna. They used a nice thick, solid piece of tuna. Most sushi places just give you a small sliver, but here, it was a succulent, moist, ... you get the point.

And thus a bit at the pricey end, which I don't normally object to, if the food is good. What's good- the high-end sushi- the top tuna cuts, and the botan ebi. Meltingly good, with all the right rich flavors of the sea. The robata which we did like- the jumbo shrimp, with uni, was very good. Charred to perfection, enriched with sweet uni, it was a highlight for even the whole week. What was disappointing- mushrooms, crab legs, and whole scallop- on the whole, done much better at Robataya, which this place competes with at some level. But the shrimp here is much better than at Robataya.As befits a tourist- (and perhaps expense-account) driven place, the decor befits a first or second date, with lofty ceiling space, well-spaced tables, and service with a smile.

3.0,6/4/2013,"FOOD: My favorite sushi rolls ever are eel/avocado and the disgustingly awesome Philadelphia roll (smoked salmon and cream cheese ... wrapped up in rice and seaweed. You're welcome, world) but other than that and my tendency to eat sushi as often as humanly possible, I'm actually quite squeamish. Salmon and eel are my favorite. Tuna is a distant second.  But the omakase here is two thumbs up. There's some confirmation bias sneaking in because if I'm shelling out big bucks for this, then the fish better be fresh. It was my first time eating abalone: interesting taste and texture, there's nothing else quite like it. It's like trying to describe fois gras or the oakiest merlot to someone who's never tried it before. I wasn't a big fan of the uni or the roe, but I might just have to add fatty salmon and yellowtail to my list of favorites. We didn't get to try a lot on the robata but I wish we did, for the sheer entertainment value alone. The chefs pick off their ingredients off the wooden platters right in front of you and then hand you the grilled plates on a giant wooden stick. We got the mackerel and the Japanese peppers, and lordy, the mackerel was divine. The little bones and cartilage got all fried up and crispy, so you didn't have to pick them out. I didn't really like the peppers even though they were marinated in something heavenly and soy sauce-based: way too slimy of a texture. AMBIANCE: This is smack in the theater district so what'd you think, you're not getting an overly dramatic show by half-hearted starving actors while you eat? First they dimmed the lights, put on some vaguely Asian-sounding windchime music, and then this wizened chef and his English-speaking translator proclaimed a beautous welcome. The girl doling out the English clearly could not wait for this to be over, she wouldn't stop rolling her eyes and sadly sighing after every sentence - I clapped extra hard for the chef who at least seemed to be having some fun. Then they lug out the mochi-slapping routine where they count off how many times you can swing a hammer at some dough. It's fantastic if you're shameless and you have someone who can snap pics to show your Auntie and Uncle in Kansas. SERVICE: The ""miss"" and ""sir"" after every sentence feels a tad forced.

I really like how generous the space was unlike many Japanese restaurant in the city.  The bar area was huge.  There was space for four grill chefs.  Behind the grill chefs there is another bar with two sushi chefs.  I though that placement was quite interesting, although I would have liked being able to see what the chefs were doing more behind the grill, the high surface and distance kept the heat away from us.Mushrooms - very disappointed in this dish.  It was grilled in foil with a bit of butter inside.  There was pretty much no flavor.  I wish they put it on the grill directly.Crab Legs - you can never go wrong with a nice long crab leg.  It was meaty and juicy, but not as sweet as I would like.Hotate - it was right in front of me so I had to order this gigantic scallop.  It was large, but perhaps due to its size it was no longer sweet.  This dish is so much better at Robataya, they spent a lot more time grilling it slowly and flavoring it.  Over here, it was just thrown on the grill with some soup broth.  The soup happened to have been better than the hotate itself.Jumbo Shrimp with Uni - this dish was delicious, but one of our two shrimps was a bit overcooked leading it to be very hard to remove from the shell.  The less cooked one was very good, the uni would melt in your mouth.  The other one, was such a pain to un-shell that it didn't taste as good after fighting to get it out.  On top of the fact that it was more cooked so it was drier.Sushi -  Ordered Otoro, Chutoro, and Botan Ebi, all of my favorites.  The Otoro and Chutoro literally melted in my mouth because it was that buttery soft.  Botan Ebi is just a textural circus of deliciousness.  It surprise me that their sushi was actually on par with some of the better places in town.  Unfortunately, there was a premium priced into every dish.  Beer was $8.50 a bottle, that is outright a rip off.  $3 for tea, that wasn't refilled until I asked for it each time.  I'm not sure what the rest of the servers do, considering the grill chefs are handing you the food.  They can't keep my tea refilled despite the prices they charge.We happened to be there in time for a thanking ceremony, which means lots of clapping and banging.  Then a mochi pounding shortly after.  They gave everyone a sample of two different flavors of fresh mochi after it was pounded and flavored.While I had a good experience, I also have to point out that something I had during this meal didn't agree with my stomach as I was still in the restaurant after we finished our meal.  Nothing serious, but I don't get stomach aches that easily.  I'm just putting it out there.I'm feeling generous today so... 4 stars for now.",2,0,1,Tina Y.,"WALL STREET, NY",227,269,2984
3.0,4/14/2013,"Atmosphere 3Decor 3.5Service 3Food 3This was one of the first Japanese restaurants I have been two. I came here a few times, first time being a little over 3 years ago, and we came here again, because we had a bloomspot Omakase deal. The decor of this place is pretty cool. I really like it. There is like a Japanese bar where the chefs do their robata and raw fish. Really cool, and very interactive. At night if you go at the right time, they also have a mochi making session, where you can help hammer the mochi. That's always fun. However, I have to say, each time we go, we end up more disappointed than the previous time. This time when we went, there were bugs crawling over the display items (which was on the bar table between the kitchen and the people eating. When we told the server, all she did was shrug and said it happens. I think this is a matter of hygiene. How do you expect people to enjoy their food, or more so be comfortable eating raw food, when you have bugs flying and crawling about (and this is a indoor restaurant...)Onto the food. I have had various omakase menus, and I definitely am expecting sashimi and sushi at a Japanese Omakase. In other ones I have had, there were a few hot food items, or at the very least we were expecting a miso soup. But we did not get anything like that, it was all raw food, sushi and sashimi. For my boyfriend and I, the omakase was too much raw food for our stomachs, we really craved something a little warm, maybe some robata, which Inakaya is known for. The fish was not bad, it was pretty fresh, so we can't complain there. But, it was really lacking variety and some signature to make it the restaurants own.",1,0,0,Crystal W.,"Manhattan, NY",116,30,29
4.0,4/11/2013,"It seems I've found myself a tasty little haven in Times Square... For those if you who spend lots of time in Times Square (like I do) the pressed sandwiches at 10pm or the loud pubs can get a little jarring, and going over to 9th Ave is sometimes a bit too far from the ride home. So the first time I came here, I thought-ah it's ok, just ok... And yet somehow I find myself here on a regular basis at 10pm, eating sushi. Tonight, I decided on trying out the kitchen. To the basics - The pros: it's always bright at the sushi bar. Normally I hate bright places, but sometimes I just want to eat, decompress, and read a play. The music (although crappy pop) is at a low level. The waiters never seem annoyed when I turn up at 10.30pm and order a feast. They are also very helpful and informative. The Sushi is good, fresh and presented in a standard manner. This is not my favorite sushi spot (That would be Gen in Prospect Heights) but I'm super happy that it exists in Times Square. The kitchen is pretty good: I'm sitting here having wolfed down a shrimp tempura (3 pieces $10), fresh, beautifully cooked and light, the Miso Mushrooms ($8) came in wrapped foil (not my favorite presentation style) but were sumptuous and rich. Warning, they are very buttery! Mmmm... And I'm about to dig into some rice balls ($6 for 2 pieces). The rice balls are not quite to my liking as the shell is a little too salty but the inside is moist and flavorful. The cons: the restaurant looks intimidating from outside. It's big, and cavernous. I'm sure it could be quite noisy when busy  I always get a splinter from the chopsticks. The only place this ever happens to me. Overall, a nice spot to hang out for food when alone, I probably wouldn't bring a date (be it friend or husband) as it doesn't fit my social atmospheric criteria (I'm crazy, I know), but I love coming here solo.",1,1,0,Melisa A.,"Brooklyn, NY",54,8,0

The food is better than average (try their cod - very good)  and as pricey as any other mid line restaurant with that caters to these types of diners - so expect a $200 dinner for 3 people with a bottle of wine, dinner and cocktails. The pros really were a nice ambiance, the Robata style dining, the mochi dough prep where diners can whack it with a large mallet shovel - makes for a great photo of your out of town guests! Also, the wait staff were very nice though at times a little slow but who cares when you are enjoying company and chatting about.

3.0,4/5/2013,"okay.. so I did come here with a bloomspot coupon for kaiseki 7 course meal for 2 at $49, so the price was great for what we got. We are two Asian girls who were starving when we walked in and walked out pretty sated - not stuffed. The appetizer trio was okay. The marinated raw baby squid was a bit fishy. The sashimi was fresh and the cooked two pieces of fishes were well seasoned and tasty. Second course was sashimi (6 relatively thick slices) with two types of seaweed and radish strings. Again fresh and melts in your mouth. Third dish was grilled stuff. nothing special but nothing offensive (3 slices of mushroom, 2 okras and 1 nice juicy piece of fish). Tempura was interesting. the breading on the shrimp was unusual with the bread crumbs being more toast-like giving it a lot of carb and so a bit oily. The crab leg tempura in theory sounds better than it tastes. Okra was nice though. 5th course was steamed egg with chicken and crab broth. YUM!! 6th course was 3 pieces of sushi - raw sweet shrimp, tuna, and another white fish. I really liked the rice. It was firm, it was sticky and you can still taste each grain of rice. I really enjoyed the sushi. dessert was green tea ice cream with jello pieces and red beans. DELISH!!! tea is $3 extra and after tax/tip with the deal, it was $35 per person. oh the service was not very good until the end.. when the waiter tried to make small talks.. ~Awkward~ but we did get a 20% off coupon from someone who looked like a manager ... not sure if i will go back again. maybe with out of town ppl who wanted to experience a different type of japanese dining.",4,0,1,Camy C.,"Derby, CT",298,305,123

You get to see how they prepare the food and drinks and enjoy the display of fresh ingredients! So we ordered the $43 6 course prix-fixe tasting menu which I thought was a decent deal comparing to some of the other Japanese restaurants, got the 3 variety of sashimi and a shochu drink (i wouldn't recommend shochu on the rocks, for some reason it tasted very dry...)6 course tasting menu1-3 - hmm these are more or less the same, grilled veggies, if you are a big meat person, don't expect too much out of these. Portions are relatively small, but still tasted really good!4 - Chicken thigh skewer and tsukune, this was really delicious! a bit salty but overall cooked to the finest. 5 - 7 varieties of sushi, no doubt really fresh and well made, if you love sushi, this cannot go wrong!6 - Layered mochi ice cream, possibly my favourite dessert in town! texture of the mochi mixed with rich green team ice cream = perfectionThree types of sashimi nothing much to say about this dish - high quality sashimiAfter having the 6 course and sashimi, we decided to order the salmon and salmon roe seiro meshi. The description of this dish could appear to be fairly plain, however once you order it, you won't regret it! It's salmon and salmon roe sitting on a top of a bed of fresh mountain vegetables and steamed rice.

5.0,1/8/2013,"There are two things that are abundantly clear.1) The Tokyo fish market is a surreal place that must be visited at least once your life.2) The airline industry is out of control and makes #1 very difficult.Lucky for NYC, there is a restaurant that brings the same quality, traditions, and experience of a real fish-market-side restaurant to Midtown.  Just to be clear, this isn't your 50% off sushi joint from Brooklyn, so don't expect to get away with a $30 check. My bill for 2 at the end of the night was more than I spent for dinner at Morimoto. Nevertheless, this was unlike any other Japanese dining experience I've had, Morimoto included, and that experience fits the bill like a glove.For a genuine experience, you will want to get a place at the bar where you food will be served out to you on a long paddle by a team of chefs who sit on their knees awaiting your order. There is an extensive drink menu, but the one I recommend is the lychee martini.  Plan on ordering at least 2. There is also a nice selection of soju and sake.  I also recommend starting out with a sushi roll or two. I can honestly say without a single 1/1000 degree of exaggeration that this is the freshest and the best tasting sushi I have ever had. Second best was in Aruba. This was the best.  First best.  I think by now, you are seeing why you can't just order one of something. For my entree, I ordered the sea bass. I was expecting a big entree plate with some jasmine rice, side of veggies, and the fish. Nope. Close your eyes and put yourself in the Tokyo fish market.  You point to a fish, they salt it, stick it on a skewer, and broil it. No heat lamps.  Fresh fish turned into broiled/cooked fish, on plate, coming to a paddle near you. Surreal - presentation, taste, experience, everything. And it's simple.  No complicated flavor infusions or molecular gastronomy here.  A meal at Inakaya would not be complete without an order (or two) of green tea mochi, freshly pounded on premise with a side of real red beans and vanilla ice cream.

It feels very Iron Chef. You have the Robata chefs in front of you behind the bar, and the sushi chefs at their own bar behind that. The food is fresh and set in baskets at the robata bar. So, when you order something, they pluck it from the basket and cook it.The chefs often lapsed into fluent Japanese, and were entertaining whenever you ordered a Sapporo. They serve you (if you're at the bar) with these large paddles that they are able to deftly handle. It was quite an experience sitting there!The waiters were very friendly, and I tried a little of this and that. The robata styled Japanese eggplant was great, but you didn't get a lot for the price. The Kobe skewers were the favorite in my party. And the sushi was great too. We even splurged on dessert (something I never do). It was so refreshingly delicious.When I was there, someone was having a birthday. The waiters took the birthday girl and made Mochi with her while banging a large drum in a very traditional feeling celebration. Then, they shared the freshly made mochi with everyone in the restaurant for free. The chefs recited a small speech in Japanese and had a female waiter translate it into English.

They could've all cursed at us, we wouldn't know. We sat at the robata counter and then the waiter took our order. We kept being interrupted when everyone bursts out welcoming people and our waiter says he's been there 4 years and he's given up welcoming people out loud. So funny. We ordered from the prix fixe and some items from the regular menu. I had the sashimi appetizer, the Kobe beef skewers, and mochi ice cream. My friend got the same thing except for the tuna salad for appetizer. We then got a spicy tuna roll to and grilled black cod to share. I really liked the sashimi appetizer. It was a good portion and I even like the yellowtail. I think the salmon, which is usually my favorite, could've been a little bit more flavorful. The black cod is by far the best! It was just so good! I was really looking forward to the Kobe beef skewers, but I think that dish fell short. I got both the tongue and sirloin and both were hard to chew on. It also came with grilled potato and asparagus. The potato was fine but 1 out of the three pieces of asparagus was not edible. Disappointed and wish I had ordered the salmon instead. My friend said her beef was tender and we both ordered medium, so I don't know what happened. The mochi dessert as expected was good. I love the texture of mochi. The green tea is subtle enough and not overpowering. I would come back to Inakaya and try more of their grilled stuff but I'm not so sure about the meats. The price can quickly add up (a piece of black cod was $20). On our way out, we saw that they have a special on Sunday's for 20% of sushi or something like that.

4.0,8/2/2012,"Went w/ a friend and had dinner from their restaurant week menu. Sat in the middle section of the semi circle sushi bar area (where the chefs serve you directly over the counter using that large wooden ... uh ... I don't know what it's called). Anyways, it adds a little bit of fun into the whole dining experience. My friend had the seared tuna salad and 7 varieties of nigiri sushi. I opted for the 3 varieties of sashimi and combo of US Kobe beef skewers (sirloin and tongue) w/ grilled vegetables. Although my friend's appetizer and sushi looked delicious, I think I did a better job choosing what to get this time around. Since it was only an appetizer, I expected just a few pieces of sashimi. To my pleasant surprise, I got 3 (or 4, I can't remember) pieces each of tuna, salmon, and yellowtail. Normally, I don't like tuna probably because I usually eat at cheap sushi places, but of the three, tuna was the best this time. Salmon (my usual favorite) was better than average and I don't remember how yellowtail was.The grilled vegetables were really good. Potatoes were cooked perfectly and the asparaguses were yummy. Now, of the two kinds of skewers I got, sirloin is the more expensive one (I know this because you can ask for sirloin only for additional $3). But guess what? The tongue was definitely better than the sirloin. It had a little bit of saltiness that I really liked. I thought the sirloin was just plain at best. We both got the layered mochi ice cream for dessert and it was the perfect ending to a fun dining experience. I hear the regular menu can get pretty pricey, so not sure if I'll come back for that, but it definitely was better than what I had expected.",0,0,0,Sung K.,"Flushing, NY",36,3,0

3.0,7/25/2012,"I went to Inakaya for a friend's birthday party and it was a great, albeit wallet busting experience.The evening started with an interesting and interactive mochi whacking demonstration where two workers showed how to knead mochi using a giant mallet and pedestal. They also got a few volunteers from the dinner crowd, including a few from my party, to take a chance at whacking mochi with giant mallets. They also let us taste the fruits of our labor with free mochi for everyone in the restaurant, one flavored as peanut and the other as green tea.As for the food itself, it was pretty good. The grilled mushrooms were probably the highlight of the appetizer skewers, though we needed multiple orders to feed the table. I ordered a simple set of cold soba noodles and chicken thigh skewers. The soba noodles were great with a large serving of noodles with the usual dipping sauce and wasabi. Went great with the chicken thigh skewers as my protein. It won't leave you fully satiated if you have a big appetite but it's good and one of the more affordable meal options on the menu. My friends had mixed reviews about the place after their meals, with most items being way overpriced for what hey offered. The worst value had to be the Kobe beef skewers at $30 for two paltry skewers and not much else.Overall, I might go to Inakaya if I was going out on a date or something similar but it's just not a great option for a casual dinner at the prices they're asking for.

2.0,7/8/2012,"This is an example of a place where the quality of the food is all right, but unfortunately, as another reviewer had pointed out, the quantity of the food when cost was concerned, really made it overall not balanced and not worth it.  I ordered their Chirashi which costed $22 - that would have been fine if you had received enough of it, so you left full and content, but sadly this wasn't the case - and as most others will tell you and also as we had soon found out for ourselves, there are many other Japanese restaurants in NY where they will offer you good food and quantity for a more justifiable price.   Also, on a side note, their miso soup was salty and tasted as though it's been left simmering since early in the morning - this is coming from family I ate with whom have had miso soup pretty much their entire lives and know how to properly cook good miso soup at home.Service we received for the most part was good, except towards the end, when the server who came by to pick up our bill just quickly grabbed everything along with the $6 tip we left on the table.  We left more than enough for our bill and we were waiting for our change, but it never arrived and the server who snatched our bill + tip, apparently just assumed that everything we left was all for them.  So basically, the server received a $16 tip, for lunch, which is obviously way too much, even considering how much our final bill came out to.  Needless to say, we were very turned off by this; yes, we could and should have specifically asked them for change when he came by to grab our bill, but then again on the same token, they shouldn't just assume and they do need to understand that it is also their responsibility to ask their paying customers if they need change as well, so in terms of offering good customer service, it does work both ways.  Right before exiting, we asked for our change that we had originally never received and after some waiting, we got it back, but we all agreed that our experience eating here had ended on a sour note and concluded that we will never eat here again.",2,1,1,Kahanalei M.,"San Francisco, CA",274,193,650

4.0,5/20/2012,"Summary:  Great first date place given all the ""stuff' going on.  Food is fresh.  Avoid the tables near the kitchen.  Make a reservation to sit at the bar. Four stars, only because it gets a bit too much Times Squares Tourist traffic.Atmosphere:  It's a little loud, but comfortable for conversation.  It's nice Japanese decor that looks $$$, but is priced a bit lower.  There are three seating areas.  A large bar away from the door is a bit better than you'd think.  The center area is ideal for large groups.  The bar is a bit more fun that you'd think.  I'd actually select the bar, where as with other places, this is a punishment for those who did not make a reservation.  This is with the exception of the seats that are closest to the kitchen.  It primarily gets the tourism off of MUJI and the non-locals in the district. The Service:  It's your typical Japanese wonderfully polite service.  They were slightly slow for us, as we did not have a reservation and were sitting in a corner.  I guess you don't put baby in a corner, because the waiter can't see her.  That said, I wouldn't dock them for this. The Staff works together and makes sure that your party isn't overlooked.The Food:  They have a  5 course prix fix/ omikase for $40+3 for the dessert. I had the variety sushi, which was nice.  The fish was fresh (I was there on Friday).  They have a Sunday 20% off sushi special. I'm curious enough to break my no Sunday/Monday Sushi rule.  Everything was pretty tastey, save the desserts.  It was a green tea and peanut buttery mochi.  If you need a little something sweet, it's ok for $3.  I would skip it though if you were full.Why for dates:  The staff performs a number of random ceremonies. There is one rice beating ceremony that occurs near the large tables.  There is another thank you speech  occurs in a very Japanese way at the sushi station.  They also pass the sushi via oars to those that sit at the sushi tables.  I like the whole concept of taking my food off of oars, even though you're essentially serving yourself.  There's enough craziness going on that if you run out of conversation during the date, the restaurant provides it.",10,4,8,May L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",617,466,229

4.0,2/24/2012,"Came here for my friend's birthday dinner last week. We made a reservation and I was able to sit even though my 2 other friends hadn't shown up yet. The restaurant is easy to get to, since it's near Port Authority and is quite spacious. Their whole concept is a large open hearth, with various baskets of fresh ingredients separating the chefs from the guests. It's like a ginormous hibachi. It was a good thing only 3 of us came to dinner because otherwise, it would have been quite antisocial. We all ordered the 5-course prix fixe for $44 and while this might sound a little pricey, we were really glad to have ordered it. The first 4 courses were various grilled vegetables like asparagus, shiitake mushrooms, Japanese eggplant, taro, ginkgo nuts, etc. While these are simple ingredients, the chef coupled the ingredients for every dish so that they balanced out incredibly well. Also the smoke and flavor from these seemingly simple dishes were absolutely delicious. For the 5th course - the ""entrée"" - we had 3 choices to choose from, a fish dish, assorted sushi and kobe beef. The fish dish was the least exciting. I absolutely loved my sushi plate, which had 8 pieces of the usual suspects - one of the freshest sushi I've had - but I hear the kobe beef is more of a house specialty. I was comfortably full afterwards and incredibly satisfied.There are definitely tourist-like components to this place. For a guest's birthday, the entire staff stood perfectly still, bellowing Japanese with English translation afterwards and bowing several times during the course of the announcement. Say what you will about it but I thought it was a bit gimmicky. I also noted that more than half the customers were non-Japanese.

3.0,2/23/2012,"Smaller but every bit as kitschy as expected, this branch of a Japanese robata-yaki is big on show but falls short on food quality.  Honestly didn't plan to come because prior research didn't seem promising, but they were one of three Japanese restaurants hosting a shochu tasting one evening, so we dined there as well.As typical for a robata-yaki, the centerpiece seating is around the robata, a big U-shaped bar with basins of food and decorative items sitting on what amounts to an ice moat between the seated and the chefs/staff.  To be served, the staff deliver food on long-handled wooden paddles (similar to the ones used to move pizza in and out of ovens) and you can pluck it right off.  Seems to me that if you dined here, this is the seating to ask for, even if you don't get much view of the actual grilling.Having said that, we sat comfortably in the table area, so no theatrical food delivery for us.  Service was mostly fine, sometimes absentminded or just absent, but the manager (who was all over the place) was attentive and a hoot.  There is also a minimal bar with some seats over on the side.  Ambience was lively, lighting bright, noise level energetic.  At one point in the evening, all the staff gathered by the robata to lead a wellness chant with hand-clapping.Food include kitchen options (salads, hot and cold appetizers, rice and noodles dishes), robata choices (listed by individual item), and sushi/sashimi.  I wish Japanese restaurants don't feel compelled to add sushi/sashimi options when that's not their niche, but I can see it as a good business decision to (brace for the sushi snob comment) appeal to less discriminating palates. I eat out a lot and don't always seem to pay much mind to prices, but I couldn't help but find the food at Inakaya expensive, and this was only while perusing the menu.  Average robata prices are $6 for vegetable, $8 for the few chicken choices, $20-30 for wagyu, and most seafood north of $20.  Robataya in East Village clocks in a few dollars cheaper in most categories, and by most accounts, is the better robata-yaki (although I've yet to try it).  The excellent Yakitori Tori Shin has even better prices, averaging $4 for vegetables and $5-6 for chicken.  In any case, we ended up ordering without too much thought about pricing.The better robata items included charred shishito peppers ($1 per pepper!) and the succulent, beautiful yellowtail collar ($38, shipped from Japan).  Everything else was not memorable: okra, roasted rice balls, and US Wagyu tongue skewers.  Everything we had, good or less so, lacked a grilled flavor.  Just for kicks, ordered a single soused mackerel sushi to try; better than neighborhood take-out sushi, a long way to go to really be worth having.  Happy hour Japanese beers a plus.  A whole grilled bronzini ordered by others at the table came whole and arranged like it was swimming, and reviews on taste were good.So who should come here?  Maybe better to say who should not: robata aficionados, if you've got standards for any grilled foods, if you want a non-touristy spot, and/or if you want more substance in a dining experience.  That still leaves a lot of people, really, and Inakaya is crowd-pleasing, excelling at presentation, even if it lacks spirit.",1,1,1,Valery C.,"Forest Hills, NY",56,837,9616

I had the sashimi on rice combo. Again, not a whole lot of food, but the cuts were very high quality, interesting non-standard types of fish and cuts, and by the end of it, I was quite full so definitely no complaints. The interviewee had the cod fish, which seemed quite small, and didn't come with any rice which I found very odd.

So, we already felt rushed.When we sat down, the waiter asked us if we wanted something to drink.  We ordered a lychee martini and a plum wine, based on his suggestions. He also asked us if we wanted some edamame. We said sure, not thinking that he was ordering an appetizer for us, but sure enough the tiny bowl of sorry looking edamame was on the bill ($6).We ordered  the salted flounder ($25) and the Kobe beef skewers ($28). The fish arrived first. It was tasty but it was a lunch portion at a dinner price. The sushi arrived next. It was nice tasting - fish was fresh, rice was perfect, and the seaweed wasn't tough.  But it didn't look especially fantastic.  In fact, I think I could make better looking sushi. Finally, the beef arrived.  The skewers had 4 pieces of meat about the size of a cotton ball.  They were undercooked and tough.  Neither of our entrees came with rice, so we had to order it.  We also ordered a side of Japanese eggplant which was inedible.  The drinks were ordered were way too sweet for our palette, but our indifferent waiter just wanted to get out of there.  It took us three attempts to get some water.I don't mind spending over $100 for lunch - if it's worth it.

5.0,9/9/2011,"Last night I went to Inakaya for the Udon Noodle event, which was hosted by SANUKI Project. They had the Udon Chef Master, Osamu Miyoshi in the house making hand made noodles! It was such an amazing event, I was able to sit at the table right next to where the chef was and watch his work his masterpiece food. What made this event that much more special, was the fact that chef Osamu Miyoshi lives in Japan and comes to NYC for 2 days once every year! So needless to say these were some very special noodles, ones that I'm happy to say I've tried! The udon was served in either a half or whole portion, nicely priced at either $7 or $13. These udon noodles were Sanuki udon noodles. These noodles were made with cold dashi soy sauce, and topped with scallion, fresh lemon, ginger, grated daikon radish and sesame seeds. The broth the noodles were in took on a sesame like flavor but it wasn't too overwhelming. The noodles had not only a nice texture to them but they also had length, making them fun to eat! This was my first time having Udon, and I think if I ever have it again, I might be let down. And of course we had to get dessert. I decided to go with Taiyaki Ice Cream, which was a fish shaped Japanese waffled filled with sweetened red bean paste and served with Vanilla Ice cream. The presentation of this dessert alone was awesome, almost too pretty to eat. The waffle was filled with the red bean paste but it wasn't as sweet as some of the red bean paste I've had in the past. There was also some whole beans left within the waffle which I enjoyed. The fish was swimming in vanilla ice cream, that was accompanied by a little drizzle of red bean paste along with some chocolate and caramel. Having the waffle, topped with ice cream and a little chocolate and of course whip cream, was a heavenly combination! My friend got the green tea ice cream which I was very excited to try because I had never had it before. I love green tea so I knew I was more or less likely to enjoy the ice cream. Within the first few seconds of a having a bite you could really taste the green tea flavor but it wasn't too powerful. I look forward to having this ice cream again sometime soon! The decor of this place was really great as well. It was very modern and a little more formal. It's a pretty big space and they have a huge section where they not only cook but also do the sushi rolls. You are able to sit around this area and watch all the action. The uniforms were also very unique and really gave you the feeling of dining in an actual Japanese Restaurant that isn't located in Times Square! The service was attentive and helpful. I would like to try their tasting menu which is priced quite nicely as well for the amount of food and type of food their offering.

4.0,9/7/2011,"Tonight after dining at Inakaya, I can't help comparing it with Robataya near St Mark, as both are Japanese grill bars having similar settings and serving similar food.Decoration - Robataya is cozier and cuter, like a little pub.  Inakaya is more modern and up-scale, as a more formal restaurant.  When I was at Robataya earlier, I was wow'ing about their huge grill bar, but today I realized it was just half the size of the grill bar at Inakaya.  Seating wise, Inakaya is more spacious thus more comfy.Drinks - both places offer sweetly tasty plum wine.  Inakaya also has plum mojito.Food - Funny thing is that Robataya's grilled food was not as impressive as its non-grilled food.  I'd think it is a bit embarrassing for a grill bar.  On the other hand, Inakaya makes excellent grilled food, though I'd suggest skipping their sushi completely.  Inakaya's prix-fixed menu is worth a try, and their mochi ice-cream is totally different from regular Japanese mochi ice-cream - you just gotta try it and you'll love it!Overall, I'd recommend Inakaya over Robataya, though it's also pricier.",1,0,0,Christine Y.,"New York, NY",110,133,295

5.0,7/30/2011,"I came here last week for restaurant week with my friends from upstate. We decided to try something Asian this time and since some of them do not prefer sushi, I looked around and decided on Inakaya. Made a reservation for 5 people at the barbecue table to make things a bit different and was promptly seated. We picked out a bottle of Sake for starters and decided that we would all do restaurant week. I went with the beef for appetizer, Chilean Bass for main dish and taiyaki for dessert. Our friends also tried the plum wine, Japanese vodka (name eludes me), and I had an import beer myself. I was afraid that restaurant week portions wouldn't be enough for everyone so I decided to order a side of grilled rice balls seasoned with miso soup and potatoes and mushrooms from the bbq. We all shared and the bbq is simply fantastic, even one of our guests who usually disliked mushroom thought it was pretty good for something he usually doesn't go near. Everyone enjoyed their portions. No complaints and not to mention everything being served to you from giant spades made it interesting.At the end of our dinner, it was apparently someone's birthday so they announce it and in polite Japanese fashion, spoke a few kind words and wished them good luck. A lot of humility even from a script that was read (unlike some restaurants where everyone knows it's your birthday and you get sang some humiliating song because happy birthday is copyrighted, we've all been there). I would definitely bring someone here for their birthday in the future.After everything was ordered, it came out to about with tip 480, mainly the sake, plum wine and other alcoholic beverages running an extra 130 or so. The food prices were modest for a high end restaurant and most of the BBQ menu costed 5-8 a dish with a large variety of choices.I would definitely recommend bringing friends and family here if you want to make an impression or just to have a good time.",2,0,0,Brian T.,"Staten Island, NY",149,23,10

The first course was the beef tataki and I'm sorry but the one I had at Matsuri the week before was just a million times better. The sushi was incredibly underwhelming and dry. The taiayki ice cream was good but there was just so much ice cream that by the time I was done I felt like my entire dinner was ice cream because it had taken over the dry sushi & the not so good beef tataki I had prior to it. I came out feeling like I just came in to eat ice cream for $35 :/ Very disappointed. For the prices they charge on a regular menu there are just better places I'd rather go to. If they cut their prices in half, then it would actually be pretty decent since the food is pretty average.

3.0,2/3/2011,"Slow service but fresh sushi, and cute Japanese traditions.  Overall not worth coming back.  Maybe I wasn't really in the mood for Japanese last night after all.  I came here for restaurant week last night with a girlfriend who was craving ""healthy"" food a we decided to try this Robataya fare.  Firstly, it was one of the few places that allowed me to make a resservation the same day- albeit  it was 6pm and of course no one was really dining in this vast place (located in the beautiful NYT building- with a vast sign that makes you feel a little touristy when dining here. Touristy, it is, with specs of Japense art strewn about and maybe a few Japanese diners) . Decor is big and grand, a giant Japanese warehouse with wooden panels, traditional Japanese art, cherry- wood tables.  There's a coat check, and of course there's the traditional shouting and clapping when a patron walks.  If you can, try to snag a spot at the bar as it seems more fun-- the chefs hand deliver you  your meal through a long wooden panel. We went for the resto week menu that looked varied, with a few supplements here and there. As I mentioned before, service is slow so don't expect them to come by too soon to take your order- this I don't have too much of an issue with (as I wasn't in a rush and I totally get the ""appreciate your meal"" idea). What I don't get is why other point of service were off-when my friend asked what kind of ""grilled vegetables"" were in her entree, the waiter didn't know.   He had to ask one of the chefs behind the bar- and then reported potatoes and asparagus.  When my friend asked if she could have more asparagus and less potato, he said no. *shrug*, I get it but it's not like either of those things cost much.My friend's lineup: 1) the sashimi app- tuna, yellowtail and salmon. She said it was good and fresh.2) the US Kobe Beef Skewers with Grilled Veggies (aka aspragus and potato). This was itty bitty in portion- 2 half size skewers, and 3 pieces of asparagus and potato. I suppose it's because it's high quality and my friend really did think they were tasty (along with a nice yakitori sauce). But I don't  know... looked more like an app. 3) Mochi Ice cream- Dessert I'm leaving for the last paragraph. My line up: 1) the chwan mushi.  I'm a big fan of sashimi but I got the egg custard (chwan mushi) instead beause I was getting the sushi entree. This I regretted- the custard was so watery and really not my thing. I can't say that it was bad, it's just not my thing... I hardly tasted any shrimp or chicken at all... maybe a random mushroom, or spinach. It was just not flavorful or good- like a tofu texture but I feel tofu actually has flavor... just saying.  2) The nigiri sushi entree. I'm more of a fan of the rolls (Sushi lovers, don't murder me), but I really do love seawood.  This nigiri was just ok... the fish as amazing and fresh, flavor and each kind had a strong flavor; esp. the cooked eel with its sweet sauce, and the tuna/yellowtail... only passable was the shrimp but that's how I always feel about raw ebi.  The reason it was just ok is because the rice didn't hold together with the fish- so much for that hard pressed vinegar. It was falling all over the place. Still...fish was great so I gues the brunt of the dish was on point.  3) The ""Taiyaki"" fish pastry with red beans and ice cream... read onDesserts: So, hands down if you come here for restaurant week or not, get the mochi ice cream.  I, having countless mediocre experiences with this frozen delight, am not a huge huge fan of mochi. But let me tell you: the way they do it here is NOTHING like the frozen globs.  The mochi desserts, though small, was thinly sliced layers of mochi... stacked in something that goes like this: mochi layer, green tea ice cream (always yummy) , mochi, ice cream, etc etc to build the cutest little tower.  Red beans, whipped cream and cherries were floating around the plate.... it was just delicious. The mochi was so light and fun to eat and the green tea ice cream super flavor. Highly recommend. My dessert was not as good, but ok.  The taiyaki is fish shaped pastry that is filled with red beans.  There was tons of red beans all over the dish, also adorned with whipped cream and cherries. It was a litttle red bean overload. The pastry was nice and crisp- and better baked than the taiyakis you get at those Japanese supermarkets. But overall, get the mochi. Given the low/somewhat unknowledgable service, small portions and and meh choices,  not the best RW meal I've had. I saw a lot of more interesting things on the regular menu (weird Japanese stuff you'd imagine) , naturally but I still think places should showcase something enticing to bring you back. I liked the fresh fish but otherwise, I don't know.

5.0,12/27/2010,"This is my favorite Japanese restaurant in the city! Absolutely the best, most authentic, Japanese cuisine I've tasted in years!!Great for casual gatherings, dates, and business dinners. There is no dress code. I come here in t-shirt and jeans while some people come here in suits and cocktail dresses. It all depends on what you want to make out of it.Customer service is superb. Staff members are all alert and attentive.No matter how busy the place gets they will gladly help you even with the smallest requests. The only downside is that when the place just opened all staff members were Japanese, and now that it's been open for more than a year they have been replaced with other ethnic persons. I'm not being racist. They are all friendly nonetheless and make me feel welcome every visit. It's just that when me or my friends have questions about certain dishes they can't answer clearly. As for the dishes, I recommend their kinki (red snapper- price may vary) and sushi (the nigiri, not the rolls).The chefs KNOW their seafood here. The grilled Kinki- They know how much salt to rub, how to flip the fish so it gets cooked evenly from the core but not too cooked overall, and keep the skin crispy and slightly peeled when served. The end result is just heaven. For their sushi, their rice does the talking. They cook it just right and add generous amount of vinegar. They apply pressure just enough to hold it together and not to make it a chewy clump of rice. That topped with their imported, specially selected (so they say), and once again generous slice of sashimi skillfully cut to shape makes you dream about it day and night. At least I do.One warning is that the portions are relatively small here.The menu does say okra for $6 so you think it's a lot of okra or okra with garnish or something but its literally just 4 small okras, amazingly grilled, with maybe dipping sauce on the side. It's definitely worth the price, but be prepared to spend $200 for two people.",3,1,1,Atsuko Y.,"New York, NY",79,107,64

Beef came with a bland sauce that we did not like much.My main problem is that they charge for Ocha (normally complimentary bland green tea) $3 per person.

3.0,12/4/2010,"Inakaya is a robotayaki, a Japanese restaurant where food is grilled in front of the customers and served as soon as it is off the coals, either plain or with a simple dipping sauce to accompany it.  At Inakaya the cooks sit in the center of the room, surrounded by a semi-circle of wonderful looking meats, vegetables, fish, and shellfish.  Opposite that is another semi-circle of counter-seating with space for thirty or so diners to eat and watch the chefs ply their trade.And there is plenty to watch because Inakaya is as much a theatrical experience as it is a restaurant.  The cooks pass food to the diners on paddles with long wooden handles.  They shout out greetings as customers come and go.  And frequently they pick up a set of large wooden blocks, beat them rhythmically, and lead the entire establishment in Japanese chants.  Why do they do this?  What are they saying?  Who knows.  But it seems to make them happy, so I say, why not?  Along with their location, on 40th Street just off of Times Square, it all combines to create a hybrid experience, a half traditional Japanese restaurant, half chain theme restaurant.The food itself is fine, mostly on a par with other robotayakis I have been to.  The prices, however, are not fine.  Inakaya is the most expensive robotayaki I have come across, by far.  Usually an item such as a beef or chicken skewer would cost between $3 and $5.  At Inakaya, they are priced between $8 and $10.  Similarly, vegetables and seafood are approximately twice as expensive as at other robotayakis.  Portions are small and dinner here quickly becomes an expensive proposition.  In fact, if the prices were more reasonable, I would be awarding four stars instead of writing a three star review.  Yes, I know they have to pay the rent, but maybe they should have thought twice before locating the restaurant in the new NYT building.All is not lost, however, because Inakaya offers a five course tasting menu for $35.  This is the way to go - with three vegetable courses, a chicken course, then a choice of beef or fish, it does take some of the sting out of the cost of eating here.Wash it down with some sake, actually reasonably priced at $11 to $13 for a carafe, and you'll be doing just fine.",3,0,2,Joe K.,"Manhattan, NY",13,80,89

We thought like most restaurant week places the portion would be tiny but in the end I was proven wrong...They are known for their robatayaki (grill) so most of their menu items resembled tapa dishes although I saw the fish being a huge portion seeing how they give you the whole fish. I had the black miso cod fish with a side of king crab robatayaki style which I thought was excellent.

2.0,7/14/2010,"I came here a few nights ago with a few friends from Japan thinking it would be interesting to get their opinions on how the food was at a ""nice"" Japanese restaurant. Suffice it to say that I did not need to hear their thoughts.I went for the restaurant week menu and chose the 9 varieties of vegetables for the appetizer, 7 varieties of sushi for the main course, and dessert-whose-name-I-can't-recall but was a sort of waffle shaped like a fish, stuffed with red beans and surrounded by ice cream. The appetizer was huge, and consisted mostly of boiled cabbage (though ponzu sauce was provided). My first Japanese friend remarked, ""this is not particularly Japanese, it is just boiled vegetables."" The second one added, ""In Japan, this would feed four people."" I ultimately was happy about this fact though, because the main course would not have been enough. I'm no big eater but 7 pieces of sushi does not constitute a meal. The redeeming element of the affair, however, was the dessert, which was delicious.While it was technically a 3-course meal it was essentially a head of cabbage + a few assorted treats. It's not that I'm a glutton for punishment, but had I not munched my way through the flavorless veggies I would have gone hungry. Definitely expected more considering even restaurant week pricing runs you north of $50 if you get drinks. While not as fancy, I could've spent a quarter of that at Zen on St. Marks and gotten twice as much actual sushi.Walking out of Inakaya my Japanese friends agreed that the veggie appetizer was ""American-size.""

Well...everything beautiful and wonderful came to a an excruciating halt when we decided to try out a new Japanese restaurant called Inakaya located in West Midtown!!!Our group, which was composed of six starving 20-something year olds decided to all order from the $35 Prixe fixed menu and some rolls and sashimi on the side.The Sashimi was okay...but when they brought out a tiny tiny dish of 1 or 2 mushrooms and asparagus for the first two courses...I was thinking wow...this is kind of cheap...and when they brought out two pieces of mushrooms and some Ginko beans for the second course...I was like are you serious??? The third course was 2 chicken sticks...And last but not LEAST for the last course which was the only decent sized portion,we had some grilled salmon and a fried rice ball. The grilled Salmon was HORRENDOUS...It was extremely dry and it had an intense fishy odor. It was an unamimous vote that the fish was disgusting...Now...I am hardly what you call a picky eater...I will eat almost ANYTHING edible...but my dear fellow yelpers...that fish was badd...And the sad part was that we were all starving because the waiter left us unattended and waiting between courses for so long. When 1 of my friends told the waiter that the fish was very dry and fishy he came back and apologized and offered between the 6 of us 3 free ice cream scoops...I thought that was extremely frugal of them...since this is a semi ""classy"" restaurant.I would suggest that if you are looking for a good quality meal...please do not come to this establishment.

Out of the three dishes we ordered, the okra was inedible... Since it wasnt fresh, when put on heat it hardened and became inedible. The dish cost $6 and came with 5pcs...

4.0,3/16/2009,"as i am told, restaurants in the roppongi district are pretty much like this.  you walk in and the staff shout in unison at the top of their lungs ""WELCOME!"" and then as you place your order they shout back to you the order - with this system i guess theres no way you can blame them for bringing out the wrong dish.  for me this was very theatrical and entertaining.  it kinda reminded me of those ancient world war two movies when you are on a battle ship and the commander is shouting the orders on a loud speaker or watching those scenes in basic training when all the cadets shout in unison ""YES SIR"".  so each chef mans a station and they hand food items between each other with these 5 foot long paddles.  when the dish is cooked they hand it to you on the end of the paddle.  loved the acrobatics and theatrics!the food though was not spectacular, it was decent.  the sake selection was also limited but decent.  we ordered rockfish, conch, enoki mushroom, hot peppers, eggplant, chicken meat ball, and chicken thigh. the best dishes were the grilled peppers and enoki.  we didn't bother ordering sushi because we just knew it probably wouldn't be up to our standards.i hope this place makes it in this economy.  There really is no experience like this in the city.",2,1,1,Norman S.,"New York, NY",78,485,0
4.0,3/6/2009,"I visited this restaurant after reading about its opening on Time Out NY. Upon arriving I was given a seat at the front counter and was offered a choice of a drink. The drink prices are in line with most other NYC places of that caliber. ($11 box of sake)The grilling menu basically consists of vegetables, seafood, waygu beef and two kinds of chicken. There is also sushi and traditional Japanese appetizers. I found the grilled items to be really good, but also very expensive. I got Shitake Mushrooms, waygu beef, fresh scallop, and a Japanese pepper that is a lot like a jalapeno. The beef skewers were $45 and consisted of about 6 oz of beef. In contrast, the scallop was only $15. The mushroom was $9 but only came with one.I found the atmosphere to be festive and I enjoyed the camaraderie between the chefs and waitstaff.The check arrived and it was almost $90! While I enjoyed the food, this will remain in the ""treat"" category for some time.",1,0,1,George S.,"Brooklyn, NY",92,40,1
4.0,3/3/2009,"Yep it's gimmicky, yep it's a loud, but it's Robata Yaki, and the Robata Yaki places I went as a child in Japan (Nagoya to be exact!) all were a bit like this.  As a kid, I was facinated with the paddles!!  In that sense, I think they did a VERY GOOD reproduction all the way across the ocean and land!BTW - almost all of the Izakayas in Japan (except for those chic-nouveaux ""lounge izakayas"") are shouty.  I used to work in one so I should know.  You're supposed to shout ""Welcome"" and basically repeat orders at the top your lungs. Food was good.  We didn't have any sushi because that's not what this place is about.  But all of the ippin-ryori and the grilled seafood was REALLY good.  The grilled King Crab, Lobster and whole Flounder was excellent.  The grilled veggies were good too.  The chicken balls were ternder and very flavorful.  Yaki Onigiri was crispy and soft inside, just like how it's supposed to be.The free kinako mochi from the mochi-tsuki show came right about when we were full, so that was perfect timing.The price point isn't exactly Taisho or Kenakaya, but I think it was decent.  About $120 per person including adult beverages of 5 house masu sake's and 4 beers and tip, so I don't think it was that bad, considering all the seafood we had.If you are looking for cheap, Izakaya experience, or Masa quality sushi, this isn't the place to go, I suppose.  Pretend you're a salary-man in Tokyo and go for the grilled seafood and the veggies, and a few ippin-ryori's.",4,0,1,Miki Y.,"New York, NY",6,8,0
2.0,3/2/2009,I hate to be the first one to leave a review. As for I've been waiting for this restaurant to open for ever since I read about it months ago. It simply didn't live up to it's standard. The food was extremely over priced and mediocre.,3,0,1,Lynn W.,"New York, NY",110,169,75
