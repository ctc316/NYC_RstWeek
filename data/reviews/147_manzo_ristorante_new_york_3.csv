5.0,4/16/2019,Service is good & so is the food! My favorite restaurant in Eataly. Can't wait to go back. Seating is a bit tight but that didn't bother us too much. I definitely recommend going here!,0,0,0,Melissa L.,"Bronx, NY",0,2,2
1.0,3/31/2019,"Horrible service and horrible food. I got a salad as an apatizer and they gave a handful of greens. That was $16. We also ordered a pasta plate and the serving size was tiny. It was definitely not worth the $29 we paid. It took them forever to do anything (take our order, bring our food, and even give us the check).

2.0,3/31/2019,"Porca miseria!  Hell would have to freeze over before I would return to Manzo or any other Eataly restaurant.  I'm usually immune to the blandishments of such mass market enterprises but I fell for a promotion offering a two-course menu for $28 and $25-bottles of wine.  As Manzo means beef we both went for the hangar steak that, while flavorful, was so tough it was hard to believe it was USDA prime.  (Could they possibly have not known how to trim the gristle?) We had a decent salad as starters but yet more salad came with the steak.  No, we couldn't have potatoes, such being the nature of special menus.  The wine was a better bargain but the food was the least of the problem: The place is a madhouse with tables cheek by jowl and noisy beyond belief.  It's hard to fault the waiters for the indifferent service as who could function in such bedlam!  We couldn't wait to get out of there.P.S.  There must have been a clump of unwashed greens in my salad as I spent much of the night running to the WC!",1,0,0,Frank C.,"Manhattan, NY",1,17,0
5.0,3/29/2019,"I don't know where to start ! This place is amazing ! During the summer times , my husband and I come to get some ice cream at Eataly. We been going for the ice cream for about 3 years now since my husband works next to Madison park which isn't at all far from here . I was pretty excited to come here for the pre fix menu they had for Italy festival . I reserved a table a week in advance because I knew if we walk-in it was going to be pretty packed . We arrived and we got seated immediately. Our server Tiffany was superb . We ordered a salad and mozzarella which were awesome. For entree , my Husband got the chicken and I got the steak . For drinks , I got something called sogno carabaico , our server recommended it and it was delicious ! Wanted another round but the wine bottles were $25 so I got a wine bottle . Since my husband doesn't drink , I took my wine bottle . For dessert we got a chocolate cake and tiramisu with 2 cappuccinos . Everything when I mean everything was perfect ! Portion wise and flavor wise was on point . I have no complains whatsoever . Will be back !",0,0,0,Jenny H.,"Flushing, NY",23,45,173
5.0,3/26/2019,"Tried this restaurant during restaurant week at the end of March. It was amazing!!!! Started with mozzarella appetizer, bottle of red wine, followed by steak and chicken. It was an amazing experience. Waiter was very attentive, came by few times to ensure everything was good. Food was delicious, finished everything on the plate. Then ordered tiramisu with desserts drink (limoncello - how can one go wrong when in italy). Will definitely come back for another wonderful experience",0,0,0,Valentina Y.,"Fort Lee, NJ",3,18,20
4.0,3/22/2019,"Went here for their restaurant week. Had a reservation at 12:30 but arrived early. Seated by 12:10. We were the only table in this certain section by the bathroom. Easy enough to store a stroller and toddler away. Service was kinda slow. We waited for almost 50 minutes for our food. We ordered off their prefixed menu for theirRestaurant week sorta thing. Hanger steak was amazing, well cooked, flavorful, filling and seasoned wonderfully. The mozzarella was delicious. Highly recommend trying this if you're a fan of mozzarella. It was wet but not too wet, if that makes sense. I really liked the salt and garlic they added on the outside. I didn't enjoy being near the only bathroom. The line was always long and it get awkward having a group of people staring at us while waiting in line. The place is also very dark. I have horrible astigmatism so dark places are extra dark for me.",3,1,4,Erica A.,"Philadelphia, PA",333,267,1071

And... absolutely yum!!!We both had the carne cruda di Manzo and the bistecca del macellaio (get it medium rare). The carne crude comes with some type of mousse you spread on it, can't tell what it was but it was absolutely delicious.

2.0,3/9/2019,"Went here for lunch with a few work colleagues and we were seated right away at 12:30 pm on a weekday. The place was relatively busy a noise levels were quite low.It was the 4 of us, and I ordered the Insalata Mista ($19) with Shredded Rotisserie Cascun Farms Chicken (+$8). I think $27 for a salad is quite steep, so be prepared to pay more! Our food took a very long time to arrive and we waited close to 40 minutes for our food to arrive. Service was okay too, and our table wasn't attended for 10 minutes after we sat down, so yes, it was a very long lunch!2 stars just for the salad which was really good!",3,2,2,Ameya B.,"New York, NY",494,312,589

4.0,1/22/2019,I went here with a couple of friends for restaurant week. They offered a lunch tasting menu for $27 for  a 2 course entree (appetizer and meal). I ordered the mozzarella e proscuitto as an appetizer and it was the best I've ever had. For entree I ordered the scallopina di pollo which I wasn't a huge fan of. Friends ordered the arrosto di manzo con polenta which they thoroughly enjoyed. We also got accompanying wine pairings for $10. Dessert had to be had of course and I got the tiramisu (best I've ever had). The service was great and staff were very attentive.

Main dishes I had the Cacio e Pepe w some black truffle the pasta itself was very good delicious tasting sauce the truffle itself good as well but the pasta needed more truffle flavor. My friend had the Gnocchi also with black truffle very good pasta as well. Restaurant is located inside eataly but the space is decent, plenty of seating plus a bar area, easy simple decor.

4.0,12/23/2018,"My husband and I stopped by Manzo last night and got to sit down immediately in front of the bar area. We ordered two drinks and testa prosciutto and meatballs to start. I ordered one of the speciality vermouths from the USA with a splash of soda and my husband ordered the Manzo Mule. We both loved our drinks and thought they were reasonably priced for the area. For our appetizers, they took a while to come out and the staff that was handling getting orders out from the kitchen seemed very confused by what tables were getting each order. We saw several dishes being brought back repeatedly and then sent back out to the correct table. The prosciutto we ordered was absolutely delicious, with a wonderful flavor or black truffle. The housemade meatballs were cooked to perfection and had a delicious black truffle cream sauce drizzled on them. Highly recommend! For our pasta dish and entree which we split, we decided to keep to Manzo's specialities which are known for truffles and ordered the agnolotti del plin which was pasta stuffed with veal and pork with black truffle butter. It was so delicious and after our appetizers, splitting the main dish was a perfect way to taste everything without getting too full. I highly recommend Manzo and would like to visit again. However, I would suggest not going here if you'd like to be seated quickly and eat quickly, as seats are first come first served and the waiters were not fast with service.",0,0,0,Bree C.,"Manhattan, NY",405,96,102
4.0,9/10/2018,Manzo is a great spot for quality food and drinks. It's nice for a getaway from the bustle of the crowds in Eataly. Nice grilled fare like steaks and pork chops. I've been there a few times. They have excellent wine option like most places in Eataly. Once thing I was disappointed about last night was both steaks ordered (strip loins) were way over salted. I eat out a lot and like my steak salted and seasoned well but these steaks were almost sent back and I really dislike sending food back. Anyway I hope they keep improving. Wait staff is good.,0,0,0,Brian R.,"New York, NY",0,36,0
2.0,8/25/2018,The food was good but the service was terrible.  That includes the management.  It was a busy Friday night but we were seated rather quickly.  Ordered a drink at the bar and halfway through they sat us.  The waiter took a very long time to show and it was down hill after that.   We had to ask multiple times for bread.  We were through your appetizer by the time my glass of wine came then about halfway through our meal asked for another glass and was refused.  Asked for the manager and a woman came over -did not look thrilled at being bothered - but I was nice and asked how the decision was made and all she said was that she stands by her waiters decision.  I had exactly 2 drinks and was by no means inebriated.  I'm over 50 and I've never had that happen to me and I'm sure there were times it probably should have -  this was not one of them.  I asked for the manager who was rude from the minute he walked over.   Seemed very annoyed we were bothering him.  After arguing with him for what seemed like forever about not just that I didn't get another drink but about the whole experience and service - including their handling of a dissatisfied customer.   At the end he comped our meal but the night was ruined.  I had heard good things but first and last time I'll eat there.    The 2 stars are because what I ate of the lamb I had was good.,0,0,0,Mary Ann S.,"North Brunswick Township, NJ",0,10,0
4.0,8/4/2018,My friend and I came here for restaurant week. Our server Dennis was fantastic. He was very busy but still gave us service with a smile. The ambiance is nice and the food is good. I've been here before and enjoyed the food but unfortunately the restaurant week main dishes were not great.

3.0,7/24/2018,"Eataly is a cross between a mall, a food market, and a TV cooking show.  As a tourist attraction ""Eataly"" locations are in prime, high traffic areas - meaning, high rent districts.  So, the seating is crowded and the prices are high - $29 for a plate of pasta, $16 for a glass of wine, $8 for bubbly water.  And, given the open-air nature of the venue, there's little air conditioning to be felt - definitely an issue when eating on a hot, humid, crowded day under bright halogen lights.At the same time the food was good, the service was above average, and the whole thing is a feast for the eyes, as if somebody polished all the tomatoes before stacking them up.Not a bad experience, but a disconnect on the price-value question.",0,0,0,William M.,"Manhattan, NY",1,62,7
5.0,7/21/2018,"Had a wonderful dinner at Eataly on Thursday night! After touring around the various restaurants, we finally settled on Manzo. There was a wait for tables in the restaurant so we were seated at the bar in front of the open kitchen. It was actually fun to watch the various entrees being prepared over the course of the evening and the high chairs were very comfortable. Service was excellent all around and we really appreciated our server Mariya for her recommendations. For drinks, we chose a sauvignon blanc to start. It was the perfect accompaniment to our dinner. For our meal, we ordered three appetizers: Insalata di Stagione, the housemade meatballs and the pan seared scallops. All three were delicious and the pecorino vinaigrette on the salad was the standout.  For our entrees, we ordered the grilled hangar steak and the Agnolotti del Plin. The steak was nice and tender but a bit rare for medium. The Agnolotti del Plin was incredible! It's a housemade pasta filled with braised raven and boar pork and arcadian patures beef with a sugo d'arrosto sauce. It's a pasta orgasm that you will want to savor each magnificent bite. My friend Rob and I raved about it and have already talked about going back just to order the pasta again. Delizioso!",0,0,0,Thomas A.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,25,0

1.0,5/7/2018,"We were celebrating and decided to go out for a steak. Not sure why we thought this place could offer what we wanted. So if you go here Don't order steak. It will come out cold and when you say that it's cold you get an attitude like you don't know what you're talking about and they try to convince you that you've never eaten steak in your life! For a good Steak go to Sparks, Peter Lugers, Keens etc. On top of it it's hard to eat at a place that completely smells like bleach!

2.0,4/20/2018,"If I was rating only the bar, more particularly Robinson, I would be giving Manzo an easy 5-star review.  Previously, we visited the bar only and their cocktails and wine selection are perfect.  Even better is Robinson, a personable and accommodating bartender.  He's reason we visit Manzo.  So, last Saturday, we decided to visit again and this time, booked a table rather than sit at the bar.  We were seated right away, which was nice.  However, we were stuffed into a tight corner near the machine where the wait staff placed their orders.  It's a tight restaurant, so we understand, but it wasn't ideal. We ordered drinks and my boyfriend wanted to try one of their signature drinks.  It was 'eh', so we asked for a simpler drink, and they were accommodating.We ordered a plate each of meat and cheese, which was good.  We probably should have left it there.  Our entrees came out and they were SMALL....and BLAND.  I ordered the flat iron steak and it had very little seasoning.  The meat was cooked to the right temperature, but didn't have much flavor.  My boyfriend ordered the short ribs and it was a very small portion.  We had skipped a meal that day and were hungry, so we were disappointed with our food in general.",0,0,0,Karen N.,"Newburgh, NY",97,24,6
2.0,4/11/2018,"Very much enjoyed the simple ambience and the Cacio e Pepe was as wonderful as what we had in Rome, but I can only give two stars for the exceptionally poor service of our waiter, Dennis. He forgot to bring us a wine menu after we were seated, then proceeded to take the full orders of two tables that were seated after us (again, while we were still waiting for the wine menu). He finally brought the menu after he had come to take our food orders (and again, after taking the orders of multiple people who were seated after us). After the food came, he failed to return a single time to check on us until nearly an hour later when we flagged him down for the check, which itself took another 15 minutes to come. In the intervening period, he checked with the tables on either side of us but never stopped to say a word to our table. It was so strange as to be almost surreal. I've never excluded a restaurant from consideration due solely to the performance of a waiter, but in this case it left a bad enough taste in my mouth that I don't think we'll be back.",0,0,0,Brian L.,"Gaithersburg, MD",115,7,1
2.0,4/8/2018,"First and last visit to Manzo. While the food was very good, our waiter's lackluster visit was a disappointment.  Me and my husband decided to go because I've been thinking of doing a private event at Eataly, and I wanted to see it on a busy Saturday night.  It started with the waiter not reading us any specials.  Then, the waiter never offered us bread, which the table next to us got. My husband ordered a beer and the waiter walked away without asking me what I wanted to drink. My husband ordered pasta and he was not offered grated cheese, and the table next to us did. He usually has a couple of beers with dinner, but  the waiter never came around to see if he wanted another drink. After dessert, we wanted coffee and the waiter offered us the check instead, so at this point we decided to pay the check and leave.

They serve fresh bread that is wonderful. I've seen them preparing the steaks and they look amazing. Service is ok, not great. That's the one thing I think they could improve on.

When asked for recommendations the waiter acted as he couldn't hear us. The waiter failed to bring the beer, was everything but friendly and seem just mad at having to take the order. Never came back to check if everything was ok not even to return our credit card once we paid. I had to ask the buss boys for additional water and for Parmesan cheese as it was offered to other tables but not to us. I had to ask the manager for our tab and he was not pleased about it.

1.0,9/23/2017,"I came here once a couple of years ago and really enjoyed it. We decided to come back last week for a birthday and it was a completely opposite experience. The biggest issues:-Service: our waiter was never anywhere to be found. He also brought us the wrong order. As someone who is allergic to shellfish and then is mistakenly brought shellfish pasta, this is pretty serious and he didn't seem to care at all. The restaurant needs to take allergies more seriously, especially since it can result in hospitalization or death. When the waiter finally put the right order in, he promised it would be less than 10 minutes, but then we all waited around 30 minutes for it, so everyone else's food was ice cold. Finally, after we got our first round of drinks, we have zero opportunity to order drinks again. Even getting water was impossible, so we were very thirsty after dining here. -plating: I don't understand why someone would ever plate a watery/liquid dish on a wooden plank, but Eataly tried to. Unfortunately, as the waiter brought it to the table all of the liquid sloshed onto myself and my purse, ruining my outfit and all of my personal belongings.

5.0,9/18/2017,"During my first visit to Eataly this past summer my friend and I ended up dining at Manzo. We couldn't have been happier with what was her birthday lunch. Set within the bustling Eataly, this restaurant impressed us with its great staff and delectable menu.We kicked off our meal with fresh bread, as well as one of their various prosciutto plates. This was easily the best prosciutto I've ever had, far tastier and fresher than what is generally served and available in my city. For our main courses I jumped for the Linguine Di Gragnano (Linguine with Poached Maine Lobster, Tomato & Basil). I think the last time I enjoyed a dish of pasta so much was when I was Italy itself. You could taste every recently picked and just-cooked ingredient blending together, from the meat to the sauce to the pasta itself. I was in heaven while eating that dish!During our visit the staff checked in on us constantly, making sure we had water and keeping us updated about the state of our orders. While I've been to faster eateries, Manzo Ristorante was not the slowest service experience I've had by far, and the freshly made, great tasting food made a relatively small delay worth it. Having an appetizer and some fantastic cocktails and wine admittedly did not hurt, but still - I would definitely come back to the delicious place that is Manzo Ristorante!",0,0,1,Larissa G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",133,649,1786
2.0,9/5/2017,"After discovering the Eataly Marketplace a month or so ago, I decided I wanted to sample one of the on-site restaurants and chose Manzo, since I wanted a nice dinner with my husband.We arrived for our Sunday evening reservation, were received cordially and seated promptly. After perusing the menu, we decided on a bottle of Chianti in lieu of cocktails, and ordered  some La Quercia prosciutto to share. My husband asked for the linguine with lobster, while I opted for the beef short rib with polenta. Our friendly waiter took the order and while we waited, we were served a very good bread with olive oil for dipping. We'd scarfed that up well before our wine and our app arrived. I thought the prosciutto was delicious - buttery and smooth - although my husband found it a bit salty. We received approximately two ounces (four thin slices) for our $21 - a mingy serving for such a high price.There was a long lull before our entrees arrived. We flagged down our waiter for more bread and olive oil, but while the bread arrived promptly, it took two tries from two different servers before we got the oil. The restaurant was more than adequately staffed, but the service seemed disorganized (and the restaurant was not crowded, nor was it an ""off"" dinner hour).When the entrees were presented, I was once again disappointed in the disproportionate size of the servings compared to the steep price.. I wouldn't have minded so much if the dishes had been extraordinary, but to be honest, there was nothing outstanding about either. My short rib was tender but flavorless, and the minute portion of polenta was soupy and also lacking in flavor. Worse was the fact that it arrived only lukewarm. My husband's lobster linguine was piping hot, and the lobster cooked well, but again, lacking in flavor (there was also a single,errant chunk of cooked green pepper in the dish - a harsh contrast with the delicate lobster, and my husband hates green pepper into the bargain). We decided against dessert, paid the bill and treated ourselves to a gelato from the marketplace - which was very good. My takeaway from the experience: go to Eataly to graze and purchase food to prepare at home, but leave overpriced, underwhelming Manzo to the tourists.",1,0,0,Donna M.,"Vienna, VA",0,8,0

We went all out in our ordering with drinks, apps, entrees, and dessert- all of which lived up to our expectationsAppetizers: honestly, the mozzarella was to die for and we paired it with one of the prosciutto plates which made us all very happy. More unique was the octopus which was served flat (not cubed as I would have expected) and flavored with limoncello which was a nice dish I wouldn't have generally ordered but was really glad I got to try something that was more unique to this menu. I couldn't get enough of the chickpea patties with Stracciatella and mussels. OMG. I'd go back for those alone! Finally we ordered the beef tartar, which was one of the more anticipated and my least favorite. The meat tasted a little more chewy that other tartars I've had.Entrees I couldn't help but order the short rib, which was served with polenta (and now I know polenta is still not my fave even prepared by the best of Italian chefs!)

Our waiter was very friendly and answered a lot of my noob questions about Italian food.They have a tasting menu that was $95 per person but everyone at the table needs to do it. So, we didn't. Because choices!We ordered some appetizers and separate entrees. I don't ever remember Italian food names, but one dish we had was thinly sliced beef with arugula and cheese. The combination was quite delicious. There was a faint sauce (or perhaps just salt) on the whole dish and I liked it.For my entree, I took a gamble on this paparadelle pasta with mushroom and butter sauce. I hate mushrooms and thought these specially foraged trumpet mushrooms would change my view on mushrooms. Sadly, it didn't, but the rest of the dish was very good. The noodles tasted fresh and were oh so thin. The butter sauce was very flavorful and salted perfectly. I just left behind this pile of black mushrooms on my plate, but I ate everything else.We got dessert and loved it. I got the chocolato to share with a dear friend and it was on point. The chocolate ganache cake was really dense. It paired well with the hazelnut ice cream. The bread and olive oil were really delicious as well. Once you have high quality olive oil, it's really difficult to go back to the low grade stuff.We spent about $55 per person. It wasn't too bad considering the food is quite delicious.

4.0,1/8/2017,"I've been to Eataly numerous times, but sitting down and eating at Manzo yesterday is the first time I have tried any of the numerous food options at a sit-down location (and the first time I ventured to try any prepared food outside of their outstanding prime rib sandwich). Given it was snowy yesterday, the foot traffic was a bit lighter, and getting a seat at Manzo - which is a little removed from where most of the traffic inside is - was easy enough. Although there was still seating space at the tables, we opted to sit at the bar and have a casual lunch. Our waitress / bartender was attentive, getting us our drinks in a timely fashion and asking us (almost too frequently) how everything was. The theme here was truffles and mushrooms - apropos for a winter menu, and next time I wander by here, I will have to see if / how that changes throughout the year.There are a few beers on tap, as well as what looked like an extensive wine selection. I ended up going for the cocktail with rye and black truffles and sugar along the rim - kind of an interesting take, but something that I think ultimately failed. The alcohol itself was solid - not too strong - but the black truffle really gets lost amongst the bitterness of the rye, and sugar is really best suited for something like a margarita. Although the cocktail fell short, the food - in particular the pasta - was a clear step above what you would get at your average Italian restaurant in NYC. The beef crudo consisted of freshly ground top round (we saw it being put through the meat grinder behind the bar), with an artistic dab of porcini and truffle-infused sauce that was a bit on thick side (one could probably almost call it a paste). The beef itself had a very creamy texture, but the flavor was plain - no dressing up of the meat at all - and that wouldn't be a problem if the amount of sauce was enough to account for the entire crudo (it was not). As such, our last couple of bites were just plain beef which, while enjoyable, were on the plain side. We both did main courses for the pasta, and this is where Manzo really shone through. My wife went with the tagliatelle with beef, veal, and prosciutto ragu - a tantalizing combination that was very rich in flavor. The pasta was cooked perfectly, and the ragu was full of rich flavor, even if the prosciutto was somewhat lacking. I went with the pappardelle with braised veal shoulder in some kind of light cream sauce (probably white wine sauce), and that blew me away...the meat was so juicy and tender, while the pappardelle was silky and the perfect type of pasta to really absorb the sauce. That was definitely one of the best pasta dishes I have had recently.The food here is a bit pricey (as are most things Eataly-related), but for pasta that is executed so well here - as well as the overall use of fresh, high-quality ingredients - it is worth the price.

2.0,12/19/2016,"Overall, a disappointing experience. We went there for the winter truffle tasting menu. We ordered the 3 course tasting menu, plus the faro entree. There was not one shred of anything that tasted remotely like it had even the slightest bit of truffle in it. Thankfully, we didn't order the $39/pp truffle supplement . It would have just added a weird layer to an already weird menu. The steak tartar was so strange. It looked like a small mound of hamburger, straight out of the package from the grocery store, with this overly salty, powdered gravy  mix on the side. Probably from Knorr . The pasta had a barely flavored, watered down squash sauce. The Farro tasted like something that is served on flights I work to London.  Weirdly, the only thing that tasted of truffle was the ice cream, it had a generous sprinkle of truffle salt on top. I guess that's what you get from a touristy place like Eataly. The waitress was weird too. We got our menus from the hostess, and then the server walks right up to us and says ""ready?""....ummm no?

Did I mention that this certainly made us feel welcomed?! ;)Our Grey Goose Vodka Gimlets were outstanding! We ordered the price fix menu of three courses for $50 pp. The first course was a beef tartare type of dish with a mushroom-truffle sauce and crostini. I have never been keen on raw meat not even in hamburgers as I always order them just pink in center never raw. But I thought I'd experiment but in the end had difficulty eating it. It had nothing to do with quality of beef but the fact that it was raw. The Mushroom-truffle sauce that accompanied it was good but really needed more flavor.Second course was a small portion of spaghetti with anchovy cream sauce accompanied by a butternut squash purée. The purée was not completely hot and really the whole dish had a delicate taste bordering a bit bland but we were very hungry and didn't mention to anyone as we thoroughly enjoyed our entire visit!Last course was hazelnut gelato with salt.

Both were amazing and very healthy-sized portions.

Our waiter was courteous and friendly providing a recommendation on dishes and wine as we weren't certain on our order.We shared an appetizer and got a bottle of wine and I also ordered the Pappardelle which was nicely flavored - it was perfect and amazingly delicious! I also had the Cioccolato for dessert and as recommended it was really death by chocolate.

The $15 market salad was pathetic! There was, at best, $0.70 worth of vegetables on it. Four or 5 swipes of radish and a few lettuce leaves covered in olive oil. Terrible!2. Again it tasted good but I ordered the Tortelli but when it came out I felt like the child of a single parent who was rushing to get me food before they ran out to their second job. 8 pieces scattered over a large, messy white plate.

5.0,8/17/2016,"The first time I went to Eataly was 4 years ago and I still remember how delicious my meal at Manzo was. I still have not stopped thinking about their agnolotti! My boyfriend lived in New York last summer and I wouldn't even let him go there without me. When we moved here together a month ago, we finally got to go to Manzo together. Manzo is located in Eataly and is the more fine dining version of the other mini restaurants in the market. This one is off to the side and is white table cloth although most people here are pretty casual. We ordered the beef carpaccio to start. My boyfriend said it is one of the best he has ever had. The meat slices are very thin and not chewy - they melt in your mouth. They were served with shavings of fresh parmigiano reggiano which just complemented the flavour.I ordered the agnolotti (of course) and I told my boyfriend to get the same because he would love it. The waitress asked us if we wanted to add truffles for $5/oz. Not realizing that they actually would give us 5oz of truffles on each of our dishes, we said yes because we love truffles.The chef even came out to grate the truffles onto our pasta dishes. The agnolotti was just as excellent as I remember it from 4 years ago. The truffles were so flavourful and just added to the dish. This is one of my favourite dishes ever and we have been to Eataly just to buy this agnolotti to make at home.Anyways, I think we were too excited about our agnolotti with truffles that we didn't realize how expensive our meals were (whoops!)

Eataly is like stepping  into a small Italian town where you can get anything from Italy, from vegetables to wine to cheese to fresh pasta to coffee and sweets ,  to a beer on the roof top ( hidden spot )  You can not go wrong bringing a date here to get lost in a conversation - and walk around with your glass of wine , have an appetizer in one , eat a primi in another and secondi meal from another and then coffee from the coffee station then a sweet to pair with the coffee from another station and then  take a galato to go , to finish at the park across the street -                  All pasta are made in house and fresh Polpo alla piastra : seared Spanish octopus with salsa verde Malfaldine , made with broken arrow ranch quail ragu  ( for an extra charge you can add black truffle ) Pappardelle : braised broken arrow ranch shaved Boar shoulder mangalista Agnolotti Del plin: bolognese ragu with veal       There really isn't much to say other than the service and the meal was great !

5.0,6/6/2016,"Manzo was a bit of an unexpected find but definitely a thoroughly welcomed one! I typically go to La Pasta whenever I'm in Eataly but decided to give Manzo which is fancier than La Pasta a try. As soon as the waiter took our order, delicious and buttery bread was served with olive oil on the side. We ordered an appetizer with octopus and peppers to share and it was oh so good. The octopus was so tender with just the right amount of crispiness on the sides and the peppers were perfectly seasoned as well. I ordered the agnolotti del plin for my entree and it was so flavorful. I was surprised by how much was packed in the agnolotti, making each bite worth savoring and the sauce is also not too heavy which complemented the agnolotti really well. My friend's tagliatelle alla bolognese, which I had one too many bites of, was also super tasty. The tagliatelle was cooked just enough for it to be chewy but tender. Our waiters were so enthusiastic and helpful, the ambience was lovely.

4.0,6/4/2016,"Food: 5/5, service: 3/5, so I'm taking an average here.We shared the first and main entree - the beef short rib was cooked so tender that the meat almost melted completely in my mouth! At the same time, it was able to maintain a firm texture, phenomenal! The maltagliati, on the other hand, present me the most traditional way of cooking Italian pasta, that the noodle could be very chewy and made a perfect combination with the meat. Enjoyed each bite of my lunch!Sadly, service was not able to keep up. Apparently our waitress must have had a pretty bad mood the time she was serving us (or probably because we did not order wine? Or probably because we skipped dessert? But come on, why would I ever pay 11 bucks for a dessert cake while the gelato place was only steps away??). The whole time I felt like we were being rushed, even though the place was half empty.A classic example of authentic food paired itself with service that sucked.

3.0,5/24/2016,"First of all, this place has some very good food. A few nights ago we ordered the tasting menu and were impressed with most of the dishes. I thought the tagliolini with quail ragu was among the best pasta dishes I've ever had' and the carne crudo with fava beans was really delicious. It is also quite expensive. Tasting menu for four with two moderately priced bottles of wine, tax and tip was over $500. At that price, the service and over all experience should be exceptional and Manzo fell short. Some of the staff, like the sommelier and the Italian host, were excellent, others, like my waiter, were not very good. I started asking him questions about the extensive wine list and it quickly became apparent he had a very limited knowledge of wine. It was like a game of 20 questions before he called the som over. Similarly with the ingredients. As with most traditional Italian food, the dishes are relatively simple so you'd expect him to know most everything thats in them, but, a number of times, he didn't. Also, the room is not the most elegant and at that price tag, it should be. Good food but the overall experience doesn't live up to the cuisine.

We were told that this restaurant was known for their meat. Therefore, I opted for the Arrosto Di Manzo (Beef Rib w polenta). I must say, I was the lucky one amongst our group because everyone else felt ""eh"" about their food (vesuvio di gragnano and tortellini in brodo). I thoroughly enjoyed my dish.

2.0,4/22/2016,"I took my boyfriend here to celebrate his new job and was unfortunately disappointed. The food wasn't even worth half the amount I paid. The only upside is that it's the one restaurant in Eataly where you can make reservations. Wasn't even necessary, as it was almost empty at 7pm Monday night when we came.We ordered the straticiella for our appetizer, and it was pretty decent. The cheese was creamy and mild, but it came with only 4 tiny pieces of bread.My entree was the tortellini. The waitress told me that it would be in a broth, which some other customers had issues with. I should've changed my order, but I said it was fine. When my dish came I almost laughed. There was maybe 12 TINY dry tortellini pieces in a bowl. The waitress had a mini pitcher of broth (basically chicken stock)  and poured it over them. That was my dish. It didn't even taste all that amazing. My boyfriend got the gnocchi, which was better. Portion was also very small. The sauce was thick, creamy, but sparse. We did like the texture of the gnocchi. However it was nothing one couldn't make at home. Very underwhelming meal. Would not recommend and will not come back. There are WAY better Italian places for the fraction of the price. The only redeeming factor is the 2 teeny arancini balls we got on the house.",2,1,0,Diane W.,"Manhattan, NY",110,162,333
4.0,4/20/2016,"Really torn between 3 and 4 here. I've had much better meals in New York, but I also wasn't my usual adventurous self during my outing at Manzo. This was my first ever ""work"" dinner, so maintaining an air of professionalism was the priority, whereas demolishing the menu and taking pictures upon pictures of the damage is my usual strategy. I didn't share 47 dishes, I didn't ask to try everyone's food, and most importantly, I was very cautious around my alcohol consumption. So this whole meal was an anomaly, hence why my experience was less than ideal. But putting all of that aside, I'll say my meal here was about 3.75, rounding up due to a spectacular drink list and fantastic service. Came here on a Saturday night at 6pm. For starters, that's an egregiously early dinner for me. I wasn't hungry in the slightest, but the coworkers all had to catch their respective Grand Central trains so I was unfortunately at the mercy of their schedules. The upside, of course, is that an early dinner means extra attentive service (though our service was unbelievably attentive even when the restaurant filled up). My one nuts-and-bolts qualm that I had here was the lighting. Our table was semi-relegated to the corner, which didn't help. I didn't have any trouble in my seat, but we ended up needing to scooch our table a bit so others in our party could read their menus without any trouble.As I mentioned, I was very impressed with all beveragial (I'm making that a word) offerings. The wine list was far too vast/intimidating for me to attempt seriously confronting it, so I stuck with cocktails/beer. Again, had I been with friends, I likely would have asked a zillion questions without worrying about making a fool of myself. But considering these coworkers all had a good 15-20 years of drinking on me, I figured I'd say the interrogation for another night out. First I went with a gin/cucumber ditty, which we all know is a tried and true combo. It was well-balanced and more spirit-forward than I'm used to for a drink of this style. I tried to nurse it as best as I could, but it was tricky. Absolutely go for this if you're feeling gin. I also had to try the dark belgian strong ale they had on tap, which was even more enjoyable than my cocktail. Can't even believe I'm saying that. For reference, it was the Noel Birra Baladin.Food-wise, dishes all hovered around ""good"". I was the only one to order fish (as opposed to steak), so I can't speak to the steak here. But my coworkers all seemed very very pleased/satisfied/etc with their dishes. They're clearly very proud of their steak cuts here, and for good reason. They look nothing short of majestic. Two of my coworkers got the Ribeye for two (see picture), and a dutiful server brought it out to present to the crowd, pre-slicing. He was very amenable to being photographed (15 seconds of fame, don't botch it) so I got a few quick shots.What I tried:Barbabietole Arrostite: Roasted Beets, Goat Cheese, Candied Hazelnuts & Black Truffle Vinaigrette (A-)Hard to go wrong with this combination of ingredients. It's funny in retrospect, because I used to seriously dislike beets. No longer! Though this app was on the very very small side, the beets were fresh and delicious. Our waitress highlighted this dish prior to us ordering as being a crowd favorite, and I can see why. Pesce de Mercado (swordfish): Grilled Market Fish, Asparagus, Fava Beans, Peas & Artichoke Brodetto (B+/A-)My only issue with this dish was that the preparation appears to stay the same regardless of what the day's market fish is. The accompaniments (asparagus/beans/peas) are quite versatile, yes, but it comes off as lazy to the consumer. They went very nicely with the swordfish, but I'd expect more effort here. Aside from that, this dish was clean, healthy and flavorful. I found the fish to be a bit under-seasoned but ironically the other components made the bite as a whole pretty yummy.",11,6,7,Molly T.,"New York, NY",887,463,1480
4.0,4/9/2016,"This review is for the bar.  We had just eaten at Baita, so we headed down here to have another bottle of wine.  The wine list is extensive with varying price points.  My experience with wine comes from working in fine dining, and well....drinking different vintages from various regions.  We noticed a generous mark up for wines in NYC.  Our bartender allowed us to sample a few before making a decision which was really nice!  We settled on a Barolo they were promoting, and it was really good!  If you ever look at Barolo wines, most are on the high end, this one was reasonable at $80.  Daveed used his Vivino app, and we were able to see the average retail price, and yes, it was a substantial mark-up, but as one server told us, wine and alcohol is where restaurants really make their money.I would definitely come back and try the food.  From what we saw coming out of the kitchen, it looks delicious!",1,1,2,Mikey H.,"San Diego, CA",373,980,3562

We decided to stop in on a random Monday during the holidays to treat ourselves and I am glad we did!The host was juggling a ton of people and also random guests who had finished dining and wanted to clearly have a detailed conversation with him. I was irritated because we had to wait a good 15 minutes after our reservation to be seated and he wasn't giving us the right attention because of the other finished diners. Prioritize, my friend.Our waiter was amazing and so knowledgeable. I think he memorized the wine list, or should I say book, because when I put in our drink orders he didn't bat an eye and delivered with ease. We started with a sweet potato and cheese amuse bouche which I honestly wish I could have ordered on the menu. It was amazing! We then ordered the burrata to share without the bacon and it was delicious! Almost foamy but filled with flavor and in a delicious green dipping sauce. Bread bowl was also pretty marvelous and they gave us tons of refills. Score!I ordered the lobster pasta which was made with a linguine. The pasta was as fresh as can be and there was SO MUCH LOBSTER in the pasta. I'm not always used to this, so another perk in my book. I felt like the pasta, while fresh, did not have a ton of flavor in it, and my unsophisticated American palette probably could have used some more sauce. But, it was quality. Husband ordered the short rib with polenta and devoured it. We both enjoyed our food so much that we didn't even want to share. Our bill was around $125 and we opted out of dessert to grab some gelato instead.

1.0,1/1/2016,"Wow, the food was great but there is definitely something strange about the staff at this place, or at least some serious mis-management. My date and I decided to go all out on trying everything on the menu for new years, and our bill was $278 total, of which I didn't mind because of the excellent quality. But to my extreme  disappointment I experienced the most obvious lack of professionalism and ethics of any restaurant that I have ever been to in NYC. The problem came when we decided to order 5 grams of white truffles to pair with our prosciutto. At $50 for 5 grams I expected to receive at least a few slices as I work with weights and measures all of the time. Rather than receiving a full order of truffles (5g) the assistant  waiter shaved no more than one gram of white truffle on to the plate; then quickly departed. I assumed that he would return later with more, but when I asked the waitress for more she asked me if I wanted to order another 3 grams. I explained that we never got the full order, she called the manager who insisted that they weighed the truffle in the kitchen and said it was actually 6 grams. I told him but we never got the whole truffle, rather only about a gram of shavings. The conversation would have continued if it was not for the fact that my date insisting that I stop for fear of having the rest of our food delayed. So I finished that it was not about the cost, but about the principal of not giving the full $50 order, and then suggesting that I should pay another $30 ($70 total) for what was incorrectly served. It was quite obvious that the manager could not know how much was actually portioned to us, but the fact that he did not investigate his staff was a serious failure. I can only assume that someone somewhere pocketed the rest of our truffle. And at $10 a gram for real white truffles I can easily see the temptation to do so.",0,0,0,Dr W.,"Portland, ME",72,17,2

3.0,12/17/2015,"Manzo offers some pretty tasty food, but in general it was a disappointing experience.Came here on a Wednesday night.  It didn't seem that busy and the host/hostess passed by several times but it still took at least five minutes for one of the host to notice me and seat me down for bar seating.  From there, it took another three or four minutes before I was given a menu.  Then I experienced an astronomical wait for a RAW appetizer.I ordered the Carpaccio Di Mantro, which took more than 30 minutes to be served. The dish was pretty decent, but nothing spectacular.  The beef was not seasoned evenly as some slices were more salty than the others.  The watercress and cheese helped to bring some flavor to the meat, but the citrus vinaigrette was not prominent enough.  The dish could have a brighter note.Next up was the Petto D'Anatra (Pan-seared Long Island Duck Breast).  Thankfully, this dish came quite quickly after I was done with the app or else I would have been one unhappy camper.  This dish was the star of the night, and brought my experience from an aggravated one to a semi-satisfying one.  The duck breast was perfectly cooked, with each piece being precisely medium rare.  They were tender and extremely juicy.  The pan sauce which it was served with was savory and warming, making the dish comforting.  The re-hydrated prunes provided contrast to the dish.  It was excellent.The customer service was quite poor as I had a long wait to get seated and also had a tremendous wait for the appetizer to come out.  I also noticed that the waiter was more attentive to the Caucasian solo sitting next to me and his dishes came out within 10 minutes of ordering.  I'll let you decide for yourself if it's discrimination or if their customer service is just simply lacking.I wish I could give this restaurant a higher rating because the food rates higher than a 3, but at this time, I cannot.",2,5,7,Nathaniel L.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",74,80,178

2.0,10/30/2015,"This may be fair...may not be fair...but we came here for lunch last week and weren't too impressed. The service was fine, but my wife ended up getting beef Tartar. She likes a culinary experience, but when it showed up she looked at me and whispered, ""It doesn't even look cooked!""I hadn't' heard what she had ordered and asked,""Well, what did you order???""(Wife) ""Beef Tartar""(Husband) ""Baby, that's supposed to be raw...""(Wife) ""...oh. I didn't know...""So being the brave foodies we are, we both took a couple bites. I personally have had beef Tartar before and it was good. This was just a pile of ground beef. Really unappetizing. I love sushi but think if someone gave me a pile of ground salmon, I wouldn't take very lightly to it either. The garnish was lacking in flavor too. I think we ate it wrong or something because if someone has to explain why something tastes good...that means it's not.I ordered the gnocchi, and again, I don't know if I'm being unfair in my review, but I've had some good gnocchi before. This was not it.  The dumplings were harder than they should be and the sauce was not up to par. Whomever made it needs a talking to. Whoever approved of it needs to have their palette checked.So, half of the blame falls on us for the ordering, but really, anything you order should be delicious, shouldn't it? We only ate half our dishes and left to share a panini. That was probably the least amount of food I have ever eaten for 50 bucks.",5,2,2,Geoff L.,"Carlsbad, CA",2145,297,404
5.0,10/29/2015,"I was nervous to come to Eataly on a Saturday night, figuring it would be crowded and much to my dismay it was.  I was able to put my name in for a table for 2 people at the Pizza/Pasta section and at Manzo (the fine dining area of Eataly).  I was told the wait for Pizza/Pasta was an 1 hour and 30 minutes and the wait at Manzo was 40 minutes.  Both hostesses took my phone number and told me they would would send an automated text when my table was ready.  My date and I walked around and went up to the beer garden upstairs to get a drink and kill time.  Before we could finish our first drink, I received a text from Manzo that our table was ready.  For dinner, we ordered a bottle of wine to share ($33), the gnocchi and the ""Tagliata di Manzo"" aka the New York strip steak.  The gnocchi is made in house (Mario Batali wouldn't have it any other way) and topped with a spicy tomato sauce.  It was mouthwateringly amazing and we didn't want the dish to end.  It was savory and delicious and I still have dreams about it.  We didn't think anything could top the gnocchi until we got the Tagliata di Manzo.  This NY strip steak came with potatoes was in a mushroom and oxtail sauce.  After we had finished eating, we used the bread to soak up the sauce that was left on our plate because it was that good.",1,0,1,Julie F.,"New York, NY",217,159,461

5.0,10/4/2015,"Hubby and I came to NYC for our 2 year anniversary.  We'd never been to Eataly before and were happily surprised with everything we found.  It is possibly the only place I've ever seen where customers are drinking glasses of wine while grocery shopping! We ended up eating at Manzo actually accidentally.  The host sort of called us over to take a look at the menu and because we didn't have to wait for a table we decided to eat here.  First, service is impeccable.  We were travelling with our 4.5 month old son and they arranged for a high chair for him and stowed our stroller somewhere safe (like a stroller check as we got a number for it). We ordered: Beef carpaccio for our antipasti to share.  This was so delicious! The best carpaccio we've ever had.  It came with parmigiano reggiano and watercress and the combination with the carpaccio was amazing. We decided to share the primi and ordered the pappardelle.  The pappardelle was perfect.  It was homemade and cooked to a perfect al dente.  It was served with a delicious sauce with pork shoulder and radicchio. For our secondi we ordered the dry aged 32 oz ribeye for two.  We actually had to wait quite a while to get the main course but it was well worth the wait.  They actually brought out the entire ribeye after it had been cooked to show us before they sliced it up.  The steak was cooked perfectly (we like it medium rare).  The meat was ridiculously tender.  Just cutting into the meat you could tell how tender it was.  This was by far one of the best steaks we've ever had.  It was expensive at $105 but since it's meant for two people it wasn't ridiculously expensive and was very much well worth the cost.  We decided to get dessert at the nutella station at Eataly instead but we definitely enjoyed our meal at Manzo.  We've spent a lot more money at other restaurants and definitely had poorer quality food and the fact that we accidentally stumbled upon this gem was an even more pleasant surprise.  We'd definitely come back the next time we're in NYC but I'd also like to check out some of the other restaurants at Eataly as well.",0,0,0,Christine W.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",20,60,9

The menu is small so we both started with the mozzarella and heirloom tomatoes. It was fresh and the tomatoes were sweet. The mozzarella was soft and creamy and seasoned perfectly. The amuse Bouche was a panzanella salad. The bread salad was okay it was very garlicky.

Perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I was ready to wrestle the plate from Jeff and just let him have my duck but that wouldn't have ended well for me, so I didn't.Any food that makes me forget about white rice is exemplary in my book.  I'd definitely come back for the prime rib.",14,12,13,Chris H.,"Los Angeles, CA",747,585,2065

My husband doesn't drink so I'm always pleased to find good wine by the half bottle.  The Barolo I selected was delicious and ideally complemented the food.  Eataly makes among the best gelato in town , so my hubby knew he couldn't pass that up.  I nabbed a couple of spoonfuls and it was as creamy and tasty as we expected. Their espresso is also top notch.  We found the team, from the hostess to the waiter to the sommelier to the  busmen, to be delightful and efficient.  It's not the most beautiful room in town but we were comfortable and it wasn't nearly as noisy as we feared.  We dined early because we had dance tickets at the Joyce and it was packed even at 6 pm.  It's high priced but the food is high quality so you get what you pay for.  We want to return when we have more time to try the tasting menu.",1,0,0,Barbara M.,"New York, NY",8,87,0

My only recommendation would be to ask if you can be seated in the back room when making a reservation. The room is a much smaller room maybe 10 tables tops. The main dinning room seemed pretty congested and loud but this room was quiet, secluded and romantic! For Dinner we opted to get the Chef's Tasting menu with traditional Wine Pairings. Our server brought us each a card that had each course and wine pairing written on it so that we could follow along while they explain what each dish was and why each dish was paired with that wine. I have to commend our server she was very knowledgeable when it came to explaining every detail of the dish and wine. The service in general was top notch! Through out our entire meal various servers came over to make sure everything was satisfactory. Each course was more amazing then the last and the pours were very nice.Overall our experience was fantastic we will definitely be coming back for a round 2 soon.

3.0,1/2/2015,"4 stars for the food. 2 for service. Out of all the restaurants in Eataly this is one is hidden in the back and separated from the hoards of people who walk through the market. I would recommend Manzo if you're looking for a more intimate setting within Eataly. Service was pretty slow from the moment we sat down. We waited a good ten minutes before we were brought over a menu. What irked me even more was that there was no mention of the specials for the night until after we had decided on what we wanted, only then did the waiter decide to mention them so we had to spend a few more minutes thinking about it. Last but not least, when he mentioned the specials he did not mention there was a truffles option to the dishes which I overheard him talking about to every other single table besides ours . Maybe I am being sensitive, but it did not sit well with me and made me wonder if it was because he made the judgement that we wouldn't be able to afford it which would be far from the truth.  We ordered the calf's tongue and cheek, agnolotti with veal to share, the duck and the new york strip loin. The calf's tongue was phenomenal and I loved all the flavors in it. The agnolotti was fresh and I enjoyed the sauce a lot. The duck was cooked to perfection but unfortunately, I was not a big fan of the red cabbage. The steak was also decent, cooked to perfection and the sauce was great. After they cleared our table I asked the waiter to bring us the dessert menu, which never came. I had to ask another waiter for the menu and that took another 10 minutes. By that time I was just so annoyed that I decided to just get the check. Who knew how much longer it would take if I did order dessert. The check took about another 10 minutes and once I paid they gave me the receipt to sign almost immediately. A meal that would usually take max 2 hours for us took us 3 hours due to all the waiting.

5.0,12/22/2014,"There is no shortage of great restaurants in NYC, but our lunch at Manzo has to be one of the best ones I have had in the city.  We ended up eating here to kind of escape the $hitshow that was happening at Eataly.  All of the other venues were in the middle of the space and extremely loud, so when we saw that Manzo was semi-secluded we checked out the place on Yelp! and decided it was worth a try.  We did not have reservations but were seated right away.  First off the service here was awesome.  From the host to the bussers, to the server, these guys had their game on.  Fast, courteous, and efficient.  We started off with the carpaccio which melted in your mouth like butter.  I had the Vesuvio de Gragnano which is Afeltra Vesuvio, Broccoli Rabe Pesto & Sweet Italian Sausage Ragù.  The green sauce was definitely visually surprising, but the flavors in this dish are on point.  The pasta was cooked an amazing al dente and the rich rabe & pesto were a killer compliment to the sweet sausage.  As much as I loved my dish, I have to say my wife's was even better.  She had the Tortelloni which is freshly made and comes with Diamond Creek Ranch Braised Beef & Pickled Brown Beech Mushroom.  All I can say is WOW.  This is a rich, decadent dish that makes me hungry just thinking about it.  The pasta of course is awesome but the earthy brown sauce and mushrooms are absolutely delicious with the braised beef.  Although we were thoroughly stuffed we were drinking so why not have some dessert?  The Bomboloni are fancy doughnuts that come with with Cinnamon Sugar & Vanilla Gelato.  These little calorie bombs were the perfect ending to our meal.We thoroughly enjoyed a relaxing lunch here with some glasses of wine and cocktails.  It was definitely a welcome relief from the hustle and bustle of the rest of Eataly.",1,1,2,Paul M.,"Southwest Ranches, FL",511,687,2070

Everyone we encountered while sitting at the bar was super friendly and helpful, the staff here seem genuinely happy and interested in making sure the customer had a good experience. Our server was a super friendly and patient girl with curly hair. She was especially helpful whem we were trying to decide on what bottle of wine to get. She asked us a lot of questions and patiently waited for me to try numerous samples before we finally made a decision. Her recommendation was spot on and I was very happy with the wine! While the prices here are a bit high I was very pleased with the quality, taste and presentation of all our dishes. For starters we got the carne cruda and the roasted beets. Omg both of these dishes were delicious!! I can't even decide which one I like best, this was probably one of the best beet dishes I've ever had. For my main meal I got the tortelloni with braised beef and mushrooms. The beef was so tender! I loved this and my only complaint was that the portion was pretty small for a main course. I ate everything on my plate! I'm not a fan of big portions, but I also want enough to feel full and had we not ordered starters we probably would have been hungry.

It appears to be a very casual almost deli when you walk up but its actually a fantastic place to sit, have a drink or eat a full meal and enjoy the great atmosphere while you people watch. The drinks list has cocktails, beer and wine - my blood orange Bellini was fantastic.The lady who took our order was so friendly and helpful, explaining we could walk around anywhere with our drinks except the 15th floor (they have a separate liqueur licence so you can't take drinks up or down). We couldn't resist having one small plate to eat, the menu is really good. The mozzarella had been recommended so we went for that. It did not disappoint - possibly up there with the best dishes I've eaten. Every element of the dish worked and blended together into one perfect experience. I would actually go back to eat it again today.The gentlemen next to us were sharing three other small plates that also looked great. They then had (yes, yes I'm a food perv - I look at what other people are having!) the rib eye for two. This looked and smelt amazing. The server brought it over, showed it to them perfectly cooked and then took it away to rest and carve it. She returned with two plates of perfectly presented food. I'd had half a bottle of prosecco and a Bellini at this point so very nearly started chatting to them about their food. Luckily the British reserve overcame the tipsy friendliness and I resisted. I'm not sure even Americans want to stop and talk when they are eating steak of that quality! I have to say I preferred this food and drink to what we had in Birreria upstairs.

1.0,12/29/2013,"Manzo is yet another overpriced pretending-to-be Italian restaurant, which is using the ""Eataly"" brand to charge you a ridiculous amount of money for discrete food. NYC is full of expensive Italian restaurants, for the same prices one can get so much better food, quality, and service. I went there for lunch with my parents. First thing that went wrong: I joined my parents after they already ordered, nobody brought me a glass of water, nobody ever came to take my order. Second thing that went wrong: my parents waited for 1 HOUR for spaghetti with tomato sauce and a steak. The restaurant's excuse is that the steak takes time to cook...we asked to have the pasta first and then the steak, they replied that it was not possible and that they bring everything at the same time!! Now, if in Italy we call them ""Primi"" and ""Secondi"" there is a reason. The reason is that you first bring the Primi, and then you bring the Secondi, they don't go together!!! In fact by the time my parents ate the pasta, the steak was cold. Finally the presentation of the dish was basically not existing. If you cook at home some pasta and throw on it tomato sauce, you get the same pasta of Manzo. BTW they charge 18 dollars for that. Total price: 95 dollars for 2 spaghetti with tomato sauce, 1 steak, 1 glass of wine, and 1 hour of wait. I ended up eating a slice of pizza at the bakery next to the restaurant (in fact nobody took my order, I wasn't kidding). I paid 3.80$ for prosciutto and mozzarella pizza. It was quite delicious.

Literally, an entire glass...it was all over my friend's light sweater and made quite a mess. My friend remained very calm and didn't cause any more of a scene than was already made. The bus boy was very apologetic and brought out club soda right away. However, what was strange was that our waitress witnessed the whole thing and didn't even come over to say anything.Next, our waitress seemed to just disappear. We had to wait for the same bus boy to come back so that we could ask him to get her. When he told her what happened, the waitress came over and blankly stared at my friend, who was dabbing her sweater with club soda. HELLO WAITRESS?!? WAKE UP!!We literally had to ask her if she could refill the glass of red wine, since the entire glass was spilled by her staff. And then we had to ask her if we could speak to the manager about my friend's sweater. When the manager came over, it seemed like it was such a nuisance for her to offer to cover my friend's dry-cleaning bill. Wow. Well sooooorry. Lady, we're talking red wine here...it ain't exactly unnoticeable on a light sweater and it ain't exactly the easiest thing to clean!!When the bill came, we were actually somewhat surprised that there was no accommodation. A comparable place would've added that gesture. We ordered a decent amount, which would come out to be about $75 per head, including two bottles of wine, so what we found fair was just to ask the waitress about comping my friend's glass of wine...A different manager came over and said no, that isn't possible because they opened another bottle SPECIALLY FOR US to refill my friend's glass, and they were already offering to pay for her dry-cleaning service. OH WAIT...LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT...you SPECIALLY opened a bottle, therefore doing us a huge favor, because a member of YOUR STAFF spilled an entire glass of red wine on my friend's sweater and now my friend needs to go out of her way to bring her sweater to the dry-cleaner, then deal with your brilliant staff yet again to chase down a reimbursement? Gee, thanks a bunch. Thanks for SPECIALLY doing that FOR US, with a topping of attitude!!By the way...to the second manager who brought over our second bottle of wine...YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO OPEN THE BOTTLE IN FRONT OF US!!

Located in the very cool Eaterly market/restaurant complex, (which has many choices) we chose a more ""sit down"" dinner vibe at Manzo. I went light for a starter and got the Baby Wild Arugula with Parmigiano Reggiano & Aceto Balsamico. When I saw the giant wheels of imported cheeses in the market area on my way in, I knew I was going to order something with Italian hard cheese. It was very good indeed.Since manzo means beef (or Steer maybe?) and it was the specialty of the house, I decided to go with a beef dish. I was torn between the Strip Steak and the Rib. I ended up going with the Slow Roasted Beef Rib with Spina Rossa Polenta & Barbaresco Vinaigrette. It was really one of the best pieces of beef I've ever eaten in my life. Full of flavor, broke apart wonderfully and went well with the Polenta. I could've eaten two more easily.The little woman went with the Tortelloni with Braised Beef & Brown Beech Mushrooms.

3.0,8/16/2013,"Heard that the beef is really good here, Manzo means beef in Italian. Since I am in NY, and is meeting a friend who has dietary requirement.  We both love all the eatery in Eataly and she picked this one.  I arrived early, but the other two in the party of 3 had not, so they refuse to sit me of course.  Then my friend arrived, she is an elderly lady, so I just went up to the hostess and said my friend is old and she would like to sit down, and see if she could seat us right away.   She asked if the third person is on his/her way and when she got a yes, she did.  I guess it is not her thought, but the seating policy. We were seated at a corner table, I thought that was good, I always like corner table, so you don't have to have anyone walking pass you all the time.  However, this one happens to have the cleaning lady's cupboard behind, after about half and hours sitting there, I kept hearing a slamming noise and it kind of shade the partition at the back.  You have to understand Manzo is not exactly it's own restaurant in Eataly, it does not have it's own walls it is made out of partition on the ground floor.  I had the NY Strip steak and I loved it, the meat is good and it is tasty, but it is not exactly melt in the mouth kind of good.. One friend ordered a halibut he said it was a bit drier than he would have liked, I was annoyed that why would not he said anything to the waiter.  Now it come to service, I originally went for the Lunch Special, and I chose the NY Strip too, she asked me what would I want for appetizer, I said normally one course is enough for me for lunch.  Before I could even say anything, she said then I am better off with the NY Strip on the main menu.  I don't mind since they both NY strip steak and I don't take dessert at lunch time,  It is just that she was snappy and blunt.  She is lucky that I am not paying the bill, if I were, then I might not give the usual 20% tips.",0,0,0,Grace H.,"Brooklyn, NY",88,716,4430
5.0,8/15/2013,"Having eaten at literally every other restaurant in Eataly, it was time to bite the bullet. And by bullet I mean absurd amounts of meat.To start, just a quite nod to the excellent service. As for decor, it's Eataly. So, unless you are prepared to sit amongst the chaos, you will not find this particularly nice or romantic. That said, it is offset in its own little corner, so it's not quite as chaotic as the rest of the restaurants there.Okay, now for the food.First, the the wine by the glass, the Montepulciano was excellent and went perfect with our meal. Gotta give huge thumbs up to Eataly as a whole, for offering solid ""by the glass"" options. So few places do.Also, the bread and olive oil were excellent. And the best part, you can go buy them right after your meal.Now for the main event:The Carne Crudo is a very solid good. So buttery and creamy. But I actually found the crostinis competed with its flavor and that it went better with the house bread, which allowed the quality of the dish to shine even brighter.Next we had the Agnolotti and I practically melted in my seat along with the pasta as it exploded with beefy goodness in my mouth.And for entrees, we split the pork belly and the NY Strip. And while the Strip was perfectly cooked with wonderful compliments, the pork belly was sheer artistry. And last but not least, for dessert we had the bambolinos (beignets) and the chocolato. Both are great, but I'm a sucker for beignets, so they won as far as I'm concerned.The only downside was that I was so full after lunch I didn't eat again for the rest of the day. Or maybe that's a good thing, because I'm not sure my arteries could've handle much more.",0,0,0,Ari H.,"Mt Kisco, NY",171,412,0

5.0,7/14/2013,"Manzo. In Italian it means beef. However to me, Manzo means an unforgettable meal. While wandering around Eataly in the Flatiron district, my stomach started to rumble. I knew I needed to eat, but where? I must have circled Eataly at least five times before deciding on Manzo. I sat at the bar where I was greeted and served by the wonderful Gina. She asked me if I wanted tap or bottled water, to which I replied, ""Whatever is easier for you."" Normally this is where a server would decide what is easiest for them to bring out to me. Gina came back at me with, ""No, it's whatever you want."" At first I thought it was a bit rude, but I realized that she genuinely wanted to take care of whatever I needed. It was a recurring theme that was apparent throughout the entire dining experience.With her recommendation, I ordered the seared strip loin. It came with some baby arugula and trumpet mushrooms with a foie gras sudo. This dish was absolutely divine! I would have licked the plate clean if I lacked any table manners.For the next course, I ordered the oxtail stuffed agnolotti. This was also served with a foie gras sauce and much like the strip loin, this dish was amazing. I couldn't believe how much flavor they were able to pack into the homemade agnolotti. I admit that I was pretty stuffed at this point. I completely demolished both dishes and a ton of their house bread. Gina then recommended that I try the espresso infused panna cotta. It came with candied fennel and a dehydrated fennel chip. I was instantly sold. The candied fennel just works with the panna cotta and the panna cotta itself was creamy and delicious. The real winner here though, was the dehydrated fennel chip. It was remarkable!Not only was the food amazing, but Gina herself did all she could to ensure that I was having a great time. She even helped me with my Italian (I'm trying to learn) here and there while I ate. In fact, I thought the service that she provided was so exceptional, I asked to speak to the restaurant manager to offer very positive feedback on her behalf. This is something that I rarely do. So for me to want to speak to the manager should speak volumes about the gesture itself. Now, I don't know when I'll be able to visit Manhattan again, but when I do, I am definitely returning to Manzo to try some more of their dishes. Mario Batali should definitely be proud that his name is attached to this gem.",2,0,3,Mark M.,"Aiea, HI",461,434,310

I would say that everything was good, fresh, and delicious but if I had to recommend anything, I would recommend the other places in Eataly (wine and cheese or the pizza place for example).

3.0,6/26/2013,"I used to be a huge fan of Manzo but in more recent dining trips, I've become dissatisfied with the way their food is prepared. My girlfriends and I were here celebrating a friend's return to NYC after a year stint in Malaysia. I suggested Manzo because frankly, it is (was) amazing!Read below for breakdown:Interior/Décor: * Crowded. If you are not into small spaces or dining near someone a few feet away from you, this is not the space for you.Service/Friendliness: **The water glass was always filled. Our wine bottle was kept cooled in a wine chilled bucket. When my friend canceled an order of her Rib Eye, they still brought it out anyway. When my Guinea Hen tasted very gamey, they gave me the option of selecting a replacement meal but did not seem thrilled about having to take the dish back.Critique of Food: **Veal Sweetbreads with Sea Scallops, Garbanzo Beans & Pancetta. For those who don't know, sweetbreads are the thymus gland of a lamb or calf. In this particular dish, the sweetbreads of the calf were lightly fried, and when paired with the sea scallops, gave it a perfect balance to the silky, mushy insides of the rich organ. Even my extremely picky and new-to-food friend took a bite and liked this dish.NY Strip Steak w/ Fingerling Potatoes, Oyster Mushroom & Oxtail Sugo: The Strip Steak was requested by my friend to be cooked ""medium plus"" but ended up on our table as a ""medium"". Now, I'm a huge fan of having my red meat more on the ""medium minus"" side so I found this dish delectable. The meat melts right in your mouth.Gnocchi with Spicy Tomato Sauce & Fresh Ricotta: The gnocchi was a little overcooked in my opinion, making the pasta more mushy than chewy. The spicy tomato sauce tasted like a typical light tomato sauce with some red pepper flakes in it.Vesuvio with Peas, Soft Shell Crab & Pancetta: This was the dish that replaced the Guinea hen and while it was a better option, the soft shell crab was very, very salty. The menu does not mention that the peas are actually mushed into a cream sauce, giving the pasta its light green color, which I found refreshing to counterbalance the salty crab. The pancetta was overkill with all the salt in this dish. But it was still a preferred option to the hen.Star Quality: Ribeye for Two. Simply looks, and is cooked to perfection. Great wine selection.Needs Improvement: The flavor, texture and pairing of their dishes.Choice Pick(s): Chitarra Spaghetti with Lobster and Basil Tomato Sauce, NY Strip Steak, and if you're in a daring mood, Veal Sweetbreads",7,4,4,Christina E.,"New York, NY",1205,310,2049

We had reservations and were seated promptly at one of the small tables, which was good.We frequent Eataly for coffee, cold cuts and cheeses to go, fresh seafood, bread, etc. from the market and love the stand-up bar in the middle court. This was our first sit-down meal at one of their restaurants.Service: Inconsistent throughout (2 stars at most, expected better from Manzo)It was freezing inside, and when we went to order drinks, I asked the waiter if it was possible to bring me some fresh mint leaves in hot water instead of a caffeinated beverage. He said that if they don't have fresh mint, he'd get some from the market. I told him not to worry about it if it was any trouble at all, and he assured me that it was no trouble whatsoever. Soon after, another waiter showed up with a cup of hot water and lemon. No mint. There was no mention of the mint for the remainder of the evening, even though the waiter who took the order saw the hot water sitting there untouched the entire evening. Strange, right?We, the couple next to us, and then another couple at a different table next to us all ordered the lobster linguini at various points during the evening. The couple next to us was offered freshly grated cheese.  The other couple was offered freshly grated pepper. We were offered neither.Food: Decent, but not out of this world (3 stars)We got the goat cheese and beet salad for the appetizer, which was delicious.We also got the lobster linguini, as I mentioned above. The lobster (both my husband's and mine) was chewy and WAY overcooked.For the meal, I had the slow-cooked ribs, and my husband had the NY strip steak.

Our waiter seemed lost, maybe just young and unaware that this is an expensive restaurant and it would be proper to offer a cocktail, check on the table, and know the menu. The menu was relatively simple and small, which is OK, but when my wife ordered the Striped Bass, he informed us that they were out of it and preparing the dish with Red Snapper. It's not the same. When I joked that they had Striped Bass at the fish stand at the entrance to Manzo, he didn't even crack a smile. We started with the arugula salad, which was very good. The lamb gnocchi was good, but the sauce was not spicy with Calabrian chile peppers as described. Really sort of bland but good texture on the pasta itself. I had the New York Strip, which was cut into slices. Excellent steak, cooked perfectly medium rare, but the sauce was very very salty and hurt the dish. The dish was described with fingerling potatoes and mushrooms, but they were really just garnish- barely present. The Red Snapper was also browned perfectly, but the overall dish was unremarkable. My daughter ordered the Pork Belly, that was very fatty with an overly salty sauce.The cost of the dinner for 4 with one shared salad, two orders of Gnocchi, 4 entrees, no cocktails, and a nice bottle of wine ($125), and no desert totalled over $400 and was just Ok.

4.0,9/17/2012,"""Let's go to the restaurant at Eataly, ya know, the nice one.""  That's how the my Friday evening started.  I'll be honest, I had marginal expectations at best.  Don't get me wrong, I love Eataly.  I go there all the time.  But I've also seen the restaurants, and if I'm looking for a cozy spot for dinner on a Friday night, I don't want to be in the middle of a supermarket with people watching me eat while they do their food shopping.  Little did I know that Manzo has its own little corner, tucked away next to the fish counter.   The moment you enter, you leave the bustling hubbub of the shoppers and other diners, and are transported to a cute little restaurant that could hold its own on any corner in the city.We had no reservations on a Friday night at 8 PM, but there was only about an hour wait, so we had a few glasses of wine at La Piazza while waiting.  The hostess took my cell number, but we wandered over just about as the hour was up, and she was able to seat us right away.  Walking in, it was great to see this was a real restaurant - formal servers, linen napkins, the whole 9.  Décor was a little understated, and the ambiance was nice and quiet - welcome relief from the Piazza.  Now, onto the food.  Menu is small, but has a little of everything.  We started with the Razza Piemontese Beef Carpaccio, which was perfect.  Presented beautifully in razor thin slices, you can gather each forkful just by scraping it across the plate.  Absolutely perfect.  We both left the fried quail egg alone, I've never seen the appeal of ruining capriccio with yolky egg.  For Primi, we went with the Oricchiette with Rabbit Ragu and Chanterelles.  I think this is when I realized we were at a true Batali / Bastianich establishment.  This dish would be at home on the Babbo pasta tasting menu.  It was just phenomenal.  Creamy and savory, I had to control myself from eating the entire plate because I knew what was coming for Secondi - another Razza Peimontese, this time the Porterhouse for Two, cooked medium rare.  Years ago, Becco was the first Italian restaurant where I ordered steak - up until then I would only order steak at a Steakhouse.  Seeing as Manzo is ""the"" meat restaurant at Eataly, we had to go with steak, and again Bastianich did not disappointed.  First test, was it cooked to the correct temperature?  Absolutely.  I usually don't go for the porterhouse, but I learned that it is a filet and NY Strip, two of my favorites.  The NY strip portion was very good, but the filet was amazing.  Melt in your mouth, tender, and perfectly seasoned.  Truly as good of a steak as I've had anywhere.  For dessert we tried the Millefoglie alla Crema with Cherry Gelato and a dessert wine that's escaping me right now.  Very good, but I only had room for a single bite.  So after this amazing review, why only four stars?  Two main reasons, the first being the price.  Everything was amazing, but this was just a bit on the pricy side.  Full dinner for two, including a bottle of red on the lower end of the price range, came out to just under $500 with tax and tip included.  And don't forget the few glasses of wine while waiting for the table to be ready.  Second detraction was the service.  The service was definitely good, but at this price point, it was lacking that finesse or polish that makes it seem effortless.  Both our server and sommelier were very nice and attentive, but there were little things like filling up our water glasses (same issue I had at Babbo).  They also brought out the entrees while my dining companion was in the restroom.  Big no-no in my book.  (They did put a food cover over his to keep it from getting cold, however my parents raised me right so I didn't touch mine until he got back).  All in all I was extremely happy with this meal and will most definitely be going back.  I love being surprised by a place, and Manzo pulled it off very well.",1,1,1,Clifford R.,"Manhattan, NY",50,169,8

We shared the mozzarella starter, which the manager commented that she had for breakfast. We also shared a homemade pasta stuffed with rocotta in a butter sauce and paired with avocado squash.

3.0,8/18/2012,"Maybe heading to Eataly / Manzo on a Saturday afternoon with no reservation wasn't the best idea, but I enjoyed it overall.  We were quoted a 30-45 minute wait which ended up being closer to an hour, but I understand that it's a very small space and it was during a rush hour.  The hostesses were very patience with our constant checking-in and we're a pleasure to talk to.The food was delicious.  I personally don't thinks he food warranted the huge price tag, but it was still very tasty.  We really enjoyed the Mozzarella appetizer with heirloom tomatoes and basil with bacon.  Three of us had the tortelloni with beef and mushroom butter.  It was very rich and filling.  One of my guests has a linguini with crab that was very good as well.  The Sangiovini wine was fantastic.The menu is rather small and some of the prices are a little too high (in my humble opinion).  Since Manzo is the ""meat"" restaurant in Eataly, I would say that the menu is varied, though not large.  It featured beef, pork, and rabbit.I would go here again, but would be more likely to enjoy a glass of wine and some antipasto or other small bites at the bar area.",0,0,0,Chouette T.,"New York, NY",298,22,1

But Manzo has some walls and really does feel separate, even though it's still on the same floor as the market. The menu is not huge, but there are some great options (if you are a vegetarian, this is not the restaurant for you).  I had my eye on a pasta dish with lobster and another pasta dish with pork, but actually opted for a lunch special: orecchiette pasta with rabbit which was amazing! Also, for dessert, try the chocolate chip gelato...melts in your mouth.

It was some of the best gnocchi i've had, along with some great sauce.  It looked like small portion but was so filling.  As an entree i had the grilled rib eye, which was one of the best steaks i've had.  The steak had to be close to 3 inches thick, which allowed it to be perfectly cooked.  The outside had a great char while the inside stayed red.  They also put some kind of glaze on the steak that i loved.  The steak didn't melt in your mouth, but had great flavor.  It might be the best seasoning on a steak that i've tried.  This restaurant should definitely be high on your list for special occasion dinners or if you're a steak lover.",1,0,0,John P.,"Queens, NY",154,594,399

4.0,4/22/2012,"Being a lover of Molto Mario, I had to try Mr. Batali's latest addition to his empire. Manzo it was and being a lover of all things meat and beef I was very excited. The place is situated inside an alcove the Eataly SUPERmarket and isn't in the greatest location. However, It managed to seem like it was a restaurant unto its own once you step inside.I was escorted to a table all the way to the back of the restaurant. The menu is very extensive with a spring tasting, antipasti, pastas, main courses, and a few side dishes or contorni as us Italians call them.When in a Batali restaurant you must order pasta so for my first course I went with the fusilli with duck ragu and foie gras. Three of my favorite things in one plate. The fusilli was cooked perfectly al dente and there was a generous amount of duck confit which was pulled and very juicy. I didn't really taste the foie gras component but my guess is it was somehow incorporated into the tomato based sauce. Delicious and hearty dish. I got through half before deciding to save room for the main course.After much deliberating, I decided to go for broke and ordered the massive porterhouse which is supposed to be for two and a side of potato crocche. This isn't the first time I have done such a thing and it was much to the waiter's (and kitchens) delight. He said when they heard I was ordering it for myself tthey said hat was ""one bad ass order"".The porterhouse came out perfectly cooked to my specified rare, black and bordering on blue. However, the ""black"" part was missing (meaning there was not a significant crust on the outside). It was presented sliced into about 18 pieces surrounded by arugula, canellini beans, parmigiano shaving, and a drizlled of aceto manodori which is a balsamic vinegar. This was definitely around 32-36 oz and a legitimate porterhouse. Some places claim it to be that big but it is not. As for the taste, it was a very good piece of meat. However, they lost big points in one area. I did not realize in the description that the steak is smoked! After a few pieces the smokiness really got to me and I had to douse the steak with salt to tame it. The smoke gave it a beef jerky, pastrami, almost hot dog like smell and taste which i am not a huge fan of. I like my meat salt, pepper, butter and unadulterated. A great piece of meat like that should stand on its own and the smoking prep was overkill. I wanted a steak, not a ham. Also, I am not a fan of beans so I wish I knew they came with that because I would have requested something else. But still it was an experience. The potato crocche side were delicious. 7 large potato croquettes that were perfectly crispy exterior and creamy potato inside. I forgoed dessert and I was very full. I would definitely like to come back to Manzo to try their other pastas and some of their other main courses were tempting like the short rib over spin rosso polenta. Two thumbs up to service as it was also very attentive.",0,0,0,G C.,"New York, NY",21,264,798
5.0,4/19/2012,"Holy mother of deliciousness.My wife and I went here after a grueling week of work to treat ourselves, and good lord was it worth it. We started with the Carne Sala, a lovely medley of bresaola with shaved apple, arugula, and a caramel flavored drizzle. I've always been a fan of marrying sweet and savory flavors, and this dish does it to perfection.For dinner we split the Razza Piemontese Smoked Porterhouse for two. Flat. Out. Amazing. It really was an unbelievable cut of meat. Cured to absolute perfection - you heard me - PERFECTION. The smokey flavor was unlike any other steak I've ever had. The Razza Piemontese cattle are protected by the region of Vercelli in order to preserve the lineage that keeps the meat so tender and lean. As a result, we get to feast on one of the leanest cuts of steak around. The steak was served with grilled brussel sprouts that were noteworthy in their own right. Of course, the wine list at Manzo is extensive and packed with gems from all over Italy. It's hard to make a bad decision on wine here.It's a little pricey, so for my wife and I, it's definitely a ""special occasion"" place, but it made this particular occasion very, very special.

5.0,4/17/2012,"Full review blogged, high points below:Deciding to go with four courses each our antipasti certainly weren't the lightest options on the menu and with two of us choosing from the main menu and one opting for a selection from the tasting the trio arrived in grand fashion with one waiter delivering each plate and beginning with the Jewel Yam with Trumpet Mushroom, Pancetta & Saba both the flavor and presentation of it and subsequent dish would be quite impressive.  For the Yam, while I only had a couple of bites, what I tasted was surprisingly complex as the tuber was presented as a puree, a baked skin, and as crispy straws all working in harmony with the hefty roasted mushroom to balance the brine of the crispy pork and drizzled cooked wine.  Sweet and savory, crisp and creamy, it was the least ""expected"" wow of the afternoon.Dining with a foie gras queen and myself also known to overindulge on the delicacy the other two antipasti would prove every bit as good as expected and with myself opting for the Foie Gras Terrine with Chestnuts, Cranberry Mostarda & Pannetone while the lady chose the Seared Foie Gras with Cotechino, Lentils & Aceto Balsamico it was not only a tossup as to which was better, but also which was a better bargain; to say the least, Manzo doesn't skimp when it comes to foie.  Beginning first with the seared preparation my first thought was that the richness of the sausage would be too much for the liver but in reality the pairing worked well  thanks to the nuttiness of the lentils and the sweet acidity of the balsamic, both cutting the fattiness of each item substantially without muting the flavors.  Moving next to the terrine - let's just say it stacked up favorably to the one at Per Se the day before in terms of texture and quality while the creamy chestnuts and cranberries were a lovely wintery touch even as the temperatures outside hovered in the unseasonable mid-60s - and buttered, grilled Pannetone? Wow.Dining with familiar friends and knowing that much sharing was to be done it was with little difficulty that we made our primi choices and again with a waiter per each large plate the portion sizes would actually prove shocking and with suggested cheeses shaved tableside the tasting began with the ""Orecchiette with Sausage & Broccoli Rabe Pesto,"" the only dry pasta of the group, imported direct from Italy, and perfect al dente with the spicy fennel sausage chopped directly into the robust sauce and notes of bitter and pepper nicely balanced by a mild sweetness, plenty of basil, and a dusting of aged Tellagio.Moving next to a dish simply called ""Agnolotti with Brown Butter & Parmigiano"" I was amazed when it arrived with more than a dozen thumb-sized pockets of pasta and after a quick tableside dusting of Parmigiano my impression only improved after taking a bite.  House made, these agnolotti were not the ultra thin ravioli of Babbo but instead a toothsome Piemontese pocket stuffed to bursting with a creamy blend of Fontina, Mozzarella, Veal, Pork, and spices that literally melted in the mouth like a savory pudding.  Simply dressed and intensely flavored this was probably my favorite pasta of the afternoon.For the final primi selection I ordered the Spaghetti alla Chitarra with Lobster, Tomato & Basil and finished tableside with Tellagio the dish delivered exactly what was expected of it - tender house made pasta, snappy lobster, plus a bold and bright sauce with acid and sweetness in harmony.  It was simple, it was fresh, and it was delicious.For my main course, this time the Fusilli with Duck Ragu & Foie Gras, another mountain of carbohydrates but this time fortifying the beautiful San Marzano tomatoes with the smooth sapor of foie gras and adding texture with a combination of duck confit and cracklins- the overall effect like a hearty duck stew and only improved with the tableside addition of 24-month aged Parmigiano Reggiano DOP.Moving next to something a bit more substantial...and when I say 'a bit' I actually mean a daily special from Raven & Boar featuring about twelve ounces of bone-in chop from a whey fed pig along with winter vegetables, kale, leeks, brown butter, and aceto balsamico.  Having had Batali's interpretation of pork more than once in the past I guess it really should have come as no surprise that the supple pig arrived in such plethora, but roasted or not I still fail to comprehend how they manage to cook such a thick chop so well without charring the surface.For our final savory another substantial dish arrived entitled ""Glazed Duck with Shiitakes, Charred Scallions, Pancetta & Persimmon"" and like everything else about that afternoon the execution was flawless.  Beginning first with the Long Island sourced fowl, a large margret was presented with minimal fat overlying the supple, rosy flesh and resting atop a thick bed of woodsy mushrooms, pungent scallions, and sweet persimmon 'pudding' the plate was completed with a light touch of local honey.",5,1,5,Michael U.,"Las Vegas, NV",3078,4440,99503

5.0,4/11/2012,"So I have to let everyone know about a wonderful find. Yesterday , April 10, I was in New York to visit the New Balance Experience Store and on the recommendation of a friend, we went to Manzo.Manzo is part of the Eataly franchise; if you are not familiar with this, it is an enormous indoor-outdoor Italian market located on Madison Park in New York City. The market alone is an experience in the completely New York style. It is packed wall-to-wall with wonderful and surprising decadence like you only find in the Big Apple. There are counters selling rich dark chocolates, made in house, right next to a fish monger with $600+/ounce caviar and just-off-the-boat deep sea fish and a butcher shop where they are cutting down a full side of angus steer. It is also packed wall-to-wall with people... locals, tourists, local tourists, everyone. Richt in the middle of all this chaos is Manzo. Manzo is overseen by head chef Michael Toscano and his Special Forces team of waiters. From the moment you walk up to the podium, you are in the hands of professionals. We were almost thirty minutes late for our reservation, we had fifteen people and we were under dressed. Nothing fazed them in the least. We were seated in seconds, happily introduced to our team of waters and treated like visiting royalty. Water, bread, menus, recommendations, more bread; all magically appeared and disappeared without even a pause. The food prices are definitely $$$ or even $$$$ but they have a prix fixe luncheon option that is only $26 for three courses. For a four star New York location, it might as well have been free. I started with an arugula and pomegranate salad with spiced toasted pumpkin seeds, shaved pecorino and balsamic reduction. It was a very generous portion size for a starter salad. I also was able to taste their Carpaccio with shaved ptarmigan, lardo and olio Toscano. Melt in your mouth delicious. Oh, did I mention the magical bread basket? The table selection of still-warm-from-the-oven breads was perfect, and if you so much as took a bite from it, it was instantly refilled. I would also love to know what brand of olive oil they were importing. It was a rich dark green and had the perfect bite to it. For my entre, I had the red snapper with pickled eggplant, basil reduction and pepper infused olive oil. The cut was generous, and there was a spice rub on the fish that was so well balanced you could taste every individual grain of sea salt against the peppers. The pickling on the eggplant was the perfect balance of brine and sweet and it picked up the flavor from the chili oil very well. Sadly, the basil was slightly overpowered, but it did cool the whole dish very well. I also got to taste their braised rib with polenta and the wild mushroom tortellini with dark gravy (almost an au juice). The glaze on the rib was caramelized so well that it looked like a warm brownie (that's right, I went there, MEAT BROWNIES!!!) and so tender we were actually cutting it with a spoon just to see if we could, and we could. OMG! The wild mushrooms were so fresh; they popped when you bit into them and the gravy was deep, dark and earthy with flavor. We finished the meal with a taste of the vanilla cake; it was really more of a vanilla bean loaf with a mark of light, slightly tangy custard and zest. Oh, and a perfect cup of rich espresso. They use a Lavazza espresso machine and it operated like a fine tuned engine, steaming out jet-fuel strength brown joy! It was amazing, delicious, decadent, perfect food. My recommendation: if you have not been there, you need to go there right now. No, I mean it, get in your car and get there now!",1,0,0,Brandon G.,"Somerville, MA",41,8,0

Seriously.  The place is massive and packed full of everything Italia.  I don't even know where to start.  It must be the largest concentration of Italian import food goods, plus hand made stuff, plus specialty restaurants on the planet.  I'm convinced.  I was in hog heaven.  Now if only those other bazillion people crammed in there would get out of my way!It goes like this:  Every specific section contains a grocery plus a restaurant and then there are little prepared foods take-out areas scattered about.  So, you could go to the fish section and buy fresh fish to cook at home, or you could sit down at Pesce and order from the seafood dominant menu.  Same with the produce.  There's a section of beautiful and interesting fruits and veggies but there's also a counter with it's own hot line serving all veggie dishes.  There's also a coffee bar and a gelato counter, whose line backs up to the line of people waiting at the panino counter.  Plus, an entire restaurant dedicated to pasta and pizza, of course (I really wanted to go there!), and a bread counter selling a huge variety of breads I haven't seen since I was in Italy last.  And I haven't even mentioned the salumi and cheese bar which contains an area where people are making fresh mozzarella in front of your eyes, which is next to the counter with whole legs of prosciutto and other beautiful cured things hanging above you.  Oh, and there's wine, and cookies, and preserves, and confections, and more pasta than you can shake a stick at (fresh and dried), and a rotisserie carving porcini rubbed prime rib to-go.... yeah, it's pretty fabulous.Coffee Roasting Counter Salumi Overhead, Fresh Mozz Bar on the Right... this makes me happy.Whole Rotisserie Chickens & Porcini-Rubbed Prime RibOne of several isles of pasta.

PeppersThen we moved on to the Primi.  Honestly, the texture of each one of these pastas is unrivaled to me in the US.  Each different and perfect.  Incredible.  Michael, I want you secrets.Pappardelle with Mushrooms and AsparagusTajarin with Roasted Meat JuicesI'm glad they sent this little extra.  It would've been a shame to miss!Meat filled Agnolotti. The filling was so juicy it burst in your mouth! Amazing!Then a Secondo...Piedmont Beef Tagliata with Fava Beans, Mushrooms and Bone Marrow Agrodolce.And with that they sent...Souffle Potatoes aka Crispy Deep Fried Mashed PotatoesYou'd think that was enough.  There were only 4 of us, for crying out loud.  But noooo.... Caitlin wouldn't let us get away without dessert too!Dense Chocolate Buddino with Sweet Ground Sicilian Pistachios and Vanilla GelatoLimoncello Cake with Yogurt and CranberriesOh my gosh.  By the end of it, we were stuffed!  Such a wonderful dinner as I knew it would be!  Thanks guys!  See you on the next NYC weekend trip!",1,0,0,Camille P.,"Chicago, IL",41,61,27

At first I was cynical because basically it looks like a giant cubicle set up in the middle of Eataly, but I had a gift certificate I received as a gift so it was worth a shot. Once seated, you forget you're in the middle of Eataly. The wine list was OK, a lot of focus on the more commercial wines of Piedmont. I started with the tajarin al sugo d'arrosto. I recently visited Piedmont and tajarin being the pasta of the area, I was craving it. The pasta was outstanding. I was originally expecting a sauce simiar to ragu with this pasta but what I received was a pleasant surprise. The sauce is basically made with the drippings from beef and veal roasts. It was packed with so much flavor. My wife had the spicy gnocchi. The gnocchi themselves were OK, not dense, but not pillows like really good gnocchi are. The spicy tomato sauce was excellent on the dish. For our main, we shared the Raven and Boar Whey Pig plate which had a sausage, the shoulder, and the belly. This dish was also beautiful. Juicy, fatty flavorful pork with a great acidic sauce. We also shared sides of brussels sprouts and polenta, the latter which could stand as its own course.

The fresh pasta special was great as well.  It had a tomato lamb ragu.  Also the razor clam pasta was succulent and clammy, in the best sense of the word.  We ate at the bar since we didn't have a reservation but it was a great experience, even better than the table I think.  The servers were just as attentive.",0,0,0,Mary L.,"Los Angeles, CA",762,725,966
2.0,9/12/2011,"On a recent trip to New York, I got to enjoy my first taste of Eataly and in doing so dined at Manzo.  I will start by saying that the food was good; in fact several of the dishes were VERY good, but in a city with SO many alternatives for great food and quality service, I left disappointed by the experience.The irritating nature of their customer care began at check-in.  I was the first of three people to arrive for the reservation.  After attempting to check in for our reservation (5:15pm for 3 on a Wednesday), I was sent upstairs to see if the reservation might instead be for the beer garden.  I returned to Manzo 10 minutes later to find the other two members of my party being met with the threat that the table was going to be given away if I (now the final of the three members) did not arrive within two minutes.  (Admittedly there was a miscommunication here, but how many 3-person reservations do they get at that hour?  Doesn't it seem coincidental that you have a ""2"" and a ""1"" showing up separately for 3-person reservations?).  Once seated, we were on the clock.  It was made very clear that we needed to be vacated by 7:15 for the next reservation.  (The restaurant is 10-20% full at this point).  We were met with similar time guidelines during each initial visit by the wait staff.  Recognizing the urgency, we attempted to place an order.  We had decided on several starters and several entrees, and at this point were well into our second glasses of wine.  The waitress refused to take our order unless given in its entirety.  I happened to mention that we may add an additional side, at which time she left until we were ready to put in the entire order.  All or nothing, I guess (which seemed more inflexible than consistent with their goal of moving our meal along quickly).Our food arrived:  appetizers followed by entrees.  About halfway through my lobster, the waitress came back:  ""Good news.  You can probably have the table for another 15 minutes.""  It appeared as though my plate was going to be cleared, were it not for this clemency.  No...really...I asked.  Furthermore, it was almost as if they wanted us to THANK them for being so flexible.  In the end, their anxiety-inducing service was all for not - they had a cancellation and we were welcomed to stay as long as we liked.  I think there is a lesson to be learned here.  While I can appreciate the value of managing expectations, it seems that they would have done just as well to let us enjoy the first 90 minutes of our dinner before making a move.  In the event that we were NOT wrapping up as their other reservation approached, they could have probably coaxed us (willfully) to the bar with a compensatory glass of wine, dessert, etc.I will definitely return to Eataly, but will probably pass on Manzo.",2,0,1,Nick M.,"Seattle, WA",0,11,0
5.0,9/2/2011,"Amazing. Celebration of flavors an good Italian cuisine. Started off with a blood orange Bellini, boyfriend had a beer( don't remember). Bellini was good, prefer the original peach type thought, beer was awesome. First course was the mozzarella with speck(AKA bacon) basil, almond slivers and a brown sauce, boyfriend order the carpaccio with fresh reggiano and lardo with drizzle olive oil. We split, after consuming this meal if there was any indication of the level of this meal, I was not prepared. Next we shared the angoletti, which was split before hand by the server(nice touch). Rectangular size ravioli stuffed with a mixture of sausage, mortadella ricotta and spices, in a brown butter sauce, that I would bathe in. At this point I didn't think there was any way to top This, but alas here comes the main meal. We order 2 new drinks, a lemon vodka thing is what I got, and my boyfriend the moretti beer, always a good choice both were refreshing. My boy friend had the whey feed pork sausage on a bed of greens with pork belly pieces and sliced potatoes. Not your average choice at a ""steakhouse"" of sorts but a item that came highly recommended by the waitress and manager. I got the braised beef rib with soft corn polenta and mushrooms. I didn't eat the mushrooms but my BF did, he said they were superb. His was GREAT, mine was better, and after he saw what he got( he complained about the portion to price ratio to which I quickly rebutted with NYC, high end-ish fad place,there was no argument) We opted not to get dessert, and walk around outside and get gellato. the menu did look great but nothing screamed put to me last night, and I really wanted to walk around.

So Manzo's menu really excited me, and i love the fact that I can have my offal for lunch. I had four appetizers as my meal....sweetbreads with mushrooms, calf brains with heart and tongue, blood sausage with crispy pig ear, and carne cruda with truffle brushetta. The three offal-centric dishes were outstanding. I am a sweetbread fanatic and that was one of the better dishes...the capers were a nice touch. The crispy slivers of pig ear was a a great touch as well to the blood sausage...like pig crotouns...adding a great texture to the dish. My first time having calf brains..or any brains for that matter..and they were very creamy. Heart and tongue were served with this dish also, but it was hard to distinguish them from a taste standpoint. It was too much on one dish...maybe just either heart or tongue would have been better. The carne cruda was too salty. There is no ambience here really, and the service is ok. I give it 4 stars because the menu is exciting and the food was really good except for the overly salty tartare.

We had great wine and food - I give it 4 stars only because I felt that most of the appetizers we got were very good, but not life-changing - usually when you eat at a Batali-related venue, the food needs to be unforgettable, but the salad and appetizers need a little work.  I did, however order the pasta/lobster which WAS absolutely unforgettable.",0,0,0,Emily W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,54,1
3.0,2/21/2011,"I'd give it a 4 star if it wasn't in eataly and in a setting that goes with the $ of dining here. antipasta: beef tartar which was good but wasn't spectacularprimi: bolognese pasta was too salty. secondi: steak skirt was just ok. we ordered it well done and normally i like my steak on the rare side. What stood out the most out of our night was the alcohol. We had 2 glasses each of red wine which was perfectly recommended and the sommelier took us through the history of the wine. Would be great if i remembered what it was but it was def worth the $25/glass. after wine, we had a flight of grappas which were amazing! It was so good we made a bet to see how much a bottle would be. i believe it was around $700 so $30/flight wasn't a bad deal.

4.0,2/20/2011,"Overall we enjoyed this place and the four stars are based on the food.  We had 5:15 reservations but  had arrived a little early.  We asked to be seated a little early.  They opened the place at 5:00 and those without reservation were seated and the bar and promptly waited on.  We were told they were not ready for us and we could sit at the bar. When we sat at the bar and told them that no thank you we didn't want any thing to drink and we were promptly uninvited to sit at the bar.  There were only two tables seated at 5:00.  The hostess (condesending little...) made us wait until 5:15 to be seated.  Obviously, they want to run up your bar tab.  GRRRR!  The service went pretty smoothly after that.  The sommelier reccomended the most expensive wine by the glass.  To his credited, he did not exhibit tude when I selected a less expensive glass of wine.  The wine was quite good. The waitress was quite good, seemed to have authentic enthusiam for her job.  We had the Crispy Artichoke Salad, Sweetbreads, Slow Roasted Beef Rib and the special ""Pork of the Day"" dish.  With the exeception of the Pork dish, which contain an incredible amount of fat,  they were well prepared and very good. We also ordered three cheese,  nice cheese, parsimonius serving. We split a dessert what was essentially a slightly over-cooked brownie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a squeeze of carmel saurce.  It could have used more carmel sauce, the brownie was cold, perhaps it went out for a walk in the frigid temperatures before it was served.  Would we go back, possibly, probably,  It's New York,  there are tons of restaurants that have tudeless hostessses.",0,0,0,Nancy M.,"Sparta, NJ",6,113,1
4.0,2/11/2011,"I recently dined at Manzo with a friend of mine who has been there twice before. This was my first time and I had very high expectations. Let me start by saying that my expectations were definitely met and even surpassed in some areas. This was actually my first time in Eataly and Manzo and I'm a fan of both!We had a ressie but I arrived a little early so I sat at the bar and enjoyed a glass of wine. When my friend arrived, we were promptly seated and my wine was brought to our table for me and added to our dining bill vs. having to settle at the bar. Our server was overly formal, asking if it would be okay to give us the menu, but honestly, in NYC it's nice to be treated like royalty sometimes. She was very informative, knew the specials by memory and guided us through the menu without being long-winded or overstaying her welcome beside our table. We ordered the Mozzarella di Bufala (seriously delicious) and the seasonal salad which was roasted root veggies with a light citrus dressing. For my main course, I had the parpadelle with sausage, a recommendation from my friend who had had it before. It was so yummy! Not too heavy or oily. It was very tasty, but I was pretty full and did not finish my dish, which is retrospect was just a shame. My friend had the agnolotti with a very light almost naked sauce which really highlighted the pork and beef stuffing. We skipped dessert to have a digestivo at one of the counters and explore the rest of Eataly. I actually went to the pasta counter and bought a half pound of agnolotti and a half pound of gnocchi (my husband's favorite pasta). I cooked them last night, a sort of tasting for my husband and I must say, I did a pretty good job. Maybe not Manzo worthy, but I was definitely inspired by them and did a decent job of showcasing the amazing fresh pasta.I would definitely go back to Eataly and Manzo so I can try all the other dishes.",0,0,1,Siobhan E.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,5,0

You'd be crazy not to eat this.The mains are why Manzo gets only 4 not 5 stars. I had the veal wrapped in hay and, lol, tasted like hay.

5.0,1/16/2011,"My favorite Italian restaurant in the city! The head chef came from babbo and the food shows it! They accept walk-ins for the bar area, which is a more fun area to eat at anyway. I usually start off with a glass of the Briccotondo Piemonte Barbera. (They sell bottles of this at Eataly wine shop.) I always get the New York striploin app which is cooked and salted to perfection every time! My two go-to pastas is the Brown butter pasta and Maltagliati pasta (peasant pasta with a red slightly spicy sauce).

5.0,1/14/2011,"I used to live in NYC and now live in LA. On my last trip to New York i was introduced to Eataly- a massive 50,000 square foot Italian eatery.It was a bit hectic, crowded and noisy for me until my friend and i wondered into ""Manzo"". We were hungry and wanted to sit down and unwind. Well, little did we know.By the time we got our entrées, after very vdelicious appetizers and antipasti, we started asking questions about the chef.  We both knew (and believe me when i tell you that my friend who's Italian and I were both looking at each other in wonder) that we have stumbled upon something incredible.  It turns out that we were eating from the hands of  26 year old Michael Toscano, formerly of Babbo Ristorante who works like a true Italian butcher to use every part of the animal, tongue and cheek.  He was a protégée to Mario Batali himself.  You never know what in store for you when you get there as he changes his menu on the monthly basis.Well afterwards, we talked about our food experience for days.  If you want good Italian food in NYC try Manzo, if you want an atmosphere and beautiful interiors go someplace else.",1,0,0,Ilona M.,"Los Angeles, CA",90,54,87
4.0,1/14/2011,"Yes..this place is very yum and quite expensive for a restaurant that's located inside a market hall.  Located inside Eataly, it has a long bar and seating hidden behind the wall near hostess area.  It was a Sunday night when we came here and the wait was about 20min.  We were seated at the bar and since my cousin and I weren't too hungry we ordered a glass of wine, an italian soda, and 2 gnocchi entrees.  When I mentioned we weren't that hungry, I didn't mean I wanted a 'tasting' of gnocchi, but that's what we got.  Probably about 10 pieces to be exact.  Although I have to say, it was pretty good.  What added to the goodness was the black truffle and robiola cheese sprinkled on top gnocchi....like heaven.  Therefore, I had to savor my food and eat it as slowly as I could to make the experience last past the 10 pieces.  FYI, our bill for the 4 items came out to a little over $100.  Did I mention it was pricey?? LOL, basically gave this place 4 stars because the quality of the food was flavorful and fresh with a desirable menu and wine list.  One star off due to the pricing and although I have nothing against that market place feel, the location just didn't fit the ambiance of the restaurant.",1,0,0,ellainne v.,"Los Angeles, CA",53,239,84

3.0,1/8/2011,"I think the quality of the food probably deserves four stars (i stuck to the appetizers). Definitely a good place if you like raw meat (they have dishes like Piedomentese Beef crudo). Raw meat is like sushi. My opinion is one can't and should never go for second best. That said, it is not a cheap but I thought it was OK for what I got. The ambiance and service probably gets 1.5 stars.

4.0,1/4/2011,"Despite the hype, I couldn't help but be turned off by Mario Batali's (also partly owned by Joe Bastianich and Lidia Matticchio) new monstrous food hall - Eataly.  In theory, the idea of having all things Italian in one central location seemed brilliant... however, as much as I tried to embrace 50,000 square feet of Italian-ness, I still felt like it was one giant cluster %$*# that ultimately forfeited the essence of culture, tradition and cuisine.Manzo, Eataly's more formal dining experience that celebrates meat from the US, finally helped me to turn a more positive leaf during a relaxing New Year's Eve dinner.  Here, we escaped the noise and bustle of gawking tourists thanks to attractive partitions that separated us from the rest of the massive space.  Starting off the night with impeccable service and some delicious blood orange infused cocktails, we immediately felt like we were transported to the foothills of Italy.Chef Michael Toscano, formerly of Babbo Ristorante (also an incredible spot), merged 'butcher' with '5-star' to create innovative, modern and sophisticated dishes using just about every part of the animal.  My favorite Antipasti choices were the Crispy Sweetbreads with Funghi Trifolati and the Proscuitto di San Daniele with Apple and Horseradish.  The Warm Calf's Tongue with Barbaresco Vinaigrette as well as the Lamb Heart with Yogurt & Blood Orange Citronette were unexpectedly delicious as well.  For my Secondi I ordered the Sturgeon but had serious food envy for my boyfriend's Venison with Farro, Cavalo Nero, Gaeta Olives and Amarone (uh-ma-zing).I now realize that Eataly may be best judged in parcels rather than as one whole food hall - Manzo's superb ingredients and first-rate culinary skills were all thoughtfully wrapped with friendly and accommodating service, making this the ultimate New Year's Eve meal for four adventurous food enthusiasts.",1,0,0,Maggie A.,"Manhattan, NY",17,82,0

Service was ok-- but this is an expensive meal that should be in a better location. In the end, just go to Babbo and get the real thing. I am surprised at how popular this restaurant is but also surprised at how amateur the front of house staff (esp the Maitre'd station) are when you arrive.

1.0,11/22/2010,"I was SO excited about eating at Manzo. My mother came into town to treat us there for my 40th birthday. First, they brought us bread with no olive oil. We had to ask twice. They brought us our appetizers...and they were really good. But then...an HOUR and a HALF later from when we had sat down...NOTHING. I went to the bathroom twice and got up another time just to walk around Eataly. My husband finally got up and informed the hostess, ""I think our waitress has disappeared!"" Then suddenly there was movement...and our Primi course appeared...with the manager (?) saying, ""Oh, some people like to dine leisurely and take their time."" Making feel like WE were doing Manzo ALL WRONG! We'd had nothing but a salad and dry bread in a HOUR and a HALF...is this true, Italian-leisurely dining? I seriously doubt it. Then it came out that they had a ""private party"" going on. And THAT'S why our food was taking so long. So we're supposed to suffer? Two of the Primi's were very good...mine was AWFUL. I was shocked. It was like limp, over-cooked, sitting-there-forgotten pasta. I've made better pasta with a college dorm hot-plate. Secondi were really good. The food was overall good. But NO apologizes! No, ""Sorry Here's a complimentary something."" Nothing taken of the bill. We left angry. I'm still angry...I've never posted a bad review before.

For the main course I decided to try the ravioli with fontina  which was absolutely delicious, I only wish the portions were a bit larger.  The pasta was fresh and perfectly cooked. I understand the menu is designed with a three course meal in mind, but at those prices I simply could not afford it.

Wow!  Then the shocker, the bill.  My wife was charged $125 for her pasta dish because it was off the tasting menu and included White Truffles.  NO ONE ever explained the price for entrees ordered off the tasting menu.  We all know that truffles are expensive but think in this case considering the average dish is $35 that someone should have given us a little heads up.  Manager was brought to our table and refused to do anything and said it was out problem that we ordered the dish.  We said thats unacceptable and bring another manager.  She snaps the bill out of my wife's hand and leaves.  She returns and says I will take 2 items off the bill but she is doing nothing about the truffle dish.  We still said not acceptable.  She then brings security over to our table and threatens to call the police because we were refusing to pay.  Are you kidding me?  Now this is becoming comical.  In the end it took 5 managers sitting around the hostess stand to finally make a smart decision.  One gentleman who I presume was the manager for the entire venue said he was sorry for the mistake and that the manager, waitstaff, hostess, etc are new and need more training and he took the meal off the bill.  He did the right thing but it took more than 60 minutes to resolve.  In the end crowded, OK at best food and TERRIBLE service.  I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone.  Save your time and money.",4,1,2,Jeff W.,"Northport, NY",36,6,0

The round of ribeye for 2 people is $100 alone! The lifter steak, which I had and was very good, was $30. $30 isn't bad for an entree dish but that's only the meat, unlike many places that serve it with small sides.
