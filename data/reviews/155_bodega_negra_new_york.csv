3.0,4/28/2019,This place got really good reviews so I came for happy hour but the food we got was just okay. The chicken tacos (I think that's what its called) were really good. The other appetizers were mediocre. The sangria was watered down and I couldn't taste the alcohol. The margarita was stronger and better. Maybe the food on the regular menu is better.,0,0,1,Erica J.,"Fort Lee, NJ",398,30,0

4.0,4/14/2019,"I enjoyed the food a lot.   We had guacamole, shrimp ceviche, and lobster and shrimp tacos.   I did find the portions to be on the smaller size while the prices were high.  It's really loud in there-  which I found made it fun, youthful, and energetic,  but the older couple next to us seemed a bit out of place.   I think it would be a good spot for a girls night, birthday, etc.  but not for a date or an occasion where you want to have a deeper conversation.",0,0,0,Sarah M.,"Jackson, WY",102,13,0

5.0,3/28/2019,"I recently had the chance to experience this restaurant located at the Dream Hotel on 16th Street close to the Meatpacking District in New York City.  With an unassuming enterence and a couple of steps down, entering Bodega Negra is a descent into a very cool, well designed space which, rarely for New York, transports you elsewhere.  Interesting that this is a contemporary Mexican restaurant whose roots are from all places, London UK.  There are lots of thoughtful design elements and my favorite is the cloakroom sign (please see image).I had an opportunity to meet the Chef who knows his spices well and set about trying the food and drink.  I particularly enjoyed the Oaxaca Old Fashioned featuring Mezcal and from the food menu my favorites included the guacamole - beautiful consistency (ended up ordering twice), the soft shell crab tacos, yellowtail ceviche and roasted Amish chicken, which was quite succulent.Service was attentive and one of the favorite aspects for us was the music which was loud enough to hear but soft enough to not affect the table conversation.  Bravo Amigos !",1,0,0,Jeffrey B.,"Manhattan, NY",6,104,368
5.0,3/26/2019,"Such a big fan of Bodega Negra! I came here with four girls on a Saturday night for dinner and it was perfect. This place has a really good vibe and is perfect for dinner/drinks before a night out. The service here is also great - our server Lawrence was fun, nice and attentive. We each had one app, tacos and one drink and we got out of here for less than $50 per person. I had the Skirt Steak tacos, the Grilled Corn Salad and tried the Yuca Fries and the Sweet Plantains (plain without the cheese or crema) and everything was so good! I also asked for a custom tequila drink which was awesome. I would definitely recommend Bodegra Negra for a good group dinner that won't break the bank.",3,0,2,Deana B.,"Union Square, Manhattan, NY",370,114,330

5.0,3/16/2019,Simply said you must try Bodega Negra.  They are serving up epic deliciousness. The entire setting and ambience of the restaurant takes you aback to a Spanish town where the locals know to go for great food.  I caught up with two other girlfriends for a night out and we started at Bodega Negra.  Patrick and Annemarie were gracious at the hostess stand in accommodating our group. As they prepared our table we sat at the bar for cocktails. I had a mezcal margarita which was tasty and well balanced.  Clearly the food was the star of our evening. Ashley was our waitress- not only was she well versed in the menu - but she made awesome suggestions for our dining experience.  The entire evening she was all smiles and each table she encounter relayed the same exceptional experience in kind. Each item our table enjoyed was packed with freshness.  Everything was a hit especially the shrimp tacos & guacamole. They were both true winners & stand out hits.  Our table ended up ordering two orders of the guacamole. Though we didn't try the pizza - it appeared to be a very popular menu item on my other patrons tables.  I highly recommend Bodega Negra for your next night on the town dining experience.

The food is fairly priced and everything was delicious. We ordered the quesadillas, shrimp tacos, plantains, and guacamole. More than enough food for two people.

We were supposed to be going elsewhere but it turned out they needed a cover so we hopped into this place to avoid the cold and ended up spending the rest of the night here.Super chill lounge environment with the bartender playing great tunes. Vibes were so good in there that we made friends with the group at the bar and bartender, plugged in our music to share some of our music with them, and just had a fantastic time.

5.0,1/17/2019,"We had dinner reservations but wanted to sit at the bar for drinks before dinner. We ended up staying at the bar and ordering food there because the bartender, Olivia, was really fantastic! She gave us some amazing food recommendations and her drinks were absolutely en pointe. I planned on having one, maybe two cocktails. I ended up trying four. I was absolutely impressed with how much she knows about mixology. The El Diablo was a favorite cocktail with just the right amount of ginger simple to give it a really balanced sweet/spicy flavor. Her margaritas were absolutely sublime. I've had some stellar margaritas at Black Ant, Cosme, Añejo... Olivia's drink blew those amazing places out of the water! A true hidden gem!We tried the Queso Fundido and the Quesadilla Rustica. She suggested adding chicken (for a small fee, of course) but we went with how it's presented on the menu. We were NOT disappointed!! And it made sense to add chicken because that would have elevated the apps a bit. Next time!Next we tried the pork belly tacos. Absolutely fantastic! The pork rind on top of the pork belly tacos is a great touch. One suggestion: While I get it that the little pork rind is a visual aesthetic to finish the dish, it did add a nice crunch to a wet taco. Perhaps rather than one whole pork rind, sprinkle roughly crushed pork rind over the entire taco and maybe sprinkle a bit of minced cilantro for some color. The crumbled pork rind would add that little bit of crunch to the whole taco rather than one bite. Otherwise, just great! (Also don't hide the lime wedges under the taco log thing)We look forward to our next visit, and very much hope to enjoy more of Olivia's cocktails. Even if the food was bad, which it absolutely was not, we would come back just for her drinks and her fantastic personality!  A++++",0,0,0,Alex M.,"Carlstadt, NJ",184,47,35

You need a reservation and you need to be on time . The Tacos was the best thing on the menu, the corn on the cob was pretty tasty. Now the reason why iI only have 3 stars is 1 the drinks weren't consistent 2. The rib eye i had was over cooked and they didn't give me a steak knife.

4.0,1/3/2019,"Bodega Negra has a great vibe and atmosphere perfect for a romantic date or a night with friends! Just make sure you're party all arrives on time because the hostess won't sit you until your party has all arrived. The wine barrels and dim lighting create a very intimate setting. Located in the downtown Dream Hotel it's also a close walk to different lounges, bars or even the always happening PhD club on the rooftop. The food is typical NYC pricey with good flavor. The guacamole was creamy, the soft shell crab tacos were tasty and the drinks were delicious. The pork belly app was a nice portion size but a bit dry without the sauce. I loved the white chocolate lava cake dessert even if I got it just for the Instagram worthy picture.

4.0,12/16/2018,"Really nice place... Ambiance is a impecable- everything from decor, lighting, and music was nice. Make resevation if you'd like to dine... but the bar location has some additional small tables avail. While the bar set up with the tables was cute, it got packed very quickly, especially during happy hour so it didn't allocate much room. At the same time, staff was still very attentive and managed to work around crowd ordering drinks quite well. Really cool tho, aside from dining area and bar, heading towards the bathrooms, Bodega Negra has larger party room available. Not sure about the booking of these spaces, but the rooms itself had ample space, nice decor, ambiance & set up.Food & Drinks: Fancy mexican cusine, so $$$ sounds about right. There wasn't many happy hour drinks available, but all selections were good. I enjoyed ""El Diablo"" cocktail most; (pictured). Food was flavorful and plating was beautiful. I clearly loved the yuca fries; let me describe... crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, perfect cut, & seasoned (fried perfectly). We really wanted to taste a white chocolate molten dessert that, for sure, wowed in design and effects... The Outcome: A warm caramel sauce, that melts the white chocolate round exterior, but unfortunately didn't deliver with the warm goodness found in the inside of lava cakes- it was cold. Overall, while over priced, thoroughly enjoyed my time there, of course with great company. :) Till next time!",1,0,0,Pamela H.,"New York, NY",9,87,84

2.0,12/7/2018,"First off, the vibe in Bodega Negra is impeccable. It's connected to the Dream Hotel and the music selection is awesome. Vibe was set. Girls' night was in full effect. The the cocktails came - we all ordered the signature Bodega Margarita (I asked for minimum alcohol - I know, boooring, but whatever, ha). I thought my drink was a bit strong, but I'm not really a drinker, so I wouldn't be the best judge of that. (My girls seemed to have enjoyed their cocktails.) Then came the food, starting with the guacamole and chips with jicama dipped in Tajin (mix of salt, chile peppers and dehydrated lime). We all thought the guacamole needed a more salt. I particularly enjoyed the jicama garnish, I think even more than the guacamole. The crisp bite with the Tajin was refreshing with the margarita.  On to the rest of the food, we had tons of stuff -- tacos, the tuna tostada, watermelon, rice, salad... The stage was set for a proper feast; the party commenced. That is, until I started having an allergic reaction. Although none of the food we ordered had nuts as an ingredient, there were clearly traces of nuts in something we ordered (I suspect the tostada or watermelon). This was disappointing given that I informed the sever of my allergy. Luckily, I was able to prevent myself from having a serious reaction, but I lost my entire appetite. The manager did apologize, offered to get me medication and took other measures concerning the food we ordered.I likely would have given this place 3-4 stars, but it's impossible to -- given what happened.

3.0,12/3/2018,"The experience was good at Bodega Negra. My friends and I went for restaurant week and the menu had a good selection of options. I really enjoyed the desert - churros with a mocha dipping sauce - really good! The major thing with the menu is how expensive the drinks are. We were hesitant to order because they were around $17 each...we each got one and called it a day. They were sub-par at best, unfortunately. Definitely not worth the money. I would have expected them to be much better.As for service, this is really where I have to deduct on my rating. Unfortunately, we were seated way after we had arrived (when our reservation was scheduled for) and we had three different servers without any explanation. I am usually really open about that kind of stuff, especially on restaurant week. However, we were left alone for almost 30 minutes without any drinks or anyone coming to take our order.

It's the city so obviously the place is pricey, but if you are out on a date or night out with your girls, this is a great spot to come too. Highly recommend a reservation. Ours was for 8:00 we didn't get seated until 8:30/8:45. The only downfall was that they made it really obvious they were trying to kick us out , even when we were ordering drinks after cake.

I would recommend the quesadilla rustica and the El Diablo cocktail. We decided to come again for dinner and that's when my opinion of this place went downhill. As expected the prices here are pretty high, which wouldn't be an issue if the food was amazing but sadly the food was far from being even good. Based on our server's recommendation we ordered the mac and cheese with fried pork rinds. This dish alone made me give this place 2 stars. The mac and cheese was clearly made from a box with awful bright velveeta cheese. The pork rinds were just offensive and were straight from a bag of cheap UTZ. The lobster tacos were also disappointing,  too mushy with very small pieces of overly smothered lobster. The watermelon salad was good, but how wrong can you go with slicing up watermelon and sprinkling sesame seeds on top. This was a waste of my hunger and money.

We arrived on time for our rsvp & were seated right away to start we went with a bottle of white wine gave the Sauvignon blanc a try very nice wine nice fruity scent light tasting.

Main dishes I had the Tacos comes with 4 small tacos Steak was delicious nice tasting meat, Pork so good with a small piece of pork grind not bad the Chicken was delicious as well shredded chicken very tasty & a Veggie taco this was ok for me way too much mushroom my friend liked it. My friend had the Steak for dinner very good nice tasting meat, good sauce.

Only 3 of us wanted the dessert in the restaurant week menu and they refused to bring the other two desserts later because it ""hindered"" with their working! By this time, I did not even have the strength to argue about anything. As for the food, it was alright. We ordered all the appetizers and they were really small. For entree we ordered chicken and stuffed rellenos peppers. The chicken tasted good but it would have been nice to have some carbs with it. We tried all the desserts too and liked the flan best out of it. Having said all that, I have had much better mexican food at other places that this place failed to wow in any way.

I recommend their tacos (hey...notice they are only 2 pieces) but they are really amazing! I had the ones with chicken and the ones with fish and both were delicious so I am sure any of their other options would be good as well. Their Fajitas are great, I mixed it with an extra of green rice and plantains. Everything was delicious. Their cocktails are really good, too. I had Margaritas and Sangria, they also have a good selection of beer and wine. The place is beautiful, trendy, all Latin-Mexican ambient and decoration. However, the music was not as good and that's why I'm not giving them 5 stars... just because they played rap all night and it was Cinco de Mayo and since it's a Mexican restaurant I was expecting to listen to more Latin music that day or at least more variety on playlists but I am talking about when I said ""rap ALL NIGHT"" I'm not exaggerating it was really at least from 10 pm -1 am.

If you expect a good meal and passable service when you order the expensive Mexican dishes, definitely go elsewhere. It was hard to get anyone's attention. The servers are more like runners for the ineffectual kitchen that turns out dishes without regard to what's on the table or the timing of the meal. Example at our table: We were halfway through the appetizers when the entrees came. When I said the timing is not good, one guy bringing the food just blankly and coldly stared at me. Not appreciated. No one asked how anything is because no one cares. And the food was cold and mediocre. $400 later for four people, we left not pleased. This is why trendy places like this don't survive in NYC. When the Saturday crowds stop coming, you need people who actually like the food and service the rest of the week.

2.0,4/18/2018,"We'll start this review with the pro's! Absolutely amazing service, the waiters who served our table were very attentive, on top of all of our food and drink needs, and one even came over with a new fork before we even realized we had dropped one on the floor. Cons though, because this started as a 5 Star review. Then dropped to 4 because the menu and the staff failed to mention there were pistachios in the lamb tacos, even when a member of our party had clarified about the nuts in a different dish (peanuts in the Brussels sprouts). The rating then really takes a dive because when our friend, who is LITERALLY (the real definition not the ironic millennial definition) having an allergic reaction at the time, goes to ask a staff member if they have Benadryl to counteract her throat closure, the woman basically told her she was shit out of luck and that she really should have specified, and blamed the whole situation on her.  So we had to jog over to Duane reade so our friend could chug a bottle of Benadryl. We could have accepted this, but then this woman has the audacity to come back when our friend returns from her drug run, to basically rub salt in the wound. ""Are you okay? But yea you really should have specified. You really need to say things like that."" We had clarified with the waiter about a nut problem with another dish, that wasn't just for fun. I found it incredibly insulting this woman felt the need to come over and diminish the issue by blaming the victim.

""Amish"" chicken was reasonably well-seasoned and tender, but came with nothing approximating the ""grilled vegetables"" mentioned on the menu, unless a bunch of cubed sweet potatoes count. Service: inattentive. How about this: there for a small birthday dinner with a few friends, and they bring a small plate for the birthday person ... but no offer of a dessert menu for the rest of us. No questions about whether we want a second round of drinks. Really, ""inattentive"" is kind. Atmosphere: look, I know this is the NYC cliché, but I say this as a New Yorker: too damn loud. You wanna be a club? Fine, ditch the tables and the pretense of serving dinner and be a club.

My bf got the Chile braised short ribs (not a short rib to be found) I guess the meat was taken off the rib bone, but then that was placed on three chips and it was bland as well. I had the chipotle honey glazed ribs and that came with the bones, there was like 6 pieces and it was alot, a lot of meat and everything but it was tasteless. The honey cancelled out the chipotle and I couldn't taste that sauciness I was looking for, I didn't even finish it. Honestly it tasted like nothing was marinated.

2.0,2/25/2018,Food: The food was hit or miss...  My waiter recommended the soft shell crab tacos they look really impressive but fell flat with flavor.  I also had the mixta salad again impressive looking but just so so with the flavor.  A friend had tostadas and enchiladas both were a little more flavorful.  The guacamole was pretty good.Drinks:  The drinks are small but they pack a punch I had three and I was pretty satisfied.  The garnish on my drinks was also very good.  They have a great variety of margaritas to choose from.Service:  Our waiter was informative and the overall service was fast and efficient.Atmosphere:  Cool setting.  This was a Saturday night so it was pretty loud and that's to be expected.  The space is tight and there was little room to move we had to get up several times to let people pass by.THE BILL:  Sadly what made this night fall flat was how we were charged.  2 of us used cards and were charged FIVE times.  Unfortunately for one person in our party her card was declined and of course this happened because the bank suspected something suspicious.  None of us noticed until we were long gone from the restaurant and then the hassle starts.  You call the hostess transfers you to accounting on a Sunday...  What accounting department works Sunday?!  Then the phone rings and rings and you get transferred to the front desk of the dream hotel.  They transfer you back to the restaurant to speak to a manger who doesn't answer and then the front desk takes a message to have the manager call you.  So pretty much inconvenience is the experience.  Now the whole event is less than memorable especially considering the embarrassment of someone's card being declined.  Bring cash if you plan to dine or drink here.  Oh and Bodega....  Get it together!,1,0,0,Joshua H.,"New York, NY",72,25,4
4.0,2/18/2018,"This is a great, trendy place to go on special occasions. The staff was friendly. The ambiance was dark and romantic. The music was awesome. I'm a big 90s hip hop fan so I was pleasantly surprised. We arrived as a party of 6- 3 couples- for a birthday dinner. We had set up a reservation days before. We arrived on time and were promptly taken to our seats. The food and drinks were delicious. The dishes were not very large quantities, although people do seem to share. When I was reading through the reviews, I saw a vast amount of pictures, but it was mostly pics/videos of Don Huevo. I ordered the shrimp ceviche for appetizer and shared with my husband. For the main course, I ordered the Crispy Chicharron Shrimp. For dessert, I ordered the flan, which I shared with my husband. The flan was sooooo good! For me, a good flan is hard to find but this flan was creamy and perfect. Everything was perfect. I only took one star away because it's a little expensive but it is definitely worth it and to be expected given the area it's located.

3.0,2/1/2018,"I came to Bodega for my 23rd birthday with two of my girlfriends after hearing about the famous Don Huevo. Located in the Dream Downtown hotel, it's a perfect spot to dine before heading upstairs to party at PHD, Dream Downtown's rooftop lounge (see PHD review!!). The spot definitely has a clubby vibe with stylish, dark haunt and Tudor-era decor. I loved the seats: half-moon wooden booths sort of carved out of the wall. I feel like this always gives off a more intimate feel. They serve upscale Mexican cuisine and the prices definitely reflect that. Bodega Guacamole (your standard chips and dip appetizer) cost $16... Bodega Margarita? Also $16. And although the food is good, entrée portions are small. Not the place you want to come if you're feeling particularly hungry. But as I said, we came for the Don Huevo and Don Huevo did not disappoint. This popular dessert is essentially composed of a dark chocolate molten cake covered with horchata ice cream encased in a white chocolate egg that comes apart when Negra modelo caramel sauce is poured on top. This confection also costs $16 (magic number??) but is well worth it. This is one of those hit it and quit it spots. Go, experience, leave. Do it for the Don.",0,0,0,Gabrielle S.,"Queens, NY",6,25,30
1.0,1/31/2018,"First time here for my cousin's birthday who came from out of town. The place is nice and trendy but sadly that didnt make up for the bad service. For the $$$ I would expect better service and better food. Service one star, food was ok I'd give it a 3, nothing crazy but I might be bias because the service wasn't good so it was hard to enjoy the food. Why the service was so bad:We reserved a table for 8 people for 9:30, a week in advance. When we arrived they said they were cleaning the table. 30 minutes later we checked again, they then said the table was currently finishing up dessert. I then said we made a 9:30 reservation, we have plans after dinner can we get an estimated wait time. They only apologized and didn't seem too concerned with us waiting. We waited, given that it was getting too late and hard to find any other spot to accommodate 8 ppl since it was now almost 1030. After the third time we spoke to them they give us two pitchers of margaritas at the bar. We were not sat until 11pm! Although we got three free appetizers to share and the birthday girl got free dessert, service was slow and we had to wait a while to even get cashed out. We arnt unreasonable, we'd understand if they explained they had made a mistake with the reservation, or were just too busy to push tables out. But each time WE had to go up to THEM to ask them about our table and the host didn't reassure us of anything. It took an hour of waiting for them to even ask us if we needed anything to make us more comfortable while we wait. DONT lie and say it's almost ready or that your cleaning up the table just to keep your customers waiting. We could have found somewhere  else to eat in the time we waited. 1.5 hours is way too long to wait for a table that was reserved ahead of time, unacceptable. Their attitude was unapologetic, rude, even annoyed. To make it worst we got out too late to keep the plans we had for after dinner. Huge disappointment. I can say I'd not dine there again, and I don't recommend it.

We were asked to sit in the cafe area which is upstairs , I explained to the hostess that that wasn't quite the atmosphere we were looking for , since there is no music up there , and especially not for a birthday. I guess she didn't like us voicing our opinion because she got extremely rude and told us ""well you either sit upstairs or wait over an hr"" she then proceeded to tell the server next to her that she didn't care because we were late for our reservation, all while we were standing right there.

The taco appetizers were fresh and perfect to share between two people especially because they come with both chicken and vegetarian friendly. The vegetables enchiladas were average- too saucy and cheesy so would not recommend that as an entrée. The Don Huevo dessert is the star of the show and probably one of the most instagrammed food item. Fortunately, the taste lived up to my expectation. It is on the sweet side and is really large so you can share this dessert with the whole table.

Mexican food should not be pricey unless they are using top quality fish and meats and these were not of that quality so definitely more expensive than necessary.

Each taco plate comes with two small tacos, that are filled with your choice of protein! They don't skimp out on the meat. The pork was tender and juicy, with freshness from the salsa. They also add chicharron on top, which adds a nice crunch. Again, I was really happy with this choice, but $14 for two tacos was too steep for me.

We weren't even finished with our drinks and the manager had the audacity to came up to us and ask us to move to another table while we finished our drinks, just so they could seat someone else there. The food was nothing to brag about. They rarely checked up on us after we got our food. You expect to go out with your friends on a Saturday night and relax and have dinner and drinks but we felt so rushed and we were out of there by 8:15 - This was after we got appetizers and entrées and drinks. It's not like we were not paying them and just came for drinks. It was a very rude experience overall and I have never been more turned off by a restaurant like this before. We were staying at dream downtown hotel as well so just like that our night was off to a very bad start.I rarely write reviews, this is actually my first one.

4.0,10/1/2017,"Came here on a Friday night at 9:30pm for a birthday dinner and it was packed! From the minute we walked in, the atmosphere was awesome from the dj playing a great mix of top hip hop and r&b tracks to the great decor (that cool penny chandelier with ~10k coins). For food, we started off with guacamole, grilled corn (elote), jalapeno appetizer, and quesadilla rustica. All were good, but nothing to rave about except the quesadilla which was amazing although it was more like a tostada pizza. The jalapeño appetizer was very spicy so be warned! Also, be sure to order the side of sauces! For dinner, we got the vegetarian tacos (with cauliflower) and veg enchiladas with a side of brussel sprouts, both of which were delicious! Portions are decent and shareable. Between 6 people, we finished 2 pitchers of margaritas - regular and watermelon/jalapeño (wouldn't recommend this one - watered down and jalapeño is so overpowering that you can't taste the watermelon). The most important reason I will be returning is for the dessert, DON HUEVO. It is officially my favorite dessert of all time. It is a large white chocolate shell that is melted with hot caramel revealing a chocolate lava cake inside topped with horchata ice cream. Can you say YUM?! With appetizers, entrees, 1 dessert, and 2 pitchers of margaritas it was about $75 per person including tax.

The food was great but I would say for 2 tacos at $17 is a bit over priced but it had a lot of flavor and was so delicious so we didn't complain.

The first time I visited this restaurant last year, my boyfriend and I had a reservation and were asked to wait at the bar for our table to be ready. We waited about 15 to 20 minutes and when we asked for an update, we were assured the table would be ready soon. The manager came over and extended his apologies and comped our drinks and guac! It was a great save for the night and we were able to enjoy the rest of our dinner without a hitch, we even got a free dessert. We chalked it up to a busy night and had an overall pleasant experience.Now on to the second night.......I found myself in the area this Friday night and stopped in for drinks and decided to stay for dinner. I made a reservation on Opentable for 10:00pm and again waited 30 minutes to be seated, we kept being told that the party at our table was checking out and would be ready shortly. No apologies were issued, no items were comped for the inconvenience, there seemed to be no presence of a manager. Once seated, the server came over and we thought the service would redeem the hiccup with the seating. However, he only checked on us twice throughout the whole time we were there, which includes the times we placed an order for food and drinks. To be fair, the food is very tasty, albeit overpriced. It seems to be a pattern to not be seated on time even though there is a reservation in-place. That is unacceptable to me, therefore I choose to take my business elsewhere.

(NOTE- this is for the cafe area)Okay so let's paint the picture: my fiancee and I get there and there is an open table, terrific! Bad news, they are missing a chair- that's fine, we can wait.... But for 5 minutes just to find a chair? That was a little long and should have been our first red flag. Whatever. We sit, and it takes so long for the waitress to get to us that I started wondering if we go up to the bar to order. Spoiler alert: you don't, they just don't know how to staff a restaurant properly. Okay, so we have our food ordered and ready to eat- all is good! Food comes and is decent at best. She had the burrito bowl and I had a quesadilla- both of which were presented very well but lacked in any discernable taste. What do I expect from a bodega under PHD? I guess that's a question I should've asked myself before we got there. But wait! What if you have to go to the bathroom during your stay? Well, you better also be training for a marathon because it's several miles away. You have to go through the main restaurant/bar, wade through too many finance bros and drunk people, almost go through the kitchen, act like you're about to crash a Bat Mitzvah party and THEN finally you get there. Warning though - make sure you're comfortable with your body because the stalls literally are just a bunch of mirrors. The time has come to leave, and we ask for togo boxes. Being the classy establishment they are, they tell me that they will box it up for us! How thoughtful. Now, I present a brief timeline of the process:9:20- waitress says she will box it up 9:30- they actually take our food 9:45- she brings the final check and apologizes for something or another- missing lids? I don't know. Lots was missing last night. 9:49- they find the lids! Hooray! So then I see our waitress just straight up turning the old container upside down into the new one so all the food is completely jumbled and messed up. (Be more careful or don't do it where I can see!)9:50- we spent more time waiting for our food to be put in boxes than we did eating it, but we got it.At that point, watching that, I had had enough. That was too many things to count that were wild and bad. The final kicker? The pen she gave me didn't work so I had to etch my tip like I was chiseling my name in a rock.

3.0,4/30/2017,"This place has been on my list forever and I really wanted to love it !! Sad I didn't. Pros - drinks were good. The desert is a must get, the Don Huevo. Delicious and so entertaining. The standout of our night was the service - our server Lawrence made the meal. Friends said tuna ceviche was also good. Atmosphere was trendy, loud. Meh - The quesadilla is basically a pizza. Tasted bland and too cheesy (never thought I'd say that). The corn was pretty good, the guac was pretty good, and tacos were fine. It was all passable but not great. You can get pretty great Mexican food in the city for cheap. For upscale Mexican, I except the food to be amazing. The dessert was the only thing to get excited about.

I made a reservation one month in advance. When my date arrived, I was lured by the decorations and ambience of the restaurant it was very presentable. Now I did have a few concerns....I arrived exactly one time for my reservation which was at 10pm but I did not get seated until 10:43pm. During that time I stood by the bar as the hostess ordered. Now their bartenders aren't very polite, second their alcohol menu does not provide much variety, in others words you either choose wine or vodka,whiskey and last but nevertheless....tequila. And let me not Even mention their pricing for their alcohol beverages!! Is insanely overpriced!! Now the food was not what I was expecting. I ordered some steak and it was not flavorful and the presentation of the dish was not to par with the pricing. All I can honestly say is that the dessert was the only good thing out of what could've been an amazing birthday celebration.....I honestly think that their pricing is way too overpriced and the menu should offer way more varieties.",0,0,0,Kimberly A.,"New York, NY",26,7,0

Started off with the fresh guacamole and the bodega classic margarita both may have been the best i have ever had, you could tell they used all fresh ingredients in both. For the entree we ordered the peeking duck, pork belly and skirt steak tacos. Of the three i most enjoyed the skirt steak, the duck was good i just found it a little sweet and the pork belly was easily the most disappointing, just seemed to lack seasoning. Lastly, we finished with the Don Huevo: a molten lava cake with a scoop of ice cream on top, surrounded by a huge chocolate shell, that is broken with warm caramel... that truly was the star of the show. Overall the tacos were a little disappointing but not enough to kill the experience.

Each order comes in a set of three. As an app I had the guac and chips and it got real y'all! Maybe because I was tipsy, it tasted like heaven in my mouth, so gooood.

I noticed the DJ was playing great 90's hip hop which I was really enjoying and dancing in my seat lol. I ordered a non frozen margarita and we got tequila shots to start the night right lol. Ordered guacamole with plantain chips. Who dosent love guacamole?! lol. It was perfect!. We shared the skirt steak fajitas and red snapper cooked in banana leaf. Both dishes were a hit!. I honestly forgot what we got for dessert,I think more shots lol. They were clearing the tables for the live performances and the manager came over and offered us a free round of drinks since they needed to clear our table. I thought that was a classy move.

I could see it as a perfect place for versatile events from  a large birthday dinner to a nice date spot.The food itself was good but I'm not sure it was worth the prices, but I may have just ordered the wrong items. The quesadilla rustica was by far my favorite, it was a pizza that was cooked perfectly and had great tasting toppings. We also ordered the corn which I thought was really delicious. My friend and I split vegetarian tacos and chicken tostadas. I thought the tostadas were lackluster with tiny portions. The tacos were also ok and not seasoned that well. My friends who ordered seafood/other dishes such as the chile relleno seemed to enjoy their meals more. For dessert we got the don huevo and it was so delicious, I would highly recommend it.Other items on the menu seemed more exciting so I hope to make a second visit and hopefully order some dishes that are more worth the price point.

4.0,3/12/2017,"I am updating my review based off the wonderful experience I had last night. The past couple times I've gone to Bodega my party and I have had horrible experiences especially in the service area. A rep from Tao group reached out to me and asked if I could try again for a do over. Although I was hesitant I was glad I did! Tonight's dining was great from service, food to ambiance. The host sat us immediately  with our reservation without any issue. The server greeted us offered recommendations  and gave us the specials. Our food was served in perfect timing. No long waits and everything was great! In my opinion Bodega has some of the best Mexican food in the city and probably the best fish tacos in all of New York! I recommend  starting with the guacamole and the quesadilla and a couple of tostadas to share for the table. Our fav is the black bean hummus tostada. The quesadilla is a perfect sharing dish and has the best balance of cheese and spice! Everyone needs to get a taco! They serve in pairs and are perfectly sized for a meal. I think the fish tacos are by far the best. The steak and duck tacos are also favorites. The tacos are packed with flavor and they don't hold back with the meat. Amazing! The entrees are also great. We tried the enchiladas which were really yummy. As for desert a must is the churros!! I don't know what batter they use, but holy hell its heaven.. and of course you must get the chocolate ball. It's great for pictures and Snapchat videos watching chocolate melt over chocolate and unveil a soufflé with ice cream! Delicious!

4.0,3/7/2017,"Quick Summary:Food: is great but expensive (taco with mac & cheese + plato + don huevo + = 90$).Attire: you can go casual; it is button down and jeans/dress and flats in my opinion. Highlight: Don Huevo (dessert) is a must buy for theatrics alone plus it was delicious. Service: was OK. Our waiter was switched in the beginning but they did refill my cup often which I look for in any restaurant. Noise: Music was sometimes loud sometimes quiet, I found the fluctuation weird. Ambience: If you want romance, I suggest the top level. The abundance of candles make it romantic plus it is darker up there. If you want more of a fun/group vibe I would go with the lower level, brighter more open space. Bodega Negra is a hot-spot right in the middle of my favorite area in NYC near Buddakhan, TAO, Chelsea Market and Morimoto. I reserved my table the night before and they called me the day of. I had asked in my reservation notes, if they could bring out their famous Don Huevo dessert as a birthday surprise right after dinner. A woman called me and asked me if I was still coming tonight and then proceeded to ask if I wanted something written on the plate. Not knowing that this was a possibility I was excited and happy she called. (She also mentioned that they have a 15-minute reservation hold time, in case you were wondering).The food was great. I had the Pork Belly Carnitas tacos with the chorizo mac and cheese (which I can't find on the menu online and took forever to come out) and my boyfriend got the Crispy Chicharron Shrimp. He loved his plate, I loved mine and we both loved the mac and cheese but those two dishes plus the Don Huevo was 94 dollars with tip. Yeah, can't go back there again. We also only had water.

I also got the Skirt Steak with grilled onions, salsa roja, guac and some queso fresco, this was tangy and tasty. Both were to die for, I mean every bite was just mouth watery and finger licking good. Messy but it was a good messy. We also tried the grilled corn as an appetizer and I love how they cut it into 4 pieces for sharing purposes.

Very romantic, intimate candle lit dinner with cozy round booth seating. Well kept and seemingly clean. - Takes reservations! Adhered to our times and seated us immediately! ⁃The service was phenomenal! Everyone was very friendly, offered personal suggestions, checked up on us the perfect amount of times and didn't rush us through at all! ⁃Drinks were very good! The Margarita Del Sol (peach!) was delicious - strong and tasty! One large ice cube rather than little ones so it didn't get watered down either.The so-so:⁃Hm, on paper, the corn on the cob sounded scrumptious - chipotle aioli, queso cotija, cilantro. These are basically all my favorite things combined; unfortunately, this app just didn't do it for me. It wasn't bad, but I've had much better. ⁃The enchiladas - great options for vegetarians and meat-eaters! My boyfriend who loves meat actually really enjoyed these! They were saucy and yummy! This was certainly my favorite part of the meal, but unfortunately only good enough to make the ""so-so"" part of my lists. The not-so-good: ⁃ Quesadilla rustica. Yes, I said it. I know I know, everyone's raving about this one so I must be crazy for not loving it right? The quesadilla, which resembled more of a Mexican pizza, was WAY too greasy and cheesy for my liking. It looked as if someone poured oil on top of the pizza, not sparingly either. Each slice that we took off the tray left a puddle of oil residue, and the layer of cheese was thicker than the tortilla underneath. This might've tasted better, but the food was only semi-warm when we received it so the cheese was starting to harden and was chewy - yikes.",13,8,11,Roma P.,"South Brunswick Township, NJ",312,224,914

4.0,1/31/2017,"So I've been wanting to come here for a while...I know that it is extremely busy on fri and saturdays. I came on a Sunday evening- my friend made reservations as a belated birthday....Place is located in Dream hotel- around the corner and next to Tao downtown, la sirena and close to buddakan. Parking is street in which you have to be lucky at the moment - otherwise there is a parking garage across the street. We came at 7ish and it wasn't that packed . By 8pm - it was packed . Place is on the small side. Bar is comfortable - mixologists. Drink menu - had extensive tequila menu from what I saw- there was a page of $ 16-20 cocktails that were strong but just eh to me. I was in the mood to have a frozen margarita or something - but none that I saw. Staff is very friendly. Lawrence wasnt our waiter but very friendly to us and made our visit even better .What I liked was the music- it was a mix of 90's hip hop . Not ghetto at all . Place is filled with mix crowd Menu is expensive- taco menu were like 20 bucks for two. I didn't try them .Luckily we came for restaurant week in which there was a 3 course pre- fix menu for $42pp. I ordered the shrimp cerviche that was delicious- had a spicy kick to it. Wish it came with hot tostones vs the tortilla chips.  The only enchilada choice is vegetarian - I ended up going with the Carne asada which was very tasty- come with onions , mushrooms and a red mole sauce. Had hot yuca fries to share  since all entree do not come with sides.  I had the churro for dessert which was eh. Had a spicy chocolate dip which wasn't my fave.Thank god my friend ordered the DON HUEVO for my birthday which was my favorite thing of the night. She said she had to pre-order it. Basically it's a round white chocolate shell with a chocolate mustache on side - the waiter then pours hot liquid caramel over it and the white chocolate shell breaks on the plate- leaving a molten chocolate cake in the middle.  Sweet but oh so delicious. We shared it and left NOTHING. It's one  of those things that when you take a bite, you go "" mmmmm, that's bangin"" lol Bill for both of us - pre-fix x 2, two-three drinks and the don huevo came to $150 plus tax The only reason that I gave it 4 stars was that it took a long time for our table to get our food - not other tables lol. If I was super impatient that day I would be pissedIf you do come- I suggest you make reservations , pre-order the don huevo Enjoy yelp buddies",4,1,1,Maria V.,"Jersey City, NJ",1789,715,5270

They even called to confirm and said we have a 15 min grace period or else they'll give the table away. No problem, we arrived at 8:30, let them know and went to the bar to get a drink. 9 pm rolls around and they tell us it's going to be a few more minutes because they're waiting for a table to finish up and pay (meanwhile there are like 10 open tables). 45 minutes go by.. and our table STILL isn't ready. The manager offered us some free drinks at the bar which was nice but we were STARVING!! We did not get seated until 10:30.  Once we were seated, our waitress was fighting with another waiter next to us. Very unprofessional. Overall, food is decent at best and NOT worth the prices.

4.0,1/23/2017,"Restaurant is nicely tucked away on the lobby floor of Dream Hotel.  You can enter thru the front entrance of the dream hotel but don't mistake the outside snack/juice bar for the actual restaurant. Bodega Negra can be accessed thru the juice bar or from the inner bar area inside the lobby floor. If you are entering from the front, you'll know you are there when you see a small staircase and a closed double door. Made reservation for a birthday party on a Friday night. Arrived few minutes earlier to be told that we can only be seated when everyone was present. Shortly we were sat in a corner area nice & snug. Coat check and a small bar which resembles somewhat of a 'speak easy' is also separately located inside this restaurant. Ambiance is very trendy and intimate and lighting is dimly lit with music pumping.Drinks:Ordered few bottles of red wines, pitchers of green sangria and guac & chips as starters. The wine menu had nice selection of reds & whites. Sangria was ok. Each pitcher was about $70 and margarita were also available. Menu stated that you can choose which bottle of tequila from various list pricing and pitcher is complimentary. We went with the sangria as we ordered few bottles of wine. Green sangria was ok, nothing to rant about.  Not sure if I'd order the pitcher again but happy we tried.  Most of the water cups were pretty dirty with lip marks but all the wine glasses were fine. It's quite dark in there so you may have to look closely with the candle light on the table. Food : We ordered Yellowtail ceviche, several different tacos (duck, skirt steak, pork belly, grilled fish,etc),Chile braised short rib, Quesadilla, Crispy pork belly, 24oz Ribeye steak, Lamb shank, Yuca fries, Fried Plantains, Don Huevo, etc.  Appetizer guac was tangy and chips were crispy making this appetizer a hit. Ceviche was not served in conventional style but reminded more of Italian Crudo dish. Each piece was delicately sliced thin and tasted fresh. Tacos were a nice addition as each order is served in 2 pieces. They are not too large but good size to munch with other items. Skirt steak and duck tacos was pretty good. Chile braised short ribs was ok. Cheese on the quesadilla was pretty salty but once cheese was slightly removed, it uncovered its delicious flavors.Lamb was tender and delicious and served in a cast iron pot with warm tortillas. Crispy Pork Belly.... was DELICIOUS! Bite feels slightly crispy but the meat is extremely tender and juicy, it melts in your mouth good. Seasoning was to perfection. 24oz Ribeye steak was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! Ordered medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. Served with grilled mini tomatoes on the vine which was very sweet and 3 salsas. Juicy, tender, delicious and cook to perfection, yes, all of the above! Dessert :Of course, had the pleasure of having Don Huevo without much wait as it was pre-ordered with the reservation. White chocolate sphere shaped dessert with chocolate mustache named Don Huevo is their signature dessert. Once caramel syrup is poured over, it starts to reveal the chocolate lava cake inside. Each order was good to share between 3-4 ppl.I requested for writing on the plate for the birthday we celebrated and they did not forget. Happy we did not have to remind them of the request.  Overall :We asked for few sombreros for silly birthday photo ops and the restaurant provided us with them which was a nice gesture.  End of the day, we all had a great time, delicious food and awesome wine to make our evening. Total came out to just under $1600 before gratuity. We were very satisfied with the overall experience and left 20%+ tip for the friendly staff.Overall, I rate this establishment just shy of 4.5  stars.",3,3,3,Sy Y.,"Fort Lee, NJ",275,223,2055

Everything was going great until I was disgustingly robbed by my waitress. Me and my guest we're having a great time celebrating my birthday so far until this point.

Here are my thoughts:Food- we got the yellowtail ceviche($15ish), chicken tacos($15ish), and the red snapper($30ish). Everything so packed with flavor and just really delicious. Space-It's located in The Dream Hotel-downtown at the Meatpacking. You can either go through the cafe in front of the hotel entrance or through the hotel's lobby lounge. The cafe is a casual small space which gives it somewhat of a speakeasy feel. It's a dim and trendy space with a lively vibe to it. They were playing hip-hop when we were there so even better. Service was superb there. We sat at the bar. The bartenders were super busy but took well care of us. Would always take the dishes away right when it's empty, refill our waters, and ask how everything was. It was excellent. My sister also got a dessert for me. It's their signature dish. Where it's a white chocolate egg that melts into the chocolate cake that's inside. I think it's melted with caramel syrup. It was so bomb.

My sister and law made sure to make reservations in advance and confirmed her reservation with the restaurant. Because the president elect was in the city there was more traffic than a usual Saturday in the city. We called the restaurant explaining we would be 10 minutes late and they informed us that they would hold our table. We arrived and the hostess greeted us and confirmed our arrival. She directed us to check in our coats and to sit in the lounge area until our table was ready. We ordered drinks and a waitress came with a menu and told us to put in the order. The waitress knew that we were waiting for a table and we were a party of 5. A few minutes pass and the servers started to bring the food to the small table in front of us. We were very confused and called the waitress and asked why was the food coming to the lounge area. She informed us that she thought we were going to eat there. The table was literally 3X3X3 (length, width & height). It couldn't even accommodate one person. Apparently the staff there didn't see a problem. We asked to speak to the manager and he ignored the initial request from the waitress. She then called the manager again (Kurt) and he was condescending and dismissive. He basically said  ""guac is on me but there are no tables and you have to wait an hour in a half to get seated"". I observed other people getting seated and they even sat a couple in a booth.

The steak which you can make your own fajita with, also yummy. The guac was yummy but portions too small. Tuna Ceviche was super tasty but the portion was barely enough for a baby (and you're expected to share).For dessert we had the Don Huevo, churros and tres leche cake. They were all amazing but I loved dipping the churros in the don huevo caramel sauce the best; you should try it.Service: Out waiter was amazing but our drinks too longer than the food to get to the table so they might want to hire an additional bartender.

4.0,12/3/2016,"Mainly came here with my bestie to try out the dessert as that has been all the rave since we found this place on yelp last month. Was in the area and finally made our way here. Only problem was I was so hungry before going to the Samsung 837 Elle King up close and personal event that I brought dinner (Chicken curry Rice) at restaurant near my work place before hand. So I was actually too full to order from this restaurant. But like they say ""always room for dessert""... lol. We did order the beef taco and side of Brussels spourts before ordering the dessert Don Huevo. My friend said the taco is good and skirt steak was moist with each bite. She also got the blood and fire cocktail which was strong but tasty. She had a Hooch deal for that cocktail. So make sure to use Hooch here. The Brussels sprout dish came with peanuts which was yummy. The wait staff was nice and friendly. So next we ordered the dessert we came all the way here to try, the Don Huevo. Yup it was super yummy. The chocolate lava cake moist and warm. Unfortunately by the time we got our dessert the ice cream on top melted since it took them a while to get us our dessert. They did raise the price on the Don Huevo to $16 from the original $12 that other people noted. The manager of the place came up to me and asked if it would be okay if we moved to a different table as the place was packed for service and they wanted to put some tables together to accommodate a larger group. She said that it was up to me if I wanted to move or not but if I did decide to move, they would compliment my dessert for free. Seeing that we were already done with dinner and only had dessert left I didn't mind moving even without the free dessert, but that was a plus. This is a nice place and seems very packed on Fridays and hard to find seating. So if you wanna go try this restaurant I recommend going on a different day. In addition, you should know the portion sizing for the food is small fares and the cost is quite expensive for each dish including the cost of cocktails are over priced. As a result I could not give this place five stars. But seeing that the place is very popular, the rest of the food must be equally tasty.

4.0,11/2/2016,"Great service for a large party in the ""private room""  Servers were very accommodating, festive, and game for some special requests.  Food was good and plentiful, not knock your socks off, but varied and tasty.  My one real complaint - it was just so freakin' loud.  I'm mean I'm getting old, but not that old.   It was tough to have a convo with the people next to me and I was losing my voice even before apps were done.  The restroom situation is also a little weird - a) the bathroom stalls are mirrored so you get to watch yourself hover and pee after a few margaritas - not good for the ego and  b) it is shared with a nightclub so even if you are just eating dinner, you have to deal with the awkwardness of a restroom attendant/leaving a tip/etc and also the nightclub crowd.  Overall though - big props to the servers (especially the one that squeezed into a midriff baring ""Big Red Machine"" shirt to humor our birthday girl) and the bouncers who suggested a perfect spot for us to move to for a few after dinner drinks.",2,0,0,Marisa S.,"Charleston, SC",191,185,177

2.0,10/30/2016,"I came here and was surprised at how bad the service was compared to other restaurants in the neighborhood. So we get there a few minutes late (about 10) the hostess asks us to sit by the bar, which I figured she would since it seemed a little busy. A half hour goes by and I'm a little concerned so my friend asks her what's going on and she tells him to wait. Fine, 5 minutes go by and I went to speak to the gentleman at the hostess podium and he tells me the same. We finally get a table, the waitress seemed cool so I asked her for her name so I can get her attention if I ever need her. This girl tells me ""I don't tell my name til the end, just in case you don't like me"" ... WTF? I was shocked and didn't know what else to even say at that point. (Mind you, the young lady has a distinct hair cut and look to her... so that statement was pointless and unprofessional.)Anyway we ordered our appetizers, food, and drinks. Still left a 20% gratuity although she didn't deserve it. The food was good, nothing spectacular. The service should have been better.",0,2,0,Kelly V.,"New York, NY",52,18,2
4.0,10/30/2016,"Bodega Negra has been on my ""GO TO"" list! Yesterday, I went with my boyfriend and it was not a disappointment! So if you live in NYC, or you're visiting, make sure you make your way to Bodega Negra. It is a bit pricey, but, hey, what can you expect? You are not eating Taco Bell, haha. Okay, so let me go on to the actual review... we were on the highway when we noticed that there was a lot of traffic and that we were not going to make it on time. So my boyfriend called to let them know that we were on our way, and are going to be a bit late. The person on the phone said that they were going to hold our seats for up to 15 minutes after the reservation time and that after that, they would try their best to get us seats. -- Okay, so we arrived about 20 minutes late and they held the table for us. When we got there, the host in the entrance told us that we had to be out by a specific time... NEVER HAVE I GONE TO A RESTAURANT AND BEEN TOLD AT WHAT TIME I HAVE TO BE OUT. So guess what? So my first thought was, ""We are going to leave when we are done with our food. We are spending money. We are not coming here to sit down and chill."" So that's exactly what we did... we stayed until we were done... nobody told us anything about leaving... duhhh, why would they? They saw we were spending good money!Anyways, the place itself is dimly lit and sexy. Everyone is at their table doing their own things... Some people are on dates some in large groups. I really enjoyed how diverse this place is... I'm not only speaking on the people people who go there, but also the actual Bodega Negra team. So yea... the food was reallllly good. We started off with the Quesadilla Rustica and it was every bit of amazing. If you enjoy spicey food get this, because the jalapeños are HOT! We also got the pork belly tacos , skirt steak fajitas.... amazinggggg! The steak was cooked perfectly! Wow, my mouth is getting watery of just thinking about it!We also got a few other things... the Bodega margaritas are strong depending on who makes them. The first one my boyfriend got was not as strong as the others. The shots are ginormous! Hahahahaha!!!! The beers are not as cold, so not that refreshing... My boyfriend surprised me with the Don Huevo, with the word, ""Congratulations"" on it... nice touch! Loved it! Oh, and they give you time to take out your phone, in case you want to record the beautiful Don Huevo! :) Lovedddd our time here; I will definitely be back!",1,1,1,Shantelle C.,"New York, NY",55,216,1211

The Quesadilla which is one of the appetizers is the best appetizer at the meal and one of the best I have ever had. Thin cripsy crust and lots of cheese and some peppers on top. So good. The entree is a whole roast pig which the restaurant brings out on top of a serving tray shaped like a pig. They let you take pictures and gawk at its magnificence and then take it back to the kitchen to carve up. They return shortly thereafter to present a carved up pig with 6 different sauces and freshly made corn tortillas. The pig skin was crispy devoid of fat and the meat was so tender, moist and flavorful. Everyone loved it.

5.0,9/22/2016,"This place deserves five stars and I'll tell you why. Located in the beautiful swanky hotel dream , this restaurant sets the bar very high for Mexican cuisine in Manhattan . Even before I came here I was able to make arrangements for their infamous dessert Don Huevo to have my friends name written with a birthday message , reservations are tough but if u call a week in advance you can manage . When we got there the decor was very unique , it was dim with cool furniture , very comfortable seating that is ideal for groups . The menu in general is ideal for sharing , from the appetizers to entrees . While there was so much to choose , I decided to go for the flat cheese quesadillas which resembled a pizza for starters ( it was amazing , it had tomatoes and jalapeños and cheese on top along with a chipotle sauce drizzled on top , and an awesome crunch) and super filling We also got the pork belly and skirt steak tacos (2 per order), I loved how juicy the skirt steak was, and how crispy the pork belly was with fried pork skins on top) and everything was perfectly seasoned , you can also tell the tortillas are homemade . In addition we ordered yuca fries on the side ( they were thick like steak fries lol, it wasn't too salty or too oily , they were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside , and the portion is generous ). Aside from these items you can find fish tacos , chicken tacos , duck tacos , veggie tacos , ribs,grilled corn, chilaquiles, various tostaditas which come in 3 , ceviche , guacamole and chips , and a lot of great entrees to choose from like ribeye, fajitas , shrimp , chicharones , tuna, lamb , Amish chicken , the list goes on and on. Aside from the extensive menu of authentic Mexican dishes , is a great selection of cocktails infused with agave and other great tequilas , or you can opt for wine , frozen drinks , vodka , you name it they have all the best top shelf liquors . My best friend got a margarita with peach purée and tequila it was to die for , it wasn't too sweet or too strong I would say this drink would compliment many dishes . You can also order sangria ( white or red ) by the glass, I opted for red and I liked how it was tangy and not too sweet , this place adds lemon but it's still pretty fruity and strong too!. The grand finale of the don huevo was magical, with the hot caramel drizzle poured on top , watching the white chocolate shell melt was mesmerizing ! I love the cute chocolate mustache added to the front , and the caramel ice cream added on top of the chocolate cake , everything worked so well together . The staff here made my friends birthday really special , they knew the menu inside out, my glass was always full , our bellies were full and we left there with a big smile on our face from the wonderful dining experience. All this for 125 dollars , it's well worth every dollar , I can't wait to return here to try the rest of the menu!",2,1,3,Michelle C.,"Brooklyn, NY",880,417,506

The wait for everything was super duper long. Ordered sangria for $70... Which makes no sense. It was expensive. The Santeria took atleast an hour to come. Ordered dessert, sat for another hour and even the waitress asked if we wanted anything else, and we replied, we still haven't even gotten out dessert.

1.0,6/6/2016,"I was incredibly disappointed with my experience.  I was celebrating my anniversary and was looking forward to this special occasion for some time.  Firstly, we waited approximately 20 minutes for our waiter to greet us and take our drink order.  Throughout the meal my water glass was never refilled.  We started with the tuna ceviche and oxtail empanadas.  While the tuna was fresh both plates were tasteless.  Next we shared the pork bellies, they were charred on the outside and straight fat on the inside.  Lastly we ended with the lamb, pork and soft shell crab tacos.  The lamb was gamey and it was impossible to detect crab in the soft shell crab tacos as all we tasted was old, soggy deep fry.  Lastly I began to develop a headache approximately 1hr after finishing the meal due to the low quality alcohol.  My husband was only able to find relief after self inducing his own vomit!  This was an incredible expense for a grave disappointment.

I had Jonathan and he was fantastic! He knew exactly what to let us try and get especially my drink! I love anything pineapple and he sure offered and served me one of the best pineapple mixed drink ever!! I of course had more than 2. The guacamole is delish, the pizza is really good and so are the tacos both steak and chicken. We enjoyed the lobster and steak and the best part was the desserts! Of course we had the chocolate ball which they pour a caramel or fudge over and it opens right up its super cool & really tasty ! I must say the place gets pretty crowded very quickly and it's not a big place at all. Music is loud and pumping and it's pricey so don't expect to pay less than $15 for a signature drink or for an appetizer.

3.0,5/20/2016,"My cousins and I came here just for the Don Huevo dessert on a Saturday night. Since there were 5 of us, we wanted to sit in a booth so that we'd be more comfortable. We didn't know that in order to sit in a booth, you have to order more than dessert, so we got a few apps (we had just ate dinner before). If you decide to only have dessert, you sit in a lounge area near the bar, but the tables are too small and the space is too tight for a big group. We ordered the Bodega Guacamole, which was good. We also ordered yuca fries, which I didn't really like because it lacked flavor. The Don Huevo was good but not amazing, I think all the hype is around the presentation rather than the taste. We also ordered churros and Tres Leches Cake (the cake is my favorite!)The service was okay- we always got what we asked for (sometimes it took them a while) BUT we had a different waiter every single time someone came to our table. When we ordered drinks, apps, dessert and paid the bill we had a different server each time. Weird because the restaurant wasn't that busy.They take reservations & have a coat check.

1.0,5/16/2016,"Worst dining experience of my life. We were seated promptly and given menus, but then it took at least 10 minutes before anyone stopped by our table (I don't know his name, he never introduced himself.), and I asked for water.  We then noticed that 3-4 waiters were standing with their backs to our table seemingly doing nothing. another 10 minutes went by, and I flagged down someone else asking if we could please get some water.  This person stated ""I'll find someone to get that for you,"" even though we still had handfuls of waiters standing around us, and there were water pitchers in sight.  We finally had a waiter stop by and asked if we were ready to order, so we ordered our water, drinks, and dinner in one shot.Nobody stopped by our table until they brought out our food (which was great), so we ate, then waited drink less for another 10-15 minutes.  When a man came to take our plates (with a simple, are you finished? No inquiries as to if we enjoyed it, or wanted anything else), we asked for the check.  I waited for what seemed like forever, then flagged someone else asking for the check (still sitting with an empty drink and no water).   It took asking a third person for our check for it to be brought to the table.  I then waited 8-10 minutes for them to come back to take it. We left after signing the bill, nobody wished us well on our way out, and I couldn't locate someone to speak to about the experience.Overall, All of the employees at bottega negra made us feel like we were somehow not worthy to be dining there - we were even questioning our outfits, as if what we were wearing should dictate if waiters stand with their backs to us and ignore us (we had just come from a show, I'm sure we were dressed just as nicely as your other patrons)  - I'm really sad to have actually spent money on that experience.Upon sharing this information with both Bodega Negra and the Dream Downtown hotel, I got a response of ""We spoke to our staff and were assured your service met our standards.""  If that's the case, you need to seriously reconsider your business model.",2,0,0,Nicole D.,"Arlington Heights, IL",0,2,0

Also, it is a mexican restaurant and they were playing english american music, which was a little strange; i feel like they should mix it up. If you go to a mexican restaurant ur kind of expecting a party but it really wasnt one. Lastly, they had no dairy free desserts.

The only way they would accept the money for dessert and champagne was if they had in hand at the time of order a credit card authorization form.

We were given a seat right by the entrance which was a little annoying but whatever. The most enjoyable thing I had was the $20 quesadilla (which is really a Mexican flat bread) it was good but definitely not worth $20 and one of the drinks (I don't remember the name of it however the waitress recommended it to my boyfriend and called it a ""Manly"" drink... however I really enjoyed it . We also ordered the ribs which I personally wasn't a fan of ; The texture wasn't good EXTREMELY fatty (( but that's just our personal taste)) . My boyfriend enjoyed the lobster tacos ((2 TINY tacos for $24)) we ordered 2 drinks, 3 appetizers and the lobster tacos. The bill was $140. Pretty pricey for a dive with mediocre food.

The atmosphere was nice - it's pretty hip, the lights are dim and there's a big disco ball or something in the dining room. If you are coming here for a dinner before the party, this is a great place to start. We got seated at a booth and ordered some guac and chips (I've had better and have made better - a waste of money tbh if you know how to make your own). The drinks are pretty pricey - $14-16 a pop.We did the RW menu, and got shrimp ceviche, pork belly tacos w/ chicharron, and a salad for apps. The shrimp ceviche was not very good, and it tastes like cooked shrimp in shrimp cocktail sauce. The pork belly tacos were alright but the tortilla was kinda cold - I think that a taco truck probably has better tacos... The salad looked alright, it was pretty big but I didn't get a taste since my friend wanted it for her own.For entrees, we had two chicken dishes and the shrimp grits. The chicken was ok - the shrimp grits was probably the HIGHLIGHT of the meal. If anything else sucked that night, the grits kinda made up for the fact that I was spending $50 on a sub-par mexican meal. The grits were formed into a pancake, and it was crisp on the outside, but fluffy and soft on the inside (mmmmmm).For dessert, we had tres leches cake and churros. They were ok - I didn't even finish the cake because it was way too sweet, and not in a very good way.

I was so uncomfortable and tried to get a booth but got shot down the 2 times I tried. Fine so then my sister orders a sangria reg short glass for $16 and she said it was watered down! They have nothing for kids so my son who like any typical 8yo was bored. It's very fancy they have a do and since I did come on a Friday the music I guess was good hip hop n r&b. The only thing I enjoyed about the restaraunt. We ordered the quesadilla which was just a thin crust cheese pizza, not that extravagant and my sister ordered the tuna tostada which she said tasted like thick skin...yuck! & it was like 3 wheat thins topped with the skin like Tuna and avocado for $18. I had a reg sized lemonade my son had a pineapple juice which he did not drink and the bill came out to 88! -___- left not happy or satisfied at all.

When she first came to the table I told her that we were there for the Don Huevo only as we had had dinner already. She wasn't happy about it and quesitoned us why. She was very pushy into us ordering other things, so we ordered the quesadilla and skirt steak tacos. As I said she wasn't happy,  everything we would call her she would wave us to wait and stop at another table get what they needed and then come to us.  I must add it was on a Tuesday so the restaurant was not full, either way we were always the last ones for her to be served.  Would I come back?  Just for the skirt steak tacos.  Quesadilla and Don Huevo are not worth it,  now even more than I can get something better done at home",1,0,0,Maria A.,"Belvedere Tiburon, CA",101,49,8

Great music selection but be prepared to just jam and not be able to talk to whoever you go with. Seating arrangements very close to each other you can literally hear the conversation that the next person is having.

2.0,2/16/2016,"Came here for my birthday to see what all the hype was about and I must say I won't ever return. The service was good but what they don't tell you is that you have a 2 hour time limit to dine, their serving sizes are enough to feed a 6 year old! And their prices are out of this world for typical Mexican dishes! I came in with a reservation for 10 and the minute we were seated the host tells us we had to order, eat, and drink within 2 hours because another party of 8-10 were coming. I said, ""Okay?  Can't they be seated elsewhere? Why was I never informed this upon making reservations?"" He apologized and asked again if we thought we'd be done in 2 hours because if not we couldn't be attended to. I said Yes, because at this time where were me and my party of 10 going to go?!Moving on, the waiter explained to us that one side of the menu was family style (big portions) and the other side of the menu was an individual serving (average size serving). Listening to what he said I ordered from the individual serving side because as many of us know ""family style"" servings can feed 3-4 people sometimes more. Turns out my serving was enough to feed a 5 or 6 year old. I was so upset and still very hungry! My sister ordered from the side of the menu that was ""family style"" -MUCH more expensive! But it was more of an individual serving. All of their drinks are expensive (anything from a fancy cocktail to a beer!)  When I asked for the price of a sangria pitcher I almost died and when you see how small the pitcher is -I think you'll die too! The taste of the food is nothing out of this world. Believe me when I tell you, you can find AUTHENTIC Mexican food just as good elsewhere for a much reasonable price and bigger serving size! To end the night, I asked for the Don Huevo which was what I initially came to Bodega Negra for. It's nice and all but if you see how TINY that desert is inside of the chocolate ball... SMH I just can't deal... Thanks but no thanks, I won't be returning. Don't listen to all the hype.

Maybe a bit more texture is needed. Loved the radish on the side!

The tequila lime sorbet definitely tasted like I had drank tequila and lime! Mango was my favorite.As for the main dessert, Don huevo. Boy, it was rich. It was really nice to see it in person. The magic white chocolate ball melting away to a chocolate mousse like cake and a raspberry sorbet it seemed. What was used to melt the white chocolate was caramel. It was fun to watch and order once. I say this because, although I am a person who enjoys sweets, this was beyond me. It was too sweet and rich, it felt like I had drank sugar. Not saying I didn't enjoy it, but I would recommend this eaten with a large group. It's not intended for an individual!The decor was very cute, quite dark inside, and it was surprisingly hard to find the restaurant for 2 native new yorkers!

We were not impressed one bit. The place itself was very trendy and nice. But the food wasn't what we were expecting. It was a group of 4 girls and our bill was $300 with tip. We ordered from the prefix menu, I played it safe and ordered chicken, seeing as it was something that was common. The chicken was dry and bland. I barely touched my plate. For appetizers I ordered the pork belly tacos and it was definitely missing some flavor or seasoning. The pitcher of sangria we order tasted purely like sour mix. Only two girls drank the entire pitcher and they weren't impressed. They were expecting to get a little buzz or atleast like it but unfortunately they didn't. I would truly recommend this place for the dessert and water. That was the best thing they had. The waiter brought us the bill right after he took our order for desserts. Which from my understanding, the bill is the last thing you should get. I have very high expectations. I would recommend just walking around the block and eating at TAO.

Both were awesome, salad was a little large for an appi but then again whatever. For entrees we ordered the chile relleno and Amish chicken. The chile relleno had a mole sauce on top stuffed with rice and cheese. It was a nicely grilled pepper and the flavor blended together nicely. Was given a side of tortillas as well which was nice. The Amish chicken was just as great topped with salsa verde and grilled veggies. For dessert we chose the churros and tres leches cake and also the Don Huevo (not on the menu for restaurant week but for it because it's fun). The churros came with a Carmel and spicy chocolate which was very flavorful. The tres leches was a nice spongey cake and not too wet or dry. The Don Huevo was so fun! VERY VERY RICH CHOCOLATE CAKE but totally worth every bite. Also the drinks were yummy. The blood fire was really good, nice spicy drink. The flore de fresca was very sweet and cinnamon-y.The ambiance is very rustic and cozy, I LOVE the decor and decorating, definitely took pics and added it to my book of design ideas/inspirations for interior design.4 stars because our waiter was kind of ignoring us during our meal and then disappeared towards the end.

Other dishes are pretty good, you won't be disappointed at least. The waitress called Jordan (I remember) had huge attitudes, maybe she is lazy or tired.

Definitely give the tacos a chance too, the soft shell crab ones are a must; if you have room for more, pick the lamb or the lobster. For dessert, get the don huevo.

The place is very dimly lit and resides inside the Dream Hotel. It has an upscale appeal and aura which is right up my alley. We started with guacamole which I don't usually eat but we were practically licking the bowl once our app was eaten. I had fish tacos for entree and they were as equally delicious. They brought my friend the Don Huevo for dessert (one of those chocolate balls that melt when hot caramel is poured over it. Inside was chocolate cake & ice cream.) I had just a bite and that didn't disappoint either! Bathroom was super clean which is a huge deal in my book. Didn't get many pics because I was having too much fun. Will definitely be back to Bodega Negra  in the near future!!!",0,0,0,Kat M.,"Bronx, NY",29,5,5

We were warmly welcomed by three lovely girls and a manager who showed us to our table. We were greeted very quickly and constantly had filled water. We did not feel rushed in anyway at all and our server Jonathan gave us amazing recommendations and knew the menu so well. We asked a lot of questions and he knew every answer, no hesitation. The soft shell crab tacos are on point! The lamb ones are even better! The tuna ceviches was perfect. And for desert we had the Don Huevo, it was such a good surprise, birthday girl had no idea I called to pre order it or the fact that Jonathan and I talked about it while she was in the restroom.

Bizarrely enough when we were serviced adequately it was to clear plates prematurely. Stunk that it was such a weird experience but I guess I can attribute it to being a Friday night. Sadly it was supposed to be a more intimate holiday celebration but with $16 small margaritas (yikes), we felt bad really letting loose. Guacamole was delicious but they took the plates too early before we were done. Yuca fries were excellent. Charged $25 to cut a cake that we brought, just a heads up. Overall wasn't that impressed but the decor was awesome and it might be fun to come back at an off hour, not a Friday night with a larger group.",1,0,0,Marc S.,"NY, NY",192,209,137

Was told by hostess that they were ""getting my table ready"", and was invited to have a drink at the bar, and she would come get me when the table was ready. No problem, we went to the bar. Really good music, great vibe despite high B&T factor. My husband ordered a drink - and to give credit where it's due, really nice bartenders. At 8:50 I went to check on table. Went like this:Hostess: Vivian right? I'll come get you when your table is ready.Me: When will that be?Hostess: I'll come get you when it's ready?Me now a little annoyed, to twit: I understand you will get me when the table is ready, I would like to know when that will be?Wannabe Secret Service Host(WSSH) with earpiece, in a bit of an annoyed tone: We are working on your table.Me to WSSH, tapping my finger on counter with each word I spoke: When will that be - in 15 minutes or 1 hour, because that will determine where I have dinner tonight?WSSH, coming out from behind the counter, with a jovial tone: Come on, let me buy you a drink.Me: My husband already had a drink, I'm not drinking, and if my table is not going to be ready in 5 minutes, I'm going to be having dinner in any one of the thousands of restaurants in NYC.WSSH, still not committing to a time: It's going to be more than 5 minutes.Me: Good bye then.So, I don't know anything about the food, nor will I ever, because I won't be going back. We were treated with total disrespect. No one ever said, I'm sorry. Restaurants need to understand the concept of a reservation.

I wish we were warned about the ambiance.  Looking on yelp, I thought it was a really casual place.  That is when I got there and saw a lot of people in suits standing outside and realized it was next to a hotel.  My friends and I came REALLY casual and I felt out of place.  It wasn't formal or really fancy in there but everyone was in dresses and stilettos or a button up. I saw that they do coat checks but we weren't offered it.  This place is pretty pricy.  The food is good but nothing special. You can get it anywhere else.  The only thing that is unique is the don huevo which you HAVE to get if you come here! It is not only cool but the lava cake inside in delicious! It is totally worth it. The seating is comfortable.  You will definitely have a lot of elbow space and space for your dishes. The music is good but it's really loud so you won't be able to have a conversation with the person across from you. I gave them an extra star because our server was great.  We wanted the don huevo to coem with a sparkler so we can sing happy birthday but she said the sparkler is only for people who ordered bottles but she gave it to us anyways!

My guest arrived 30 minutes late due to traffic and they STILL held our table during a crazy busy night. Our waiter Robin was amazing. That's actually an understatement but I can not think of a better word at the moment. Robin helped us find things on the menu he recommended items, he talked to us, shared laughs and even allowed us to take a photo of him. He made sure that everyone knew it was my birthday! Last night was honestly  one of the best nights I've had in years due to the service at the restaurant. The music was great! I felt like I was in a club, I even asked to thank the DJ which I was allowed. DJ Shaka Bueller and Robin gave me the best birthday!

It's delicious to eat, the caramel drip is amazing. We ordered the steak fajitas which is definitely way to much food for one person. I was disappointed with the tostados. There were 3 and they were tiny and I know it wasn't on a tostidos chip but it definitely looked like that. We also ordered the Chopped salad which was very tasty.

The first loss of star comes from the fact that you cannot see your food.  The restaurant should install pendulum style lighting above each table, with the light directed and focused down onto the table.  Done properly this would not bleed light to its surroundings, or take away from the ambiance.  It would allow you to a) read the menu, and b) see your food. The second loss of star comes from being charged $10 for a bottle of carbonated water; not a bottle of Pellegrino or Perrier, but a bottle of regular water with carbonation added by the restaurant in the kitchen.  We were charged for 2 bottles; not cool, not good, not coming back.",0,0,0,Jeff S.,"New Rochelle, NY",0,8,2

5.0,9/11/2015,"First and foremost, judge me all you want... but I love the meatpacking district/chelsea area.  I've been to so many mexican restaurants before who would warn me about the spice levels in their dishes and they always ended up being a joke.  Not at Bodega Negra.  We started off with an order of the pork belly, which was crispy on the outside but still tender enough to flake/fall apart when you hit it with your fork.    For our entrees, we had the crispy red snapper and the skirt steak with a side of Yucca fries.  Both of which were fantastic, but I would say the red snapper was the stronger dish of the two.  The skirt steak came out a perfect medium rare and the pepper blend/mole that it was served with was great.  The yucca fries came out a little later and by then we started feeling full so we didn't get to enjoy them as much as we wanted to.  The dessert.... just as everyone else said... Don Huevo. I don't even know why they bother having any other dessert on the menu.  I would highly recommend this place. A meal here for two with 2 drinks a person will run you about $250 with tip.*Hint* If you're trying to impress a fun loving spouse.... this is a great spot to look in to.

I wish I remembered what her name was so they could put her in check, but she had a very nasty attitude, and overall was cold, rude, and unwelcoming. Some examples...we asked for a cup of coffee and repeated our order one more time as she was walking away just incase she missed it and she snaps back saying ""yeah I already heard you the first time"". She dropped water as she was walking away on one of my friends, and as she was taking a cup of coffee off the table she spilled a few drops of coffee on my cousin, both times she did not even bother apologizing or helping to clean up. Then when she found out we didn't give her a huge tip she was all mad and we heard her complaining to someone as we walked by. Well sorry, but I'm not sorry. Your service sucked and your lucky we gave you anything. Tips are something that are earned based on good service, you are not automatically entitled to one so maybe you should learn to do your job first. We were not loud or rowdy or needy, we did nothing to deserve such an attitude from her.

3.0,8/11/2015,"I came to Bodega Negra because my husband's niece had wanted to go here. Since it's restaurant week, I decided to take her and try what is classified as a Mexican restaurant. The service staff was really nice. We had arrived late but they had saved us a table at the corner. This place is very dark and looks like a hidden cave with ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" chained-up sofas. ""Bodega negra"" means black market in Spanish so I guess they were literally going for that look, which impressed my 20-year-old niece and my inner-mischief self.  By the way, the bathrooms were also dark in a S&M-kind-of-way. I thought a gimp was going to jump out at me from one of the bathroom stalls.  I should mention that my husband and his niece are Mexican.  I've been with my husband for ten years and been at all the fiestas and quinceañeras that offer the wonderful food from Mexico (some literally shipped from Mexico).  Therefore, I consider my taste buds honorary Mexicans.  We walked in this restaurant like we were part of the unofficial council of the Mexican Kitchen.  So as soon as I saw the restaurant week menu, I was disappointed.  They had no meat or spicy food in this menu. The Chile Relleno had no meat.  The shrimps were not spicy and came with grits (isn't that from New Orleans???).  The regular menu has plates that cost a minimum of $40.  So my niece and I ordered tacos and empanadas from the appetizer section, which was still expensive.  I paid $16 dollars for only two tiny tortillas and the empanadas were just as tiny for the same price.  After I had a bite of my tacos, I realized why it was so expensive.  It had pecking duck, which by the way was delicious but not enough. I was still hungry after I inhaled my food.  I then looked at my niece and asked her what I should have asked at the very beginning: ""Why here?""  She then went on to describe a dessert that seemed to come from a magical world.  I asked the waiter if such a thing existed and he revealed that it does by the name of ""Don Huevo"".  ""Don Huevo"" is a beautiful ball of white chocolate with a black mustache on it.  With the power of hot caramel syrup, it melts and exposes one gorgeous bowl of explosive lava cake and vanilla ice cream with bits of melted white chocolate.  This is the only reason why anyone should come to this restaurant.  It is a great experience to have at least once since it is $16.  Although this experience was amazing, it was almost ruined by a group of women at the table next to mine. As soon as they wore the sombreros and fake mustaches provided by their waiter, they turned into their own version of a Mexican by screaming, ""Arriba"" and ""Si, señor. Me llamo Juan"".  I might as well have been having dining next to Donald Trump and Kelly Osbourne.If you're into expensive Mexican food that is really not Mexican and seeing people pretending to be stereotypical Mexicans with fake sombreros, then this is the restaurant for you.  If you want authentic Mexican food, then go to Rosa Mexicano, which even currently is part of Restaurant week.  For inexpensive Mexican food, you can even try El Cantinero.",0,0,0,Nery A.,"Brooklyn, NY",142,51,105
5.0,8/10/2015,"This is Mexican to the 10th Octave!! My sisters and I took of advantage of Restaurant Week and selected Bodega Negra because of their menu.Bodega Negra is right in between The Dream Hotel and a storefront. It's dim when you Goinside. Just be careful going down the stairs- you need to hold on and get your bearings straight.Now, once you head down to the Dining Room- that's when your mind plays tricks on you. Place is pitch black! But your vision somehow readjusts to the darkness there. Restaurant Week menu was nice and compact from Appetizer all the way to Dessert and portions were huge!!! My sisters and I had the most scrumptious meals here- actually no complaints. Dessert was another success. Bodega's Tres Leches Cake was luscious!

The manager even came by to make sure we were having a good experience.  Seriously some of the best service I've had in NYC, ever!  My favorite dishes were the Quesadilla Rustica, the Empanadas, and the special Ceviche of the night with yellowtail, avocado, and lime.  And of course, we got the special dessert - the Don Juevo - never seen anything like that - HUGE wow-factor!  We ordered margaritas and they were well attended to, and super delicious: not too strong, not too weak, not too much ice - just perfect!I seriously would recommend this place for a fun dinner - great for groups & celebrations.  You will not be disappointed by the level of hospitality at such a trendy restaurant!  Loved every bit of it!",0,0,0,Jilly F.,"Washington, DC",0,3,0
3.0,8/6/2015,"I went here with a party of 6 for my sisters 30th birthday. The service was alright, a little slow. 4 people had the pre-fix dinner menu $40 for 3-courses (Restaurant week). The choices for entrees were poor. For appetizers we had pork belly tacos, chicken tostada, shrimp ceviche and guacamole. The pork belly were ehh okay nothing special, chicken tostadas needed seasoning. The guacamole was great! For entrees they had the crossed chile poblano, Amish chicken, pork belly tacos (I didn't know they weren't as good prior to trying then as an appetizer), and steak tacos. The Amish chicken was presented well but very dry with a bunch of roasted vegetables, nothing special. The steak tacos were good but for 2 for $16 is a farrrrrrrrrr stretch. I didn't taste the poblano chile but didn't hear anything about it. The dessert was the best thing about the meal. The tres leche was great, churro a were alright and the infamous ""Don Huevo"" is nice to look at but isn't mind blowing.

I finally flagged down our waitress after 15 more minutes after the appetizer and she responded ""they are cooking it"" sorry what? really? For more than an hour? I was so upset I got out of the cramped booth to find a manager, told him everything, and when I went back, still no tacos! The best part of this entire night was the company I kept, and when the food and beverage manager came to kindly apologize, but still no tacos!! They finally arrived more than an hour later.... And they were 2 tiny tacos each!! Nothing else! What were we supposed to do now?! They were all still so hungry and we were all too nervous to ask for anything else ....

1.0,7/30/2015,"We stopped in one random Sunday afternoon since we were down by the Piers. My boyfriend is in love with Oxtails, if I could cook them I'm sure he would've asked me to marry him by now. I digress - when I saw that Bodega Negra had oxtail empanadas, I figured we'd give it a go. At first, we didn't know it was two different restaurants. It was nice out, so we sat in the front part where they have a open bar area so you can opt to sit at stools on the sidewalk or inside looking out. We ordered a drink from the bartender to get us started. I noticed on the menu, the empanadas were not listed. After asking, we were told that they are in the main restaurant only and that if we wanted we could have our table moved inside. Sure, why not since that's what we came for anyway. The inside restaurant, is dark and dim but not in a romantic way. They place little faux candles on your table. Our waitress was friendly, sharing with us more of the popular dishes. The boyfriend picked the steak and I had the roasted chicken. His was good, mine was kind of bland. We had the same drinks from earlier, and after looking at the prices I said we would be slowly sipping those until dinner was finished. The entrees were overpriced, and nothing fantastic to them. The chicken, I could've made that at home. The waitress stated that later in the week, I believe Thursday and Friday nights they have music and it gets packed. Saturdays you need a reservation to guarantee a seat.

They pour caramel over a big ball of vanilla chocolate that opens up into a chocolate molten cake and ice cream in the center. It was okay, overly sweet nothing special.

I do have to say that for a dessert it was pretty pricey, but it's worth it for that one time experience and to see in person.

We ordered some tacos and was a bit dissatisfied with the portion size however after eating the chips and amazing guacamole with grilled corn (1 ear cut in half), the tacos (2 per order) were very filling. Since we came here for dessert we couldn't leave without it. I'm not a chocolate lover so I'm glad the Don Huevo was white chocolate with caramel. It made sharing easier. Once they did the whole melting the ball it revealed almond ice cream over a fudge cake which was tasty. I didn't eat much due to my disgust for chocolate but my best friend said it was ""worth everything,"" so I guess it was good.

3.0,4/6/2015,Remember you are in NY so you will be paying NY prices. The drinks are over priced ; a Corona would cost you $9. I ordered Tosaditas and usually when I get them from a Mexican restaurant they are a nice size ; these looked like an appetizer ; thank goodness I ordered Yuca fries.

Unfortunately, my date and I, didn't get to experience the restaurant decor and full menu. We had a 11:15pm reservation and when we arrived at 1045pm, the front was congested of guest awaiting to be seated. I started a conversation with a group who were waiting for hour for 10pm reservation. When I spoke to the host- there were -almost 15 parties ahead of us. She recommended we dine on the smaller dining area outside of the restaurant. She was kind enough to inform us that we weren't likely we be seated before the kitchen closed. Therefore, we decided before the night was ruined to accept the host recommendation. It seems like the staff was very frazzled and confused. Although, our waitress was very polite and attentive.

The homemade salsa, queso fresco and hint of cilantro add a perfect balance of flavors. I was tempted to go make out with the chef this breakfast was so delicious!

4.0,3/20/2015,I came here for my 24th birthday with a few girlfriends. I had seen videos of their dessert don huevo and would not shut up until i got it. We ordered chips and guac which I could not stop eating and chicken quesadilla which tasted more like a pizza but wasn't bad. Then I ordered skirt steak which tasted so good. I wanted to sub the potatoes for fries but they said it could not be done because it takes away the art of the plate whatever that means but once I tried it I was satisfied with my steak and potatoes as is. There are no words to describe how amazing and pretty the dessert is that we even ordered 2! Mainly because we didn't get a good video the first time around and the ice cream was melted :/ but all in all it was a pleasant dinner and might I add the waiter gave us 4 free champagne shots with a berry in each.

Let me say this. I work in the industry and I never write reviews no matter how good or bad the service is so just try and imagine how much of a disappointment this was. Yes, I know servers may not care about restaurant week but at least act like you care when you have tables. We saw our server probably a total of 3 times throughout our 2 and a half hour dinner. First time was when he came to take our drink order, second time was to take our food order, and third time was to drop the check. Our drinks were empty on the table for at least 20 minutes at a time. At one point my friend actually had to go over to the bar and order a drink. Hello do you know how much more money you would've made if you had been more attentive and made sure we were ok (especially when your cocktails are $16 each)?? I do applaud for the bus boys to pick up some of the slack though seeing as they were extremely attentive. When a friend asked about a good upbeat place to go for her friends birthday, I told her Bodega Negra but warned her that the service is HORRIBLE but hopefully it was just because of our server.

Unfortunately we had to make two separate reservations to get the restaurant week deal of $38 for an appetizer, entree and dessert, and they wouldn't let us all sit together because of other reservations and it's a small little spot, but besides that it's cool. Food is decent, they probably put the weakest dishes on the deal menu on purpose so I'm not going to judge them based on what I ordered because it was pretty plain. To me this place is all hype, good to try once or twice but nothing I'd consider as a hidden gem.Also one thing to note, to find this place you have to like walk through a hotel entrance, through some kind of small cafe bar area just to get into the restaurant.

Our menu was a set menu and we got a sample of each thing on the menu. This is a pretty expensive place our bill was about $1300 so if you're going with the group make sure everyone at least puts down $75 don't forget tips, other than that the atmosphere was great, the restaurant was very dark and cozy, and overall the food was very good.

One plate lead to the next...and the next and that guy getting my number. Lol  Started with the shrimp ceviche. It was ok, but the other appetizers and entrée most def showed the chef out! Enjoyed the juicy and savory Amish chicken and the well flavored balanced shrimp and grits. Tacos were eclectic and offered the non typical with duck and pork belly protein options.  Sitting at the bar you totally can come here on your own without feeling awkward,  but I can see how it would be fun with a small crowd as well.  Staff is really accommodating and friendly.  I enjoyed the food,  drinks,  ambience, music,  crowd and service.  #nyc #wheretoeat #nycfood #eatery #nyceatery #mexican #mexicanFood #coolspot",0,0,0,CityUndercover U.,"Philadelphia, PA",105,26,55

1.0,2/16/2015,"of course like many of you, I've come across their don huevo dessert on social media and I said...I must go there. It was yesterday, the day after Valentines, we had reservations. But were seated in one of the tiny and I mean tiny tables in the center of the floor. Its super dark, I almost tripped. At first, it looks really cool, the minimal lighting but then you sit there and realize its just too dark. Ask for a booth if you're making reservations. Once again the table was tiny and the waitress had to wait for us to be semi done with our appetizer (guacamole and chips) which btw I've had better guac, I can actually make better guac than the one I tasted there. So she had to wait to clear off the appetizer before bringing out whatever else we ordered bc it just wouldn't fit on the table. We ordered chicken tostaditas to start and the shredded chicken was NOT tasty, i don't think it was even seasoned, hardly tasted like anything and the cheese on top of it was a very small quantity and added nothing to the dish itself. It seemed like more a decoration. You would think...mexican resturant and expect seasoned meat and cheese, cheese, cheese. But no, that wasn't the case. The drink we ordered was called fruit hermosa and it wasn't good. I had originally had a hard time picking a drink so i asked the waitress what she recommended ..the margarita or the fruit hermosa and she said fruta hermosa bc its pink, its valentines day weekend, everyone is going with it and it's good blah blah. So ehhh the what heck, we ordered  it and Fruta hermosa was NOT a good drink. Period.*****DON HUEVOO!!!!! Moving along to the infamous dessert. DON HUEVO!!!!!!!!!*****Ok so it normally it is a big shell of white chocolate but since it was valentines day weekend, they put red dye in the white chocolate and in the hot caramel they poured over the shell to melt the big shell/chocolate egg. I would have preferred the original version. After seeing all the videos and pictures. I was mentally prepared and expecting a big white chocolate shell. All the red threw me off. I was disappointed AND  the waiter usually brings it out and waits for you to get your camera ready but he kinda rushed through it, I couldn't even get a good shot. It was part of the experience, the presentation, the anticipation. AND It was not all what I expected it to be. They put a tiny tiny scoop of ice cream on the lava cake and no decorative heart in the center. I saw other tables near us that ordered the dessert and they had a FULL scoop of ice cream inside the shell and a cute decorative heart but we didn't get that. Maybe because we didn't order an entree???? There is really tight management there. I saw at least two men in suits standing at either corner of the resturant looking over everything, everyone. Walking back and forth. So maybe they are the ones who decide who gets a full scoop of ice cream and a decorative heart and who gets the cheaper version! LMAO. Sounds ridiculous but you never know. We only had drinks and appetizers and weren't satisfied enough to order more food. It was bland. so we moved straight to the dessert and not even that was good.  There was DEFINITELY a difference in our Don Huevo dessert compared to other tables around us AND THAT TOOK AWAY FROM OUR EXPERIENCE. My boyfriend and I both agreed.  We gave Bodega Negra thumbs down.   Very dissappointed.",3,0,0,ML T.,"Manhattan, NY",108,22,5

4.0,1/21/2015,"As my friends and I walked in through these big red doors we were taken by surprise by the beautiful architecture and structure of modern decor carefully placed throughout the room. There were pieces of mirrored glass that covered an elevated alcove in a corner where others sat and it reflected a dreamy space. A gigantic ball hung from the ceiling covered in pennies and it was rotating ever so slightly insighting others that look at it to gasp in wonder and awe. The restaurant was dimly lit with candles at the center of each table lighting the intimate space. We were caught up in the scene of waiters and waitresses rushing to fill hungry customers orders and were excited to see the hustle and bustle and popularity of this establishment.    When we were seated, we first ordered 2 pitchers of margaritas and chips with guacamole they were both delicious and  complimentary of each other while we waited for the rest of our companions to arrive. The margaritas were both strong, crisp in flavor, and refreshing to drink as if I was being quenched from a 100 years of thirst. Next we each requested tacos and I imagined a larger portion of tacos in my mind so I had ordered 2 pork tacos. I was surprised when they arrived to the table because the tacos were so small when the price was ranging $15-$17 and I expected a large portion. Although the size of the taco was not what I expected, the taste was delicious.    Our friends came around and we ordered quesedillas and when it came to our table it looked like a small pizza and had a similar taste to a delicate pizza as well. I still thought it was delicious and continued munching on it. At last!! we finally ordered the Don Huevo and that was the star of the show. The waitor brought it out and it is this white chocolate covered ball with a dessert inside. He poured this mixture that slowly melted the outer exterior of the white chocolate ball and the chocolate brownie icecream surprise of the inside was at the center! The presentation of the dessert was perfect and it was definitely exhibited like a magic show that was heavenly throughout each bite.   The service was excellent and I felt hurried because it was a Saturday night and they had to fill in other tables so they expect us to leave before 8pm for other reservations. Also, finding the bathroom was a almost like going through a maze. There were several twists and turns you had to take and on top of all that the halls were dimly lit. It was basically an adventure to find it and once you entered the bathroom the stalls and everywhere you turned to was covered in mirrors. It almost reminded me of being in a fun house. Overall, the experience I had was great and you should go with a group of friends! I was a little disappointed with the portion size of the tacos because of how much you're paying for only two of them along with the quesedillas looking and tasting like a delicate pizza but the dessert was what really made this experience a memorable one.",6,1,2,Jessica T.,"Bergen County, NJ",108,22,85

Uneven amount of tortillas, extremely small portions of the toppings and maybe 6 pieces of meat. For $37, I don't think that's ok. A pitcher of margarita was almost $70. The bottle of tequila doesn't even cost that much! We had the don huevo for dessert, of course. It was rich and I enjoyed it. But again, a very small portion. It was okay because of the richness of the chocolate. I don't think Bodega Negra is worth the prices they charge.

Only in New York...) and we were waiting for his girlfriend. Got there at 10:30 and sat in the bar. SOOO dim you literally need your phone to read the menu. Made me feel like my grandmother. Very fun, irreverant artwork.Bathroom is weird - you basically have to go into the hotel, passing the kitchen and down a back alleyway. Drinks were good, but they should be at $17 a pop.

Boooooo..Okay when our food arrived, none of us ordered beef, we all went for chicken but one of the dish was beef. Yuuuuk. We were soooo hungry so we decided to share all 3 dishes instead of returning it.After the need fiasco, we wanted to order more drinks and asked for the menu, our waiter's reply was ""I am the menu"".

1.0,11/24/2014,"I came here this past Saturday to celebrate my friend's birthday. She was looking forward to coming here for the Don Huevo dessert. Before the day came, I made reservations for 10:45pm. My friends and I arrived about 15 minutes earlier and was told we had to wait. That was fine since we did arrive early. Fast forward to 45 minutes s after our 10:45pm and we are still waiting. We were told our table was almost ready several times. I will say that the manager was nice enough to provide us with one round of drinks and an appetizer of guacamole at the bar since were waiting so long. In the end, we were seated 55 minutes after our reservations. Finally we are seated and while we were eating, the bus boy was standing right in front of our table for the majority of the time we were there. Even before we had a chance to finish the food on our plate, he was at our table trying to take the plate away. We had to tell him several times no.  In regards to the food itself, come here if you only want appetizer sized food. Do not expect to come here starving and expect to eat a meal that will satisfy you. Since the manager had given us the guacamole, I was not that hungry when my two small crab tacos arrived. However, I will say, the desert was good. My friend liked the Don Huevo desert and that made me happy. The desert was big compared to the actual meals we ordered. I will also say I liked the theme and the ambiance of the restaurant. The music the DJ played was good as well.

3.0,11/9/2014,"I wish I could give them 5 stars. The food was very tasty even if slightly over salted. However, even by NYC standards, this place is outrageously overpriced when you look at price versus plate. For $17 you get 3 (THREE!) round tortilla chips each topped with 3 very very thin slices of seared tuna, chipotle sauce and fried onions. $17 for 3 tortilla chips. For another $16 you can get the most mini corn tortilla tacos you have ever seen. The meals did give you a quality portion, but for about $40 per entree, it almost wasn't even enjoyable. For a group of 7 the bill came to $65 per person- we had a few plates to share and half the group got entrees. After the pitcher of margaritas and 2 desserts we all walked out with happy tummies, but talked about the portions for the rest of the night. I absolutely agree with everyone that it is just far too dark in there. I couldn't describe the plates across the table or see details about my own without turning on my phone's flashlight. The creepy yet must check out mirror bathroom is an interesting touch. The highlight of the meal was the Don Huevo dessert. Pour that hot caramel sauce over and watch the white chocolate orb melt and open to reveal an incredibly delicious molten lava chocolate cake with the tiniest scoop of very good horchata ice cream. Overall it was a good meal, but I'm sure Yelp can direct you to better tasting food for a better price within a 5 block radius.

If I knew it had gone so down hill I would have just went to chipotle. $135 without tip and we didn't even order entrees. It started off bad when we got guac that was the most awkward texture I have ever felt in my life. I don't know if they mixed in one that wasn't rip, or if they froze it. It had very little taste and was terrible. Everything really lacked flavor. For the money you pay and the portion you get I atleast expect it to be good. Dessert was a big let down. We order there (don huevo) molten cake with the white chocolate dome over it. By the time it got to us the ice cream over the cake was completely melted the dome didn't even melt half way as well as the cake wasn't even properly cooked. The outside of the cake was burnt and crisp and the inside a raw uncooked mess. For what we paid they should step it up. Their service is little to be desired as well. It's dark in there I would never bring a child to this establishment. for how empty the restaurant was, service and bad food shouldn't have been an issue. I will not be returning here.

I received 12 pieces of steak and some potatoes and peppers to make little tacos out of with my tortillas.

Strip away the oh so very hip setting, the substantial price tags, and the attractive clientele and you're left with very mediocre Mexican food -- completely unexciting. If you're like me and could care less what celebrity followed you into the elevator, prompting the bellhop to usher you out of the elevator to give said celeb a VIP ride (true story--gee thanks Dream Hotel), save your money and go elsewhere.If you prefer your Mexican served with an extra dose of cool, maybe you'll enjoy yourself here. The place is Meatpacking-chic. But, definitely avoid ordering the shrimp ceviche (tasted like grilled shrimp), the fish tacos (my table didn't finish these--bad sign), yuca fries (mushy, bland lumps), and the salmon al pastor (too sweet). The guacamole was pretty good and the molten chocolate cake didn't stand a chance in this world. Warm chocolate confections will be my downfall. The bodega ensalada was also yummy, but ranch dressing was the reason I ate even the grossest vegetables as a kid, so I'm not sure I would call this dish a culinary breakthrough.",6,2,1,Margo L.,"New York, NY",219,93,4

We first ordered a round of cocktails / beers, not sure if that explain the check but by the end of the meal total was close to $80 pp, despite RW! Which is ok, had our experience been better.Our waitress was doing a good job. Appetizers and mains were really good. I'd like to say I'll be back - since I really liked the food - but I am not so sure...I felt so rushed to finish my plate for the entire meal!  Entrees came 10 min after the appetizers! We  were still eating our appetizers when they brought the entrees, not even close to be done!!! So we had to send them back. As soon as the last person finished her appetizer, the plate was taken away and the entrees brought in, I think she was still chewing. Not cool. And it got worse during the entrees. The busboys kept trying to take our plate when we are not even half way through. Almost all of us had to fight, at least 3 to 5 times to keep our plates. At some point it gets not only intrusive (since it interrupts a conversation) but also very unpleasant.

As a self-declared carnivore I can't recall another time that I have consciously ordered a vegetarian dish, but I was pleasantly surprised with how good this was. I dare say it may have even been...healthy. The whole chili was stuffed with a bunch of warm deliciousness and dressed with a spicy sauce that I thoroughly enjoyed. For dessert I loved the Tres Leches Cake. It was moist and very flavorful. I do not have much experience with the particular dessert but the others that I've tried have been a little bland.

I started with a ginger lemonade which I was thrilled came with a piece of skewered candied ginger. Drinks are pricey though-$16 (I was able to read THAT on the menu.) So be prepared to spend some $$$ if you would like dinner AND drinks. I did the shrimp ceviche for my appetizer and it was delicious!

4.0,8/8/2014,"A trendy upscale Mexican restaurant that specializes in agd tequila and mezcal. Very noisy and crowded, but the dark atmosphere hides the other tables a bit. Drinks are fantastic with a good selection of tequila and mezcal, including some spicy fiends that go great with the food. The mezcal has a great smokey flavor and goes so well with slow cooked meat. The food was also superb. The gucamole was very fresh, bright, and crisp and the chips were excellent. The jalapeno poppers were good, but could have been spicier and smokier to add more full flavor. The quesadila was like a pizza and just incredible. The tacos are meant to be shared family style, so bring a few friends to, like pokemon, try them all. The Peking duck ones were nice and citrusy, though the meat was hidden a bit by the flavors of the sauce. The pork were also good but a bit dry and lost in the toppings. The chicken was excelent and shone through the cheese and guacamole toppings. The steak was also good and well seasoned. The crab was far and above the star. It was crispy, tangy, and crabby in all the right ways and just beautiful.For desert, the flan was pretty good, though honestly much alike any other flan I've had. The Don Huevo is super unique and must be experienced. It's a giant sphere that they pour hot chocolate over which bursts and melts the shell, exposing the chocolate goodies inside. So good.

We were a group of nine so we understood that we'd possibly have to wait a bit for a table large enough to accommodate us to be available. We ordered some drinks at the bar, which was empty when we arrived. By 8:30, the bar was packed and we were having trouble maintaining our place at the bar. We asked how much longer our table would be, and we were met with a terrible attitude from the hostess who informed us that our table was still being used by another group but that they were finishing up. Fine. We ordered some more drinks, and perused the menu trying to decide what to order.By 9pm we still had yet to be seated. We ordered chips and guac at the bar (which were delicious). Unfortunately, since we were a group of 9 we hesitated to just pack it up and leave, believing that we would be met with long waits anywhere we attempted to go at this point. HAD the staff been honest with us from the beginning, we would have left at 8:30, when we originally inquired about the status of our table. We asked about our table again and were told, ""they are ordering dessert"". By 9:30pm I was ready to walk out the door had we not been seated in the next 5 minutes. Sensing our frustration, it seemed as though the manager went to speak with the waiter because the waiter FINALLY asked the party sitting at ""our table"" to move along and the table was miraculously vacated.Starving, we ordered quickly and our food was brought out promptly. However, our waiter seemed like he could not be bothered with us. He did not return to inquire about our food. Nor did he even attempt to apologize for the wait we endured. In fact NO ONE from the front of the house seemed to care. Considering we spent well over $300 at the bar waiting for our table, one would think that a manager would come to our table to check on us. Clearly, the management at this place does not care about return customers since it is such a ""hot spot"".

Second course I ordered the Roasted ""AMISH"" ChickenNot exactly sure why is so amish in this chicken, unless is an Amish guy back in the kitchen making this. lol But the chicken was too dry, over cooked.

I came early figuring might as well hang here to grab drinks and hope could get seated early.  Not only was I not seated earlier which is not a big deal but was not at table until 1015.  Not sure if overbooked, let people with no reservation people sit or people were lingering more than expected but one should never need to wait that long to sit as do not care how trendy the place is.While I waited I ordered those Jalapenos rellenos as they were not on the restaurant week menu. I should have left after eating those as they were all hot no depth.  The food that came with meal was not much better as though food was okay and one would hope so when paying 16 dollars for 2 small tacos they had small faults.  The peking duck tacos were overally salty and my salmon had obviously been par cooked and then finished later as both overcooked and dry on outside and not that cooked in the middle.  Could not tell you the quality of the fish as the pineapple and sauce overpowered whatever flavor the salmon might have had.The drinks were not much better as did not find the margarita to have that fresh squeezed lime taste.  Could use better beers as this place has a small beer list. I understand this is a Mexican restaurant but one can have stuff better than corona in a bottle.I doubt this review will hurt this place as its popularity will carry it for awhile but they should think about using all their space so peope do not have to wait.  Their main dining room was packed but a large group area was completely empty.  It would require some people to eat family style though it seemed like there was enough large groups that could have taken over most of the tables.Overall I would rather have eaten at one of the many blockheads in the city than come here as gotten past point when need to impress people by going to a place that is only skin deep.  I should have given this place one star as expect much more when spending over 100 for a dinner for two but as mentioned the food was atleast passable and our server was nice.",0,1,0,Bryan C.,"Hoboken, NJ",179,395,788
1.0,7/29/2014,"In a city chalk-full of amazing restaurants, this place is a complete disaster. I haven't had service this bad in over ten years. To start, my table reservation, on a Tuesday night, was 45 minutes delayed. While I snagged a cocktail table at the bar area, not a waiter to be seen. I fought my way to the bartender only to be told I had to order from a waiter. Thirty minutes later still no luck. Complained to the host and was given the cold shoulder.  Finally, after 45 minutes was seated. Sat at our table and we quickly ordered appetizers, starving. One of the apps didn't show up and we had to remind them to bring it out. Then, after twenty minutes we reminded our waitress that we hadn't been poured any water and no one had taken our dinner order. For the price point we paid for very mediocre Mexican food, I **definitely** expected better service. For $15-17 tacos, overpriced $28-48 Tex-Mex entrees, and crappy flavorless guacamole, I expect flawless execution. There are no less than 500 trendy (and fun hip) Mexican restaurants in Manhattan that are worth going to over this bridge & tunnel -frequented spot.",1,0,0,C K.,"New York, NY",0,4,0
1.0,7/29/2014,"I'm giving this one star because of the lack of customer service in the main part of the restaurant. The male and female hostesses need to be trained because my friends and I experienced overt discrimination and were not seated even though we had a reservation. We had a reservation that we were on time for on Saturday however they claimed that were were 20 minutes late. I showed them the open table confirmation but they refused to acknowledge it or address it. The man behind the desk then said we may like the cafe more because we were ""dressed"" for that location more so than the restaurant which was quite a scene.  Note to readers--I noticed a woman who was seated because she was wearing the same dress as me. We were a party of 4 decided to just go with it because we were looking forward to catching up rather than dealing with loud wannabe socialites. I have sent a letter to the management because that type of service is just unacceptable. During the evening we asked to speak to a manager three times but no one ever came over to speak with us. We decided to still have dinner at Bodega Negra because my friends and I were more concerned with catching up than dealing with snobby restaurant staff. The blessing in disguise was the mistreatment because the cafe was not noisy, the service was superb, and the atmosphere was more our speed--we didn't need to scream to hear each other and fun maxi dresses were appropriate. The food was delicious. The grilled corn, kale taco, & grilled fish tacos were my favorites. My only advice to the management would be to train their employees to check the attitude at the door because restaurants with a lot of attitude don't establish the respect for long term success in NYC because in the end it's about quality of food and service.

3.0,7/25/2014,"I recently checked this place out. It's got a sexy vibe and look, that's for sure. As I was exploring the environs, I found a credit card on the floor and, since all the nearby staff happened to be busy, I walked over and gave it to the bartender saying ""I hope they didn't leave...here.""It was so loud in there I guess he thought I said ""hoping for a good drink this eve...here"", because he asked would I like to try one of their signature margheritas. That struck me as so friendly he would offer me a taste while I was waiting for my table. But I was shocked that he gave it to me in a full size glass! I did as I thought would only be responsive to his gesture and downed it with only a few gulps. He looked a bit surprised as, not skipping a beat, I proclaimed it one of  the tastiest I'd ever had!He asked if I wanted to try the (some indiscernible name). A strong bite of tequila was then to go down my gullet at an even faster pace. It was refreshing!These generous tastings continued, as I started to feel the effects. At some point a waiter came over to me bearing a plate of small tacos. He put it right down next to me as he said ""These are some of our best"". In hindsight, he may have said ""That's for another guest"". I just assumed it was another form of lagniappe and hungrily downed these tiny bites. Tasty!In any event, the tequila was getting to me on two fronts and I went searching for the men's room and some relief. Staff members were ready with an intricate set of directions on how to get there and I recall suggesting they give patrons a map. In a bit of a haze, I finally found the bathroom. I have to say, these new chic bathrooms are a bit too much. First off, it was extremely small, with absolutely no lighting. I remember that there was a broom and a mop in there too, in addition to the urinal...which seemed to be little more than a bucket. Fine for a man, but I can't see how a woman would have fared as well. As I exited the tiny room, I was greeted with some very strange looks by other patrons...but perhaps they were foreigners, not used to these chic hideaway bathrooms.I have to agree with the other reviewers regarding the dark lighting (read: barely any light)...yes, la bodega es muy negra! This helps explain why, as I reentered the dining area, I tripped over the leg of one table, tumbling into oncoming tables of diners. Before I could right the ship I had done a face plant into one table's quacamole...and I concur with other reviewers that the quac is quite good (while I prefer a bit more spice). However, the $15 charge seems excessive...that is until I recalled the mega drought that has happened. Other reviewers mentioned the guac comes with jicama for dipping. I can't confirm this, as I only removed tortilla chips stuck to my face, no jicama at all, but the chips were just fine.I picked myself up and apologized to the laughing party of youth & all seemed forgiven as the thought of drought sent me back to the safe confines of my bar stool.Finally a manager came over to introduce himself...a nice gesture. He also introduced some security staff from upstairs. As he emphatically wished me get home safe, I insisted that I had yet to try any of the establishments desserts. He instructed a server to get me ""a slice of tres leches to go"", mumbling something about a small price to pay. (Come to think of it, I don't remember paying them a cent.).I found the security to be quite friendly...they were also adept at supporting my back and shoulders as I received what I can only categorize as ""a gold glove send-off"". While I've never allowed ratings of security to affect my yelp ratings, I'll admit it does here!A final point: some yelpers indicate the place is pricey...but I found it quite affordable.All in all, I'd call it a remarkable visit to the Bodega!",0,2,1,Big Easy K.,"New York, NY",6,91,34

We were literally the only 2 on a Thur night. Place started filling around 715.. Even if I could have had a 645 res I would've felt better. Ok food:We had the guac.. didn't get the skull.. not sure why. Didn't ask. Maybe they don't do it. It was good. Not worth the cash though but good. Got a 2nd helping of chips free. We had the ribs.. which were ok but messy and greasy... had good flavor.We had the tacos.. for those of you who said pork belly was good. OMG it ruined my night! So fatty and greasy.. left a bad taste in my mouth. Just BAD! Never again...I had some chicken dish.. I forget the name.. but its small and comes on 3 chips.. basically shredded chicken. It was good. Juicy.We had the Don Huevo for desert.. again.. I just don't get why people like this! Big deal the chocolate melts..What was inside was a pile of chocolate MUSH! Yes MUSH... It just felt as if it all just melted WAY too fast.. as if it was left out for 30 min.. but really was just 30 seconds.. Melted icecream.. couldn't even taste it. Just BAD.Overall I won't be back.

2.0,6/16/2014,"Our reservation was on Saturday May 31st at 6:45 PM for 5 people. We came to Bodega Negra for a friend's birthday dinner.On our way to the restaurant we found out the 5th person in our party was going to be late so when we got there at 6:48 PM, we expressed this to the hostess at the stand and asked her if it would be okay to seat us anyway. The manager was standing right next to her said they could seat us right away but we only had the table until 8:15 PM. We were all a little taken aback about the time limit we were given for our dinner, so the birthday girl asked if this was standard procedure, to which the manager said yes.We decided to just go with it and the hostess showed us to our table. The restaurant is decorated very nicely, although, a little dark for my preference. Since a 7 PM dinner in NYC is a little early, there were only two other tables seated next to us at the time, both with parties of 6. Everything started off smoothly, we ordered drinks and some apps. We were trying to wait before ordering more food because the 5th person in our party still hadn't shown up. The waiter then comes by and tells us that since we have a time limit and need to be out by 8:15 we should order now. This proceeded throughout the entire meal. We were constantly reminded that we needed to leave by 8:15 and rushed through ordering and dinner. Eventually the birthday girl had enough and asked the waiter if all the other tables had a time limit as well, to which he responded no, only if they arrived late to their reservation. We arrived 3 minutes after our reservation time....We asked to speak to the manager and he basically said that every table had a time limit and it wasn't just us. When we asked about the two tables next to us who had been there before us and were still there, he said the table had more people so they had a longer time. 6 people vs. 5 people.....anyways,the manager just brushed us off with an disingenuous apology. We finished the rest of our meal and were out by 8:15. The waiter did try to apologize about our situation and commented on ""what an awkward position he's put in"". If you feel so awkward, then maybe you should stop reminding us over and over again about our time limit. Just a thought. Oh, and after we finished our dessert at 8:08 (after we spoke to the manager) the waiter asked if we wanted anything else, any coffee or tea....no thanks.Besides the terrible service, the food was actually very good. We ordered:1. Pitcher of margarita: good, nothing special.2. Guacamole: good, but nothing special.3. Grilled corn salad: one of our favorite dishes of the night. Loved the corn combined with mint.4. Quesadilla Rustica: amazing, it's got a little kick to it which we loved5. Veggie Tacos: not sure, I didn't have any of this dish but my friends said it was good6. Chicken Tostaditas: amazing as well7.

5.0,5/29/2014,"Upscale Mexican is an exploding category nowadays, so it takes more and more to stand out. Bodega Negra is a noteworthy addition to the crowded field. Tucked away deep in the bowels of the downtown Dream Hotel, the restaurant is aesthetically pleasing and lovingly decorated like the storage vaults of a destileria. My only criticism is it is a bit *too* dark (even menus hard to read). That being said, it's a fun night out environment also suitable for a date. Menu is outstanding, if not exceptionally deep. You'll see standard fare here, such as guacamole (solid, although not the super-spicy I like. Big ups for jicama as a dipping vehicle), quesadillas and tacos. You'll also see authentic home style fare like chile relleno (outstanding) and modern fare for people who lean more conservatively (grilled salmon). My faves are the lobster tostada and virtually all of the specialty tacos. Having sampled the entire collection, I recommend the Peking duck and pork belly varietals. Thank me later. Also noteworthy is the specialty cocktail list, which features a deep tequila and mezcal list, in addition to wine and mostly Mexican beer. Prices are actually pretty reasonable, particularly versus local competition like las Cenitas.Tip: Melvyn's, the co-located juice bar in the hotel, shares the kitchen with Bodega. You can order some of the taco dishes at the juice bar. Comes in handy if you want to sample the fare and can't get a Rez or want something more informal.",1,0,0,Chris X.,"New York, NY",5,91,3

We were told by our friendly waitress that all the entrees are shareable since they are tapas style. There were four us so we started off with the guacamole which was one of the best we have ever had (hands down). Then we ordered the honey maple glazed ribs, the chicken tostadas and the skirt steak tacos and the quesadilla rustica. All of the entrees we ordered were so filling and every bite was tasteful. You can taste the freshness in every bite. The meats are well marinated (chicken and steak) and the cheeses used on the quesadilla are very distinct, full of various flavors. To wash down the food, I ordered the guava margarita. It was great. Very sweet and smooth! For dessert we had the tres leches, which was okay, but the Don Huevo deserves it's own paragraph. We ordered TWO Don Huevos since we had read the reviews on here and it looked like a must try. The presentation is different and something that I have never seen. I like that the caramel sauce gets poured on the white chocolate ball which after being melted has a delicious, finger-linking good molten cake in the middle.

I called at 6pm to make a reservation and couldn't get in until 11:30pm. For an appetizer we enjoyed the guacamole, which was amazing. They didn't overdo it with 'special' ingredients like some restaurants do and the corn tortillas served with them were the icing on the cake. For dinner my date and I shared the special - shrimp & scallop tacos - and the grilled fish taco. Both tacos were great, however the shrimp & scallop tacos were breathtaking!!! Seasoned to perfection and not messy at all. BEWARE that the tacos are pretty small so if you're really hungry you may want to do 2 orders of the tacos per person - 2 tacos per order. I did think it was kind of expensive. The 2 small tacos were $15. The guacamole was $15. The patron magheritas were $15. However if you egg an entree it can run you $30 to $70.

We were the FIRST table to arrive, so that rubbed me the wrong way a little bit.  We got over the awkwardness of a 100% empty room with a cute circular table in the corner.  Guac is a must, and I liked the variety of margaritas.  The Spiced Celery sour was my fave, and the rest of the crew really liked the Blood & Fire.  What was weird, though, was a friend asked the waitress for a recommendation - and she just refused to provide one.  She said she liked something fruity but not too sweet, and the waitress was like ""umm...well....i'm not sure what to tell you, because I don't know which one you're going to enjoy...."" It was super awkward.  Anyway, as far as the food goes, the guac was solid.  We had that, a ceviche, and a variety of tacos.  The grilled fish taco was an absolute winner - I believe it was a sea bass that night, and there was some element of caramelization that made it sweet and delicious in addition to fresh.  Carnitas were a little dry - grilled corn salad was spicy and good.Our wait staff switched something like 5 times, and they kept trying to take plates before people were finished eating.  All in all - the food was good, but I wouldn't go crazy over knocking this one off your to-do list.",5,1,3,Emily R.,"Manhattan, NY",452,361,4

This is something interesting to see definitely. Ceviche - yellowtail ceviche was definitely sub par; yellowtail is a creamy fish to begin with and extra coconut cream did not help; not enough acidity to also penetrate through the raw fish; it was too fishy for my taste (from a guy who eats raw fish all the time, this was not properly prepared); best part of this dish is actually the plantain chips; nice and crispy.Bodega Guacomole - excellent starter for the table and the spiced radish slices were interesting; this was probably the best deal in this place in my opinion.Crispy Pork Belly - not cripsy and mushy actually from drowning in the sauce. what is up with that? This one tasted just like the grilled octopus with chorizo taco. Must have used the same sauce in both dishes.Tacos - Peking duck tacos and grilled octopus with chorizo tacos were both just average. It tasted like over seasoned bbq meat. It was too salty and not enough natural flavor of the meat itself. And it is tiny like mini-taco tiny.I am not sure if I want to try this place again. I grew up in Jersey City, visited many South American countries and living in West New York has really made me appreciate Latin cuisine. This is just another over priced hyped restaurant that has good decor but not enough taste and flavor.",2,0,0,Mark R.,"Los Angeles, CA",242,512,1298
5.0,3/24/2014,Great vibe! Loved the bar area and it's not sceney like the other meat packing places. Definitely recommend this place again,1,0,0,Amisha P.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",25,30,3
4.0,3/23/2014,"Very cool vibe and great food and drinks. Based on our group's experience and the other reviews, it sounds like they're still working out the kinks of their seating. We had a reservation for 7, but were told our table wasn't ready when we arrived. After waiting for about 30 minutes, we were escorted to our table, but it wasn't set for the number of people in our party. We went back to the bar while they re-set the table and then were finally escorted to our table.Seating issues aside, this place is really great. Decor is dark with lots of skulls and a very ""Dia de Muertos"" vibe-- very different from any other Mexican restaurant I've been in. The guac was good (nothing special, though the skull bowl it's served in is pretty cool) and the quesadilla rustica, while delicious, felt a little out of place, being that it was more of a pizza than a quesadilla. The steak tartar flautas were delicious, and the warm egg yolk sauce that accompanied them was on point. The lobster tostaditas were perhaps a little too wet for their chips, because the lobster mix left the chips underneath a little soggy. The warm corn salad was fresh and well-balanced, the yellowtail ceviche was amazing, and I really liked that they served it with fried plantain chips.We were stuffed from dinner, but I'm glad we splurged on dessert anyway because the Don Huevo is not to be missed. They bring out a giant white chocolate sphere with a chocolate mustache on it, and then they drizzle warm caramel sauce over top of the sphere while it melts into the bowl, revealing the cake inside. Obviously the presentation here is the showstopper, but the cake itself is rich and sweet and didn't disappoint.While pricey, Bodega Negra packs a punch.",1,0,0,Carolyn B.,"Chicago, IL",378,56,0
3.0,3/15/2014,"More than anything I thought the drinks were good. They have a very comprehensive Tequila bar with some of my favorites. The cocktails were all very good. The food was also pretty good, the empanadas with short rib, lobster, and tacos were great for sharing. I just thought the guac could have been served in a dish more condusive to sharing.All in all a good place, food was good but I'd go for cocktails.",0,0,0,Ian C.,"Alameda, CA",314,387,407

4.0,3/12/2014,"It was easy to get a Friday 6pm reservation for 4 last week-I found that pleasantly surprising, especially for this new place that had a lot of momentum in its favor already, from what I had heard. I loved the warm and intimate decor, and the entire staff was exceptionally good-looking; not surprising, but noticeable nonetheless. There was a great cocktail selection.Our server was very knowledgeable, and had a great sense of humor. The food selection was good-we started with the guacamole, which was delicious, but nothing particular or special. It's hard to mess up guacamole, and it really was good, so we polished that off pretty quickly. There were several main-menu options for those who don't eat meat. While I ordered the veggie tacos, my husband had the peking duck tacos, and my cousins ordered the lamb barbacoa taco and corn salad. The portions were small for the price, but tasty. We ordered the tres leches for dessert, which was good, too. I would recommend Bodega for a nice romantic dinner or a chill evening with friends.You will have a great experience from start to finish. I subtracted a star only because of its price. Don't go too hungry, unless you're prepared to spend a lot.",0,0,0,Chi M.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,59,0

5.0,3/5/2014,"Compared to the several other flashy hotel restaurants in Meatpacking with similar incredibly expensive menus and sceney atmospheres, this newest addition is definitely a 5-star experience.If you don't feel like reading on to find out why I think so, just check out this video I shot of the coolest dessert ever, the Don Huevo, which alone is worth coming here for: instagram.com/p/lD4BsQip…As for the rest of the menu, on first glance it seemed almost interchangeable with the very underwhelming La Cenita, which also opened nearby fairly recently. This had me a bit skeptical and worried that this would be another $100+ disappointing meal, but it happily turned out to be a $100+ satisfying and enjoyable meal.Even though we didn't order any of the entrees, which were all quite pricey, we still dropped a pretty penny on a bunch of the smaller things:- Bodega Guacamole ($15)It really stings to pay so much for some guac and average chips, but that's what you get in this neighborhood. This one was more about the presentation - the long, thin chips overflowing vertically out of a cylindrical container, and the guacamole served in a translucent skull bowl. Pretty cool. Not the best chips & guac, but a fun choice to start.- Braised Oxtail Empanadas ($14 for 4)These were pretty tasty, as long as you like the fried empanada casing. They were light on the oxtail, with a very thick, puffy empanada batter surrounding them, which made them a bit bland, but not bad.- Chicken Tostaditas ($12 for 3)This was easily the best starter. You get 3 little tostaditas, which consist of a small, round, very crispy tortilla chip, with a generous mound of chicken piled on top. The juicy chicken was delicious, along with the queso fresco and red onions on top.- Pinto Beans & Chorizo ($8)- Green Rice ($8)When you look at it that way, you realize you just paid $16 for rice & beans, and really feel like a sucker. Fortunately, they were at least good, the beans piping hot with a nice meaty flavor from the chorizo, and the rice interesting and different from the usual yellow variety.- Skirt Steak Tacos ($13 for 2)- Peking Duck Tacos ($14 for 2)These were both very tasty, but when compared to the great new tacos that are all the hype these days, these are nowhere near as good as the ones at places like Mission Cantina and Otto's Tacos. The steak and the duck in both were excellent, juicy and delicious, but the tortillas were forgettable.- Tres Leches Cake ($12)This was an excellent rendition of tres leches. I typically see this cake in small, short slices, so I was surprised to see this beautiful, very tall slice with multiple layers. For this reason probably, it was not quite as soaked in milk and soft as usual, but it still had an excellent taste and was actually a bit denser, which I loved.- Don Huevo ($12)Though the tres leches was excellent, if you can only bear to get one dessert, this is the one you must get. As mentioned above, this was one of the coolest desserts I've ever seen, and also happened to be really delicious. If you think it's cool when they flame your baked Alaska tableside and you enjoy taking pictures of that, then this will really amaze you.As the waitress set the plate down, which has a massive, perfect sphere of white chocolate, along with a chocolate mustache adorning it, she let us know we should take a picture or video of what was going to happen next. She then proceeded to pour a carafe of hot caramel sauce all over the sphere, causing it to slowly melt away and decompose poor Don Huevo. It was amazing to see the white chocolate fall apart to reveal the beautiful molten chocolate cake inside, with a little scoop of horchata ice cream on top. That cake inside would have been a tasty enough dessert on its own, but the huge amount of white chocolate and the whole spectacle really make this one of the few items here where you really get your money's worth. Even if you don't want to shell out the money for a full meal here, you should at least come for dessert and order this.In addition to the satisfying food, even the atmosphere is much better than the other places around here. It's nice and dark, which is fairly typical, but instead of a lot of untz-untz and top 40 jams, they were playing some really chill Spanish music, which actually goes a log way in making it feel a lot better than some of the tacky Meatpacking restaurants. The service was also excellent and way better than similar huge places packed with tons of tables. We received plenty of attention when needed and everybody was very friendly.While better food and much better value can be found elsewhere, this is indeed as good as it gets for a Meatpacking hotel restaurant.",24,8,12,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834

The ambiance is energetic and fun, food was so good the yellowtail ceviche was out of this world, the bartender wad very nice and attentive.

2.0,2/11/2014,"I wish I could give 0 stars but the food was really good so I am giving it 2 stars.I hate giving bad reviews. But when we were treated the way we were at the place, we felt  purely invisible, I had to write this. My husband and I stayed at the Dream hotel last night and decided to eat at this hotels restaurant. The fact that you are spending a pretty penny at the hotel to eat dinner at one of the hotels restaurants you expect to be treated like a customer and not like pure disgrace.   We walked in at 9:20 on a Monday night.  The place was super busy. The hostess asked us if we had a reservation, it being a Monday night we did not realize we would need a reservation. So she told us that at 10:00 a table would be ready. We told her we would sit by the bar we sat at a seat across from the bar.   This seating was weird because they put 2 bar stools which people were sitting at in front of seating to use as a table where others who were sitting where we were were placing their food and drinks on an uneven bar stool.  Which I thought was gross and odd. There were 2 other seating areas near the bar which both were getting service to their tables full service. As in drinks and food.  So my husband and I sat there waiting for a server to take our drink order.   We waited and kept waiting. The manager passed us a good 5 times and a number of servers passed us probably 10 times each server.  The manager was even mingling with the other 2 tables which were next to us. As we sat there ignored with nothing at our table. We tried to get servers attention but were ignored.   Literally after about 30 MINUTES of waiting for a server to help us and literally appalled and ready to leave at 9:45 at night, my husband went back up to the hostess and said something. He was in no way nasty. He just stayed we have been sitting there for 30 min and have not gotten service.  The hostess responded with well you have to go to the bar and get a drink.  Mind you everyone else who was next to us across from the bar I was getting fully served food and drinks. My husband proceeded to tell her that everyone else was getting served who was sitting near us but us. He asked her if she could send a server by us.She never listened because after another 10 min no one came and being 2 feet next to the hostess stand we knew she didn't tell anyone.  Finally we somehow got a severs attention and were taken our order.  Which took another 15 min to get. Totally not the servers fault since they had him waiting on the bar section and the opposite side of the restaurant.  At this point it was after 10. And I could see behind me that there were a few empty tables. One of which was empty for about 20 min.  Finally at 10:20 we were told we would be seated. Of course this was at the table that was empty and cleared off for 20 min.   Why not sit us as soon as the table was ready because we were already really annoyed.  Our waitress was very sweet.  She said she saw us sitting at the bar for a real long time.  Which makes me wonder, if servers saw us sitting there with not a menu or drink in hand why did not one person take action and ask us if we needed anything?! She did however take my husbands drink away, which was still half full.  Which he said something about and she brought him a new one on the house (after he complained).  He did say his drink was really good too.  The manager who ignored us a few times prior did come and ask us how everything was.  Which we totally wanted to say terrible but it just wasn't worth it.  We think she was all the sudden being friendly because the owner was  2 feet from us eating.  I just didn't get how she didn't ask us how everything was when we were sitting at the bar for an hour with not a drink or menu in our hand, and then suddenly she cared.  Other then this disgrace of service and the ignoring factor which made us feel like crap the food was great.  We had the guacamole and pork belly apps. Which were both great.  We had lamb and steak tacos which were also good as well.  We had a lobster app (not sure what it was called) which was delicious it was on a chip and very good! The decor is pretty cool and it has a cool vibe to it.  I will say the chairs are all different which was weird. It didn't match the decor.  They had some Mexican inspired chairs mixed with a couple of chairs that look like they were picked up off the street. Which didn't go with their decor.  Same thing with their plates. Their service and management needs to change. My husband works in the business and is very understanding about things however customers should never ever be ignored, especially for almost an hour.  After a while we were purely laughing at how terrible it was that we were just ignored the entire time. We may not have spent a lot but a littler under $200 is a lot and they should value and treat us like they want us to come back. We will not be coming back, Do yourself a favor and stay away.",9,0,0,Alissa M.,"Wayne, NJ",23,54,0
