5.0,4/29/2019,"We waited for about 20 mins to be seated on a Saturday noon, which is not bad. We have a group of 4 so we ordered 4 breakfast dishes. All 4 dishes are delicious. Their salmon eggs Benedict is comparably small but tastes very good. I love their French toast and waffles too. Omelette is just average. Overall a really nice place for a brunch on relaxing weekend.",0,0,0,Jiangyi C.,"Chinatown, Washington, DC",2,15,50
3.0,4/14/2019,"First time here at Sarabeth's. I came on 4/14 at around 2pm. Was looking for a good brunch spot after church with my friend, she suggested Serefina but my gps accidentally took me here. We were starving so we decided to stay.Very Nice ambiance, seating inside and outside which was nice. We decided to sit outside. Out wait time for two was about 5 minutes which was good. The host wasn't very welcoming nor greeted us when we initially came in. I gave 3 stars solely because of the server and his service. I didn't catch his name because his interaction with us was very minimal, but he was a Caucasian male with a semi bald head, he hair on his sides. Food was very good, I ordered a almond crusted French toast with a side of home fries & avocado. My friend ordered the big fluffy French toast and a side of eggs scrambled with cheese. They are pretty pricey here, so make sure if you're not trying to spend a little probably should try somewhere else. For a side of two eggs it was $10. Nonetheless the food was great.Now. Back to the service. Our server for one took a bit long to get us, I was a server for over 5 years so I'm pretty understanding of how it feels to be a overwhelmed server. He did stop and tell us he was going to be right with us. Which was fine. When he got to us my friend was ready to order but I asked for his opinion on two options, (French toast and salmon Benedict) he assumed I wasn't ready since I asked for his recommendation and told me what he likes salmon and very fast said I'll give you guys another minute since you're not ready and sped off before I could say we were actually ready. Food came out in a timely manner. However I had asked for him to bring pepper, I never got it.I couldn't help but notice his interaction with the party behind us. It was a large party with about 8 or 9 people celebrating a little girls birthday. He was very interactive with the table, extremely polite, didn't appear to be in a rush. But whenever he got to us it was very rushed and spoke very fast as if he wanted to spend the minimal time with our table. He NEVER checked on us after we got our food from the first time. He never brought my pepper. & he never brought our check until I had to ask another server. He ended with dropping the check at the table without saying a word and picking it back up to swipe our cards and dropped it back off without saying a word either. I tried to think of why we could possibly be getting treated like this, initially I would just assume that was his servicing style of minimal conversation until I saw how overly friendly he was with the table behind us (a completely Caucasian table) & believe me I'm one of those people who hates when people of color try to bring race into any and every thing but that's literally the only difference between us and the table behind us.Other than this terrible server. FOOD AND AMBIANCE WAS GREAT. Might come again, not sure though.",0,0,0,Tiffany M.,"East Bronx, NY",26,21,25

2.0,3/29/2019,"An average breakfast place. It was the kind of meal you say ""meh"" about. The lemon ricotta pancakes had the texture of buttermilk pancakes (where I personally like a more textured ricotta pancake) and the lemon flavor had a very subtle taste, so subtle you could barely taste it. Their popular muffins were average--they would've been better if served warm and they were very small. One good thing is that they served a lot of bacon with their side of bacon. I wouldn't come here again, as there are better bakeries around here.",0,0,0,Abbey P.,"Highland Park, Los Angeles, CA",2,12,8

Sure enough, we arrived at the restaurant and, after some time, were seated at the window. The food and coffee came quickly. I ordered almond crusted French toast, which was unique and delicious. I couldn't even finish the whole thing. My aunt also ordered French toast, and my cousin had a muffin and eggs.

5.0,2/16/2019,We made reservations here for brunch on a Friday morning and we were glad we did. It was packed! We had a table of 5 and we each got something different. My cousin and I split an order of the lemon ricotta pancakes and the traditional eggs benedict. Other people at the table ordered french toast and pancakes. Everyone left very happy after their meals. The prices were a little high in my opinion but you definitely get quality with the prices.

4.0,1/29/2019,"One of the best NYC brunch spots so it's filled with a lot of tourists and locals too. They have a few different locations in the city and sell their products such as jams and baked goods too.Surprisingly, the food is good for a touristy place. They are known for the egg benedict. I'm usually not a fan of hollandaise sauce since I find it a bit heavy but sarabeth delivers an excellent egg benedict that's not overdone.

3.0,1/17/2019,"Just thought I'd give this place a try. It's wasn't bad, but it wasn't mind blowing.  Coffee for $5 - take a pass. Small cup and no refill and was kind of weak. The Four Flowers Juice - now that was really good. Food - the crabmeat guaco and chips was really yummy.  Seafood Cobb salad was not my favorite (I know my seafood) - will not get it next time. Chef's Burger was pretty good. Chicken ciabatta sandwich was ok.  Chicken needed seasoning. Short rib hash was pretty good.  Service was so so. Maybe because they were busy?  Table next to us came in first. We were almost finish before they got their food.  Not sure if I'll be back.",1,0,0,Jennifer F.,"Indianapolis, IN",1,21,74
3.0,1/12/2019,"Food was OK - but a bit overpriced and my goat cheese and spinach omelet was under seasoned and a bit bland.

5.0,12/31/2018,"I had not been to Sarabeth's West location in a few years but went a couple of weeks ago with friends, and I was not disappointed. I always like Sarabeth's for the great quality of food and the selections. I feel like they might have scaled down the dinner menu a little bit from what I remember, but I had one of the specials and it was truly delightful. Service was top-notch, and the ambience of the restaurant is very peaceful if you want to have actual conversation your dining table. It did bother me that I couldn't get some of their preserves with my bread, because that's one of my fave reasons for visiting (they said they don't serve jam at dinner). Other than that I was very very happy with this and will definitely go back again, probably earlier in the day though so I can get my jam!",1,0,1,Dove C.,"New York, NY",948,101,32
3.0,12/7/2018,"This review is for Dinner only. We wandered upon this on a Friday night mainly because it wasn't all that busy and we were looking for a relaxing atmosphere. We were promptly seated and given a bread basket. The biscuits were very good and the servers were very friendly and helpful.However the food was okay at best. I ordered the salmon and it was a bit overcooked but I initially boiled that down to ordering it medium well. However, my boyfriend had the burger as rare and it was almost burnt. We could have certainly had a better prepared meal for less than what we paid at Sarabeths. I've been to other Sarabeths in the area it does a much better brunch than it does dinner. I would recommend making a reservation for brunch to really enjoy what this restaurant does best.",2,0,0,Grace L.,"New York, NY",168,16,12
5.0,12/6/2018,"Sarabeth's came highly recommended by a friend, so I decided to check it out on my recent trip to New York. I must say, I was NOT disappointed. I was expecting to wait a long time for a table, but we were seated within a matter of minutes. I ordered the salmon benedict, lemon ricotta pancakes, and of course a mimosa. The mimosa was strong - just the way I like it! I think it's safe to say that this was one of my top 5 favorite salmon benedicts I've ever had, which is a bold statement because I've probably tried about 50+ benedicts. I usually never order pancakes, but the lemon ricotta pancakes were phenomenal! To top it all off, the service was great. The place was totally packed and our server still managed to do an amazing job. I'll be sure to stop by next time I fly across the country. I highly recommend this place for brunch!",0,0,0,Audrey M.,"San Jose, CA",163,225,259

4.0,12/4/2018,"Ahhhh Sarabeth's! I've been dying to get here for about a year. Finally made it on Saturday (12.1.2018) with my family after we had a great day at the museum and Central Park. We sat for a late lunch but really wanted dinner so we ordered off the late lunch menu while waiting. When my family and I dine out we spare no expense. We love good food and even better service. First waiter was a bit of a douche all because he didn't hear my aunt say she wanted ice on the side. She didn't make a big deal out of it because it wasn't but he seemed to have quite the attitude. And it was such a bother for him, as a server, to take the drink back. He walked off angrily while shaking his head. Like really?!!! He brought back the new drink and slammed it hard enough on the table that some of it spilled over. Very rude and completely unnecessary. I mean we were a party of 5 and three of the people were senior citizens. How disrespectful. I immediately made it clear to his manager that I didn't want him serving us anymore. Our new server Fernando was amazing- so nice and made sure we had everything we needed. Which got him his $95 tip. It was well deserved.  Other than that idiot the food was great. But I mostly likely won't go back to that location.",1,0,1,Tavia N.,"Brooklyn, NY",529,23,43

1.0,11/17/2018,"This place is joke- horrible horrible staff. Their manager and hostess should be no where near the hospitality industry. The manager, who's bald with glasses, gossiped about the customer and laughed about in front of customers- what a joke. The hostess, who had big curly hair, is even worse. She's obnoxious and acts entitled. It's obvious that she sees herself as superior to others, she too gossips about customer in front of others. I heard her talking about something in our party and I stepped in and she was rattled. She is the opposite of a person you want in restaurant- crap-talking customers in front of them. She should be promptly fired along with the manager. Don't go here, a true crap hole because of their immature staff. I wish I could give zero stars.",1,2,1,Charlie M.,"Larchmont, NY",4,49,15

3.0,11/11/2018,"Came here for brunch with a friend and I was a bit overwhelmed at how many people were in the restaurant standing, waiting to be seated. It was way too crowded and I made reservations and still had to wait a good while. After 20 minutes, we were finally seated and we were starving. We knew exactly what we wanted. I had the eggs Benedict with a side of truffle fries, he had the turkey burger and we shared the fat and fluffy French toast. I liked my eggs although I was only able to eat one. The English muffin was a bit too thick for me. I wasn't so crazy about the Canadian bacon. He enjoyed his turkey burger. And we both absolutely loved the French toast. It took a while for the food to come, maybe about another 20 minutes. The price was a bit expensive and I can't say it was worth it, it was pretty average. I think I would come back to have only the French toast again.",2,0,1,Lily F.,"Brooklyn, NY",502,387,1172

I ate dinner with my coat on. Our waiter was the definition of obnoxious; he would balance plates on his head when taking orders and other cutsey tricks like that. He also managed to get our order wrong, the table next us had their order wrong, and my octopus came out cold.

My husband enjoyed the braised short rib hash which came with a choice of pastry; he opted for a croissant but it wasn't very good, cold and dry. Coffee was nice and strong.

3.0,9/16/2018,"I had lunch here a couple days ago. To start off as I was walking to the restaurant to meet my friend I got a message from Open Table that the restaurant had canceled my reservation. This was about 10 mins before my reservation. I told my friend to stop walking there since our reservation was canceled & that we needed to find a new restaurant. I called the restaurant anyway to ask them why my reservation was canceled. The manager picked up & said it was an error & that they would honor the reservation. I told him I would be there in couple of mins then. So my friend & I proceeded to go after all.First off when we got there I was expecting the manager to greet us & apologize for the mixup about the reservation, but that did not happen or happen at all.  Would've been a nice touch considering I had to call to have it rectified. My friend & I both ordered the 3 Course Prix Fixe Lunch. We both got the Velvety Cream of Tomato Soup, Jumbo Lump Crab Cake w/Watercress Salad, Cheesecake w/Sour Cherry Compote. I ordered a glass of Prosecco.The first course that came out was the soup. I had told my friend to order the soup because I had it before at Sarabeth's Central Park South & that it was amazing. Well the soup came out & it looked nothing like the one at the Central Park South location. The soup looked sloppy & some of it was on the rim of my bowl. I actually wiped it clean before my photos to make it look more presentable. The soup was not garnished like at the Central Park South location. That one had a drizzle of balsamic, cheese, chives & was impeccably presented. This was really sloppy & sad looking & did not taste anywhere close to the Central Park South one. Also when I asked for bread I told my friend that the other location presented a basket of very fancy breads, this location gave slices of poppy seed bread which was not fancy at all. While we were still finishing our soup our main course came out. There was no room on the table so I quickly finished my soup to make room for my main course. My friend couldn't finish fast enough so we managed to squeeze her entree in the middle of the table. I did not appreciate that they brought our main course out while we were both still working on our soups. The tables next to us were empty, they could've at least put the main courses on the tables next to us while we finished. When my friend did finish her soup, no one came to take away the empty soup bowl. We proceeded to eat our main course. The crab cake was ok but not impressive. I was not a fan of the watercress salad. The fries were decent. The waiter asked if I wanted another champagne I said no, but he left my empty glass on the table. He could have taken that away when I said I did not want another glass of it.Next course was the cheesecake. It was ok not great. All in all after going to Sarabeth's Central Park South location, this Sarabeth's was like the ugly stepchild. It was a big downgrade from the other location. I gave the other location 5 Stars.  I hope that they can strive for better presentation & service & use Sarabeth's Central Park South as an example.",0,0,0,Lil W.,"Queens, Queens, NY",1,24,115

The mimosa was a full glass and a small carafe of the extra. We ordered the short rib hash, French toast, garden omelette and oatmeal with apples. The short rib has was a pretty plate. 2 sunny side eggs over a the hash. The hash was 75% meat, 25% potatoes. The hash had nice flavor, and the meat was tender. The green tomatillo salsa was really good. Unfortunately I found the eggs to be under seasoned. The eggs were also over cooked on the bottom, brown and hard to cut. They pan might have been too hot. The French toast was served with bananas and strawberries. I think the bread was challah bread. My son really enjoyed this dish and he ate the whole thing. My wife had the garden omelette and she also said the eggs were under seasoned. The service was good though out the meal but when we finished the dirty dishes were left for a very long time.

4.0,6/18/2018,"As a part of my birthday weekend, my girlfriend's mom and her boyfriend popped up to treat us to brunch before a nice walk through Central Park! That is so sweet of them! Now, it wasn't a Boozy Brunch, but that's TOTALLY okay. It's totally normal to NOT drink with brunch. I bet you didn't know that! Lol, anyway, Sarabeth's is somewhere they've been before and told us we had to try. So here we are!Atmosphere/Appearance: I would describe Sarabeth's as a very mature and sophisticated restaurant. Leather wrapped chairs and benches comfort you as you dine throughout the elongated establishment. The lucky ones (us) get seated right in 1 of the 2 bay windows so we can people-watch while we eat! Fairly quiet inside and a nice place to relax.Service: It was okay. I expected better. Let me explain. Our server was great, don't get me wrong, but she was only great when she was around. Each of us ran out of water at some point or needed something to go with our meal and when we went to get her attention, she was gone. Then when we were trying to leave we waited at least a solid 10 minutes just to GET the bill after our table was cleared. I'm not sure if this is normal for this establishment, but it was a little bothersome. We were ready to leave and get out to enjoy the day, but we were held captive! Lol.Food: For my breakfast I landed on the Braised Short Rib Hash. It was a very tough choice because there were SO many good looking things on the menu, but I wanted something hearty. It's braised short ribs jumbled together with onions and some other ingredients topped with 2 fried eggs then served with a jalapeño tomatillo salsa. It was delicious and so savory. It comes with a choice of flavored muffin, scone or toast along with the legendary preserves that put Sarabeth's on the map. I had a blueberry muffin and with the orange preserves it created the perfect balance of sweet  + savory with my hash.Value: A little on the expensive side to be honest. We were considering getting a mimosa or 2, but at $14.00 PER mimosa or $44.00 for a carafe, they are TRIPPIN'. There are restaurants where I can get unlimited mimosas AND unlimited food for that price. I'm all set. Lol. My meal was $20.00. Eh, it's New York City, so I guess you could say it was worth it. Just be prepared to spend a little bit of money when you come.In conclusion I certainly enjoyed my experience at Sarabeth's. It's not MY type of restaurant, but it was definitely refreshing to eat somewhere new.",4,2,4,Eric W.,"Hartford, CT",1634,458,1029

But, once I was seated, I noticed the floor underneath the table was a complete mess. They also forgot to give me a menu so I sat another ten minutes waiting for someone to notice. Once I received a menu I could tell they were trying to rush me out. (Probably because I was a party of one.) The waiter was nice, and the Salmon Benedict was fine, but I was shocked that it was served to me in under three minutes. Makes me wonder if it was sitting under heat lamps in the kitchen.

The short ribs themselves I will dream about for times to come.  My friend had the classic Eggs benidect  and cleaned her plate.  Everything was fresh, flavor filled, and left you thinking of what you will have the next time you return.  If that weren't enough, the service was phenomenal.  I look forward to exploring more",1,0,0,Gara G.,"Bronx, NY",2,29,28

I also ordered the salmon benedict, which was good but not anything special. A friend of mine ordered the potato waffles and they were sooo good. Definitely get this if you decide to come here and like waffles. The reason I'm not giving this place 4-5 stars is for two reasons. The first reason is because the service was pretty slow and trying to flag down our server seemed almost impossible at times. It was pretty busy at the time, so I'm willing to give a pass on that one. The second reason is because I ordered an orange juice, which was not listed on the menu so therefore I assumed it would be the normal ~$3 for a glass. The orange juice was actually really good so I ended up getting a refill. When the check came, the two glasses of orange juice were listed at $17. I obviously assumed this was a mistake because who in the world charges $8.50 for a glass of orange juice?? I flagged down the server, which took a while, and asked her if this was some some sort of typo. She said no and walked away. So I ended up paying the price of an entree for two glasses of OJ. Price nowhere listed on the menu and no mention of how outrageously priced each glass is from our server.

We then got the lemon ricotta pancakes, the crisp potato waffles and a side of applewood smoked bacon. Food was wonderful. The lemon ricotta pancakes were very lemony but good. The waffles with apple sausage was a very interesting combination, but equally as good. Overall a great meal with great service.

I tried their take on eggs Benedict. It was not as good as the same dish from my local diner in NJ. More expensive too. Their side dish of spiced potatoes was bland and didn't taste freshly made. And coffee? In a city blessed with a Starbucks on every block, it's a wonder their cuppa is blah. My wife had a vegi frittata that she said was good. The muffin on the same plate needed work. It looked under baked and I snuck a crumb and it was doughy. The noise level is so high, conversation is difficult. But service is good - professional and efficient.

I guess it is like a brand that gets business because of name recognition. I was struck by how perfunctory most of the staff was. I didn't get a smile from my server until she brought the check. The hostess who appears to have a personality when she interacts with other staff members, didn't have one when I walked in. It may be an east coast thing, but it drives me crazy when I say, ""Thank you"" in a restaurant and the server or hostess says, ""It's not a problem"" or ""You're fine."" Sometimes I think maybe it is in response to the clientele, but I appreciate warmer service. Also, I was dining alone which for some reason seems to elicit less attention or hostility. This cracks me up because there are two women seated next to me who only ordered coffee and aren't having breakfast but everyone keeps checking in on them.

In the past, everything I've gotten here was flawless. I usually go for the eggs Benedict with Salmon. The hollandaise as I mentioned before is perfect - it is light, not too salty/overpowering and the eggs are perfectly poached. Unfortunately last time I came here - this past week for my birthday, I was a little disappointed with my order. I'm not sure whether it had something to do with coming here midweek, but everything was a bit off. The hollandaise was just OK and my eggs had a runny whites when cutting into them. We also got the chocolate truffle cake and the chocolate pudding. I was very happy with the chocolate pudding - it was very rich in flavor and had little toasted marshmallows on top. I would definitely NOT recommend the chocolate truffle cake. The cake is very dry and too sweet. Took a few bites and just left it there. Overall, will I come back?

Other people in our party had the farmer's omelette which was MUCH better than the pancakes and came with a muffin which was excellent.The tough thing about Sarabeth's is that it is obscenely expensive, even by New York City standards. There really isn't much that warrants the astronomical prices. The service was ok, but not excellent. I've been to a couple of the other Sarabeth's, and this one just doesn't impress.

I'm 8.5 months pregnant dining with my mother who has a severe back condition.  So when we were asked to sit at a tight corner with a cushy seat (one I used to love) and a regular chair, i very nicely requested a table with two regular chairs (and no cushy seat) a d explained the current physical condition as neither of us could comfortably sit on the cushy seats at this time. The hostess said  ""well the tables with only regular chairs seat four and you're only two""...it was an awkward moment considering there were only three other groups dining at the time (first thing in the morning on a monday) and at least ten open four seaters in a very spacious restaurant. I pointed out that there was no one here, and this is physically uncomfortable, so the hostess then walked us over to a four seater, clearly annoyed and walked away without saying a word after we had very nicely thanked her.  Just a terrible experience, feeling like an absolute burden in an empty restaurant while pregnant. THEN, we were asked if we wanted anything to drink. I normally get the coffee. But again, since I'm pregnant and avoiding too much caffeine I opted for the hot chocolate (first time for me). If was okay, not bad but not memorable.  Then the bill came - and it was freaking $8. Are you kidding me? For something not on the menu, that is complete fraud. I asked the waiter about it who said that yeah it is quite pricey and should be on the menu. He very kindly offered to have me speak with the manager. When the manager came she justified it saying it was Belgian chocolate and house made and therefore very expensive. I said well shouldn't all that be explained in the menu (including the price) -  she admitted it should have been...but didn't take any action on rectifying the situation. I asked if anything could be done now and she said ""well you did drink it, didn't you?"" So awkward.  Yes, but you tricked me into drinking bizarrely expensive hot chocolate. Good to know I should be very cautions before casually ordering a non alcoholic drink here. she took two dollars off the bill, which I guess was nice.

1.0,11/3/2016,Absurdly expensive for what should be classified as a $5 blue plate special. Cup of ok tomato soup and a so called adult grilled cheese NOT that they didn't take the time to melt the cheese all for a mere $17.50... shall I go on I shall. The grilled cheese was inedible when our server was informed he said no worries I'll take it off the check. Well I guess paying $13 for a cup of soup is worth the trip to Sara Beth's. Crab cake w Where's the crab! 4 of us totally disappointed especially after spending $120 for breakfast food.

My only complaint is the price, $14/Bloody Mary when other brunch spots are offering $30 for unlimited drinks and an entree makes drinking here not really worth it. And who doesn't want a Bloody Mary with their brunch? Same price for mimosas which is even more crazy unless they're using some seriously lux champagne!

4.0,10/29/2016,"The reviews do not lie.  I went here specifically for the lemon ricotta pancakes.  There were other restaurants that I had been to before this, which boasted the same thing on their menus, but I held out for this place and I'm so glad that I did.  The pancakes are deliciously light and fluffy and so moist from the ricotta.  Add some fresh berries, whipped butter and syrup and you are in pancake heaven.  They also give a relatively large portion, so going with a friend and sharing a few items is the best idea.Of course the rest of the menu looked delicious as well, but sadly, since this was a solo visit, I had to settle for the one dish -- IT WAS WORTH IT.  This location is a little small and like most NYC brunch joints, it gets pretty busy on the weekends.  I didn't have to wait too long and again, the LEMON RICOTTA PANCAKES - my mouth is watering just thinking about it.

All in all, we were pleased with the service and quality of the food.The restaurant has a lovely ambiance, our waitress was attentive and helpful and I appreciated the reasonable portion sizes - just the right amount of food so you don't over-eat and feel gross, or leave hungry and feel annoyed.We ordered the mussel entree as our appetizer- fabulous dish! Highly recommend.Then we split the Seafood Cobb Salad, Espresso BBQ Short Ribs and the Grilled Skuna Bay Salmon between us. They were terrific dishes, with mad love to the short ribs that fell off the bone and came with a great homemade apple sauce- delish, ya'll.The only downsides of the meal were the complimentary bread basket (for a place known for its baked goods, I was surprised that they arrived cold and were underwhelming) Also, the new dessert item, the S'more's In a Cup was really disappointing (a few toasted baby marshmallows in a mason jar of chocolate pudding, with maybe a teaspoon of graham cracker crumble) would not recommend and I would be shocked if it stays on the menu.I would definitely go to Sarabeth's UWS for a nice dinner out, and I really want to try their price fix menu for $25- seems like a great deal!",0,0,0,Elena K.,"Washington, DC",17,15,0

Other than that, our waiter was prompt to take our order and ask us around halfway how are meal was. 3 of us got the classic eggs Benny. The eggs were poached perfectly and the hollandaise had a nice tartness. It made for an okay eggs Benny...but not something I can't find at any other brunch place. For its price, nothing stood out to me. One of my friends got the crisp potato waffle. I got to try some and I can tell it was good. The waffle had a soft and chewy interior with a slight crisp exterior. The chicken and apple sausage complement the waffle really well for a savory aspect and the syrup added to the taste for a sweet finish.

2.0,7/9/2016,"As a diehard Gossip Girl fan, it may shock you to know that it took me this long to get to Sarabeth's.  This weekend, I decided to get in touch with my inner Waldorf and finally make an appearance at the chain's Upper West Side location.  I grabbed the Serena to my Blair, and we headed over.  We arrived around noon and there was a fifteen minute wait.  When we were seated, it took them over ten minutes to bring us menus and water.  I know they were really packed, but Sarabeth's is busy every weekend- it didn't seem like they were properly staffed.  We were starving so this was less than amusing.  Everyone who worked there seemed overwhelmed.  The outdoor area is right on top of the road and the tables are close together; definitely not the place for an intimate conversation.  My friend and I now know everything about the people at the two tables that were bookending us.  Also, the outdoor area was just kind of gross; there was some trash by our table even though the area is gated in.When our server finally came to take our order, things went a little more smoothly.  The food came out rather quickly.  I ordered the salmon eggs Benedict and my friend ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes.  We both really enjoyed our dishes.  The salmon eggs Benedict was good- the eggs were perfectly poached and the hollandaise sauce was flavorful.  The bread it came on wasn't exactly an English muffin but was very good.  The dish was pretty small though; I've been known to not finish my brunch dishes but I cleaned my plate here.  Also, for $19.50, I think that it's insane that the dish doesn't come with potatoes or coffee or anything.  I tried the lemon ricotta pancakes and they were great as well, but again, the portion was small.  I legitimately felt bad taking a piece from my friend because she finished the rest of the dish so quickly.  Again, $19 - and nothing with it.  All in all, for over $40 for brunch, we weren't that happy with the service nor the portion sizes.  While we both really enjoyed the food, we didn't think it was worth putting up with the less-than-desirable aspects of the place.  While I would be willing to try another location, I don't think I'll be back to the Upper West Side branch.Guess this is one review Blair & I differ on.  Well, you know you love me anyway.  XOXO, GG",3,0,1,Jenn P.,"Manhattan, NY",285,134,933

I would not bother waiting in long lines for brunch just to pay almost $20 for mediocre pancakes or eggs. You can get a better breakfast for 1/3 of the price at any diner. If you want something ""fancier"", there are a million other options in the neighborhood. The dinner options seem to be a little more reasonably priced but, again, the quality isn't great.

Everyone is beyond rude and unhappy to work there it seems! Our server literally disappeared for about 35 min! The table next to us said the same exact thing! I also noticed a table across from else so annoyed that they literally left with their plates completely untouched! Our food took over an hour to come to the table.

Only after an hour waiting the manager finally appeared and apologized. Once we got the food the toast was gross and not toasted. It was stale and old.The almond crusted French toast was literally French toast with almonds thrown on it. I sent it back and told the manager this was not how the menu presented it.

There was a side of pickles, cabbage slaw, sir kensington's ketchup (not as sweet as regular ketchup), and guacamole. It was plenty to fill me up. My friend ordered the crab cake benedict which looked super delicious even though I didn't try it.Overall, my experience at Sarabeth's was good but nothing extremely memorable.

I asked multiple times for a refill on my coffee and got just one refill... I'm sorry, but I need my coffee. I wouldn't go back here just based on the poor service I had.

2.0,3/6/2016,"In my opinion, this is one of the most over rated places in the city. I love brunch and quite honestly, I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to brunch; I love it all. I have been to this location twice and was really underwhelmed. I ordered a cheese omelette. It had very little flavor. I even found myself using ketchup to add flavor. And I am NOT a ketchup fan. Only toast comes with it if I recall so I had to order a side of potatoes. They were ok but certainly nothing special. Giving this place the benefit of doubt, I returned for brunch again and although I ordered pancakes this time around, everything was very mediocre. The food was edible but nothing at all special. I live nearby and always see people waiting outside for brunch and also at their other locations. There are many, many other GREAT options right around the corner.

The restaurant is comfortable and bright and service is fine. I ordered the goat's cheese and spinach omelet with a scone, OJ and coffee. How much wrong could that go? The scone is what I cannot get out of my mind and what has compelled me to write this review: It was terrible! I was like the Wonder Bread version of a scone: no texture, no nooks or crannies, very machine-made looking and tasteless. I couldn't believe that was supposed to be a scone. The omelet was ok, though all the cheese was scrunched into one part of it and there was just enough spinach to serve as spots of decoration on the outside of the egg. The orange juice was terrible: slightly bitter, definitely not fresh squeezed or grocery store quality OJ, but possibly Minute Maid from concentrate. Definitely tasted like a cheap concentrate. Coffee was adequate but shallow coffee cup meant it got cold quick. Would definitely not recommend this restaurant for the menu I ordered.",2,0,0,Karen M.,"New York, NY",0,16,0

If it was hand squeezed by them that day or a Eli's individual pint or something I could understand but really watery juice is worth a third of my lobster roll and more than my son's dinner!!!!! F#*k off.Let me just say, Sarah Beths, is a classy option and food is always reliable. I have been coming here not so frequently for 15 years. ...however their staff is not always so reliable and inevitably let's down the food and the experience. Whether it be pure incompetence or pretention. Last time I went they tried to stick us in the not so accessible front window with baby in stroller in an empty restaurant. They were so concerned about keeping us out of the way(from no one else), they made us feel uncomfortable and unaccommadated. I would have more than understood if there were more people or it was a rush time but they showed me they couldn't think on their feet.Yesterday, we waited for 5-10mins before our waitress presented herself. The restaurant was 2/3rds empty but she seemed frazzled. After taking our full order she forget about a coffee and tea order after 15 mins bad cappuccino arrived which she clearly didn't know how to make as it was topped with cinnamon and very watery.

We had to wait about 15-20 minutes due to the crazy rush of students and their families. I ordered the crab cake benedict, which I substituted the english muffin for croissant, OMG BEST DECISION EVER, well I personally LOVE croissants so eggs benedict on a croissant is like heaven to me. I recommend substituting it for a croissant because it adds even more flavor aka butter, MO BUTTA MO BETTA (hi5 if you get this reference.) I think all brunch places should offer eggs benedict on croissant. Anyways, the crab cake was 95% crab and 5% cake (bread crumbs) which most places do 95% cake and 5% crab, so respect Sarabeth respect.My dad got the cobb salad with lump crab and shrimp and he said the crab was so good. The chunks of crab were HUGE! My grandma got some type of olive oil pasta with pieces of lump crab and same as the salad, the chunks were huge, juicy and delicious! Our waitress was also so nice and so patient with us (my grandma.) She's a little old lady and she had a lot of requests and questions but our waitress was willing to answer and attend to all her wants and needs with no sign of complaints.

The wait was about 20 minutes, which is surprisingly short for a weekend. We were seated very, very close to the people next to us, that it was pretty uncomfortable for both us and the party next to us, but I forgot about it as time went on.I ordered the Salmon Eggs Benedict served on an English Muffin, my friend ordered the same but on a Croissant and my other friend ordered the Classic Eggs Benedict with Canadian Bacon served on a Croissant. They both really enjoyed the croissant, which really made me regret my decision to have mine served on an English muffin, but it was still very good. I've had many Eggs Benedicts before and I have to say, this dish is one of my top favorites. It has a very light, clean taste that left me very satisfied and not too full, even though I only ate half.We also ordered the Grapefruit Mimosas to complete our boozy brunch, which I highly recommend!

4.0,4/24/2015,"Ok, so I have to be honest but really, I'm not going to be snobbish. Sarabeth's is a place for New Yorkers to eat. It's not for tourists. If you don't live here, stay away. There's no chance you're going to ""get it"" and we don't want you to. We just want to come and be among each other. Yesterday I was there for lunch. At the next table was an out-of-town couple: a very wealthy old guy (I saw his credit card...it was made of enriched plutonium) who was so miserable he didn't say a word the entire time and looked angry while he ate. With him  was his trophy wife, way way younger, gorgeous, and acting very happy and animated because she must have been embarrassed by the old fart's refusal to say anything and gloom and doom. Both of them were eating a 4 egg scrambled egg plate and both had separate plates with about 8 slices of bacon on them. And the wife poured a ton of salt on her bacon. Let me share with you: New York people are on all kinds of weird diets, but none of them involve pouring salt on bacon. Before I left I went down to the bathrooms and accidentally walked into an unlocked bathroom where a very attractive woman was finishing up. We both were startled, both apologized, but then began chatting like BFFs. She told me she was with her boyfriend, they had been together forever but he refused to marry her, and would I please come by their table and tell him what nice things I had said about her. Hey, we're neighbors, you know? So I did, and I told him fella, if you don't pop the question, I'm going to do it right now so if she wants she can ditch you. See, we don't need tourists for any of this. So you guys from Okeebogee can eat in a Greek diner and see what New York diners are all about.

My friend and I came here on a Sunday afternoon and we were expecting ridiculously long wait times, but we only had to wait for about 20-30 minutes. Not too bad for peak basic people dining times.Once seated, my friend and I decided to share a basket of their muffins and get separate egg dishes. I had their green and white eggs, which were really fluffy and delicious. My friend got the goldie lox, and she loved them as well.

4.0,3/2/2015,"I came here on a Saturday afternoon around 3 for brunch. Because it was 3, my dining companion and I were both starving, so we were overjoyed to find that open tables were plentiful at that hour. One note: I am not a seasoned brunch-goer in the city, so my bar is not set too high. Though I dine out often, I lack sbustantial brunch experiences to compare this one to, so keep that in mind when reading this. Service: Excellent. If it was less than excellent, I would've given this place 2 stars. The restaurant was pretty empty, so I would've had a short fuse for inattentiveness. Water was refilled quickly and our food came out shockingly fast. And quality was not sacrified for speed, as you will see if you read on...Food: Two thumbs up here. I've been to the Central Park South location so I wasn't surprised in this regard. My dining companion ordered the Four Flowers Juice to start and loved it. I'm not a huge juice person, but when someone has a reaction like that to a drink/food, I can't stop my inner mooch from coming out. And wow, that drink was pure tropical paradise. Orange, fresh pineapple, banana and pomegranate juice combined to perfection. And just the right amount of pulp. The only downside of the juice was that it reminded us that we soon needed to face the bitter tundra that is New York City in February as opposed to an island wonderland far, far away.To eat, I ordered the Garden Omelette (broccoli, corn, sun-dried tomatoes,carrots, Vermont cheddar) and my dining companion ordered the Crab Cake Eggs Benedict (crab cakes, hollandaise, peppers, chives). Very, very tasty. The omelette was a bit greasy for my liking (at the Sarabeth's on CPW South there was not a trace of grease to be seen on my eggs) but they were otherwise wonderul. Solid four stars for the food.Overall, I'm giving this four stars because a) I am well aware that there is better brunch out there, b) i have seen far more creative brunch menus in my lifetime and c) this wasn't overwhelmingly, lip-smackingly delightful.

Much more of a fancy brunch spot than a hangover cure brunch spot.The wait can be long and they don't ever do reservations. This would be fine but there really isn't enough space to wait. There's a small walkway entrance and that's it. When the weather is comfortable, it can be fine to wait out on the street. But when it's extremely cold or hot, you want to be inside to combat the temperature and there really isn't anywhere for you to go. The waiters squeeze by you like you're in the way, and it just feels bad. Plus, if you have a table right by the door (there are many of them) then you're getting a blast of the temperature outside each time a new party comes in. Always try to sit in the back!The food is consistently good. Make sure you go hungry because the portions are filling and rich. The mimosas are great and the 4 Flower one is unbelievably. I'm sure you could just get the juice without the champagne and be equally as satsified. So good! I often get the eggs benedict, which is great. Their homefries are more like oven-baked potatoes with green peppers--very tasty. We always order a second portion for the table. Last time I went I got the seafood cobb salad off the lunch menu and it was amazing. The right amount of filling, lots of protein and veggies. Win win. Also, as I often pay attention to bathrooms, Sarabeth's has 2 nice, spacious ones downstairs.

2.0,12/21/2014,"Sarabeth's used to be a place where you could go for a great, albeit overpriced, meal either with friends or alone.  As a longtime and frequent customer of the restaurant its finally time for me to break up.  The main dishes I've gotten at sarabeths are the buttermilk pancakes, the chicken apple sausage and scrambled eggs so that is what I can speak to.  Over time the quality has gone and now its no longer worth coming for these prices when the city has tons of great brunch places where you can wait for an hour for a table.Sadly the buttermilk pancakes have always been good and are still ok but I wouldn't go out of your way to come here just for that especially when they're dry and rather thin.  Not fluffy.The chicken apple sausage used to be AMAZING but they must have changed the way the dish was prepared or the ingredients because now it is dry, large and charred with no flavor. Even the apricot or apple jam can't make up for the dry sausage that used to be juicy and full of flavor.Long story short just pass on this restaurant because of long waits, high prices and edible but not great food.",1,0,0,Miss S D.,"Washington D.C., DC",0,9,1

4.0,11/29/2014,"Did I mention that having brunch is one of my favorite things to do in NYC? Obviously I had to try Sarabeth's at some point and together with three friends we decided to go there. 1. Reservation issueWe had a reservation and were there on time. However, we waited 15 minutes and were standing in the middle of the restaurant in the way of pretty much everybody. I don't mind waiting generally BUT at least one should tell us how long to wait. We had a reservation and we had to be there in time. All of us. If you don't play with their rules you don't get a table. If you are that  strict to your customers you should have the same rules for your restaurant. To their defense: they apologized that we had to wait but said that this is normal on a busy day.2. SeatingHowever, eventually we got our table on the left side next to the bar. Horrible spot!!! It was cold outside and the doors were opened and closed constantly and it was just freezing each time someone wanted to get in or out which was every two to three minutes. But the restaurant itself was pretty. 3. FoodAbsolutely fantastic. Such a great brunch and so much better than most of the restaurants around. Everything came together and smelled, looked and tasted extremely good. My favorite dish were the CRISP POTATO WAFFLE with chicken & apple sausage, chunky apple butter and sour cream. OMG. That was incredible. Same for all the egg dishes we had.

The sauce was quite nice as well and went well with the fish and potatoes.I sampled the Lobster Mac & Cheese from my friend's plate and it was underwhelming.

1.0,9/30/2014,"TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!I came here for breakfast/ brunch around 10:45am with my boyfriend to show him how fabulous Sarabeth's is (I've been to the UES location and it is wonderful). However, I was extremely disappointed with my experience at this UWS location. The service at this establishment is AWFUL. My boyfriend and I sat down at a table for two and it took us 20 minutes just to get WATER. The waitress barely visited our table... we only saw her three times the entire time we were eating there, (greeting, giving us our food, and handing us our check) and it was very difficult to get refills of water and coffee in a timely manner. As for the food... we ordered french toast and waffles, and it took FIFTY MINUTES to receive our food. When the food came out, it was lackluster at best. It did not taste like anything special, and was certainly not worth the $60 it was for the 2 dishes and coffee. The coffee also tasted very watery, and was not very hot. The most frustrating part of this experience was that in the 50+ minutes we were sitting at our table waiting for our food, THREE new tables sat down at the tables around us, and all received their food WITHIN 15 MINUTES OF SITTING DOWN. I do not understand how that is possible or fair. And to top it off, the hostesses kept staring at our table as if to ""hurry"" us up, like we were an annoyance because we were taking so long to eat our food, when in fact we didn't even receive our food yet!!!This experience was absolutely infuriating.

4.0,8/20/2014,"Food was pretty delightful, but got dull past the halfway mark. The service was friendly, but only moderately dependable. The product is good, but over-priced for what it is [as is majority of the things in NY].The lady and I wanted some breakfast whilst visiting a friend, so I looked to my trustee reference book [aka YELP!] and looked up Sarabeth's. The pictures of the food looked like this place made the best food around. Being big fans of American breakfasts, we were down for this place.We walk in and were promptly seated. After surveying the menus, she orders the smoked salmon scramble while I get the Popeye Eggs. The food took around 15 minutes to arrive, but we both had to use the restroom separately, so it gave each of us time to conduct our business, as well as read the nice article they have printed, written by Sarabeth on how she became successful [located downstairs next to the restrooms]When the food arrived, I was initially disheartened, thinking that my eggs would be poached.. but, looking back at the menu, for sure, it said scrambled. Same reaction cam from my wife. But one bite into her food, she was happy. The cream cheese, semi=melty, was dreamy with the smoke salmon and eggs. For my Popeye eggs, the 'English Muffin' as they called it, was super delightful. The eggs were cooked about 30 secs too long for my own personal liking, but the food was still delicious.One thing that made this place unattractive to me was when there was a customer [I think she was Japanese], requested for something multiple times and was even blown off by one of the waitresses one of those times. I think she was asking for ranch dressing? I think she had to ask 4 times for it - didn't stay long enough to see if she actually got it.Our waters were filled regularly and tables were being turned over at a rapid pace. As mentioned previously, though the food was good, halfway through our meals, we both kind of lost steam and lost desire to eat the food. Not that it wasn't good, just that, the wow factor was lost around half way.Complimentary with the smoked salmon scramble was a choice of a scone, muffin, toast, or croissant, so we went with Banana muffin. The flavor was there, could have used some walnuts, but it was dry. All in all, the food was good, service was nice [ to us, at least], but the food got uninteresting after a while.

I am a big fan of their English muffin, and the hollandaise was not too lemony. Well done! One thing I did observe that I would point out to others is that if you go for Sunday brunch before 10:00 am, it is Romper Room. I counted no fewer than fifteen munchkins there in the 9:00 hour, at least half of whom were in the 2-5 year range. Now, they all seemed very well-behaved so I have no complaints.

I have no issue paying for a certain level of quality/service, but 18.50 for pancakes or a waffle with no sides (not even a salad garnish) means that it better be the best you have ever had. Having ordered the Coconut Waffle and the Lemon & Ricotta pancakes we can easily say that they were not near the best in any regard of anything we have ever had. IHOP would have tasted better IMHO. Had the entrees been priced at 9.99, then this restaurant may have gotten 3 stars for its true mediocrity, but at almost double that then it is easy to give it one star. We also had an issue with a hostess who made some arrogant remarks, but the manager on duty dealt with that by comping one of our entrees. Even with that comped it was still a $100 meal. My best advice is to go three blocks north and go to Jacob's Pickles where the food is delicious and worth the wait and the money.",5,1,0,Christopher M.,"Manhattan, NY",9,18,0

I live right around the corner from Sarabeths, and wanted to take a friend visiting from out of town for a nice brunch, where we might be able to sit outside and enjoy the day. Much to my surprise, and despite the long line, I was told that our wait would only be 25 minutes. After about AN HOUR, I went in to see what the new ETA would be. They said there was one table of 4 before us (we had 3 people) and that we were next. Fifteen minutes later, that table of 4 was called, so we knew we were the next ones. A table for 4 opened up outside, which was exactly what my friend was hoping for. But a family of 3 appeared out of no where, went inside and spoke to someone and were immediately seated at that table. OUR TABLE which we had waited 1-1/2 hours for!!!! I was livid!!! The person manning the list had the nerve to tell me they were before me on the list, but she didn't know I had checked on that and saw for myself earlier that we were next.

I was in town to doing a tour of NYU with my daughter.  This was my first time eating here. The atmosphere was the quaint and cozy like so many places in NY. The waitress was sweet young lady and seemed new. Always had a smile on her face and was delightful. I started off with a half bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon, it was not back and not overly oaky. I reviewed the menu and was interested in multiple dinner dishes.  I decided on the Sauteed Floridian Red Snapper served over a saffron-jasmine rice pilaf with mango salsa. The snapper was done perfectly and was flaky and moist. There was no fishy taste what so ever and just melted into my taste buds. Jasmine rice was seasoned and tasty. The contrasting mango salsa complimented the fish in the rice. The diced red onion in the salsa added a slight offset to the sweetness of the mango. Being so tasty on the first bites I had to share with everyone. We were instantly all sharing are meals with each other. My brother order the Roasted Lamb Shank and it was tender and had a savory flavor from the port sauce. My daughter order a burger, done medium well with some fries. The burger was moist and juicy with the nice grilled flavor. The fries were crispy on the outside and soft inside. Our family friend order the Flat Iron Frites special and the meat was tender and flavorful. The green peppercorn sauce on the frites was okay but seemed just average... not up to how all the other dishes tasted.  I would definitely recommend this place to others.  I look forward to going again with my daughter attending NYU in the fall.

1.0,4/7/2014,"A disastrous Sunday brunch. We were a group of 3 girls (in our 30's) with my friend's small puggle asking for outdoor seating around 2pm. Hostess (who mentions she was new and needs to ask a manager if having a dog around was okay) almost regretfully says the wait was for 30 minutes and makes a point to ensure my friend's dog was leashed so it stays outside the dining area barrier- yes okay fine.. were they always so dog-friendly?- so she takes my name and we decide we can wait but in the meantime, we walk around the block with the dog and come back 20 minutes later for our table that would soon be ready in another 10. When we return we wait for a few min and I ask the hostess again for a sign of update on our table. She says there are still currently no outdoor table for 3 ""but if a table becomes available you can just take it,"" seemingly exasperated. Great! So we wait some more and we notice 2 tables-for-2 were free, just not connected to each other. Fine, we just had to wait for one table adjacent to a free table to clear and we'd be golden. So we ask if they can be nice enough to give us some mimosas while we stand and wait. Nope, ""friendly"" waitress says policy doesn't allow for them to serve us if we're not seated. Okay. Pause.. so how about if my friend with her dog sits on one outdoor available table and me and other girlfriend sit anywhere like inside (which has more than like 6 free tables, not crowded at all). Surprise surprise- ""No, we have a policy,"" (yet again), ""that once we seat you in a particular table blah blah blah, legalese etc, (moving verboten). ""Do you have a policy against serving customers also?""Wow! it's incomprehensible how disagreeable and off-putting they were! At this point it's been a whole hour.

4.0,2/27/2014,"3.5 stars really, rounded up to four based on the fact that I have no choice but to round some direction and I really love the mimosas and eggs. Brunch. Wait takes forever in the summer and a bit in the winter, and prices are high, but it's worth it a few times a year. Why? Four Flowers Mimosa and Goldie Lox.I wouldn't have known about this place, despite its popularity, had it not been for a visiting family member who heard from someone at her hotel and at a bar that Sarabeth's was a great brunch option. After that first visit, I've been back a handful of times. It's pretty darn expensive. But I can't not order a Four Flowers Mimosa. It's my favorite mimosa ever. The Four Flowers juice is so, so, so yummy. And the nice thing is that they bring an extra little pitcher of juice and the remainder of your tiny champagne bottle to the table, so you basically get two mimosas. That makes the price a little more reasonable. My husband loves the Bloody Marys. I usually get an iced tea too, which also comes to the table with an individual refill pitcher and is presented well. I almost always order the Goldie Lox, which has salmon and cream cheese and comes with your choice of bread or muffin side. I like that I can order the omelet with egg whites only, but I hate that it costs a little extra. Still, the omelet tastes great; it's light and fluffy, and really, you can't go wrong with cream cheese in my book. The fish usually has good smoked flavor. Once or twice a few pieces have been slightly overcooked, but not so much that the dish isn't still good. I love the pumpkin muffin and the banana muffin, and of course the preserves are divine. But the muffins have their off days--they aren't always perfect. Guacamole appetizer is delicious; the flavor was great, and I really enjoy the chips they serve with it, which are more potato chippy and not tortilla chippy. But it is one pricey appetizer, and you get lots of food with your meal, so only order if you are starving. I've tried the lemon ricotta pancakes as well, since they seem to be what everyone swears by, and they are good. Very light and flavorful, great choice if you want pancakes but don't like the feeling you get after a standard stack. These are thin pancakes, with a very light syrup, which allows the flavor to shine. The service is just okay. The restaurant is almost always packed, so usually I can understand why service is just okay. But recently I was there when the restaurant had emptied out, and our server pretty much disappeared. It took us ages just to get the check. We weren't given explanation or apology. I hope that is abnormal, and I'm offering the benefit of the doubt that maybe she had an off day or something happened. Given the amount of money dropped here, service should never be lacking though. I've had great servers here; I've had mediocre. Guess it's hit or miss. Oh, and be aware, tables are super close together. Like you will know your neighbor's conversation topics close.Come here for food, not service. It's worth a try once in a while. I wouldn't say it's a must-do if you have limited time. But if you have time to spare and want to splurge, give Sarabeth's a try.",2,0,1,Jaime B.,"ASTORIA, NY",74,72,3

It was overcooked, and the only thing that saved it from being too dry was the cheese filling.It was served as is, with no greens. The only thing you get is a scone, which was certainly not made of the day: too dry. I ordered a pumpkin cocktail which was nice. The boys had bloody Marys, which were huge but tasted super spicy. It looks more like a soup, actually. And indeed, Sarabeth offers as an option to add shrimps in it (no kidding). My husband had a tuna sandwich, which he said was very common and overpriced. At least his greens were good, and the dressing perfectly tangy. For 1 sandwich, 1 omelette, 1 frittata and 3 drinks, it cost us almost $100.

It just tasted like regular pancakes with a hint of lemon. However, the pancakes were fluffy, and well cooked.The apple breakfast sausage was definitely nothing special, and the apple chutney they covered the sausage in didn't seem to mix very well.That being said, while we weren't impressed by the food, my son ate everything in sight and kept asking for more. For that alone, this place was upgraded from 2 stars (because of the price to value ratio) to 3 stars.Would I come back?

Being that I'm not a huge fan of sweet breakfast food I decided to pass on the muffin, which maybe that was my mistake.  It seems that maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. We started with spicy bloody mary's a-ok nothing special though for $14. The menu did have a lot of tasty options and I had a hard time deciding what to order.  I went for the spinach and goat cheese omelet.  I like that they use all cage free organic eggs and the omelet was one of the fluffiest I've ever seen. But really you should be ordering something sweet here I think given that Sarabeth's started as a jam making business and the owner is a pastry chef the sweeter things seem to be the star items here.  The omelet was tasty and came with a side of toast or a famous muffin.  My friend ordered the potato waffles with chicken sausage.  This dish was very good and inventive.  Savory potato waffles with chives served with apple chicken sausage.  The plate came with a side of sour cream and fresh apple sauce. It was the perfect combination of sweet and salty.Brunch is so popular in NYC and there are just so many choices, of all the places I've eaten before this just wasn't a favorite for me.  The quality of the food was excellent and people around me really seemed to enjoy their meals here,",3,1,2,Lauryn C.,"Raleigh, NC",1366,718,1775

The hostess was completely ditzy. During the entire time we waited, a two top table was uncleaned and unused outside despite the fact that 4 other parties of 2 were waiting! How does this place make money when they are not turning tables?!Second, the food was ""underwhelming"" per my hubby, but I say UNacceptable! Whatever you do, DO NOT get the almond french toast. It tasted like the non-perishable biscuits you pack in your emergency bunker for natural disasters. DRY, possibly burned, Probably made from chemicals. The strawberry sauce could not revive this thing. The benedict was unimpressive too. How do you make hollandaise taste bland? It's butter and egg yolk for goodness sake! I did appreciate the thick cut canadian bacon though. The only thing that deserves honorable mention are the mimosas which are a great deal. These were possibly the best mimosa I've had. Super fresh orange juice and champagne you could tell was not Andre.You get a whole mini bottle of champagne and a small carafe of orange juice.

We got there at noon and snagged one of the last remaining seats (luckily, this location does not fill up or have as big of a crowd as some of the other ones).I'm normally a savory breakfast person, but given how everyone always talks about Sarabeth's baked goods, decided to branch out and try something sweet. After a long deliberation (long partially because service is not the most attentive), I settled on the Almond-Crusted French Toast. The french toast was pretty good and I loved the flavor of the almonds. The strawberry jam drizzled across the toast was a bit too sweet for my taste and there was more than I needed, but it added a nice touch. Had it been a little later in the afternoon, I think this would have made the perfect dessert. My friend had the Pumpkin Waffle, which had a nice fall flavor about it and was not too sweet.While my mind wasn't blown, I did leave very full (definitely could not finish all of the food).

The hostess was friendly and engaging as she lead us to a quiet table.  A I asked for my favorite Lemon and Ricotta pancakes with a side of (gasp!) bacon while my favorite friend asked for Salmon Eggs Benedict. Service was quick  but not rushed and we settled to enjoying our meal.  The hint of lemon gives the pancakes a fresh taste which was perfect for spring. Since we are both believers of sharing our food, my friend gave me some of the salmon benedict  and I restrained myself from stealing his food. We skipped the dessert and just opted for cappuccinos which were pitch-perfect.  As we walked out of the restaurant, the line is now longer and we were glad we started our Easter early with Sarabeth's delicious breakfast.",1,0,1,Lara G.,"Astoria, NY",308,424,252

Our waiter was a bit slow but not to a point of being intolerable; he forgot my juice completely until after we'd already been served, but that was fine. The preserves were delicious as expected; the omelets: tasteless. I've had overpriced small portioned but DELICIOUS brunch food before and am fine with this; however, sadly bland omelets with no taste whatsoever really let us down.

I agree with another reviewer below that the bread to benedict ratio was off; if anything, it needed more than the paper-thin ham that I got. To make it worse, the scrambled eggs were overcooked: you know, when it's in chunks instead of that creamy fluffy consistency. You are not allowed to eff up eggs if you are a breakfast/brunch place.

5.0,4/6/2013,"Anyone who knows me would know I absolutely LOVE, LOVE brunch, and I just HAD to try this place.I just finished the Scotland 10K in the nearby Central Park this morning, and I was hungry for some good grub. My friend highly recommended this place, and we decided to let me try it for the first time. They told us it would be twenty minutes wait, and we decided to stay (obviously). Within 5 minutes, opposed to their estimation of 20, we were seated, by their windows. For those who enjoy the view of upper west side NYC scenery, there are seatings outside as well. But today was cold - about 35 degrees; I wanted to stay indoors. They started us with coffees, as I looked at their menu. I read on many reviews to try their French Toast and Pancakes, but I am not a big fan of sweet breakfast, so I chose their Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict. And I am so glad I did. It was an absolute gorgeous sight to see, two poached eggs sitting on top of English muffins and soaked in hollandaise sauce. There is also a small garden salad on the side. I almost couldn't eat it because it was just too beautiful to touch, but I devoured that thing in seconds. YUM, YUM. My friend ordered their Fat and Fluffy French Toast, which was amazing as well. It comes with three slices of French Toast, sprinkled with powdered sugar, sliced strawberries and bananas. And on the side, maple syrup and butter. He also ordered a side of Pork and Apricot Breakfast Sausage (for $8 though ..). The sausages were nothing special, but that apricot marmalade .. DELICIOUS. Our bill came out to be about $60+, tips and tax included. I am used to cheap and good eats, but I still did not mind paying for the quality grub I had eaten. Though I have to say .. you would not find coffee on their menu, and they make you feel like the coffee is free because they pour it for you with their prepared cups in front of you.

Once we came back, we were seated immediately. The one strange thing was that one of the hostesses said they didn't allow outside drinks which is something I've never really encountered. She asked us to pour the drinks into the cups on the table, which I didn't mind because I had actually gotten the coffee for free (the computers crashed at Starbucks) but if I hadn't it was a fresh full coffee that I could only drink for whichever could fit in the cup... slightly annoying.

Next time (which won't be anytime soon, just based on the exorbitant pricing) I'd like to try the eggs Benedict or the lemon-ricotta pancakes.

4.0,11/16/2012,"Came here for dinner with my parents and my grandparents and it was perfect for them. This restaurant is like an upscale version of your grandmother's home. Perfect for an older crowd/people who are picky eaters. We started with chips and guacamole, which turned out to be potato chips stuck into guacamole. The potato chips were very large and crunchy and really impressed the table. Personally, I was kind of grossed out by the combination.We also had the tomato soup (which they are known for) was delicious, creamy, and had large chunks of tomato - A+For dinner, I had the filet mignon which was classically good, but free of any spices. It was presented really well. One member of my party had the lobster prix fixe and it was amazing! The lobster was stuffed with crab meat, perfectly cooked, and they even had completely cracked the lobster so you just had to pull it out of the shell. It was amazing! I kind of regretted not getting it!The other members of my family gave high ratings to the chicken pot pie (which looked awesome when it was brought out--there was an impressive puff pastry over the top!), the shrimp risotto, and the rigatoni.For dessert we all sampled some of the pecan pie and it smelled like Thanksgiving.Our waitress was super friendly as well. This is the perfect place to take people who want nice American food. One negative for those traveling with seniors, the bathrooms are below the restaurant down a flight of stairs.

4.0,11/13/2012,"We've always walked by this place and never went in because the prices are not conducive to our lifestyle.  Given that it was my boyfriends birthday, we made the exception and went ahead for brunch.  It was nice that brunch was offered even during the week, as we both work weekends, and going out for a boozy brunch isnt something we ever get to do.We didn't make a reservation, and were lucky to get a table with no wait.  I know this place is notorious for having a line out the door, and a wait for a table.  Birthday luck was in our favor.   The tables are very close together. So if you're looking for something intimate and quiet, this is not the place.  However, thats New York.  Tables cozy together, and an active atmosphere.  The prices are really the only thing that have kept us away.  We're not penny pinchers, but then again, we're not rollin in it either. So $24 entrees per person are usually something we avoid. Especially since we know of much more affordable places. We got the banana, orange fruit mimosas.  I wasn't expecting them to bring the small split bottle of champagne and a refill of the juice with it! So for $12, it was worth it.  We also ordered a basket of the muffins and jams, however, I wish it was written on the menu, or mentioned, that they arent mini muffins, they are full sized muffins.  Between two people, it was a lot of bread. A croissant, and five muffins? We boxed up most of them and brought them home, with a refill of the delicious jams (thank you!). For our entrees, I got the Almond Crusted French Toast, that came with strawberry sauce and thinly sliced almonds.  I got four pieces of toast and it was more then enough.  My boyfriend got the Fat and Fluffy French Toast that came with fresh strawberries and bananas on top.  It really lived up to the name... fat and fluffy. We also shared an order of the three pepper hash browns.   The food was delicious, the drinks were awesome (I mean, with a whole split bottle, you can make it as strong as you want, and you get the whole thing for yourself. Kinda hard to mess up).  The only reason this place doesn't get a full 5 star rating for me are the little things.  We had some empty plates hang around our table for awhile, some sugar wrappers from our coffees that didn't get cleaned off and the prices just make it unrealistic for us to visit on the regular.  Service was great, and attentive, and fast.  I did feel slightly rushed having the bread basket brought out then the food shortly after, but like I said, we never would have finished the whole basket anyways.Our bill was $90 for the two of us.  Again, two mimosas, two coffees, a basket of muffins and two entrees.  We'll go again, but save it for a special occasion.  Unless you're willing to spend over $100 on just breakfast for two.",2,0,0,Jamie F.,"Manhattan, NY",25,22,5
3.0,11/11/2012,Was visiting from out of town and came here due to the good reviews I read. We arrived on a Friday at 11am and were seated immediately which was nice. I was worried about the wait. We ordered Eggs Benny which were good and the famous Lemon Ricotta pancakes which again were good but I guess from all the good reviews I was expecting to the be wowed which I wasn't. The decor at the front of the restaurant was nice and light but we sat in the back of the restaurant which kinda dark and the decor reminded me of an 80s hotel restaurant or something.

4.0,11/2/2012,"So torn. While the food is quite delicious I cannot say the same for service but mainly the ridiculous wait for a table in a non-existent wait area. We basically stood there, staring down other peoples meals and any empty seats. Try doing that for a half hour/40 mins straight. Talk about awkward.  At least the food was delicious... I ordered a salmon Eggs Benedict- hollandaise, lightly tossed green salad on an english muffin. Friend's Chicken pot pie- delicious and brings back memories of home. Sirloin burger- PERFECT medium on brioche bun with fries. I wished to have a bit more attention with service, a refill with water and coffee would have been delightful :(.  Part of me understands that good food establishments are in high demand so a wait is typical. The meaner side of me demands that delicious foods should be offered with impeccable service and wait times. So.. I don't know. I really enjoyed the food. It was filling, tasty and made me want to order one of everything on the menu, but c'mon... the awkward, hovering wait experience wasn't pleasant. Sarabeth's, I like you.

3.0,7/1/2012,"This is a review for brunch dated July 1st, 2012. Outdoor temperatures were in the lower to mid 90's and it was high noon. I had heard some pretty good things about Sarabeth's so I decided to brave the heat and the small crowd gathered outside the restaurant to give their brunch menu a try.  The truth is, I'm on a July - September tour of brunch reviews, and I didn't plan Sarabeth's to be my first stop, but here I was walking through the sea of hungry and excited patrons to the hostess inside. A smiling yet undeniably harried blond hostess greeted me and told me the wait for a solo table outside would take about 20 minutes. I did a quick observation of the inside dining area and it was packed with sterile and happy upper westsiders. Maybe a tourist or two, but the crowd was your typical frizzy haired upper west side mom-baby-husband-angsty teen girl grouping.  They sell take aways like granola and little tid bits inside, but I didn't pay attention. As I stood outside in the sun, a larger crowd was gathering and congesting the sidewalk, and disgruntled moms and dads with their baby carriages were trying to push through with annoyed looks on their faces. Their grumbling would immediately change to wistful smiles upon seeing that the crowd was waiting for Sarabeth's, quietly gushing with their ""woo Sarabeth"", ""Oh Sarabeth~"" ""Yes I love this place""s. 20 minutes turned to 40 minutes and when I saw the harried frizzy hostess seating a preppy haughty young couple that had just walked in, at a little table I had been eyeing for five minutes, I expressed my dissent but she sharply said, ""they were here before you."" Poor line management, check. Lying, check. Already I had a feeling that this might go down in my memory as just another overrated nyc brunch eatery.Another hostess, just as harried and frizzy as the first one but with darker hair, seated me after 42 minutes of baking like a potato in the sun. I took a quick glance of the menu and found that they have five varieties of omelettes (red omelette, garden omelette, farmers, spinach and goat cheese, and cheese omelete which is either white cheddar or gruyere). The red omelette is a chunky red pepper and tomato sauce and cheddar omelette which sounds like a heart burn on a pretty plate. I ordered the FOUR FLOWER JUICE which is a concoction of OJ+Pineapple+Banana+Pomegranate and it is a very refreshing pick-me-up and a great start to perking up your taste buds and prepping your system for the indulgent brunch entree. I wanted to review their crab cake benedict, but as they were out of Crab Cake *how dare they) I ordered the CLASSIC EGGS BENEDICT. While waiting I sipped a J. ROGET MIMOSA, DId it taste like a $12 mimosa?  I wouldn't say so.  By this time I still didn't receive water at my table, and I was too heat-exhausted and tired to muster a yelp to get the waitress' attention. Mediocre Front of House Service? Check. The CLASSIC EGGS BENEDICT arrived within ten minutes, and my first thought was, this is an akward and ugly looking benedict. The bread-to-benedict ratio is way too high and the ovewhelming brioche couldn't somehow support the ham and the non-yokey poached egg, and it screamed a serious lack of structural integrity. I didn't see the yoke until about 75% into my first egg and I coudn't help but exclaim, ""there it is!"" The bread is soft but t's puffy and its a very fat and a sad looking sort and tough to swallow dish. A little over halfway through my second benedict, which was a litle easier to manage but again, lacking in the yokey yokeness, I understood that the purpose and utilitarian feature of the big puffy bread is to help you sop up the yoke and egg left over on the plate. Hmm... I get it, but I won't be coming back here to order the CLASSIC EGGS BENEDICT again. The first cut into the benedict is a true test of your strength and finesse because the edge of the bread is a bit tough, and one wrong move and you'll collapse the haphazard stacking of the mediocre ham and non-yokey egg.  Despite my inner complaints, I scraped the plate (I needed to get moneys worth). Wanting to treat myself for successfully maneuvering my way through the most difficult eggs benedict and the scorching heat, I asked to see the dessert menu. Long story short, I took the waitresses recomendation which was the WARM RASPBERRY BREAD PUDDING. . The bread pudding was almost flan like but undeniably dreamy.  The creamy bed upon which it rested was a song and dance in my mouth and the chunks of raspberry in the breadpudding had my taste buds skipping. would I call it stellar? No. it's missing a certain je ne sais quois. Sarabeth's was a citybest in 2006 and 2007, which was obviously a long time ago. Sorry Sarabeth.

4.0,5/30/2012,"Brunch at Sarabeth's is everything brunch should be. All of the food is comforting and delicious, yet the flavors are complex and each dish is executed perfectly. After going the first time and ordering the lemon ricotta pancakes and the eggs benedict, we were not able to get the amazing memory out of our heads and had to go back two weeks later. The home made english muffin atop which the eggs benedict rest is a culinary triumph, and once having had it, makes it virtually impossible to enjoy any other take on the muffin. The lemon ricotta pancakes are everything the other reviewers have said - delicate, light, fluffy, with subtle tones of flavor from the lemon and ricotta. In another word - genius. That said, we were less impressed with the jams and bread basket. Perhaps we just got a bad bunch, but we were expecting them to be warm and fluffy, and they were not. They felt like they were taken out of a pasty case. And the jams while tasty, weren't that much further apart from what you'd get out of a jar of Smuckers. So, I question whether the price tag on that appetizer is warranted. Overall though, we've been back once since our first visit and will likely go back again, especially since the english muffin is haunting our dreams.",5,1,2,Bryan C.,"New York, NY",227,149,1

I felt like I was eating at some cute B&B on the New England coast.  Yes, it's a little pricey but the food is excellent.  I had delicious french toast and my boyfriend got the pancakes.  We also ordered the basket of biscuits and muffins with preserves and we got the preserves sampler to take home because they were so yummy!  The muffins weren't half bad either ;)  We couldn't sit outside because it was pouring down rain but I bet it would be fun to just sit outside and leisurely drink coffee and enjoy your breakfast.",1,0,0,Ashley M.,"Austin, TX",145,110,1
4.0,5/15/2012,"Four stars for their food and service.  I had the eggs benedict which were absolutely delish.  Their buttermilk pancakes were ok and the popeye eggs were ok.  I do love thier homemade biscuits and like the fact their their mimosas are actually enough for two drinks.  Now lets talk about their prices and waiting time for a table. We were told we would have to wait at least 20 minutes for a table for two, which is understandable on a Sunday at 1pm in May when its warm out.  45 minutes later, right before my head hit the pavement, we were called in.  As far as their prices go, I understand its Manhattan, Amsterdam no less, but $18 for eggs benedict and $16 for plain buttermilk pancakes?  Wait, what?",4,1,2,Gigi S.,"Bronx, NY",9,131,72
4.0,5/3/2012,"There's a reason Sarabeth's so frequently finds itself on those ""Best Brunch"" lists you see in New York Magazine, Time Out New York, and any other print or online publication that takes the time to generate such lists. Simply speaking, Sarabeth's KNOWS BRUNCH. When my mom, brother, aunt and I went one Saturday morning, we got a sense of just how popular this place was in the neighborhood: the line was out the door, with people braving the cold in the hopes of snagging a table (even if they had to wait 30-40 minutes to do so). Once seated, we decided to try a few things and sample each others meals (strategy, guys, strategy). On the menu: Eggs Benedict, lemon ricotta pancakes, almond-crusted french toast and the farmer's omelette. There's nothing quite like lemon ricotta pancakes made the right way. The ricotta makes the batter extra light, so it seems like you're biting into a cloud of lemony sweetness - delicious. The almond crust on the french toast was not at all overpowering, providing a nice crunch to the sweet toast. Leeks, bacon, potato and Gruyere seem like a perfect mix for a nice winter soup, and that combo works equally well in an omelette: the creaminess of the Gruyere enhanced the saltiness of the bacon, while the leeks and potatoes managed to balance each other out. As for the eggs Benedict (which I ordered): sometimes this dish can be tricky if you don't get a good piece of Canadian bacon, if the egg isn't poached just right, or if the hollandaise is too heavy. No tricks here. Everything was great.On a side note, my hilarious aunt was so in love with the Bloody Mary, she asked for a to-go cup to sip on the rest of it while we were walking around the city.",13,10,10,Diandra D.,"Pelham, NY",687,328,29

The food came out pretty quickly, and they have really good service. The place is also decorated nicely and feels clean. The Eggs Benedict was delicious. The English muffin was thick but still moist and soft. The ham was so good and tasty. There wasn't much hollandaise sauce but it wasn't necessary. There was also a small side salad of mixed greens that came with it. The Lemon Ricotta pancakes came as 5 smaller, thinner pancakes with butter, syrup, and some berries on the side.

My friend and I had a 3pm reservation but she didn't show up until 3:45 (thanks a lot weekend MTA). The hostess was really nice about it and around 3:30 informed me that since brunch was ending at 4pm she would seat me so at the least part of our order could go in. The waitress was attentive, made suggestions and checked on us a few times. The food was Great! The muffin basket was pretty good, I've definitely had better muffins but the homemade jam more then compensated. The four flowers juice is AMAZING!!! I'm usually not a fan of juice with banana in it but a friend gave me a recommendation so I went for it, and I'm so happy I did. In an attempt to not consume a weeks worth of sugar I passed on the ricotta lemon pancakes and went with the farmers omelette, substituting spinach for the leeks and egg whites. It was delicious, perfect amount of cheese and fillings, although a bit thicker than I prefer but still really good. Having already ordered the muffin basket, we skipped the toast and had a mixed green salad. I think the salad really sealed the deal for me, it complimented the eggs perfectly. Another reason I enjoyed Sarabeths was the fact that we weren't rushed or given attitude for staying an extra hour and a half after finishing our meal. Of course I understand that it was after the brunch rush and it would have been a different story at 12:30. However, I've been to plenty of places that give you attitude if you stay too long when the place is empty. Great food and amazing customer service is worth 5 stars in my book. Yes this is probably one of the more expensive brunches I've paid for but, you get what you pay for and I was more than satisfied with this splurge.",2,0,0,Nicole S.,"Silver Spring, MD",5,12,1
4.0,3/4/2012,"Absolutely best brunch experience- that is of course after being seated.  My only big gripe with this place is that they do not accept brunch reservations, so the four of us had to wait nearly an hour for a table.  We didn't mind it at first, we already knew we would have to wait a while and it just gave us more time to catch up.  Once finally inside, we were warmly greeted and offered superior service for the entirety of the meal.  Everyone loved what they ordered- each item was truly delicious and I was a fan of my more-than-enough mimosa placed on the table for me to add more in the flute at any time- a real treat.

3.0,2/29/2012,"I guess I just don't get the hype.  I adore brunch, but Sarabeth's wasn't anything spectacular...certainly not worthy of the huge lines it garners on weekend mornings.  Two of us had a nice meal, but I don't think it's really worth going back.  We decided to get two egg dishes and share them so we got the Farmer's omelet (leeks, bacon, potato, gruyere) and the Goldie Lox (scrambled eggs + lox).  These come with your choice of bread so we both got pumpkin muffins (great until I took a bite and found raisins tainting the pumpkin, but that's a personal distaste).  The omelet, while big, was very dry and the flavor was not that striking.  The fillings were small and sometimes not present.  The Goldie Lox was our favorite of the two because the eggs were much moister.  We also shared a side of pork and apricot breakfast sausage, which basically means pork sausage in a pile of apricot preserves.  The sausage was tasty, sure, but I can buy similarly plump sausages from Trader Joe's just down the street and cook them up just as nicely.  Our waitress was very nice, so that was a plus, but the food was just mediocre and the prices were too high for the quality and quantity of food received.  I would've like some breakfast potatoes on the side of my eggs or maybe a light salad and some fresh fruit.  But no, just my dry omelet and raisin-infested muffin.  Maybe NY just doesn't understand what makes a brunch ""1 hour wait""-worthy, but Sarabeth's isn't it.",2,0,0,Anne Marie B.,"Manhattan, NY",134,425,3

5.0,11/17/2011,"I dined at Sarabeth's last night and can't stop thinking about it! I came here somewhat on whim too and I'm thrilled that I chose Sarabeths as my eating destination. My friend and I wanted to meet for dinner and he was coming up from uptown so this was the middle. I quickly did some leg work to find a spot on the UWS and through playing around on Yelp, it lead to Sarabeths. I made a reservation for 6:30 and couldn't wait! I had arrived a few minutes late, but on a Wednesday night they weren't too busy. It's a very quant eatery. You walk in and you first get the feel of a bakery but as you look towards the back it has more of restaurant feel to it. My friend and I were seated at a booth that was tucked away in the corner which was just perfect. Our waitress, Steph, came over and got us started with a bottle of wine.  We had a Riesling that had just come in and was new to the menu, Steph highly recommended it, and while I'm no big wine-O it was fruity and delicious. They then brought out some complimentary bread that was fresh out of the oven. The ones with the raisins was my favorite. When it came time to order, I knew what I wanted but I had to make sure I was getting the right thing! So I asked Steph how the scallops were and she didn't have anything bad to say. What really sold me was the polenta pumpkin cake that came with the entree. I had the Grilled Maine Diver Sea Scallops pumpkin polenta cake, mini micro greens, sage brown butter sauce. I know this is going to be a seasonal item but I want it to stay on their menu forever. In fact, I would just like to have the polenta as an entree entree. It wasn't your typical polenta either, not creamy or really firm, they met in the middle. The polenta was surrounded by 4 big scallops that were drizzled in some of the best sage brown butter sauce I've ever had. The polenta with a little butter sauce was really the icing on the cake though, the pumpkin spice flavor was accented very nicely. The scallops were perpared perfectly and topped nicely with some fresh veggies. I'll be back to have this dish again before it's off the menu ... and that's saying alot because I don't usually hit restaurants twice!My friend had the Pan-Roasted Free-Range Chicken Breast roasted garlic mash, haricot verts, chicken ajus. But instead of garlic mash he opted for spinach. He was ranting and raving over the spinach and they gave a really nice amount of it. The chicken was a nice sized piece and was gone in the matter of minutes so I assume it was good!! After our meal, we just had to have dessert, and because I'm all things pumpkin right now we ordered the ... wait for it ... pumpkin tart!! A beautiful little round tart was brought to our table topped with whipped cream and pumpkin seeds. I'm not sure which dish made my taste buds dance more when it came to the pumpkin flavoring. The tart was delightful and just enough to satisfy ones sweet tooth. I will say though, the presentation of all the other dishes were shown some love but the dessert dish wasn't ... I would have enjoyed if the pumpkin tart dish got some decorative love even it was just sprinkling some cinnamon on the plate so it didn't look so sad and lonely!And to round out the meal, we ordered another bottle of wine! One thing I really liked about Steph, she had a heavy hand so when she poured that wine, she didn't hold back! She was very attentive and more than helpful with the menu. It was just a relaxing dinner and the food was just outstanding. It appears as if they may be more of a brunch spot, which I will have to try but the dinner was a stand out for me!",1,0,0,Lauren L.,"Astoria, NY",414,331,602

3.0,11/10/2011,"I have finally been to Sarabeth's, the staple of Upper Manhattan brunch. Hooray! I have to say I have mixed feelings about it now that I've been... the food was great, but the atmosphere was, well, not my typical scene. The baby blue & white interior with lots of wood paneling made me feel like I was in Cape Cod or something, but the overcrowded seating area felt a little bit like a chain. The menu is huge, but it left me with some questions (like: what is this weird juice that people are paying so much for?) which is part of why we over-ordered. We were also cold and wet and starving, so that probably also had something to do with it. The muffins were good but not all they were cracked up to be. I'd recommend getting one on the side for $2.25 (not listed on the menu) instead of the basket. The lemon ricotta pancakes were great at first, but as they cooled they lost their fluffy zeal. I was really happy with the Popeye's Eggs, and I think the ""English muffin"" that it came on would have been my favorite part of the meal... however, that crown was stolen by the pork & apricot sausages, which come on a bed of apricot jam. They were phenomenally delicious. The Bloody Mary was also large and really tasty, and came with lots of fun things in it. I also have to say that everything was very nicely presented - I spotted a sandwich across the room cut into quarters with a spray of fries coming out of the middle, very cute. Despite all of the deliciousness, I probably won't be rushing back - however, the Sarabeth's Bakery in Chelsea Market might make it into regular rotation.",0,0,0,Colleen L.,"Brooklyn, NY",266,330,61

Firstly, we wanted to order a bottle of sparkling wine (since it was my friends birthday) but were harshly told by our waittress that they dont have that (I wonder how they make their mimosas...), so we ordered bloody marys and a blue moon. the bloody marys were good, really big and very spicy (might be too spicy for some people). we wanted an orange with the blue moon, but were told that they dont have oranges.so we order our found and are told that out of the maybe 8 bakery options, they dont have four including croissants (I thought they are famous for their baked goods and it wasnt that late).The food (we all had omlettes) was ok, but not that special either.I guess with a friendlier waitress we would have enjoyed the place more (albeit the lack of certain items). Generally, we didnt feel very welcome at the place, neither coffee nor water were refilled. It seems like you are much more welcome when you come with a child, very childfriendly (which, in return, we are not too keen on).When we left, we saw a lady sitting outside drinking a piccolo bottle of sparkling wine...It was just not what I was expecting, there are so many other places for brunch....",0,0,0,Amelia E.,"Manhattan, NY",1,42,0

3.0,9/26/2011,"contrary to the debilitating pressure to try sarabeth's west for brunch, i of course am the rule breaker and instead opted for an improvised rainy friday evening dinner. for a party of three, (three very brown and very queer people, might i add), we ambled in from the fickle rain into a warmly lit, farmhouse elegant and hella caucasian (upper westside obvious) establishment. not to mention, we were far younger in appearance than many of the patrons. if you are a transplant to nyc but love all things breakfast and jam, or are just a quintessential oprah fan, then you know about the the illustrious sarabeth's. i shared 2 entrees with a friend, namely the jumbo shrimp risotto and the grilled hanger steak (ordered medium). food arrived reasonably and prior we were given a bread basket with all of it's carb and starch glory! good biscuit, good dinner roll, obvious comments. the shrimp risotto was more firm than i would like and i would've appreciated a touch more creamy in texture. however, the flavor profile was great with tender shrimp countering the thick of the risotto in comforting tune the brightness of the peas and the fullness of the pancetta.  with hanger steak, i typically order it medium rare. however, since i am nice and like sharing, my co-eater wanted medium and unfortunately the steak came medium well, tougher, a slight struggle to chew. it could have been pulled from the grill a minute or so earlier. the bordelaise sauce though, was luscious and accomplished. the sides of fries and spinach were hardly memorable. last, were desserts of strawberry shortcake and raspberry bread pudding. strawberries, short cake, creme fraiche, all were great but the biscuit aka short cake could use some inspiration. the bread pudding was keen to the eyes and was more mushy than i anticipated, as i hoped for a crunchy exterior to the velvety interior that i typically love about bread pudding. it was a solid idea, i may try to navigate in my own kitchen. for the price tab, the swift and precise service, my experience at sarabeth's was solid. nothing weaved of mythical genius baker's hair follicles or talking salt shaker sorcery. honestly, i will concur with the choir, which is rare, and say yes, it was pretty good and pretty overpriced. additionally, acoustics amped up by 8:00pm on friday, it got to -loud movie talking-decibel levels.

Some friends and I came here (kinda reluctantly, since it was in the morning) and it was totally worth it.I was planning on getting some eggs that morning, but the lemon ricotta pancakes caught my eye, and so I couldn't resist as if it were a Victoria Secret model. I'm very glad I did get it, because it was phenomenal. The taste was just the right amount of ""lemon"" and had a great fluffy, creamy texture. Best pancakes I've probably ever eaten.I also had the chance to sample my friend's omelettes, and they were pretty good. The insides were very moist and soft, and there was a good amount of bacon/leek/potato ratio to eggs. My other friend got the Goldie Lox, and that was pretty good too. The lox itself was salty, but the combination of eggs and cream cheese with the lox proved to be delicious. I would highly recommend this place for breakfast or even a brunch.

1.0,8/2/2011,"I was extremely disappointed with my dining experience at Sarabeth's the other day when I had a guest visiting from oversea. First of all, there were flies in the dining room. GROSS. I felt like I was eating at a street vendor stall in Asia. I had the Salmon Eggs Benedict that came with a side of salad. The Salmon Eggs Benedict itself was very bland. The sprinkled red bell pepper and chives on it didn't seem to go with it either. I would totally let it slide if it was a $10 dish, but no, it was $17. So not worth my money. Then the salad. The leaves were badly bruised and not fresh at all, not to mention the lack of taste. I didn't even know how to complain about it to the waitress as I felt dumb stating the obvious. I decided to asked for more salad dressing in the hope that would somewhat turn my salad around, but no. After I poured the salad dressing the waitress brought me 10 minutes after I asked for it (it was at 2:30pm on a Monday), it had a funny taste, which made me decide to complain. The waitress explained that was the only dressing they used for all of their salad, but she brought me a new side salad with the only other kind of dressing they used in the restaurant anyway. The second time around, it looked slightly better, but not that much. I already lost my appetite by then, so I didn't even bother finishing the salad. My friend had the Open Faced Jumbo Lump Crab Cake Sandwich. The fries that came with tasted worse than the fries from McDonald's. How sad was that? And apparently her watercress apple salad was pretty bland too.      I'm giving them one star for the decent lemonade and the fact that the waitress who was somewhat responsive. I have been there once a long time ago, and I remember the food being decent. I have no idea what happened, but it doesn't matter as I'm not going back any more.

3.0,6/6/2011,"What a cuuuute country kitchen homemade jam and scones scene! It's like I've died and gone to Laura Ashley heaven. Seriously, this is definitely a solid brunch place, but there is something so offensive about a side order of bacon that's seven dollars and orange juice (okay, it's fresh squeezed but still) that's six. Also, when I was there this past Sunday, the fat and fluffy french toast was super dry. Whatever happened to soaking the bread all the way through with egg so that it really tastes like french toast and not merely like challah bread with a thin coating of egg batter? i didn't send it back because it was busy and I didn't want to be obnoxious--maybe that's their special signature particular french toast style--but I now regret that I didn't. After all, for a breakfast totaling $35.00 per person (what I paid including tax and tip) everything should be crazy perfect. Also, the whole suburban UWS scene with moms and dads and strollers and the sort of entitled atmosphere feels strangely artificial and kinda bland. It's as if Applebee's upscaled it a bit and opened a Shabby Chic breakfast chain in all the zip codes where people will pay twelve dollars for a basket of muffins without batting an eyelash.",0,0,0,Nina S.,"New York, NY",26,16,0

I've gotten the Papa Bear porridge before - that's the kind with strawberries and bananas I think - and it's really solid but usually I go for the garden omelette, because I am a sucker for, of all things, broccoli, in my eggs.

My boyfriend was super sweet on Valentine's Day - left for work as usual, but came home 15 minutes later with flowers and goodies and a request that I put on some pants because we were going to breakfast. Yes, he wanted me to put my pants ON. Look, we've been together for a long time and I was unemployed: putting pants on, at the time, was reserved for special occasions. So we walked up the street to Sarabeth's - a place that as new-ish UWSers we felt compelled to visit. The gesture was sweet and romantic and special, and that portion was perfection. Sarabeth's didn't contribute much to the moment, though. I suppose I was expecting something a little more refined, a little more ""uptown"", but I'm not really sure what Sarabeth's is besides a glorified Denny's. The decor was a little dated, a little shabby, and a little too reminiscent of a nursing home. Hmm . . . now that I think about it, Sarabeth does sort of sound like a grandma name.

That can sometimes be difficult without the yolk, but these guys know what they're doing. Second time around I tried the granola and it was grand.

You can order it from turkey or sirloin....take the beef.  I've had the meatloaf, chicken pot pie, hanger steak (that's what the waiter forgot), rigatoni, chicken breast and numerous other specials.   My wife will usually get whatever fish is on the menu (they always have salmon) or she will get a salad.  The food has always been very good....made to order and in large portions.  They always have a lobster prix fixe which I had once and it was excellent.  Starts with a garden salad, then you get a 1.5 lb lobster stuffed with crabmeat.  I gave the kids my chocolate souffle.  DRINKS - Full bar and generously poured.  Even the wine portions are decent.  Again, the kids get shirley temples every time we let them.SUMMARY -  You cannot go wrong at Sarabeth's for a reliable and tasty meal.  It isn't cheap...but it is always good.  If you go there one night and see two adults and two kids making a lot of noise, slurping Shirley Temples and eating cheeseburgers...that's us.  Oh yes, when you get the bill, the credit card bill is itemized.   So, if you ever go there for business....everything you ate will be on the tab.  Could be embarrassing if you eat a lot or if you have told your boss you are on a low carb diet.",0,0,0,Steve P.,"New York, NY",3,71,2

I booked a special New Years Day brunch for a party of 7, and also my sister's big 21st birthday. Not only did we have to wait an additional 40 MINUTES for our 'reservation' to be ready (we were literally told to go take a hike while we waited), but then we were seated at a table that was barely big enough to fit 5 people (and we had a party of 7). When asked VERY nicely if they had anything else at all availabile (and I AM southern, so asking nicely is like a super-skill for me), I was told, in the RUDEST possible way you can imagine, that if I didn't like what I got I could just have my party wait another 40 minutes. It was the most cramped, un-special breakfast ever. While i enjoyed the 4 flower juice tremendously,that was about all this place had going for it.

4.0,1/7/2011,"I do not do brunches; I have never understood the point of having brunches with people on the weekends. I am barely human at any time appropriate for brunch, not to mention that I cannot talk nicely or look nicely. Moreover, this is the critical issue: if you eat brunch, what about lunch? I would like to squeeze in as many instances of gastronomic delights in my day; therefore, I do not like to be cheated out of a meal, if I can help it. On the other hand, breakfast in bed, now that I can understand. It even carries a hint of the decadent eroticism - feathered slippers and silky dressing gowns...too many French movies, I agree. Papa Bear - hot porridge, strawberries, bananas, fresh cream, raisins, honeyMy lazy metabolism refuses to get started unless I feed it some fuel; and the only fuel it accepts in the morning is sugar. My brain, running on low blood sugar, has always had a hard time deciding between Papa Bear and Big Bad Wolf - fruits & cream v. brown sugar & butter; but this day, I leaned toward Papa Bear. Strawberries in December were looking pale and tasted paler; but it was not a problem that liberal swirls of honey and cream could not fix. Their warm porridge was freshly cooked, not relentlessly stewed, so that each grain was still separate and visible and retained its plump, grainy texture - instead of a mash of cardboard pulp to make recycled paper. Spooning up a huge spoonful of strawberry and banana slices on top of the creamy porridge, with the mixed in honey and cream visibly enticing and dotted with raisins, life was not so bad after all. Salmon Eggs Benedict - Irish smoked salmon, Hollandaise sauce, peppers, chivesEggs Benedict is a dish that appears deceptively simple, but it is not. It requires each layer to not only be perfect but also to web into a coherent whole: First of all, the eggs - the yolk must be runny but the white must be firm; Second, the hollandaise must be creamy but not heavy; Third, the protein cannot be Oscar Mayer; Fourth, the bread must be an English muffin - halved, and; Fifth, an extra touch - e.g. a sprinkle of fresh herbs - will complete the dish. Sarabeth's does each and all elements beautifully: First, the eggs are consistently cooked perfectly - I despise wobbling and runny egg whites (it rather reminds me of, well, snivel; now I have said it); Second, the hollandaise is light and airy; Third, I prefer smoked salmon as the supporting actor as it lends a certain glamour and sophistication, and Sarabeth's smoked salmon is tender but not fatty (some unfortunate and undesirable smoked salmons are so fatty that they are orange version of fatty tuna - wrong!); Fourth, the English muffin here is not the flattened and squashed one of half a dozen in a paper tray, but it has enough height, even when halved, to allow you a satisfying bite and chew, and; Fifth, chopped chives and peppers are perched charmingly and aromatically on the eggs. Ahhh, the thrill of the first cut into the eggs sends a shiver down my spine. Pumpkin Waffle Topped with Sour Cream, Raisins, Pumpkin Seeds and Honey The above two dishes are the tried and true favorites, marked by a bright red stamp of approval. This ""new"" item - pumpkin waffle - for trial on this day was both inventive and disappointing. The use of sour cream, in place of whipped cream, stimulated debate on the merits at the table. However, the first bite solved the issue once and for all: They matched. The sweetness of the pumpkin and the sourness of the cream embraced each other lovingly. In addition, the reduced liquidity level in the sour cream permitted the waffle to remain independently dry - instead of turning the waffle eating into a race against seepage. One thing that I must absolutely emphasize is that the accompanying condiments are served separately in tiny ramkins so that you can add as much as you want and when you want it. Don't I just abhor places where by the time the waffle has arrived, the whipped cream has already half-melted from the heat and eroded a big messy hole in my waffle? Whipped cream stay on the side, please. As a finishing touch, the well toasted pumpkin seeds rendered the crunchy nuttiness to the entire assemble. Therefore, you may wonder what indeed the problem was. The problem was the waffle itself: The texture was dense and heavy. A waffle - we are not talking about Belgian waffles here - should be crispy on the outside but fluffy inside. Sarabeth's pumpkin waffle was neither crispy nor fluffy, which usually indicates either an inadequate amount of baking powder or eggs in the batter. However, in the case of pumpkin waffle, it is more likely due to the wet pumpkin puree, which will make it difficult to rise; thus, the air could not be captured inside to create the requisite fluffiness. Yet, I would have liked to be surprised by a more expert rendition of the pumpkin waffle problem.",1,0,1,The World Digested A.,"Tokyo, Japan",8,119,85

5.0,9/10/2010,"A brunch DREAM. I was seriously hungry last Sunday morning when I came here with my friend, but when I looked at the menu and saw about 10 things that looked amazing to me I knew I was in for something fantastic. After drowning myself in some much needed and delicious coffee, we ordered and split the entrees. Searching for totally opposite types of flavors, we got the Almond-Crusted French Toast with Cranberry-Cherry Sauce and not wanting to be too fat, we ordered the Garden Omelette (broccoli, corn, sun-dried tomatoes, corn and Vermont cheddar) as well. I was incredibly impressed with both dishes, but there was something very very special with the french toast. I've been eating homemade french toast for as long as I can remember. My dad, who's a fantastic cook, has made french toast all my life and 95% of the time restaurants can't touch it.  It's simple, full of flavor (whether it's plain, banana or blueberry), and perfectly golden brown. Only the truly insatiable would look elsewhere. Sarabeth's french toast, while different, indeed rivals my dad's. The crisp outside with almond crust, the lightly powdered sugar, and soft interior was perfectly combined, and to add to its loveliness, the sauce was a revelation. It wasn't soupy or watery, and was bursting with deliciousness. What a relief to have the proper amount of topping!Anyway, the brunch was divine. Luckily, there are a number of locations in the city for everyone to enjoy. I hope the others deliver so strongly.This is worthy of a 5 star brunch review.",1,1,1,Adam H.,"New York, NY",56,13,0

3.0,9/6/2010,"Reviewed: 12/31/2009Good brunch, friendly staff members, and cute decor  This is my third visit to Sarabeth's West and despite the usual wait (they don't take reservations), I was still as excited as a fat kid who is ready to dive into a 3 layered cake. Those who hate crowds however, should probably skip this place because I guarantee you, THERE WILL BE A CROWD with a wait of approximately 20 - 30 minutes. My favorite entrée, the Eggs Benedict w/ Salmon-- Irish smoked salmon and Hollandaise sauce, topped with peppers and chives--was the ultimate indulgence. I would also add that their waffles, buttermilk pancakes, and french toast spread with fresh strawberries and bananas are all equally delicious. I wouldn't recommend their omelettes though, as I did not recall screaming, ""YUMMMYYYY!!"" when I tried them on my first visit. My friend ordered ""Sarabeth's Famous Velvety Cream of Tomato Soup"" - and trust me, it's equivalent to a whole entrée, their soup portions are huge and extremely hearty & filling. The soup tasted nothing like the common tomato soup though...it was rich and creamy (yum!) and reminded me of lobster bisque w/ a hint of tomato after taste. Overall, I would say the service was adequate and the food was good and delightful, but not superb.

4.0,6/19/2010,"Pros:  Disclaimer-- As the backdrop for many celebratory brunches over the course of my life, my fondness for Sarabeth's is likely influenced in no small part by nostalgia. That said, if I were to stumble upon Sarabeth's as a first-timer, I would fall in love with the french toast, or the pancakes, or the berry-encrusted versions of either one, or the complimentary champagne cocktails. Or the general sensation of being treated to brunch on an Easter Sunday by your grandparents (even if you're just out with your fellow 20-something friends).Cons: Even as a non-first-timer, boy do those long lines put me off. Go EARLY! Before noon is best. Also, I will admit that the food is not always worth the pricetag, but consider that you pay for the overall experience, and the free champagne.Balance: PROSBOTTOM LINE: Sarabeth's is a treat.

I was in the mood for fish and luckily the menu has an ample supply of just that. I was stuck on four menu items - fish tacos, shrimp scampi, the halibut special and the lobster roll. After inquiring with the waiter I decided on the fish tacos, which was apparently his favorite, as well as an order of sauteed spinach.My partner in crime ordered the macaroni and cheese app drizzled with truffle oil (her favorite) and the pumpkin ravioli in balsamic vinegar. We also succumb to an order of sangria. Overall, the food was clean, neat and well prepared. The fish taco portions were huge, though I felt the apps were a bit small. The sangria was delicious but the ""pitcher"" they offer is a bit on the tiny side. What I loved most was that the food was simple, yet flavorful.

There was a waitress doing sidework, guess we couldn't bother her?finally greeted, we weren't told any potential specials or given any suggestions.We had to ask what the soup of the day was, and later heard a conflicting report from another staff member near by.  We finally ordered the tea sandwhiches w/tea and a bowl of soup.Second warning: see the waiter look at our table with an 'oh yeah' face after he reappears from the kitchen and he puts our order in. We waited THIRTY minutes to get four squares of bread made into pathetic sandwiches. It was starting to become clear that our waiter's attention was focused on a high order table/large party nearby.We weren't checked on after our food was delivered and never offered more hot water for the small tea pot. The other waitress finally refilled our water glasses after a while but only after the manager/owner noticed and said something (mind you at this point there are four tables seated in the enitre place-quite challenging)waiting...lame sandwich finished, thinking, 'where's the soup?'. It never came. I got so fed up that I asked for the bill- oh, he never put the soup in (he at least admitted it). The lame sandwich and single pot of tea cost TWENTY dollars.

I got the the smoked salmon eggs benedict with hollandaise sauce ($17.50).  The salmon tasted like something I would buy at a gas station vending machine (not that I would buy smoked salmon at a gas station... just saying), and the sauce was watery and metallic tasting.  She got the buttermilk pancakes with fresh strawberries ($16), and they were doughy and heavy. It also didn't help that the four most annoying girls in NY were sitting next to us talking at the top of their lungs and wearing sunglasses indoors (made me think of Larry David, who once said, ""Do you know who wears sunglasses indoors?

I also expected there to not be a wait at such an ungodly hour, yet the four of us were standing around for 15 minutes waiting for a table to open.Regardless, yes, in my opinion this is the best brunch food in the city. Note that it's not the best deal nor the least expensive but no matter what you order, you will be thrilled, satisfied and wishing fervently to come back so you can try everything else on the menu. We had: lemon ricotta pancakes (me) - light, zesty, not overwhelming; buttermilk pancakes (brother #1) [didn't try this]; fat and fluffy french toast (brother #2) - true to its name, fluffy and so, so good; and Goldie lox (friend) - frittata-like eggs with lox and cream cheese baked inside, with a croissant, which was so fresh you could smell it across the table. Each item ran in the $12 - $13 range.Also, thank goodness for the bottomless cup of coffee ($3.50), I must have drank four or five in the course of an hour!

With its simple lines, clean white walls and upholstered seating, the place manages to exude a calm, nurturing atmosphere where you'd expect little girls to have a tea party and yet, it is gender-friendly enough not to encroach on one's own sense of masculinity. And the food is good too. It's best to go to Sarabeth's for brunch. Dinner is fine here but, brunch is the cat's meow in these parts. There are many good options to sample including their french toast, lemon ricotta pancakes and almost any of the egg/omelette variations. Be sure to try the sausage in apples if you are a meatasaurus. They will certainly hit the spot. Oh, and the muffins are a nice combination of moist and substantial. Get there before 10:45/11:00 AM and you will likely not have to wait in a huge line. The friendly staff has always been good to me and my parties.

I was urged to try the Lemon and Ricotta Pancakes w/ Fresh Berries plus the Spinach & Goat Cheese Omelet by my dining companion, who happened to be a fan of the West Side eatery. Both were ordered and arrived in a timely fashion.Looking back, my taste buds shake in anticipation at the thought of those pancakes. I'm not a pancake person, yet Sarabeth's has caused me to reevaluate my feelings about flat cakes. They were the best I ever had in my life and easily fall into the top 5 things I have eaten this year. The omelet was the perfect fluffy balance of goat cheese to egg and spinach.I was highly impressed with the meal and the service.

I'd do me.Only a stone-throw from my new apartment, it almost pains me to say it but I just don't think this place is for me -- I mean, come on people, it's Tuesday at 9am and I'm hungover, why are you all smiling, why are you all wearing the same clothes, why do you all have the same stroller -- seriously, get out of my face.I'm asked: ""Would you like to sit outside?"" Absolutely not, no way, no thank you -- all those buses and taxis and pedestrians -- why do they even call it Al Fresco, what's ""fresh"" about exhaust fumes and dog urine and cigarette smoke... I'm here for peace and quiet -- and a gallon of water, please.Last night, on the enormous terrace of my brand new incredibly beautiful penthouse (don't worry, it's only temporary), I got fantastically drunk with two prominent celebrities, maybe you've heard of them: Grappa and Syrahh, they're kind of a big deal, we're kinda besties... Oh yeah, and one of the stars from Ugly Betty was there, too -- we talked about French organ music and Dallas' amazing Meyerson Symphony Center... So, anyway.Stumbling into my seat, I already knew what I was having -- a soft (meaning slightly runny) omelette with smoked salmon and cream cheese with chives and sourdough toast with butter and blackberry preserves -- plus a side order of sauteed spinach... My thoughts on the food: the eggs weren't ""soft"" at all, the salmon was slightly too salty, the toast was just okay, there was only one tiny chive, I loved how they folded the cream cheese into the eggs, and the spinach was great.Some guy complimented me on my shirt -- I had to look down to see what he was even talking about,  I honestly forgot what I was wearing -- apparently I'm a baseball fan or something.The waitress was incredibly sweet and attentive, but not at all obnoxious -- it's an extremely fine line... The bus-boys were a little too formal and affected, in my opinion, but perhaps that's what everybody else expects them to be.As I staggered out -- right foot, left foot, breathe in, breathe out  -- come on, ol' boy, you can do it -- I was given a few sweet sincere salutations.I'll be back at some point, I suppose, why the heck not... But I really wish they served things like corned-beef hash or biscuits and gravy or chicken-fried steak -- that's what all the old people (one of which I am not, thank you very much) really want, anyhow, and, let's face it, this neighborhood is sort of like an old folk's home.",6,6,4,David L.,"New York, NY",849,1168,1211

The berries were sweet and not preserves so that was a plus. The crab cake benedict came with a side of toss greens topped with light dressing, but I can't think of anything spectacular about it. The yolk was a bit runny, the way I like it, and the biscuit was flaky as it should be. Overall, not a bad dish, but like I said.. could have been better.. possibly the crab cake could use a bit more seasoning. btw there was a decent amount of crab and there were two biscuits and two eggs.we came away with a bill under $30 as we avoided their $3.50 drip coffee,  total rip.. coffee cost what.. cents??.. what's up with that.All, in all, I like the place for their professional service and solitaire, clean, baby-power fresh bathrooms. amen.",0,0,0,Jeff Y.,"Brisbane, CA",105,34,1

The food came luke-warm and, beside pouring coffee into my cup as she rushed by, the wait-person never asked me how the meal was or if I needed anything else. On top of that, there was a line out the door while three tables remained set and ready, during that time I overheard the hostess complaining about her job. In addition, everyone had their winter coats while they ate because it was too cold inside. I kindly asked the hostess if the heat could be turned up and she said it was and that the cold was due to people opening and closing the door. This is New England, it gets cold every winter, why not just put a better heating system in place?I wouldnt have minded so much if this had been a diner, but this is the restaurant that I waited 45 minutes in line for so I could pay $7.00 for a side order of 2 cold fried eggs.  I hardly ever tip below 20% but I did today and explained to the manager why, and promised him that Id give them another chance.

Like many NY establishments, however, egg whites can be substituted for a small surcharge, a small price to pay if that's the type of thing that eases your conscience.Also on the menu are healthier options like granola, fruit & yogurt, and porridges with honey and other variations of toppings, but somehow I have not been as tempted by those items when I arrive and by the time I get a table. I've waited for up to 40 minutes a couple times and the best tip I can give is to arrive before or after peak brunch times (i.e. before 11am or after 2pm).

However, knowing what I know now, I don't think I could ever justify WAITING for the food here.The server was extremely nice and hospitable, although I wish she had been a tad more helpful in the selection process. (When a patron asks which of two items is better, and you reply ""Everything is great here!""....yeah, that's not going to aid in the decision-making.)I ordered grapefruit juice, and they were out. Settled for the orange juice, which was cutely served with a straw. Now, I could be wrong, and oranges on the East Coast might taste entirely different from those on the West Coast, but this juice was sweet. Sweet as in it tasted like tangerine juice. Moh well. And then the food. O hai three little blintzes. When I come in for brunch, I come expecting to be rolled out of the restaurant, my clothes bursting at the seams. The cheese blintzes were tiny, and while served with apple butter that was equally good, maybe filled about a quarter of my stomach. If I hadn't been on a tight budget, I would have ordered something else, but you know what? When I'm paying $12 for blintzes, I sure as hell hope they at least attempt to be filling.

3.0,4/6/2008,"Does it live up to the hype? ... Not in my book. I went out late last night and  went to sleep dreaming about the delicious brunch I was going to eat. We got to Sarabeth's around 1pm and waited about 50 minutes until we were seated. By that time, we were starving and had watched as waiters walked by with tons of yummy plates of eggs and waffles etc.  Which made ordering all the more exciting...I ordered eggs benedict (sans the ham) bc i'm a vegetarian, and the waiter kindly offered to make it eggs florentine (with spinach instead). My bf got the red omelet and my brother got the spinach and goat cheese omelet. We also got the ""morning crunch"" (granola, fruits and yogurt) and a side of potatoes to share.  The food came rather quickly (a definite plus), and the first few bites were really exciting. However, a few more bites, and I realized that it was just the hunger talking. While Sarabeth's has good quality food, the meals are not very inventive or mouthwatering, just standard brunch fare.  All three entrees were okay - the omelets were fluffy (nothing special) and my eggs florentine were on these weird disks of doughy bread, instead of an english muffin... (as advertised in the menu!)As for the sides,  ""morning crunch"" and potatoes were rather mediocre. The granola was definitely not toasted, and did not have a lot of texture or flavor. The potatoes were just sauteed with some peppers, really bland, they definitely could afford to spice this up. (My suggestion would be to cook the potatoes until they get tough on the outside and stay soft on the inside...)I suppose I was disappointed because I set my standards too high... Since I cook so much and really enjoy making  breakfast/brunch, I often go out to restaurants to find new and innovative recipes. While I could go here again for an okay meal, I'd rather try another place where the wait time is less, and the coffee doesn't cost $3.50!(oh yeah the coffee....bleh!)ps.

There are definitely a few things to try, but considering that Sarabeth's is known for the pastries, stick to the sweet stuff. French toast and company make a splash, but occasional trips to the savory side, like the omelets and side items like the chicken apple sausage doused in apple butter, are worth the deviation.The crowd becomes staggering past eleven, so like I said, get there early or wait.

We assumed the service would be on point since there were four servers, and a total of six customers. But you know what they say when you assume...The menu isn't anything impressive, but there's some good home-cooked feel options. I decided to go with the ($25) prix fixe. Tomato soup for starters, tilapia with root vegetable puree and strawberries & cream for dessert. My boyfriend decided on the Ceasar and chicken pot pie.The waitress came to take our drink order (tap water for both of us) and it took about 20 minutes for her to bring it over, and it came with the starters. The soup was actually really good, still had chunks of fresh tomato in it. The ceasar salad was.. a ceasar salad. Nothing extraordinary. The breads in the bread basket were all delicious, but cold. Agh!A while after, the dinner arrived -- they never cleared the starter plates ,so we held them up so the entrees could be placed down. The tilapia (and accompanying sauce) was really good, cooked very well. The ""root vegetables""? Just mashed potatoes, with crispy leeks on top.The pot pie was more of a reconstructed one, with the puff pastry being placed on top in the ramekin. Neither us were really impressed.After sitting there for literally 25 minutes after our entree was done, a waitress finally came over.

I'm not sure it worked. Sure, it was like rays of sunshine in my mouth. But I didn't want sunshine, I wanted cheeeeeeese blinnnnnnntzes. I don't think I even got my blintz itch scratched, because, as you can see, I'm still craving blintzes. Mmm, blintzes. With strawberries on top, not plum preserves.I also tried the pancakes and I don't understand what people find so special about them. The scones are good, but definitely resemble biscuits. This is not a bad thing, as they've got the flaky texture that says the fat was cut in perfectly (the way the biscuits I make wish they tasted). Just didn't expect my scone to taste like a biscuit.So, nothing here is bad, it just feels a little ... off ... to me. I'm not detecting greatness here. Three stars.-----------------------------------------------------UPDATE: I came back here for dinner. One star.My burger was overdone and flavorless. My waitress ignored us, even though the restaurant wasn't crowded. My water glass sat empty from just after I arrived until after the food came. I couldn't even get the check; I wound up just leaving cash on the table. Awful. I know, we'd both ordered the cheapest things on the menu, but I was going to compensate with a ridiculous tip. I didn't. Not even positive how much of a tip I left, seeing as how I couldn't get the check, but I still think I left too much.I was sorry I'd brought my friend here. I'd assured him it was a well-regarded place.",5,2,3,Cheryl C.,"Chicago, IL",23,152,11

Get there by 10:30 AM on a Saturday or Sunday and you are golden, probably a 10-20 minute wait. The BEST cup of coffee, with an endless bottom nonetheless, HEAVENLY. The omelettes are almost too delicious and perfect, without even a hint of brown anywhere... Just BRIGHT YELLOW through out. Perfectly done, absolutely mouth watering. Their bagels and lox are good to. A must for a Sunday morning, especially on a warm, sunny day. Better go in a small group, it's a shorter wait and one can sit around ones table and people watch.

5.0,3/14/2007,"I had my first Sarabeth's experience on Saturday. I wanted somewhere I've never been before, fantastic sweet breakfast food (I gave up sweets for Lent.... oh the horror!), and a place where it's worth it for a friend of mine to travel an hour to get to.Luckily, we only had to wait 20 min and the weather was great. We sat down and perused the menu, I zeroed in on the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes or the Almond-Crusted French Toast. My Jersey (by way of Cali, he'd be offended if I didn't mention that) Friend got the latter and we shared. I loved the pancakes, 4 rounds of soft fluffiness where the griddle was heated at just the right temperature to make it golden. I was moist and lemony, they weren't too sweet. I just wanted to package them in my purse and save it... like Napoleon Dynamite w/ plastic wrap. As for the Almond-Crusted goodness, the slices were thick and dense with egg, which was perfect to hold the slight batter. It was crispy from both the batter and the almonds, drizzled with raspberry syrup.In the end, he said it was worth the hour of travel to eat there.",3,0,2,Michelle R.,"Los Angeles, CA",131,77,14
4.0,3/4/2007,"The last time we went to brunch on the UWS, we went to Good Enough To  Eat but we decided this time, it wasn't good enough, so we went to Sarabeth's. Even at 10 am, there was a bit of a wait, which wasn't surprising. We actually didn't have to wait very long...they told us 20 minutes in line, we waited maybe half that. It was crowded, but didn't bother me because I had an inside seat. Poor Henry...he was on the outside and was jostled by waiters and people waiting on line (note to self: ask for a table in the back next time!). We got coffee right away but had to wait awhile for someone to take our order. Once the orders were placed, the food came maybe ten minutes later. Yum! I ordered the lemon and ricotta pancakes. I highly recommend them, especially if you're a lemon lover (Henry thought they were too citrusy but to each her own, I suppose). I came with fresh blackberries and strawberries. Henry ordered the salmon eggs benedict, which was on a homemade English muffin, which Henry reports as ""alright"" and complained that the bottom of one of the muffins was overcooked and it was overpriced (15 dollars for two poached eggs but it's got lox on it, sooooo....yeah.) We shared a side of chicken sausage, which I recommend. All in all, it was a good experience, the restaurant itself is warm and inviting, the food was pretty good if on the expensive side but I would go back again, maybe earlier next time.

5.0,2/22/2007,"My experience at Sarabeth's weekend brunch started off with a small stroke of luck -- no wait despite how crowded the place was.  Surely this is an atypical occurrence, but I was not impressed initially because the place looked like it was full of hype and no real substance.  The menu didn't seem that impressive and clearly I was judging the cover by the menu (does that even sound right?).  Without a doubt, I couldn't have been more wrong.  Why?  The food was nothing short of spectacular, the service was accommodating, and the prices weren't as bad as I thought.  The Goldie Lox (smoked salmon + eggs) couldn't have been more better prepared sporting a fluffy texture and a heavenly taste. Trying the other dishes (spinach & goat cheese omelette, farmer's omelette) only left me yearning for more. The service was fantastic as was the simple, yet homey decor.

Little did we know that the potatoes would be finely diced, the bacon crumbled, the cheese fantastically melty, and the egg cooked so perfectly that it wasn't a bit browned. Fancy. The choice of 'bread"" is equally fancy. We picked the house-made corn muffin, kind of like cornbread. Served with sweet butter. Good. Of all the fancy pancake/waffle selections, we decided to start with the basic on our first visit. Buttermilk pancake was fluffy and sweet, not heavy or gummy. The fresh bananas and strawberries were fresh and seasonal (at the time). The service was professional. Next time I'm in NY, I'll be back at Sarabeth's.
