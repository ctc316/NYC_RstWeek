4.0,4/27/2019,"Nice, small and quaint place. Had the meatballs, two orders, sizzling shrimp, cheese plate and croquettes. Reasonably priced for 2 people. Made reservations on Open Table last minute.

2.0,4/18/2019,"I visited the Chelsea location recently.  Never dined at the restaurant prior to this visit.  My son recommended it so we all went.  First, the Margarita was great.  But, this is about the food.  I ordered the paella since that is what dominates the menu.  I ordered one of the 3 seafood options.  None of the options had the right assortment of seafood so I asked to substitute.   No problem, but add $5 per serving.  Then, each serving was ~$39 and you had to order a minimum of 2 servings of the paella.  I was very disappointed when the food arrived.  The 2 servings was enough to feed one person (I'm 180 pounds).  Therefore, my 14 year old and I were both hungry after eating the 2 servings.  Also, the seafood was not anything special.  The few shrimp was not remarkable.  The scallops were cut as thin as a quarter.  And the squid was - well squid.  The rice was delicious - just not enough.  Not sure why they don't have more complaints about their portions.",0,0,0,Jerry G.,"Boston, MA",67,6,0
4.0,4/15/2019,"I LOVE this happy hour and have attended many times- but I've also had differing experiences here. I love that they have half off tapas and that its every day. $8 wine and sangria is also great to have as an option.Typically I LOVE the food, but when I went again last Friday it was different: the octopus was mushy, the potatoes were cold, the mussels were just ok. But I really think that that was just a fluke. I will continue to return because usually the food is super yummy!",1,1,1,Viktoriya Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",37,165,115

4.0,2/26/2019,"Generally speaking, this place was good, great for dates or a night out with girlfriends, but I've had better food in Boston (surprisingly). I came here with my 2 girlfriends and we ordered 7 tapas and 2 desserts and a glass of red wine to share. The wine is really expensive $13 for some dry wine (I've had better). I would not recommend getting the sardines; they were bland imo. Sundae was good, not too sweet; we ordered 2 since each sundae came with only 2 churros and there were 3 of us. My favorite was the beef cheeks very tender with just enough flavor and the pear surprised me! The octopus was solid, soft, but still a bit chewy. I personally have had mussels the same exact way better in a couple restaurants, but one of my girlfriends really enjoyed it. My second favorite was the tortilla, just something I've never had before and it tasted great. The shrimp in the garlic oil is extremely hot, even after it stopped bubbling. Two is us burnt our tongues a bit, so I recommend letting a shrimp cool on your plate before eating it. The meatballs were very typical. Personally would not come back again. Also it came out to be about $65/person.",0,0,0,Lisa Z.,"Boston, MA",174,80,212
4.0,2/17/2019,"Let's be honest- if you're browsing this review of a Paella bar, you are almost certainly ok with a dinner loaded with carbs and finished with a side of wine. Is this the place for you if you're trying to exercise dietary restraint? NO. Is it good? Sure! Is it good enough for me to come back on date night with the man? Umm probably not. If I'm going for yummy chewy crunchy rice, I would rather have a bimbim bop. The wine was excellent though. Also for those that are vegetarian, they do have a vegetarian paella but the minimum order is 2 servings so make sure your friend/date is also down for meatless Monday.",1,0,0,Kelsey K.,"New York, NY",2,6,6
5.0,2/2/2019,"Went there during NYC restaurant week and was pleasantly surprised, started with the croquetas and gambas, both delicious.

2.0,2/1/2019,"Came here for happy hour and this place has a pretty good deal. All tapas are half off from 4 - 7 and they had a beer (bottled unfortunately) for $6 and wines/sangria were $8. Not bad considering the location, but the tapas deal is money. We ended up getting the Tortilla Espanola which was quite delicious. Airy and light, perfect appetizer. And then we got the croquettes. I thought that those were so so. They were supposed to have short ribs in them, but I couldn't taste or see them. That being said, it tasted pretty good, just not what I was expecting. We came for restaurant week, and they forgot our tapas, which was a huge bummer. Luckily we had some tapas at happy hour before our actual dinner cause we're fatties, but we were starving as we waited the half an hour for the paella to come out. The paella takes a long time to come out so make sure you order everything at once. When the paella came, it was pretty decent and very filling. We got the carne one. The chicken I thought was very dry, but flavorful. The short ribs were also a little overdone but also very tasty. For dessert we got the churros. They were super dry also (seeing a recurring theme as I'm writing this now) and very dense. I've been to boqueria and their churros are way better. Additionally, we had to sit with a bunch of other people at a communal table, although I think there are some private high tables in the back. I wasn't a huge fan of that. The happy hour tapas are a good deal but it was a struggle to get to the bar because it was so crowded.",1,1,0,Kenneth E.,"Manhattan, NY",354,280,368
5.0,1/26/2019,"Went with a friend to try their restaurant week menu. The food was good. We got the croquetas, chorizo, paella de carne, and the desserts. The paella serves two so you and whoever you're eating with have to decide on the same type of paella. My friend and I opted for the carne. All delicious food. The only down part about our experience were the churros. They were sad and kind of burnt. I've lived a few years in Spain and I know that they shouldn't look like that. But besides that the rest of the food were scrumptious. Service was amazing. Shout out to the manager for always checking up on us, our server Robert for attending us, and to the owner, Lolo for treating us like his own guests!

3.0,1/23/2019,"Nope. Came here during restaurant week but my friend and I just wanted to order off their main. No one bothered to offer us their restaurant week menu anyway. I'm surprised by their high ratings but to each their own. Subpar at the very least. Service was lacking and when they were around, they weren't friendly or useful for that matter. Stopped in at 630 and the restaurant was empty even when we left at 9ish. The tapas were mediocre, though we didn't try much and the paella, meh. It could've been bc we got the meat paella. My friend is allergic to shrimp so we didn't get seafood paella. I'm a big fan of sangria so my friend and I got a pitcher. They only put in Granny Smith apples. Seriously? Thanks but no. Music was quite loud but it could've been bc we were seated next to the speakers. Seating was cramped and quite uncomfortable but standard for NYC. Except here they have high top stools. Please invest in actual chairs so we can lean back and relax while dining. Learned that they have HH specials after I dined through these reviews but only at the bar.

5.0,1/18/2019,"Omg. The seafood paella was by far the best I have ever had. Better than any in Madrid or Barcelona or anywhere else for that matter. The bartender Johanna was super nice. Very full bodied Tempranillo and beautiful Albariño. The rice was so tasty and flavorful. You could eat it by itself. Lots of seafood. If you ask for hot sauce, they give you this hot oil that is very spicy. Perfect. Definitely worth a repeat.",2,0,0,Ty H.,"New York, NY",134,205,25
4.0,1/17/2019,"I was  missing the deliciosas paellas from when we visited Spain. A friend had come here and recommended we come. Wow the food was so delicious they had me speaking Spanish in no time, I wanted mas mas por favor!!! You have to try Arroz Negro, cooked with squid ink, it was everyone's favorite. We ordered 3 different types but that was the winner! Their Sangria is also very good...not too sweet, with a light faint taste of cinnamon. If you like sweet Sangria you will not like this one...I loved it, I don't care for sweet wine. We also ordered the alcachofas, (deep fried artichoke) so tasty.

5.0,1/6/2019,We stopped in here after another dinner plan fell through and we weren't sure where to go. Glad we did! The service here was attentive and friendly from the moment we stepped in the door. They offered communal seating first but it was a tight squeeze so we opted for the less crowded bar. The paella does look amazing but it takes 35 mins to prepare and two servings minimum must be ordered ($28+ per servicing). We opted for several tapas. All our tapas were delicious (get the huevos rotos!) and the sangrias (especially the cava one) were fantastic. A little pricey but great food and quality service here.

We went during happy hour, so all tapas and drinks were half price! Service is excellent and we didn't have to wait long for food.We ordered the bacon wrapped dates, layered eggplant, grilled squid and crispy Brussel sprouts. The bacon wrapped dates were some of the best I had ever had - soft and sweet on the inside and crispy and buttery on the outside. 4 paellas for the two of us worked out perfectly.

3.0,11/30/2018,I came here with a group of 6 people on November 16th 8:00pm. I made reservations the day before and was seated promptly. The Chelsea location only has high chairs. They take check in your jacket before getting seated which was a plus. We were not given water till we finish ordering our food. We got 6 tapas and the Squid Ink Paella. The waiter told us that we should order 3 portion. Each portion was about 28$ each. The tapas were okay. It wasn't spectacular like I was hoping it would be. The paella came out about 30 mins later. It was okay. The seafood they out on top didn't taste fresh at all. The rice didn't have much flavor. Our entire didn't  think it was worth it at all. The entire meal came out to be 350$. We all thought it was not worth it. I would not be back.,0,0,0,Cindy C.,"Flushing, NY",76,59,154

5.0,10/29/2018,"This is an awesome place for Paella lovers. We went as a party of six. We ordered Socarrat, Carne, Arroz Negro Paella, alcachofas fritas (artichoke) and more. The Paellas came in huge metal pans. In each pan, there were plenty of squid, beef, chicken, rice, etc.All the Paellas were flavored perfectly. Maybe it is a little salty for people who prefer lighter flavor. But for me, it is just right amount of savory. The Arroz Negro Paella really stood out with its black color (colored via squid ink)!!! The squid ink didn't really have a distinct flavor so it was pretty much a visual phenomenon.The lighting is very dim (gets really dark at night) and the space in which we were seated was quite narrow. These are the only two aspects I think can be improved. Nevertheless, I think Socarrat is a fabulous place for Paella!

We were a group of five and had three bottles of red wine (all at different price points - all great), some tapas, and paella. The octopus is particularly delicious! A friend is allergic to shrimp so we got the carne paella and it was really delicious. The meat was tender, the snow peas really crisp, and everything was just super flavorful. We only ordered 3 servings since we also got tapas and that was plenty for us.We were sitting at the bar table, which can get a bit loud (not for us but probably for the people next to us after we finished the third bottle of wine.

The place is like a factory with mediocre, overpriced food. They run a disorganized ticket system with the kitchen. I think the ratings are so high because there's not much paella in NYC.

4.0,10/2/2018,"I love socarrat. It is my favorite paella bar in nyc. Reservations are easy to make via opentable and I've never had a problem with anything on the menu. The service is friendly and attentive and the ambiance is at a moderate noise level. I've tried the black squid ink paella (mild-fish taste), the carne paella (salty), the seafood paella, which in my opinion is the best one of the menu as they do not skimp out on seafood here. In order to get paella you must order two portions, which means at a minimum you are paying $52-$60 for paella. Paella takes the longest to come out so I recommend ordering that as soon as you sit down. A two portion order can be shared amongst 4 people as long as the table is sharing other tapas.

There are obviously empty tables on the other side of the restaurant with better seating and space, which until we left, there are still empty spots.

[2] Ensalada de Burrata y Remolacha - fresh burrata, roasted beets, orange and beet puree. This was a refreshing dish and the only vegetable dish we opted for that evening. The burrata and beets went well together. [3] Carrillada - braised beef cheeks in apple marmalade spinach served with potatoes and tarragon. The braised beef was tender and flavorful. --PAELLA--[1] Pescado y Marisco - shrimp, scallops, squid, mussels, cackles, white fish with veggies. This was hands down the table favorite. The chefs are very generous with the seafood and size of this paella! Great flavors all around. [2] Arroz Negro - shrimp, calamari, white fish, scallops, on squid ink sofrito. This was the second favorite of the night, we have a bunch of seafood lovers so that's not a surprise. The squid ink always adds a nice flavor to the rice. [3] Carne - short ribs, chicken, chorizo, snow peaks and mushroom sofrito. This was the third favorite but still delicious.

We decided to order the squid ink paella and it was so amazing. I recommend calling it in maybe like 15 min before you arrive because it takes a while to make. There are two negatives here.

Gambas Al Ajillo; sizzling shrimp, olive oil, garlic, guindilla peppers served with soft bread, it was so delicious that we all delved into it and practically finished it within minutes. Other tapas were Chorizo and fried artichoke 'Alcachofas Fritas'. Both are good as well and we enjoyed it together with a fine bottle of Rioja.For main entrée, my friend suggested Paella De La Arroz Negro, it was for three of us to share and came with squid ink sofrito, fave beans, piquillo peppers and shrimp, calamari, scallops and white fish on top.

Perhaps the sangria is making me sound ridiculous but I feel like I wanted to like the negro more...because it feels like a foodie kind of dish with the squid ink... but I think the Pescado y Marisco may have actually been better to be honest. If you're anything like me, my suggestion is to wait for what I like to call ""crispification"" to complete on the bottom of the pan. Please check this place out. If you don't have time to wait for paella you can't go wrong with tapas and sangria.",3,0,2,Daniel M.,"Royal Palm Beach, FL",177,53,126

5.0,7/25/2018,"My favorite favorite paella and sangria place in the city! This place is perfect for groups (4-6) since you can get a pitcher of sangria to share and at least 2 different paellas. My favorites are the pescados and the arroz negro (squid ink)! All their apps are amazing and never disappoints. I would def recommend: croquetas del dia; coca del dia; and pulpo a la gallega! As for their sangrias, OMG just try one and you'll fall in love! I usually get the red sangria since I don't like my drinks too bubbly or sweet and its PERFECT!

Only had reservations available for the high tops which was fine but not as fun for a sit down dinner. We ordered the red sangria which was delicious. Got the potatas bravas and cheese plate along with the vegetable paella. The paella was really good and reminded me of some that I had in Barcelona. Service was slow and our waiter only checked on us before we ordered and at the end when we wanted our check. We could have ordered another sangria glass but decided to pass.

4.0,6/24/2018,"I came here with a group of 14 and made a reservation a few weeks in advance. The space is great for that and I highly recommend a reservation regardless of your party size. I chose this place because it's good for a diverse group of eaters: vegan, dairy free, meat free, and everyone else. The restaurant was really accommodating for everyone and we all enjoyed the food and sharing/tasting. Here's the thing though - they charge $25 per person for a paella regardless of size or sharing. So if it's a paella to share for 2 it's $50. If you want a 3 portion paella it's $75. I shared the vegan one which had rice and veggies. Very good - but no protein and we both left kinda hungry. Someone else got one covered in seafood: mussels, clams, shrimp, etc for the same price. Then 1/2 the table drank while the other 1/2 didn't. So my only recommendation would be to ask ahead of time to separate the bill. Some of our party got a great deal while the other 1/2 WAY overpaid. I chose this place because I'd eaten here as a group before. Everyone loved the food and we had a great time.

You have to sit at the bar to get the happy hour prices btw.The tapas were fine. We got the octopus and brussel sprouts. The happy hour portions are definitely smaller than the regular portions, or at least they were smaller than the pictures we saw on yelp. We also got the seafood (octopus, shrimp etc) paella which was really salty. The pan looks really big, but don't be fooled, the food part is really shallow. Overall, for the price, even at happy hour, the food was fine at best. The service though was so slow. We didn't get the first tapas (the octopus) until probably 30 minutes after we were seated and we didn't get the paella until almost an hour in and we had to ask for the brussel sprouts. We also just got water, but they never came by to refill our glasses.

We were sitting at a round table next to the window, very comfortable for 3 but good for 4. We were eating tapas of fried artichoke, beef cheeks, cold cuts and grilled octopus while watching people walking their dogs or making phone calls outside in the rain, cosy inside and chilled out side.

1.0,5/5/2018,I had heard great things about this place so we made reservations to check it out. My sister and I took our parents here and the reservation was for 4:30pm on a Sunday afternoon so we were expecting the place to be pretty quiet. When we got there we were shown a high top table right by the door. We requested to be moved to different table as it was rather cold to sit by the door that kept opening. The management staff was really unhelpful saying all empty tables in the restaurant has reservations. I could see how this could be true but the entire place except for some customers sitting at the bar was empty. We reluctantly sat down and then realized our table was uneven. We again requested to be moved but was met with so much resistance we ended up just leaving. I was pretty mortified how poor the customer service was.

4.0,5/5/2018,"My friend and I stopped by here for the happy hour special. Service was fine and the atmosphere is nice. It's a cute date spot or to just catch up with a friend. The tapas were half off for happy hour but we didn't get to order much since we opted to the pescados paella. The red sangria was good. Nothing spectacular but worth getting from the happy hour menu. My friend actually got the rose sangria which isn't discounted for happy hour but it was delicious! Better than the red sangria. The paella initially looked huge but the dish is shallow and plated in a huge pan. We really liked the crunchy parts around the edges. They weren't generous with the seafood but not stingy either. It was all just the right amount. It's also pricey. You need to order a minimum of two servings and each serving can cost about $28 and up depending on what time of paella you order. With that said, we did appreciate all the different kinds of paella offered. They all sounded so good.

Also, there are no tables with actual chairs - only stools. I'm a young, fit human being and yet it was totally uncomfortable not being able to lay back and relax while paying for my expensive meal.

4.0,4/23/2018,"We were excited to have paella at this decently rated place. We were able to catch them during their happy hours (tapas and sangrias), but I was told you have to order at the bar. I was disappointed that it took us 15-20 minutes for someone to pour us water. They weren't busy either. Actually he was cleaning utensils most of the time. I had to make sure the waitor didn't walk away and took our order then. He seemed taken aback. Naturally the squid ink pasta, which I read was less saltier, took about 35 minutes to come out. Remember as noted on the menu. It's two orders minimum, so basically $26x2 for the paella. Thanks to the same waiter, we ordered a tapas because we were pretty hungry. Additionally we ordered a drink. The food was great. A little cold for the mushroom tapas but I think it was supposed to be cold and hot in other areas?It also took awhile to get hot sauce. Actually we were asked to try their aeoli sauce instead. It took another 15-20 minutes to get our bill after we finished. There seemed to be no order or urgency for a not very crowded restaurant.

3.0,3/29/2018,"I've decided to give this place three stars out of five because of the mediocre amount of dedication in making the food. Having a party of four, we were lucky enough to be seated on a Friday night due to the extensive amounts of reservations made and the number of people there was already there. If we came even a second late, chances are we would have had to wait for a minimum an hour. I've read reviews written highly on their paellas being delicious here, so we took the opportunity to try it out. We started out with two appetizers: 1. Tocino con Huevos, a braised pork belly with reduction sauce served with a sunny side up egg along with potato crisp fries.2. Canelones Espinaca, a four-piece pasta like stuffed with Spanish and melted torched cheese on top. The braised pork was very interesting very tender meat with a crispy skin attached, in my opinion, the sauce was a little salty. For the Canelones Espinaca, it was pretty good despite the fact the cheese was burnt on top creating a subtle burnt taste which may have destroyed the potential of an excelling appetizer. Moving on to the main entrees, there were two paellas orders: 1. Huerta, Eggplant, broccoli, artichokes, tomatoes, chickpeas, snow peas, red and green pepper sofrito. Instead of snow peas, we had regular peas. The flavors were there, very subtle but there were there. It also melted in the mouth until a waiter graciously helped up mix up our paellas, not sure whether he was hoping we'd be out soon or wanted us to enjoy all of it. It was such a shame, not only was the bottom of the paella was tremendously burnt, the waiter mixed it in making it harder to enjoy anymore. The burnt parts of the paella overwhelmed the whole thing and it just became inedible in my opinion. No one likes to eat burnt food and having the waiter scrape the last pieces of burnt paella just really killed it. 2. Pescado y Marisco, a paella consisting of shrimp, scallops, squid, mussels, cockles, fish, English peas, tomato, and onion sofrito. Although seafood isn't my thing, I still somewhat enjoyed it. Overall, I felt really disappointed after coming into this place having high expectations.

2.0,2/6/2018,"Came here to celebrate helping my friend get a new gig and also returning since coming here for the first time back in 2013.Honestly I didn't even know I've been here before, and wanting to try this place only to find out that I have. It was a nice reminder of how good this place was back in 2013. The service was great, and I've never had such good paella before, not to mention it was my first time having paella. It was good times with a bunch of friends and new people I've met.Fast foward to 2018, and well the experience was definitely not like it was the first time. My friend and I choose this place for restaurant week, and since it was a weekday afternoon, the place was rather quiet as expected. When my friend arrived we were quickly seated, and welcomed warmly by the waiter. Everything was going fairly well. We looked over the menu, and decided to get separate dishes so that we can share and try different dishes.My friend and I just talked and caught up on our lives, but noticed our order was taking rather long. I glanced around and it seemed like everyone else was also getting their orders pretty late too. So it seemed like the norm. When our appetizers finally came, I was already so hungry that my friend and I demolished the small bread basket, so I asked another waiter for a small basket of bread, but was confronted with a deep sigh and a look of annoyance. Not what I expected.I noticed that one of our appetizers were missing, and waved down the same waiter who gave us a sigh of annoyance and told him about our missing appetizer. He then proceed to tell us that we never placed an order for our Patas, and then ask us if we would like to place an order for it but it would come later. I was annoyed but agreed to it, only to have our original waiter come back to us and apologize for the mix up. I'm grateful for the apology otherwise we would've been charged twice for the Patas.So on to the food, the food itself wasn't as memorable as the first time, I'm not sure if the quality of the food went down, but the paella just seemed bland and didn't stand out like it did the first time I came here.The appetizers were ok, and the only two appetizers that really stood out was the Patas...WOW that was really good! It was like a delicious mayo, spicy sauce homefries, but not homefries and better! The other appetizer that was really good was the Croquettes, it was really creamy and delicious, with a nice crisp on the outside. The presentation of the croquettes weren't great though but it definitely tasted better than it looked!The reason why we come here is for the paella, it was really bland. For the price of the dishes, I think I would've found another spot that would've charged less on the the food for the same taste and quality minus the Patas and Croquettes.I'm really disappointed in the service as they didn't really seem courteous to the restaurant week guest, I really had high hopes. The service was really mediocre, with the exact pairing with the food. Maybe it was just a bad day.",1,1,1,Sam P.,"New York, NY",182,15,50

4.0,2/2/2018,"Restaurant week #3... tbf (to be fair) there were about 10, 2 tops ran by 2 guys. One (our server) was apologetic and sweet, apologizing for completely forgetting our patatas. The other (shorter, stouter) gave an exasperated, audible sigh when we asked for more bread...!The shrimp ajillo was so flavorful but should've been placed in the cast iron skillet near raw as it bubbled away in its own juice, oil and garlic for about 5 minutes after it sat on our table. Delicious and you do need the extra bread to sop up all the excess delicious garlic oil. The chef's choice croquettes tasted of the smoothest cream and cheddar cheese with greens blended in between. It was super decadent. The chicken, Brussels, fava and veggie soccarat of the day was a huge hit. The supple short grain rice was cooked in broth to a perfect al dente and finished in butter that resulted in a bit of char and stickiness around the edges of the pan. If our paella del dia is a testament to Soccarat's soccarats, we are instant fans. The yellow seafood shellfish soup was a bit salty and a over-cooked while the peas were semi hard. Served in a pan, it was also difficult to eat. It would've made more sense to offer bread (bowl) or serve this over rice. It was just ok. The long awaited patatas finally came and we were not disappointed. It lived up to the hype I had created with my companion as I'd raved about it being the best item on the menu. He whole heartedly agreed as we divvied up each morsel of the perfect little cubes of crisp silken mash coated with hot salsa and mayonnaise. Beyond full, I'd almost forgotten we had one course left.But it's worth mentioning. Their flan is really good. Housemade to a creamy consistency- light and sweet, it was hard to stop. The churros has a chewy tapioca flour thickness and outside crunch that was so pleasant. The chocolate sauce was just fine. Soccarat is a solid lunch or dinner fare. Their service can be a hit or miss.",1,0,1,Elisa H.,"New York, NY",1731,578,1105

3.0,12/9/2017,"Cute spot in Chelsea. Tucked away on 19th street. Sat at the bar area and ordered a glass of wine, the dates app and the paella (mix of chicken and fish). I give a three because I wasn't super blown away by the paella. Although they do come around and help you scrape the crispy part once you get toward the bottom - using a special tool. That part was nice because with paella you are always stuck scratching away! The chicken was a little dry, but overall food was solid. Service on the other hand was not. Felt completely neglected by the bar tender and it was a seeming inconvenience that my husband and I were there (this was a Saturday night at around 530pm, and it was not crowded).

The waiter was very insistent on my boyfriend and I ordering tapas (he recommended a total of 4 including the paella). WTF? That is too much food for two adults. The waiter wouldn't stop insisting on ordering tapas and it was really uncomfortable. The menu says a serving of paella is $28, so thinking we would pay $28 plus tax and $ for the drinks we ordered (a Diet Coke and an iced tea), we ended up paying $100 for two drinks, paella, and a small tapa. Outrageous. The paella was ""2 servings"" but we never asked for two. We asked for one to share and were surprised by the huge check at the end. Confusing menu and okay service.

5.0,10/2/2017,"Summary: A great place to stop by for a drink and a snack or a full dinner, especially during September and October when the full length windows are open and the breeze blows into the dining room. Room: comfortable and inviting, with warm wooden chairs and tables in the dining room and a surprisingly comfortable bar if you're so inclined (which I am.)Service: We sat at the bar, which has full service and an attentive and friendly bartender. Food: The wines are well chosen and we tried a few--all good. We finally ordered the Domenio del Cuco, which reminded us how good Spanish wines  can be without costing a fortune.  The Iberian ham is delicious, though machine sliced. Even the pan con tomate was terrific: toasted just right and loaded with garlic and oil. The pulpo was mostly tender and richly seasoned, though a few pieces were a bit chewy. But it all came down to the paella mariscos: buttery, tender pieces of flaky white fish, tender shrimp squid and other seafood over a bed of richly seasoned rice. If you can stand to let it sit for a few minutes, the heat of the cast iron pan will crisp the rice on the bottom, which you can scrape up to create a crunchy rice mixture that is absolutely amazing. Let me tel you, with a plate of that paella and a glass of wine you will be so very happy to be alive. Value: Soccarat is not exactly cheap, but it is a good value. The tapas are moderately priced and a few with a glass of wine will make an excellent dinner.

4.0,9/18/2017,"We wanted a selection of tapas so passed on trying the paella which can only be ordered as a serving for two and seemed like it would be too much food for the two of us if we preceded it with 2 or 3 tapas.    We were also starving and the paella would require a wait of 30+ minutes.   We ordered a selection of 6 tapas plus the Jamon iberico board.   This was the perfect amount of food for the two of us for dinner and we had room to split a dessert.Our tapas selections varied from excellent, the bacon wrapped stuffed dates were our favorite, but the octopus and the goat cheese portion of the Napoleon de verduras were also very tasty.    The chorizo, meat board and pan con tomato were all good, though not outstanding, and our only big disappointment was with the calamares, which were a bit too chewy.     But as a selection of small plates go this was a success.We were a bit unhappy that our food came all at once since we would have preferred to have only 2 or 3 items at a time allowing for a more relaxed meal pace.   Our waiter, however, had wanted us to order everything at the beginning, though after we had finished everything we were asked if we wanted to order any more.  I think the problem came because the place caters more to people ordering only a couple of tapas while they wait for their paella.   Otherwise, service was good.   The only seating was at high tables with stools.    Not my favorite, though not as uncomfortable as I feared.    And, I have no idea why a Spanish restaurant would close at 11:30 (11pm on weeknights), but they do.",0,0,0,Lynn S.,"Croton-on-Hudson, NY",0,47,0

I planned to order Paella only but the bartender told me it took more than 30 minutes to cook the Paella, so I'd better order something else while waiting for it.

First we were seated at a tiny table next to loo despite a rez, not good. Started with a pitcher of the rose sangria which was AT LEAST 3/4 ice with almost no fruit - an astounding ripoff! Tapas of bacon wrapped dates were good, calamar tasty but TINY portion, tomato bread dry with thin old topping. Pricey langosta paella dry and chintzy, don't bother. Service was not so friendly. However we heard a nearby table get a free dessert cuz they complained to their server about the lousy sangria. We were quiet so nada for us, we paid for our churros.

Factor in the cost ($120 for two sangrias, two cokes and the food) and the fact that our table in the far back with exposed pole offering little room and I just wouldn't recommend this one. The (blue cheese) croquettes were good but nothing extraordinaire. The ahi tuna tapas was too warm/lacking some flavor but it was ok. The paella was downright bad. We had the first one on list (chicken, beef, white fish, mussels, shrimp). It was so over cooked/blah--dry chicken/beef, missing spices, mussels were ok but a few weren't opened and the shrimp was soooo terrible.

He did a lot of research and knew exactly what to order when we got there haha we ended up getting the Jamon Iberico and Arroz Negro.Jamon IbericoI'm not a huge ham person, but the ham at Socarrat was delicious. It's a 36 month aged Spanish black foot pig, not sure what that is exactly but it was so good. They paired the ham with a few pieces of bread and they went so well together. I could go for some more of that ham right now. Definitely recommend getting the Jamon Iberico if you're stopping by.Arroz NegroI was so excited for this dish, but was so disappointed! I know Socarrat is known for their squid ink paella, so we knew we were going to order it when we got there. We had to order the shrimp on the side because my boyfriend is allergic.

The mildly sweet dates in the inside paired well with the saltiness of the bacon. The croquettes were all right. They were perfectly fried but dry and you could barely taste the chorizo in there. For our mains we split the lamb and the paella. The lamb was slightly overcooked and came out a bit dry. The vegetables in the dish were very flavorful but the lamb lacked seasoning. The paella serving was bigger than expected but was dry and lacked flavor as well. For dessert we ended with the flan and churros. I love flan generally and it was a decent flan. I am used to a more solid flan but the texture of this flan was more like a creme brulee. The meal was decent for $29 but I would be disappointed with the food if I had to pay more.

2.0,6/18/2017,"Our friend really wanted paella and since we had a large group, we had to do prefixe menus if the party is larger than 8 people. The reservation was easy to make - however they never followed up with which pre fixe menu I needed to choose so on the day of it was a mad dash for me to figure out which option. Theres pre fixe menus at the $45/$60/ and up range. They also have drink packages for dining in, which hindsight if our group chose, it would have cost the same (we had 2 pitchers of sangria for the table and a few ordered glasses of wine, and non alcoholic drinks so in the end doing the wine and beer and non alcoholic drinks would have been ideal). We arrived on time for our reservation and was seated in the smallish room off to the side with a long table connected to the bar. The chairs were basically high stools - interesting for a large group dinner. I have to say I may have chose a different place had I known that was the seating arrangement.Now, the taste of the food wasnt bad at all, I would give them a 3.5, the issue was with portioning. The paella pans are huge - and for the $60 pre fixe we chose 5 tapas, 3 paellas and 2 desserts. We had one vegetarian so they threw in a fourth vegetarian paella. The tapas were shared amongst 4 ppl (we had a total of 12) so they brought out 3 sets of tapas. The paella however was 4 large pans for the entire table. The pans look huge but are shallow. You can barely scrape it. It was just not worth the $60 prefix. Then 3 sets of 2 types of desserts came out again to share. Everyone left content in terms of the quantity of food. But for a group of 12 to clean the entire table of dishes, it means there wasn't enough to go around. Heck we all even ate the vegetarian paella!The desserts are so cheap - you would think they can afford to give every person in the party their own sampler instead of making 4 people share 2 measly plates. Service was ok, it was the busboys who brought out the food and nothing more. Honestly we were part of a bachelorette celebration and they did nothing to make it too memorable - and we ended up having dinner as a group at a famous Steakhouse in midtown next day - the bill was the exact same price and we were stuffed!!!! Such a shame.. I really wanted to like this place as I've had it bookmarked for such a long time.",1,0,0,Sasha C.,"New York, NY",6,939,497

If you can make it through all of that, you're in for a real treat. The paella is awesome! Some of the best I've had! A group of 5 of us shared 2 paellas and it was more than enough for all of us. Throw in some drinks and we had a great time. Service is awesome and the staff are super friendly. We had bottomless sangrias and let me tell you, I never saw the bottom of my glass.

I've even ordered paella to go from them and the price is affordable. The only reason why I'm not giving a 5 star is because every time I've ordered a drink from them it was way too strong or way too sweet.

It did have a spicy kick to it so caution if you can't handle the spice.Patatas bravas: Fried potatoes- nothing so special about it.Pulp a la gallega: This may have been one of my favorite apps.

Squid Ink: I loved it! it was my favorite. it was crunchy rice in the bottom and the rice was covered in squid ink and its something different about it that made me keep reaching for this.2. Socarrat: There was a mix of seafood and meat but it wasn't my favorite. 3. Carne: Lots of meat and paella. If you're a meat lover, you'd probably enjoy this.Dessert:We had the churro sundae.

3.0,5/21/2017,"For a restaurant that specializes in paella, I think Socarrat did a pretty good job in upholding its name as a paella bar. I came here with my family (a party of 11) so we booked a reservation for a prix fixed dinner. This prix fix includes a choice of 5 appetizers, 3 paellas (very large), and a dessert. Appetizers:Patatas bravas: these were fried potatoes covered with a spicy cheesy sauce. Crunchy and delicious and not too spicy.Croquetas del dia: a very crispy exterior and a soft creamy interior, these croquets were my favorite. Pulpo a al gallega: tender octopus and potatoes fried with garlic... so good.Atun: Lightly seared tuna seasoned with spices and sesame seeds served along side a light salad and tangy dressing.Paella:Soccart: this paella contained a mixture of seafood and meat. The rice was cooked perfectly and all the seafood was spot on. However, I felt that the rice didn't have the crunch at the bottom like it should have. Arroz negro: Now if you like squid ink then this is definitely your dish. This was my favorite one.   The squid ink that is mixed into this paella not only lends a distinguished jet black color but it also offers a unique musty seafoody taste that if you enjoy, you will love. tender pieces of squid through out and huge chunks of fish and scallops on top. Just great, except for that face that once again it did not obtain the crunchy bottom that i was hoping for. Carne: The MEAT paella. if you love meat then youll love this. This paella was able to deliver that crunchy bottom that I was looking for. Lastly for dessert: Churro sticks in chocolate sauce. And here is where dinner fell short. It's like they build you up the whole night and close off with a bite that is far from the perfect end. Overall i enjoy my experience here. I recommend the prix fix menu ONLY if you have a large party, other than that just come for the paella.",0,0,0,Vincent T.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",379,297,260

I expected fluffy and light churros served with a side of coffee cream but it was small and hard pretzel like churros. I think the meal was delicious but the desserts here don't close off the entire experience how I would've liked.

She has been here multiple times, with no issues.  Upon arrival- the owner and waiter greeted us. Owner spent an inordinate amount of time explaining the menu to us- which was nice but weird. I mean, we can read, right?  We informed him of the shellfish allergy which he wrote down. We ordered some sangria and the paella that had no shellfish in it.  Owner suggested the croquettes for an appetizer. OK. Said croquettes arrive, my friend eats two. Owner returns (AGAIN)- at this point he was being ridiculous- we could not even finish a conversation he was hovering so much. He asked how we liked his suggestion. We said we liked them and asked what was in them. He says... SHRIMP. WHAT. THE. HELL.  He realized his HUGE mistake and starts apologizing. Ok. My friend starts popping Benadryl's and we start mapping hospitals should she have a reaction. Waiter comes over, also apologizes. Super, super great waiter, btw. Now, I would have left it at that. Mistakes do happen, even though this one could have been avoided. However, owner returns and tells us that allergies are ""psychological"". What? Unacceptable. I inform him my friend has had to go to the ER in the past-how on earth is that psychological? So now I am beyond livid, and my poor friend is just hoping she won't end up in the ER. Waiter was amazing, kept checking on us. Owner comes back- and tells us some ridiculous story about some woman in his village in Spain, way back in the day. Apparently this woman was really sick (with what he had no clue), and was expected to die! But guess what, y'all? She lived another 20 years! Yet another example of mind over matter, I suppose. What. An. Asshole.  Anyway, they ended up comping the entire meal, which I am sure the owner was pissed as hell about. Food we ate was good, but the mood was ruined and we were super scared my friend was going to have a reaction. Waiter was amazing but owner could not just have apologized for his mistake and left it at that. Also, their menu just said croquettes, there was no note about what was in them- because apparently they put whatever the hell they feel like putting in their food depending on their mood.  Needless to say, I will not return, and please be careful eating here if you have any sort of food allergy.",0,0,0,Maria J.,"New York, NY",1,20,4

We were still going to wait and try the food one way or another, but I always appreciate when the restaurant takes the time to acknowledge things like long wait times. The drinks of course were an even nicer touch, though not necessary, of course!The food was spot on.

It looked like most people had to do the same too.There was a prefix dinner menu for Valentine's Day but we opted out of it because it would have been way too much food and drinking for the two of us.  Instead we got 2 glasses of rose sangria, carrillada, arroz negro paella, and churros which filled us pretty nicely. The rose sangria and carrillada were delicious. The carrillada dish was beef cheeks mixed with potatoes and a marmalade. I would recommend it as an appetizer.Then the paella came out and it was huge and sizzling! I was so excited because it smelled so good. It's looks deep but it's not, yet it's perfect for two people.  The first bites were amazing because the dish was still hot and the rice unburnt. Towards the end the rice was all burnt so you have to call the waiter over to help you scrape it off quickly. It was a great dish.

They cook the rice then sprinkle which ever type of paella  you ordered add ins on top so the flavor isn't cooked in with the rice, it definitely was not worth $50. I asked a question about the fish and the waiter was unsure and did not try to get the answer until I insisted that he went to the kitchen to find out which type of fish it was as I had a certain allergy to a specific fish.

2.0,2/16/2017,"I had been going to La Churreria for years and always wanted to try Socarrat, so when my boyfriend decided to book them for Valentine's dinner I was beyond excited. He booked the 19th street location instead of the Nolita one because this one has better Yelp reviews. He confirmed over the phone twice, that they were serving both the regular and Valentine's prefix menu.We get there at 8:30 for our 9pm reservation and waited at the bar while our table was being set up. I ordered a margarita which was good, got me tipsy and by now I was really enjoying myself and looking forward to the food. At 9:10, we get directed to our ""table"" which was basically a long dining table with stools on each side and couples sitting across from each other. My elbows were inches away from the the ladies on either side, everyone looked uncomfortable and it was unromantic to say the least. We spoke to the hostess and she was very nice and got us a more private table at a different part of the restaurant. The servers here were the really fake friendly kind. First off, the guy serving us told us we HAD to order from the pre fix menu no matter what. We asked him to check with the hostess and he came back to us with the regular menu. So do all the staff have the same information or no? Its not that big of a place for people to not know what's going on. We order appetizers that came out at a decent pace. For our mains, we ordered 2 servings of the Pescados y mariscos, but I asked them to include only shrimp, mussels, clams, and scallops. Waiter says no problem at all. Our paella shows up looking like it had been robbed on the way. There were probably 4 pieces of shrimp and a handful of mussels and clams and NO scallops. When I point out to the waiter that they forgot the scallops, he tells the kitchen, who then tell him to come back and CHECK. So now we basically dig through the paella to prove to this man that there were no scallops. The most casual non caring apology follows with no offer to compensate us in some way, or bring us the scallops. In that moment, trying to enjoy a romantic night, we let it go, but I checked out their paella pictures on yelp and we were basically served 90% plain rice for $52. I feel cheated. What we were served is SO different from all the paella pictures other patrons have put up.Mind you, I've had paella in Spain and Italy and that's were I fell in love with it. This paella was under seasoned and SO under cooked. We ate less than half of the whole thing and sent it back. The server never bothered to ask if we liked it or why we didn't eat it at all. We tipped them just as we would have if we had great service. In the end, the waiter chased after us as we were leaving because he forgot to add some drink to the tab. Honestly I thought he had comped it for the shit paella that we got served without the scallops that I paid and tipped for. I'm giving it 2 stars because the cheese plate was decent and the bartender seemed to give a shit. Other than that, I'm pissed because my boyfriend spent close to $200 and we were met with sub quality food and disinterested service that really put a damper on our mood.

This is ridiculous.... even if we chose the regular menu, as part of ""great"" service, if you notice that we table is ordering the same things that are available for less, tell them! Guess what, the customer will always realize what happened and assume they were wrongfully charged or misinformed!! Horrible and selfish! 2. After we ate, we had a round of drinks to celebrate and while we were toasting, a MOUSE ran out of the kitchen, roamed round the back seating area where we were and ran back in the kitchen. -- This is beyond disgusting. The way it was handled when we mentioned it to our server was a cheap acting skit. She was shockingly calm and tried to convince us she'd never seen one before. All that was offered was a piece of receipt paper to write down our emails (which we did) with a promise that the general manager would contact us ASAP with an explanation and apology. We have yet to hear a word. This is whats truly unforgivable. Our awful experience was topped off with silence when we should've been given the manager's information as well as being asked for ours. 3. After that incident I walked out of the restaurant and barely made it into our cab before I lost my dinner. The thought of eating a meal from a kitchen with a rodent problem is beyond terrifying. As an unhappy customer, please do better. Try to find a way to fix it because I do not see myself going back to this restaurant, or referring it to others.",1,1,0,Jen U.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,39,8
5.0,1/31/2017,"I love Spanish food, especially Tapas and Paella. While my mother was visiting us, she wanted to get some good paella. Who can blame her? There has been this Paella Bar that I have been wanting to go to, so we decided to go during the week day lunch, when it should be rather slow.The inside was very narrow and long, and have window at the front entrance and all the way back. The rest was lit with rather dimmed lights, creating cozy, romantic, and somewhat warm atmosphere. I liked how the interior had that rustic, antique look to it with red brick wall and dark furniture.We heard that the paella is not that huge in portion, so we decided to order a sandwich in addition to paella. We chose Steak Sandwich. The sandwich was bigger than we expected. The steak was cooked really well, soft, juicy, and packed with flavor. I didn't have too much of expectation for the sandwich, but it turned out pretty great.Now, the paella. They have eight kinds of paella to choose from. Yes, I said it right, EIGHT!!!! No wonder they call themselves the ""Paella Bar"" with that many selection. We went with Pescados y Mariscos, which comes with shrimp, scallops, squid, mussels, cockles, white fish, and English peas. It was brought to our table in a piping hot pan, which was awesome. They were right about the amount, it was smaller portion than I thought it would be. They do not do mountain of paella, but they do quality paella.When we were getting to the bottom of the pan, the waitress came back (as promised she would), and scraped off all the crispy rice on the bottom for us. We always loved the little burned rice on the bottom, so we were excited... And it was so delicious!!! We were very happy with our food, it was really tasty and and the staffs were all friendly. I would definitely go back again for more paella!",2,2,3,June S.,"New York, NY",212,624,4546

4.0,1/29/2017,"3 of us came here for restaurant week. It was a bad day to go, raining and windy. But the food was so good that I didn't regret coming over. From the restaurant week menu, I'll ranked the tapas to be in the following order: 1) Croquetas del día- crispy and creamy. Well flavored.2) Gambas al ajillo- shrimp was decent, but the oil was so flavorful and addictive that we finished the bread to soak the oil up.3)Atún- seared tuna was cooked nicely- rare in the middle. However, it lacked of flavor and we often have to soak it with the oil from gambas for flavor.For main course, the table need to share a paella, and its portion will be adjusted for the party size. I was a little disappointed with this arrangement as we could not try different flavor. The waitress response to our request was cold. No sugar coating, not apologetic. She could have responded nicely. We got Arroz negro which was really nice. They also served a small garlic sauce on the side. Scallop was cooked close to rare, and other seafood was cooked nicely. Rice was well seasoned and savory. There's some crispiness at bottom and the waitress scrapped the rice off the pan near the end of the meal.For the dessert, I recommend getting the flan over the churros. Flan was very flavorful and better than most places I tried. Churros is pretty standard.",1,0,0,Bevano L.,"Jersey City, NJ",86,106,263
1.0,1/28/2017,"Overpriced and underwhelming. I was so excited for some good Spanish cooking, but this place did not deliver, at all. The tapas were good, but way too small and not really intended for sharing with 2+ people who have any semblance of an appetite. The paella was incredibly overpriced ($25 per person) and barely palatable. The seafood was undercooked and really lacking in the dish as was the flavor. On top of the subpar food, the service was terrible. The waitress seemed to be put out by everything she did from remembering to explain the menu to refilling our water glasses to bringing out our food. Everything seemed like it was such an effort.

2.0,1/25/2017,"Overrated, overpriced, and good for people who don't know the real thing.SERVICE: 2 out of 5 starsThe hostess didn't even great us - no smile, nothing. She had a long face as she took her time pulling our my reservation (there was no one in front of us).The waitress was okay. We were asking her questions about the food before we ordered and she was obviously annoyed. When I asked her about the arroz caldoso, she gave me a sarcastic smart ass remark, saying ""it's soupy"". Well duh, it says so on the menu. While I was ordering a margarita, she started slowly walking away from the table, so by the time I finished telling her what I wanted she was a good 3 feet from us...it was so awkward. Overall, she wasn't that attentive even though there were only one of four tables there. Our requests (for butter, for olive oil, for salt/pepper, for to-go boxes) seemed to bother her a little. We even asked if she was from Spain and she seemed a little annoyed and she answered in a sarcastic way as if she expected us to know already that she's from Spain. At the end she started smiling more and seemed a little sweeter.It's obvious the management is just dumb and doesn't know how to train their staff.FOOD: 2 out of 5 stars- CAMERONES AL AJILLO: My mom ordered this and she said the shrimp tasted like it had been frozen, but she loved the garlic sauce it came in.- SOCARRAT PAELLA: My mom (who LOVES paella) ordered this. We were shocked with how little rice it came with. My mom said the rice looked dull was lacking flavor, especially saffron, which she thinks is essential for paella. The seafood in the paella tasted bland and overcooked to her. She also didn't know why the paella had lima beans when they usually have peas. The meat in the paella was also very tough and hard for her to eat. To quote my mom, ""This paella sucks"".- PATATAS BRAVAS: The potatoes themselves were pretty bland - some were crispy, but I wish more of them were. The garlic aioli on top was rich and sooo good. The hot sauce was good - nice medium level of spicy - but it needed more.- ARROZ CALDOSO: Literally soup with a bunch of rice in it. It was SO bland. I only took a few spoonfuls and packed the rest up to take home; I plan on adding a LOT of spices and seasoning to fix it up. I did like that it came with a lot of vegetables.- CHURROS CON CHOCOLATE: They came out really hot, so I assumed they were fresh but my mom didn't find it fresh and she thought they were just reheated. I liked the crunchy texture, but my mom found hers too crispy and hard to eat (maybe she just got a bad batch?). The churros come with a cup of thick, melted dark chocolate with whipped cream on top to dip your churros into. The whipped cream tasted fresh and not too airy - not at all like the whipped cream from the can; it also tasted like vanilla which I love. The rich chocolate and the light whipped cream balanced each other out nicely; my mom mixed them together and ate it all.They put bread on the table which was nice of them, but the crust was a little burnt.We had came here with a friend and her daughter who both had never had paella. My mom was excited to introduce them to paella but she now says she needs to find a better place to take them so they could eat a proper paella.P.S. My mom LOVES the paella at La Nacional (just a few blocks away), and she says it's a shame they're closed for renovation. Also, La Nacional isn't overpriced.",2,1,0,Chelsea C.,"East Elmhurst, NY",77,45,271

They make their paella fresh and it takes about 45 mins to be ready. I just happened to pop in here after happy hour with friends and ordered the Paella and a bottle of red.

At first the serving size for a portion of two concerned me, but it ended up being enough. I have just returned from a trip to Spain.  I was disappointed when we were being rushed out. I understand I am not in Barcelona, where they let you eat and sit for hours, but I was sad our dinner was rushed. All in all, I would never come here for tapas.

Crockett were blend. We ordered 3 paellasThe black ink, lobster and the meat paella ..The only decent one was lobster paella..the rest were blend and were missing the spices Also the dessert was extremely disappointing I've have had better churros from the street vendor ..I must add the service was great, prompt and waiter extremely polite and accommodating",0,0,0,Anna K.,"Staten Island, NY",34,11,0

The croquetas, dátiles, and coles de bruselas were all great! However the jamon ensalada and pork belly w/ watermelon were meh and inedible, respectively. I understand we live in he States, so finding quality jamon is slim to none (Casa Mono best so far). The pork belly was so over cooked I nearly choked getting it down. Honestly, I haven't had pork belly so overcooked since I last visited the Midwest, where they overcook all their meat.Overall though, I enjoyed the meal.

Socarrat was rated as one of the best paella restaurants in the city so we decided to try it. The restaurant is cute, we were there for lunch on Friday around 2 pm so it was not busy at all, only two other tables when we arrived. There was only one waitress working and she did not seem happy, she was not nice. She spilled water on the table and did not bother to wipe it until I asked her a few minutes later. Anyway, the food...do not get the pan con tomate, you will be throwing $7 in the trash, this is an extremely easy thing to make and it had no flavor, the bread was toasted too dark and the tomato was just that, tomato. You gotta make the tomato with some garlic, salt and olive oil, basic but tasty, not this one though. This left us a bit disappointed and fearing that the rice would not be as good as the reviews said...the rice was great, well cooked, flavorful and it really tasted like it should. We had the arroz con pescados y mariscos (they have a typo on their menu by the way, it says pesados y mariscos) and the arroz negro, I liked the flavor of the first one better but that's just a personal preference.

Our table wasn't quite ready when we arrived which is understandable and totally fine for a Saturday night so we helped ourselves to the bar. Drinks were quick, simple, and friendly. We had to ask the indifferent hosts to see if our table was ready yet as we had already gotten through a round of drinks waiting for a 8:45 reservation we made days ago. Once we sat, the waiting continued before anyone acknowledged our empty cocktails, dry water glasses, or existence. Luckily the waiting was enough time to figure out everything we wanted for the evening but it would have been nice to have some water or cocktails on the way. After finally ordering we patiently (perhaps too patiently) waited until around 10:30 to ask a manager to check on our food. Frazzled of course - as if a completely food less table sitting for an hour and a half in his busy dining room was something he hadn't noticed yet - went to check on our food and it came quickly after that. While the food was actually pretty delicious, it was disappointingly tiny. I mean we're talking about paella, a dish that feeds families!!!Luckily our company was great so we had plenty of conversation to entertain us but too much of which was about how much time everything was taking from the seating, to the service, to the kitchen. If we hadn't been there for so long already we would have loved to stick around for dessert and drinks but we weren't willing to take the risk. Luckily Momofuku milk bar is right up the street and open late so we took advantage of their take-out window instead!",0,0,0,Joey C.,"Raleigh, NC",16,1,2

Our waiter was helpful with food suggestions and answered all our questions. We were four of us and decided to try a bunch of tapas and a paella for two. We ordered the octopus which was well cooked and not at all rubbery. We got the shrimp that came in a nice spicy sauce. We also got the chorizo that was nicely done. In addition we ordered the mixed veggies and cauliflower tapas which were good too. For the paella we got the veggie one that actually surpassed my expectations. It was well made and flavorful with a lot of different veggies in it. The seating is a bit communal so you might share your larger table with another party if you're a small group.

3.0,6/23/2016,"I have bookmarked this place many years ago, and luckily last Friday I was able to eat here w/ my good friend whom I celebrated her early birthday with. We came during happy hour time, and was offered 50% off tapas & drinks if we sat at the bar. But my friend wanted space, so we chose to sit in the back. Discount for tapas & drinks during happy hour was such a deal - maybe next time if I come back. My friend and I were not that hungry, so we ordered to share: 1) Pescados y marsicos paella (shrimp, scallops, squid, mussels, cockles, white fish, english peas), 2) Patatas bravas (crispy potato cubes, aioli, spicy tomato sauce), and 3) Pinchos morunos (marinated skewers of beef w/ moroccan spices).Due to the paella taking awhile to make (about 30 minutes or so as it is labor intensive), we started off with the tapas. The pinchos morunos (2 pieces of beef skewers) was so damn delicious and juicy! I wish there was more servings. The patatas bravas was delicious as well - the potatoes were crisp & the aioli sauce made the potatoes even more enjoyable. I thought the paella was disappointing as I have eaten the authentic one from Spain a few year ago, so comparing it was not a good idea. My friend who has not eaten a paella before thought it was tasty. The paella pan deceivingly appears very large, but if you were to scoop everything on the pan to one side there was not a lot of paella. There was too much seafood vs rice in the paella. The seafood was quite tender and fresh, but the rice was so soggy (should be al dente) and the seasoning was a bit overwhelming. I thought the paella was mediocre, and could have been better. If I had to come back again, I would just do tapas only (forget about the paella).Customer service was exceptional.

3.0,5/26/2016,"To start things off: I am without an ounce of doubt in the bottom 10% least sharp tools in the shed. That being put out there, and for the entire Yelp world to know, I know a thing or two about paellas, and folks, let me tell you, this was one pathetic looking paella. **Disclaimer: I was born in Spain and go back often. (Yes, I suppose that could be categorized as a humble brag.) **I decided to dine at Socarrat (which is the burnt rice in the bottom of the paella pan (paellera), an item most Spaniards fight over if done right), with my mother and my friend, Kevin, to have him experience some true Spanish food. We were told the owner was from Spain and expected some fine paella. We ordered a few tapas - patatas bravas, alcachofas fritas & 3 beers. All were acceptable and the price point being reasonably fair for NYC.  We then ordered the Socarrat paella for two. We expected the wait and that was no issue at all. While we waited they seated three separate parties at our table and all 3 decided to move to another spot. I probably smell terrible, but still a poor choice by the staff to seat them there when several tables for 2 were open.Now to the meat & potatoes of the review. When the paella arrived I was in shock at what I saw. The amount of rice in the paellera did just enough to cover the base. Sure there was socarrat, but that's supposed to be under another layer (or 2 or 3) of rice, not the principal layer. I wanted to say something to the waiter but know damn well that that's not his doing. It was the most pathetic showing of a paella I have ever seen. I could see people thinking ""typical New Yorker b*tching"", but I am not complaining about the more expensive items that were thrown on top. I am complaining about the rice. There was a single layer of it. That's a damn talent, and to that I applaud the Chef. The least expensive food item in the restaurant! Was is that hard to add another layer? If the owner served this paella in Spain his family would be truly ashamed. It would include, but not be limited to, an alpargata to the behind, him being removed from the kitchen for life, his mother never letting him see another paellera ever, and worst, ""coger gambusinos"" with a bunch of his ex closest friends.",3,7,0,Nico N.,"Medford, MA",2,15,5

This doesn't bother me since that's what 99% of Chinatown restaurants do, but just be aware it might happen.We ordered a pitcher of red sangria, the Datiles, and the Arroz Negro paella for 3. Sangria was fantastic and not too sweet, the Datiles were delicious (bacon, dates, cheese, and applesauce doesn't sound like it should taste good together but it did), and the paella was definitely worth the 30 (!) minute wait. Loaded with fresh seafood and some of the best scallops I've had since I went to Maine, the rice was buttery and garlicky and the bottom crisped up nicely, though not as much as I would've liked.

In regards to their tapas, I highly recommend getting ones that aren't your standard garlic shrimp, croquettes and bacon wrapped dates (which we've had here, and yes, they are good).  Try instead the creamy hand rolled meat stuffed pasta, grilled pork belly and the Moroccan beef skewers. All of these are excellent and different from what you would typically find in other tapas joints.  Size wise, I was actually pleased with the portion amount.

Paella takes about 30 minutes to cook so they recommend you get tapas while it's cooking. Tapas- Gambas al ajillo: well-cooked shrimp in oil. It was delicious but I was upset I paid $12 for 6 shrimp - pulo: octopus literally melts in your mouth. It was a little more worth it than getting shrimp in oil but it was still pricey. $16Main- squid ink paella: omg so good. This is a must when you come. What I wish I did was get one serving of squid ink and another serving of socarrat paella. If you put garlic sauce on it, it tastes even better! I asked for their spicy sauce and WOAH IT IS HELLA SPICY. I love it. - sangria: I got white sangria, and I expected it to be fruity and sweet but it wasn't fruity or sweet. I still enjoyed it bc hey it got me drunk. But i don't think I'll get this $14 drink next time. By the way, paella is paid per person. I did not see that and was so shocked by our receipt.

Not long after the arroz negro arrived, the smell of seafood perfumed the air as it was placed in front of us. The rice was cooked absolutely perfect, and the seafood was fresh and sweet. The squid ink added a subtle sweetness and acidity to the rice; the best part had been the socarrat that was scrapped up from the pan with each spoonful which was complimented by the garlic aioli.

The carne was also a great, hearty combination of flavorful meats that is sure to please any meat-lover. I wasn't a big fan of the de la huerto, a vegetarian paella if you don't order the chicken as the veggies came out too soggy for my taste.

4.0,2/3/2016,"Went here Sunday with my sister and some friends for restaurant week dinner. Delicious, delicious food! I eat out a good amount but unfortunately I hadn't had an amazing meal in quite some time. Many restaurants I'd been excited for have been sub par lately, but not Socarrat.Nice, dim lighting and a communal ambiance. The sangria was good (still not as great as Las Raices in San Juan-I compare every sangria I have to their's). The croquetas del dia were pretty tasty. Small for my taste but good..just wish the day's selection had some meat in it. If it did, I couldn't taste it.What really was the star for me was the paella de carne with the 'carne' being short ribs, chicken and chorizo. It came together so, so well. The meat wasn't chewy or overcooked and whatever dark liquid that the paella cooked in (maybe beef broth and seasonings), helped everything come together. I like that the waitress scraped the pan for us so we could get all that good socarrat at the end.Churros were my dessert and they were good. Just wish you got more than 3.So here's everything the 4 of us had. For restaurant week, you get individual appetizers and desserts but 2 ppl share one sizable paella:3 of us had the croquetas: again tasty but small1 of us had garlic shrimp: good flavor. i bit overcooked I thought.1 paella de carne: again, delicious!1 paella de socarrat: a ton of meat and seafood in it. very good and everything was cooked beautifully but it lacked for seasoning. You could taste the juices of the shell fish, but I was looking for some saffron or other seasonings to stand out more. Everyone at the table agreed the paella de carne was better. 3 orders of churros: again, tasty but a small order.1 of flan: I honestly didn't have any of the flan. presentation wise, it looked great.",0,0,0,Leah H.,"Springfield Township, NJ",78,22,13

The dinner restaurant week had several paellas to choose from, some of which were on the menu and had a lot of seafood, and just better choices overall. It felt they were being cheap and just throwing whatever leftover ingredients they had lying around into the lunch paella. Shrimp in garlic appetizer was good with crispy garlic and oil, but they gave us only a few slices of bread to dip into the sauce, and we asked for more they kept being stingy and giving a few very small slices.

Shrimps and chopped garlic went well together. My main course was Paella del día. It reminded me of Thai green curry fried rice somehow although their tastes are totally different. I had know idea that I had to use a spoon to get Socarrat (the crispy rice at the bottom of the pan which was and that was the best part of paella), so my server did it for me before I discarded my dish. He even offer me a glass of Sangria since it took a while for my paella to come, and I really appreciated that. I ordered Flan for dessert.

1.0,2/1/2016,"Absolutely TERRIBLE dining experience. My boyfriend and I had made a reservation for 6:00pm on a Sunday during Restaurant Week, which we then decided to move to 5:30pm. When we arrive the restaurant wasn't very full, yet everyone seemed very overwhelmed and disorganized. Our waitress had to make several trips back and forth to bring us our menu, and even admitted to being a ""horrible waitress."" She told us the paella would take about 30-40 minutes so we should order it first, which we did, around 5:50pm. We also ordered tapas and two glasses of sangria. The tapas were all delicious: we got the kale salad, which had a very creamy, nutty dressing and beets cooked two ways; shrimp sautéed in garlic and spicy oil; and squid cooked with potatoes and paprika, which was the tastiest thing I ate all night. It took our waitress 15 minutes to bring our sangria, which I would understand if it were a specialty cocktail requiring individual attention, but seriously. All you have to do is pour it from a pitcher and through some diced fruit on top.After waiting an hour after we'd ordered our paella--over the course of this period, our waitress continued to be unhelpful and distracted--we finally asked how much longer our wait would be as we had tickets for a play at 7:30. Our waitress blamed the high volume of tables in the other room--which we couldn't see--and said it would be at least another 15 minutes. So the ""30-40"" minutes would have become at least 75 minutes. Bizarrely, she asked if we wanted to order dessert first and take our paella home in doggie bags (we did not). We eventually asked for the check, explaining we were in a rush, and it still took our waitress five minutes to bring our check to us. The restaurant was kind enough to give us the drinks on the house, but we still ended up paying $40 for three small appetizers.The food we had was really tasty, but I have never been so ignored in a restaurant.

The restaurant is very tight and narrow and we were seated on a long table that stretches through the room. This is where it can get loud. You are seated next to random strangers who you have to shout over because everyone is trying to shout over everyone else trying to have a conversation. Its also hard not to listen to the conversation next to you. Maybe its better when its not as busy.The menu was very simple and easy to understand. We ordered the croquettes and huevos rotos. The croquettes came out first. However they were very bland and didnt have much flavor in my opinion. The huevos came out afterwards. The eggs, which is supposed to be the star of the dish i assume, was fully cooked. Im also assuming the yolk is supposed to be runny but ours was cooked and hard. The fries on the bottom were almost overcooked and too crunchy as well. They were not pleasant to eat. The appetizers were not the best and expected much better.We ordered Arroz Negro as our main. This dish was not bad at all. The seafood was cooked really well and the portion was more than enough. However I wouldn't go out of my way to have this dish. The dessert was my absolute favorite part of the night. I ordered the churros sunday funday and it was amazing. The texture of the churros was spot on along with the hot chocolate fillings and cream.

Rice mixed well with lobsters, scallops, shrimps, and a little bit of squid. My Spanish friend said the paella was too wet. It should be juicy due to the seafood but it should never be like porridge. I guess my Spanish friend had higher standards for paella, it was good enough for me except that $33 per person is really over priced.Note that if you wanna order drinks, make sure of the price.

We tried the negro paella (various fishes) and it was delicious. The flavors were on point and the scallops were cooked to perfection.

I was nominated to order for everyone, if I remember correctly, we ordered croquettes, crispy potato cubes, grilled octopus, grilled tuna, a cheese & prosciutto platter, garlic shrimps, and several other tapas that I vaguely remember the names of, but I received a lot of compliments with the meal, boy those garlic shrimps and the tuna! Although one of my friends mentioned that the tuna tastes like something from Xi'an Famous Foods (lol).My girls were so delighted and we all enjoyed the dishes, I particularly love the potato cubes and what I typically like to do with a small tapas menu is to check off everything off the menu altogether.We ended up with two 2-serving paella in the end, the squid ink seafood and the white seafood ones, they were so flavorful, the rice was cooked crispy and juicy, I loved that little crunchiness mixed together with the risotto-like texture, the seafood was phenomenal! To end the meal we had a cheesecake and flan. Those portions are quite small, pretty good for our appetite because we were already full. The cheesecake was made of goat cheese, I was one of few that liked it, but the flan was everyone's favorite. It's not overwhelmingly sweet, very nice texture! Service was not the best, they were quite busy, but they provided what I needed, so I liked the fact that they left us alone to enjoy our chit-chats and secret santa (we made a small mess with the gift wrapping papers but we helped to clean up).

2.0,12/20/2015,"Hold up..... They call this a paella bar?!?? Being Half Spanish, and having grandparents straight from Spain, I have to say that their paella is seriously a disgrace. I've never been to a restaurant that executed paella so poorly-- I have no idea why it would ever be considered their ""specialty"". The menu consists of tapas and a list of different paellas. We started with some tapas... So disappointed. I'm convinced the Patas Bravas were frozen. And to make matters worse, they slopped mayo and superrrr spicy hot sauce on top, which completely took away from the dish. My entire party couldn't even comprehend their idea behind the Brussels sprouts. They had ASAIN sweet and sour sauce on top... And they were just inedible to me. On a more positive note, I didn't mind the scallop & shrimp screwers and tortilla, so I'd recommend ordering them. Don't expect anything spectacular though. I was still starving after the round of tapas and seriously couldn't wait for the paella. We all expected the paella to make up for the poor tapas, but they actually ended up being better than the paella. We ordered the Arroz Negra Paella for 2 which totaled to $50 (they make you order for a minimum of 2 people per paella). My entire party was in shock--they pretty much just threw rice in a skillet and added some UNSEASONED shrimp, scallops, and fish on top. It wasn't even worth eating.We actually ended up going to another restaurant after dinner because we couldn't stand to eat any more of their food. We immediately regretted wasting money at Socarrat.I've seen mixed reviews about their service, but I personally had a bad experience. Our server neglected us majority of the night even though it wasn't even packed. I can't recall him checking on our table even once. He only took out order and helped deliver our food. The decor is super cute and definitely the best part of the place! However, they have the oddest music choice. It definitely takes away from any Spanish vibe they're trying to give off.If you want tapas or paella, go elsewhere!

It was definitely worth the wait for that  paella beauty.Now, let's talk about the service. Service could have improved a lot more. Our server got caught up with a 6-top that seemed very complicated. Okay, I understand. But as he walked away from that table, he could've acknowledged our presence. He could have said ""Hey give me one second I'll be with you"" or maybe ask another server to greet us. He didn't. Whatever. It just really sucked because we already knew it takes at least 30 minutes for our food to come out and waiting 10-15 minutes before getting greeted just makes it close to an hour for food. When the server came to get our order, he was asking if we were sure about not getting appetizers because the food will take awhile. He was pushing it a little too much. We politely declined and we knew it was gonna take awhile for the food to come out... We just needed that order in the system as quick as possible so they can start making it.. I honestly try to be as understanding to waitstaff as much as possible and I always go on defending them (Maybe he was just having a bad night) but sometimes it's just disappointing, especially after hearing good things about a restaurant.Tip: don't go restaurant hopping before heading here as your bank might lock down. Haha. As soon as I got home, I get a call from the restaurant saying my card was declined. HUHHH!??! I didn't understand because my card went through when I was there, and I signed a copy. Normally cards swiped in a Micros POS will let you swipe to a certain amount in your card and make sure there's enough for tipping... But I didn't understand why it took two hours for them to tell me it was declined. I went to a couple of restaurants throughout the day and maybe my bank thought it was fraud.. But it would have declined at the first swipe when I was still there. I called my bank and called the restaurant back and it all got settled. They might have accidentally cancelled the payment then when they tried again it didn't go through. Ehh whatever.

I *really* just wish the food matched the service. I have visited the UES Socarrat and enjoyed the arroz negro paella and tapas (refer to my review on that location).  I had heard that the original Chelsea location was better than the other locations, so we ventured here.The wine was definitely the highlight of the meal for everyone. We ordered the Ribera del Duero 2011 Roble tempranillo bottle (x2). It was earthy, rustic and smooth. Definitely the type of bottle that people with varying palates would enjoy. I recommend it. Pero la comida estaba otra cosa. 1) We ordered the eggplant napolean special tapa and it was a bust. I'm so used to the flavorful, jaw-dropping eggplant napolean from Tanoreen in Brooklyn that this tasted like air. 2) Patatas Bravas were not good.  Who decided to use that sauce? A dollop of some ketchup topped with mayo? Plus they tasted overly starchy. PASS (Olea in Ft. Greene's patatas bravas still reign supreme... my spouses homemade ones come second). 3) Lobster Paella should be skipped. I had ordered the Arroz Negro paella at the other location and enjoyed it. To our chagrin, this one was just dry and bland, shockingly. We ordered it because our server said it was the best of the seafood paellas... If that's true, you should just skip them all. 4) For dessert we ordered the bunuelos de chocolate and they also brought us a flan on the house (!?). We didn't enjoy or like either.  We originally wanted the churros, but we were advised against it. The bunuelo bread was stale and hard and the flan was just there.  You didn't even notice if you had taken a bite or not... Boqueria is still my top choice for tapas... and last time we were there we ordered the seafood fideus negro (like paella but noodles instead of rice).

At the end of lunch all she brought was a check, no dessert with a candle for my mother to blow out.   My brother and I  tipped her far more than she deserved, she deserved nothing.  I had chosen this place because of great food reviews from friends and family but I will never return nor would I ever recommend it to anyone else.   It was not even busy enough to give the waitress the benefit of the doubt which im accustomed to doing anywhere I go.   My mother is an awesome lady, I wish I remembered the waitress name,  no thank you for ruining what was supposed to be a great birthday lunch celebrating a wonderful woman.",3,1,1,Marie C.,"New York, NY",135,2,0

Still not mind blowing, but better than most I have had in the city.Pulpo a la gallega Galician styled octopus, potatoes, paprika oilTender pieces of succulent octopus. It almost even had a porky flavor to it. I enjoyed this one.There was also a special that day that had fried goat cheese wrapped with what I believe is proscuitto with green tomato and on a toast. Don't think the toast added anything more and could have been left out since you already get the breading around the goat cheese. Other than that, the flavors melded well!At first, I thought you have to order a minimum of two paellas.

3.0,9/25/2015,"I was so blown away by the food I had in Barcelona and Madrid that I made a personal mission to find authentic and amazing food from Spain in NY, I have yet to find it. The restaurant itself is very dimly lit and the seating is mostly high chairs so don't expect to spend the whole night here. The restaurant is busy and you should definitely arrive early or make a reservation.The food:Pan con tomato- fresh tomato spread, olive oil, garlic, country toast. I was told a long time ago that there are two dishes served at any Tapas restaurant that are a good indicator of how the meal would turn out, if a restaurant can make a very good Pan con tomato and a tortilla espanola, it's a very good sign. I thought the Pan con tomato was good but not great, I felt it was missing the natural sweetness from the tomato and I thought the bread was so thick that it overwhelmed everything else.  I felt the perfect pairing of the crusty bread with the sweet tomatoes and the hint of garlic was not present. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Coles de bruselas- crispy brussels sprouts, chopped almonds in a sweet and spicy glaze. The brussels sprouts were made well and I enjoyed the balsamic glaze, I do wish they took out the outer layer of the brussels sprout since I thought it was a tad tough.Arroz negro- shrimp, calamari, scallops, fish, piquillo pepper, squid ink. I was told this was the dish to get out of all their paellas and I thought it was just OK. I thought the fish and the scallops came out fantastic, they were cooked very nicely. The squid on the other hand was so overcooked and chewy, I almost didn't even recognize what it was. In terms of the rice, I thought the rice was too wet and at times mushy, I was so so with the rice. Lastly, people always talk about socarrat with any paella, the crunchy bits on the bottom of the pan, and honestly, I really don't care for it, it's crunchy and it sticks to your teeth. It doesn't do it for me. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Cochnillo asado- roasted suckling pig, swiss chard, water chestnuts, pork reduction. I thought this was going to be a easy pleaser but it was just OK. I really felt like I was just eating regular pernil. I thought the pork should have been more unctuous, juicy and I was expecting it to be more tender, I also wish the pork skin was more crispy. I like crispy and pork, it's like the perfect match. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Red Sangria- I thought the Sangria was OK, it was more sweet though than I expected and I didn't really notice the wine.",10,7,8,Ben L.,"Queens, NY",978,1001,2785
3.0,9/25/2015,"Came to Soccarat with a friend for restaurant week (yes, this review is overdue) and was really hoping to be impressed. Unfortunately I was not. The shrimp in the gambas al ajillo (shrimp in garlic sauce) tasted as though they were dropped in the sauce last minute, rather than being cooked in it. But the real downer was the seafood paella. The seafood was actually steamed and placed on top of the paella. It's supposed to be cooked in the rice so to pick up the paella's flavors. This is just paella 101. My mind was blown in the worst of ways. Yea, there were crunchy bits at the bottom, but what's the point when the star of the show (the seafood) was so bland? The meat paella was good - the meat was actually cooked in the rice - but seafood paella is a classic. I just don't understand how you prepare it so poorly.

I recommend getting 1 or 2 apps for every person at the table and sharing. We had the Pulpo (Octopus), Cochinillo, and Datiles. All were good, but the Datiles were extraordinary. They are Dates, stuffed with almonds and Spanish Blue Cheese, then wrapped with bacon and served with an apple puree sauce.

Now like I said before, I am not a big seafood fan, but this food was excellent. The rice was excellent and everything I tried I liked. The only thing I didn't try was the Mussels, I just really, really don't like mussels.

4.0,8/31/2015,"Okay, so being Spanish and having just come back from Barcelona - took a cooking class on paella - I really wanted to try this place. Paella can be delicious or it can go horribly wrong - it's always about the rice. We ordered some familiar dishes, to start: Gambas Al Ajillo, Pulpo Gallego and Chorizo. Gambas and chorizo were awesome - the chorizo had a chimichurri sauce that had that vinegar punch. You'll need lots of bread to sop up the garlic and chorizo sauce - almost wanted a straw for the chorizo sauce!The Pulpo was good but my Mom is from that region, and her Pulpo is my favourite. We ordered 4 paella's: Pescado y Marisco, Arroz Negro, Langosta and the house. The black rice was a hit as was the fish and shell fish, followed by the lobster and then the house was last. I would avoid ordering one large for a large party, it's too big and big is not always better? Besides they have plenty of options. There was that crust on the bottom the pan, where the rice browns and takes on this flavour. We found ourselves digging for that socorrat.

They were both delicious. I then ordered the iberico which was amazing but for $26 I expected to get more since it was a shared platter. I licked the plate though.

We went on a Tuesday night for a dinner at 6:30 PM.The decor was pretty standard. They sit you across from each other at a long bar with stools for seats. I personally didn't find it to be too much of a pain to converse though I can see it being more troublesome if the parties next to you are particularly loud. 3/5 for subpar seating.The food. We got the gambas al ajillo and huevos rotos con chistora for the tapas, paella de arroz negro for the main course (you must share 1 paella for 2 people) and churros and flan for the dessert.The shrimp was so tasty. It was spiced perfectly and the garlic slices were also cooked very well. The eggs over fries were just as good. The fries were just the right amount of crispy with runny eggs spiced equally well. We decided to not go for the croquetas after reading that they were pretty meh. Boy was it the right decision. 5/5 for awesome tapas.The paella de arroz degro was very good. But first... It's paella, people. The rice on the bottom and edges are supposed to be ""burnt."" The rice is hard because it's overcooked not undercooked. Please do some simple research before eating new food if you're going to complain like that. A lot of these reviews hating on the paella for being a paella just baffles me... Anyhow it was cooked just right for a paella. They remind me so much of hot stone bibimbap. It was a tad heavy because of the squid ink but that was to be expected. It was also definitely salty but I would say the amount of salt used was actually proper for a dish like this one. The seafood given was plenty enough and was very fresh and tasty. The salt and heaviness did make it hard to finish without a drink. Still, I would strongly recommend this dish. 4.5/5 for a paella that could be improved with a drink or by a red pepper paste (I'm so going to try this later).The flan was light and good, the churros were pretty standard and came stuck in what was basically a chocolate mousse. 4/5Overall, if you enjoy paellas, have never tried paella, and/or enjoy hot stone bibimbap, I would STRONGLY recommend this place.Oh, and remember to ask for the garlic paste that normally comes with the paella de arroz negro.",1,0,0,David K.,"Hayes Valley, San Francisco, CA",54,134,115

Don't know if that was indicated on the menu since I really couldn't see. As an appetizer -- gambas al anojio (sautéed shrimp in white wine reduction ) was pretty good nothing out of this world--came with stale bread though. Also had the mejillones con chorizo (mussels with red sauce and bits of sausage ) which was delicious. Lastly and the most disappointing was the paella negra. The portion was tiny.

The cochinillo left something to be desired. Like it was tasty but not as good as it could be. The skin is the best part but it wasn't very crunchy.We liked the Soccarat paella better, with all properly cooked meat and seafood, fragrant tender rice, rich crispy crusty bottom.  The Valenciana was so-so, bland.

4.0,8/4/2015,"Socarrat's signature dish is their seafood paella, or paella de arroz negro. We came here for dinner with the intent of trying it and saw that it was also featured on the Restaurant Week menu. Generally, I am skeptical of restaurant weeks because they have become synonymous with uncreative dishes and lowered quality, but Socarrat's selections seemed to be a fair representation of their normal menu. Along with the seafood paella (the two of us were required to order the same kind of paella), we chose the croquetas del dia (croquettes of the day) and huevos rotos con chistorra to start. We also got a pitcher of the red wine sangria, which is pretty much the only form of wine I will drink. The food took a while to come out - almost driving me nuts in the process - but at least every dish arrived at our table hot. The croquettes that day had been filled with spinach and were good, if not a bit boring. The huevos rotos exceeded my expectations and consisted of fries covered with sunny side up eggs, chistorra (a type of Spanish sausage), and vegetables. When the paella finally came out, we gaped at how enormous the pan was. A serving for two is really enough to feed up to four if you're ordering other dishes. I had never had arroz negro before, so I couldn't wait to try it. From what I can tell, Socarrat's rendition is the real deal, chock full of a variety of seafood and crispy at the bottom. The rice by itself was flavorful from being cooked with the seafood. Even though we were hungry, we barely finished half of the pan. For dessert, we got both the Churros Sunday Funday and the flan. The churros were served in a layered glass of chocolate pudding, coffee cream, and whipped cream. Even though I don't usually love churros, I ate most of this because the pudding and cream were so yummy together. The flan was flavored with passion fruit and was your lighter, more syrupy Spanish flan. I prefer denser Latin American flan, so I didn't have much of this.The dark, intimate atmosphere of Socarrat in Chelsea is suitable for casual group gatherings or dates. My one complaint is that all of their chairs are backless wooden stools, so it wasn't the most comfortable to sit in for hours. Perhaps this best functions as a happy hour spot. Now that I've tried the seafood paella, I would come back for more of their tapas, many of which sounded enticing.",1,0,0,C C.,"Los Angeles, CA",108,194,203

For appetizers, we ordered garlic shrimp and fries with huevos. Garlic shrimp smelled amazing - comes out sizzling in an iron skillet! With a side of the bread, this dish is great with the sangria roja (SO refreshing!). The fries with huevos -- yum! I can't believe I've never thought to try fries with eggs before - simple yet amazing dish.To order the paella - each paella has to be ordered for at least 2 people. If you want to try 2 different types, I suggest going with at least 4 people. We wanted to try the Socarrat paella and the Black Rice paella -- and opted for the Black Rice since I've never tried paella with squid ink. It was yummy. The rice is seasoned perfectly and topped with scallops, fish, calamari, and shrimp on top - it's also served with a side of garlic aioli, but I thought the paella was very flavorful so I didn't need the extra sauce. Warning: this dish is EXTREMELY filling! Pace yourself, and do not try to finish it!! lol!For dessert, we ordered the flan and the Sunday Funday churros.

2.0,7/31/2015,"Gratuity is defined as a voluntary amount given for the exchange of customer service. In NYC it is suggested at 15-18% but when the meal is amazing it is not rare for servers to receive 20% or even more. With that said, even when they are tipped at 15%, there is no need to pester customers for that extra few dollars and ruin the entire dining experience. Since we only had 50mins to the meal, the bartender was accommodating and allowed us to order the paella before everyone seated since that alone takes 30mins to make. The server was just as accommodating and took our orders quickly and the tapas came out promptly. We ordered the Gambas Al Ajillo, Mejillones con chorizo, Pulpo a la gallega and Cochinillo asado. Our favorite was the gambas since the flavors from the salt and olive oil were fully integrated in the shrimp. The cochinillo was very tender and the meat came apart easily but it was a bit on the salty side. The arroz negro, as everyone raves about, was really amazing. The last time I had such amazing paella was at Toledo in Murray Hill and before that, Spain. In terms of food and the dining space, they are on point with Spanish vibes.At last, the check came and we split it evenly and tipped 15% since it was a quick meal and we received standard attention/service. As we were about to leave, the server questions the amount we tipped and the way he approached the situation was as if we were kids who didn't know any better. We double and tripled check the amount to be sure and were confident it was ""enough"". However, we didn't want to argue and left a few extra dollars.

Sometimes restaurants tend to serve visitors with discount deals in a condescending manner, but the servers at Socarrat treated us with the same courtesy and sweetness.It was my first time having Spanish cuisine, so we ordered the representative Socarrat Paella. The dish came in a huge hot stone(?) pan while the contents were still deliciously sizzling. Packed generously with fresh seafood and perfectly seasoned, the paella was just amazing. When we got to the crispy rice part, the server helped us scrape down the dish to the last bit, and we left feeling unbelievably happy as we diligently gobbled down the dish. Sangria was also a perfect match for the paella.The restaurant overall has a great ambiance, but it's a bit narrow and hard to get around once you're seated. Eating at the bar area was great fun, as we could also get a small chat with the bartender from time to time. The wall that we faced had some mirror decor, and eating while facing myself was also an interesting experience... Next time I visit, I'd have to make sure that I look nice, so that I wouldn't have to keep looking away from myself in the mirror.Although it is a bit expensive, I'd say it's definitely worth the food and experience.

4.0,7/29/2015,For appetizers we had the kale salad and garlic shrimp.  The kale salad was delicious.  The grilled garlic shrimp came in a hot pot and were still cooking when served and I felt they were overcooked but the flavor was very good.For the paella we ordered Arroz negro (seafood and squid ink rice) --- amazing!  Was a lot for two people and it was cooked perfectly.  I usually don't like the crunchy rice but this dish change my mind.For dessert we had the flan and Sunday Funday Churros.  Both were so good -& I can't decide which was better.Great service...

3.0,7/26/2015,"I live above this restaurant for the last 2 years and never went as the menu seemed a big pricey. Its restaurant week and they have a terrific menu. The appetizers were fabulous as one would expect from a tapas and paella bar.  There was a myriad of different tomatoes and cantaloupe and apricot with light dressing. Absolutely a must in the summer month..as its super refreshing. Then we had the cod croquetts..this was a perfect blend of crispy batter on the outside and creamy goodness on the inside. The entrees were a soupy vegetable paellas and meat paella. The soupy paella broth was not well seasoned which caused the dish to be entirely bland. The meat paella was burnt around the edges of the pan...which means it was left in the oven a little too long. The rice was a little on the dry side because it was left in the over too long...but the meats were all outstanding...actually exemplary as they were seasoned to perfection. Finally, the dessert were both very good. We had the flan..which had the perfect custard consistency and a great sauce to soup up with. Then there was the churro coffee sunday. This was spectacular as there was a perfect blend of coffee mixed with chocolate pudding, chocolate sauce and churros...what a great way finish our spanish restaurant week experience.",1,0,0,Chad R.,"New York, NY",231,505,8
4.0,7/24/2015,"I came for restaurant week dinner and we ordered the kale salad and the huevos rotos con chistora (fries and sautéed peppers and sausages topped with two eggs) for appetizers, the paella de arroz negro (squid ink paella) as the main entree and the churros and flan for dessert.The huevos rotos dish was AMAZING. I wish I could have this for breakfast everyday. The fries aren't crispy but it's more fitting for the dish that they're not. The dressing on the kale salad was savory and creamy but not overly rich. Included beets, walnuts, goat cheese (which I couldn't really taste), and dried cranberries. The paella (sized for two) was surprisingly rich. I really liked the scallops, calamari, and fish. I'm allergic to shrimp, but it was there too. The rice itself was creamy and thick, but a bit too salty. I loved the crunchy bits of rice.Someone also came to scrape it all off the pan for us which was nice.The ""Churros Sunday Funday"" were 4 mini churros stuck in a creamy mousse-like hot chocolate sauce. Couldn't really taste any coffee but it was really good. The sauce was so chocolately though we couldn't really have it after eating the churros.The flan was good - the passionfruit cream was definitely the best part.The restaurant itself was kind of small and very dark. I'm guessing it's for the ambience but it's hard to take nice pictures of the food haha.And it gets quite noisy with all the conversation.

No burnt rice. We again spoke to our server and asked him why ours was burnt to a crisp and our neighbours was not. He called the manager over who tried to argue that our dish was cooked correctly.

He checked with the kitchen on everything ordered by our entire party and held sauces on the side which contained flour so that I could sample the dish safely.

4.0,6/28/2015,"I came here a few years ago and didn't remember much. Family took mom here for Mother's Day. I had never been to the original one. The venue looks pretty cool but all the seating are high tops. So, it is intimate, etc. but can get pretty uncomfortable.For appetizers:Gambas al ajillo - This has great flavor, like really great flavor. I don't think I'd do this again because the shrimp are quite small. Think, fried rice size shrimp. It is very tasty though.Patatas bravas - Exactly what you'd expect. They're nicely fluffy inside and have a delicate crisp outside. Milhohas de cordero - This was definitely the ""wow"" dish for me. The lamb is nicely cooked, it breaks apart so gracefully. The spinach, the peppers, the meat, the plating; bam. Pulpo a la gallega - The octopus is grilled quite nicely. The potatoes along with the paprika oil go really nice together. I just wish they had not forgotten this and brought it out with the entrees.For paella:Socarrat - Figured you can't go wrong with the paella that carries the establishment's name. It was good but it didn't have that edge I was looking for. There's meat/fish, a little bit of everything in this one. The garlic aioli made this better, you have to ask them for it. You may see a few tables with a small white squeeze bottle, that's what you're looking for.Carne - I typically do not order all meat paellas but I'm glad I did. The meat was tender and savory, the rice was nicely coated with all the juice. Scrape the crispy rice or ""socarrat"" off the pan, mix it up with a little bit of garlic aioli and go to town. Unbuckle your belt, then repeat.For dessert:Sunday Funday - Kind of small for what it is but really tasty. It's a glass with three churros and a mixture on the bottom chocolate, cocoa, coffee and cream. It's fun to dip through it, wish there were more churros though.All in all, solid place.

4.0,6/24/2015,"After living in Barcelona, my standard for paella is incredibly high, and I've been disappointed by a lot of places in New York, including the famous Boqueria and trendy Barraca. I think Socarrat has hands down the best paella I've had in NYC. A few reasons why this paella is excellent:- The abundance of stuff. It's not just a pan of rice with some toppings, the paellas are filled with seafood, meat, vegetables, whatever your poison, and the flavors are fully soaked in- Use of ACTUAL SAFFRON (it's not that difficult people)- The method of cooking - paellas actually take 40 minutes to come out because they are making it the correct way, and the rice at the bottom is perfectly crunchy and ready to be scraped up and enjoyed. The tapas here are also on point, including the patatas, the alcachofas, and the daily croquetas. What took this place from 4 stars to 5 stars for me though was the inclusion of my favorite Spanish drink - Claras. A perfect mix of beer + lemon soda is the perfect summer meal accompaniment.

Scrape it off with no shame and eat it all up because it's amazing.

2.0,6/9/2015,"Five stars for food, 0 for service. After many a delicious paella at their Midtown East location, I thought this would be the perfect place for an early dinner with friends. Boy, was I wrong.After being seated in an EMPTY dining room, we ordered some sangria and tapas. About 10 minutes later, our waiter returned to ask if we were going to order paella. Due to the various dietary restrictions in the group (and the 2 person minimum for a paella order), we thought it best to stick to tapas. I mean, tapas is another major selling point for the restaurant, right? Wrong. This did not fly with the staff. Initially, they told us to move to the bar. The prospect wasn't too appealing as we were now settled in a still-empty dining room (its about 6pm at this point). Then, they asked if we could leave the table by 8pm. We agreed, at which point our waiter finally relayed our order to the kitchen. This had a domino effect of delaying our subsequent orders, which we had to place separately due to the limited table space. This had no impact on the hostess, who started clearing our plates at 7:50pm, and then coolly dropped the check. The restaurant still wasn't full.Kudos to the industrious hostess who doubles as a busser-- but you lose points for failing to address the situation properly, and for your bad attitude.If you want the experience without the pretense, go to the Socarrat on 2nd Ave. The food is the same but the ambiance and staff put this location to shame.",0,0,0,Lauren B.,"Manhattan, NY",6,212,0

Croquetas were very cheesey and overall nothing too special. The paellas were great. I preferred the Arroz negro more than the pescado since it was more savory.

By and large this has been in the Newark restaurants.I like those but paella or mariscada tends not to be their forte.I've read articles in Saveur and The New York Times which made paella sound good.Something more risotto like.I ordered the Paella Valenciana with rabbit ,snail and pork and it wasn't at all gloppy.Crisp somewhat charred rice and good flavors, a winner and a pleasure.We also had a chorizo appetizer with a fava bean puree .My wife had a Tortilla Espanola which seemed perfect.The Sangria is a little sweeter than I like but it had a good fruit flavor and tasted like it actually had alcohol in it.

Sadly, I was not able to use my Blackboard eats 30% off because the server told us it wouldn't work at that hour. Oh well. This is a solid 4 star experience, but, I'm not returning... the food was a 3-3.5.  I enjoyed the sleek atmosphere (minus the cramped communal tables - we sat next to a couple at the same table and I felt bad for constantly knocking her elbows!), and the service (food came out fast, orders were taken fast), and the sangria roja was GREAT (strong too- but pricey at $36 for about 4 glasses).   We all shared a bunch of tapas and the Arroza Negro paella. Here goes:-The Tortilla, beautifully plated, but a wee small.  The famous Spanish omelet, with aioli, unsalted shishito peppers, sweet roasted red peppers, white toast-A small chess board of Spanish blue chess, manchengo, cheddar and candied cranberries and jam... good but then again that's just cheese. It's good everywhere. This was not earth shattering. -Gambas in garlic- could have be better grilled and more sizzly- could have used more shrimp too. The spicy oil on the bottom though was tasty. - The patatas bravas- good, solid, not the best I've had, dunked in a bit too much aioli. A good portion. - The shishito peppers - this time, salted with lemon. It's delicious! But not hard to recreate at home. -We ordered the arrozo negro, two portions. But it was WELL MORE than enough for 4. That's how they get you- they charge $25 per serving for the paella.  Honestly, for this price I wish they'd put more seafood in there. It was  mixture of calamari, some kind of fluke- y fish, shrimp, peppers, lima beans.  The rice itself was a bit greasy and should have more of crispy to it... but the squid ink was spot on.  Was nothing like some recent squid ink rice I had at Estela. Again, great ambiance and service, but food these prices should be a bit better - perhaps I am a tough critic since Spanish/tapas since to be one of my favorite cuisines.$140 for four of us.",3,1,2,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",878,1242,25

4.0,4/5/2015,"Though Socarrat is technically known for its paellas, this review is just for the tapas. I went with a friend on a weekend evening after watching a ballet nearby. The restaurant itself is pretty small, and has quite the upscale feel. There were many candlelit tables for two; it is a perfect place for an intimate date.The first tapa we got was the pisto manchego: sauteed zuchinni topped with goat cheese and tomatoes. I loved the generous chunks of goat cheese in this dish. The olive oil drizzled atop was infused with a sort of pesto sauce that really added a kick to the veggies.Next up was the pan tomaca, essentially tomato paste spread on pieces of toasted bread. Not as great as the first tapa. The tomato spread was rather chunky and bland in my opinion. The crust on the bread was also quite sharp and a bit difficult to chew. This turned out to be my friend's favorite, however!  Having spent 5 months in Spain, I felt that one could not possibly go to a Spanish tapas restaurant without ordering tortilla. It's basically a condensed omelette filled with potatoes and olive oil. Socarrat's version was pretty good! The texture was mushier than most of the tortilla I've eaten in Seville, but it was just as flavorful. Lastly, we ordered some garlic shrimp. This was my favorite of the bunch! The shrimp was piping hot when the waiter brought the dish to our table. I was blown away at how tender and juicy they were. The garlic flavor was strong.The tapas were definitely more on the expensive side. I really enjoyed the them, but I don't think I would go back another time just for tapas. Service was great and the atmosphere is lovely, however. Maybe one day I'll be back to try the paella.",1,0,0,Diane W.,"Manhattan, NY",110,162,333

Ended the meal with chocolate beignets and the homemade churros and regretted it because it was a waste of money. Beignet was too sweet and churros were stale. 3 stars because I've had better paella and the desserts sucked.

How is that enticing? Ended up getting their seafood soup and WOW! Glad I did. It was jam packed with shrimp, clams, mussels, all kind of good stuff. The broth was nice and saffron-y, not overpowering. We got the croquettes as an appetizer which was good, very soft and creamy but crunchy exterior.

4.0,3/6/2015,"Cute place. Yummy paella.The restaurant is really long and narrow and lots of high tables with stools. The ambiance is more of a casual cozy date feel, not the place for a group. Or maybe I'm biased because there was a noisy group of 5 seated next to us that was kinda killing the vibe. We opted to skip the tapas and go right for the paella. We got the Arroz Negro because squid ink on rice by definition is delicious. Also got a pitcher of sangria, which yields a fair amount of alcohol for two people. The servers warn you ahead of time that the paellas takes about 1/2 hour to prepare, which is understandable. Ours, however, probably took at least twice that long and then some. The server came by once to tell us that it was taking a little longer than usual and it would be out soon. Then he came out again to tell us that ""something happened in the kitchen"" to our paella and they were remaking it. I tried not to think about what that ""something"" was. He offered us a tapa on the house, so we got the calamari and enjoyed that. To be honest, I wasn't that impatient for my food, as a pitcher of sangria is a great distraction while waiting, but I appreciated the gesture nonetheless.The paella, when it finally arrived, was delicious and the garlic aioli was a perfect accompaniment. Plenty of seafood and the squid ink gave the dish a nice briny taste. The rice was properly crispy on the bottom.

1.0,3/4/2015,"This restaurant is awful! We went to the restaurant during for restaurant week deal. Their service was super bad! The waiter didn't know anything about their food and didn't introduce and explain their menu and foods clearly. We showed a picture of an appetizer (Howevos Rotos Con) see if they have it, the waiter said they don't have it on the menu but the chef could make it for us. But when the dish came, it was totally different than what we expected, it was just nasty french fries with an overcooked ugly fried egg. And for the main course, since we didn't know much about Spanish food, we thought there is only PAELLA DEL DIA with 3 different choices, when we asked about the menu, the waiter didn't explain the menu for us clearly. At last, we didn't get what we want for our lunch, and we paid extra to order the food we would like to eat. We ordered a Garlic Shrimp , Croquetas Del Dia and a salad for appetizer (TAPAS), and Paella del dia, zarzuela, Pollo a la plancha for main course, flan and churros sunday funday for dessert. The size of the dish was so different than showed in the pictures!! It was super small. The tastes of the dishes were just so-so, the Paella del dia was very salty! Flan, so nasty, tastes like steamed eggs. None of the dish was acceptable. One of my friend let her umbrella in their restaurant, she called back asking if they see it. Their attitude was terrible!  Very very very disappointed! Terrible experience! Not worth it at all!

3.0,3/2/2015,"RESTAURANT WEEK 2015 - SUNDAY LUNCH [3.5 STARS]Socarrat is known for the paellas and I have been dying to try their paellas and paella del dia on the RW menu was pretty good. It was better than the paella I had at Fig & Olives. However, Arroz Negro was another story though.PROS:-GAMBAS AL AJILLO - (shrimp in garlic olive oil) the shrimp was very fresh and piping hot. I also really like the garlic. It was really crispy and it tasted really well. [4 / 5]- PAELLA DEL DIA (the paella of the day on sunday contained chicken, eggplants, mushroom) - fresh ingredients and I liked the crunchy bits of rice that are stuck to the pan. [4.5 / 5 ]- ZARZUELA (seafood soup containing mussels, shrimp, clams, scallops in saffron sauce) - this was quite delicious albeit a little fishy. [4 / 5]- FLAN - The flan was great. I liked that it wasn't overly sweet and the passion fruit cream paired really well with the flan along with strawberry and blueberry pieces. [5 / 5]- CHURROS SUNDAY FUNDAY (Coffee cream, hot chocolate. whipped cream, cocoa nibs) the churros were hot and crunchy like it came straight from the fryer. With the churros dipped in the chocolate and cream, it tasted even better. MMMm soo Good!! [4.5 / 5]- there are HOOKS underneath the bar area to hang your handbag but it gets in the way of your legs from where you are sitting.THE OKAY: - ARROZ NEGRO PAELLA - I got this to go for my mom and when I brought it back, I found that the rice was undercooked and it was very hard. I had high expectations for this as many reviewers said this was very good and I thought it was just ehh... Like others mentioned this was pretty SALTY. The only thing that was good was that their seafood was fresh. [2.5 / 5]- RED SANGRIA - it's pretty good red wine topped with some chopped up pieces of granny smith apples. It could definitely use a bit more fruits in the sangria. [3 / 5]CONS:- CROQUETAS DEL DIA - for sunday the croquetas were filled with blue cheese. I wasn't too wild about it. I don't really like blue cheese but the creaminess of the filling helped cover up some of the blue cheese taste. It's ok for a bite. [1.5 / 5]- TIGHT SPACE - we were seated at counter quite similar to a bar and it felt a little cramped.",3,0,1,Teresa C.,"New York, NY",156,471,1940

All appetizers were delicious. Two people had to order one kind of paella, so as a table, we had two different kinds. However, they are made in these huge pots so it's plenty to share. We had one with meat. It had chicken and chorizo, with soybeans. The other one we shared had seafood and squid ink. Both were very delicious. Last, we had dessert. It included churros and flan.

The shrimp were delicious... the croquetas a little mushy for me. We both ordered the zarzuela paella... under the paella section... because it was seafood paella, which we both prefer. After eating a few bites, I realized there was no rice. It seemed really strange. The seafood was fine... but it was literally a seafood soup. The waitress didn't bother to let us know what to expect with this dish... I would think she would assume we were wanting paella. When I asked her if any of the paella dishes include rice at this restaurant she said ""yes, the paella dishes do... however, I ordered zarzuela."" Silly me... it was under the ""paella"" section on the restaurant week menu, and our waitress said nothing about it being broth-based. I was pretty peeved- I had been excited about some good paella for weeks. Haven't had great paella since Barcelona! Doubt I'll return, just because I'm still so disappointed from the whole experience. Both desserts were also pretty terrible- flan and churros.After returning home, I went online and looked at their real menu, there is a seafood item under both Paella and under Arroz Caldoso (soupy paella).

Good service, although a bit slow considering the place was pretty empty. The gambas which are a huge staple in Spanish tapas was so boring. It needed salt, it needed love... It needed something! The crab croquettes were very delicious.We both shared the paella del Dia which included chicken, artichokes and asparagus. This also lacked salt but it was easily fixed and made better with the addition of some chili oil. My partner actually hates socarrat (the crispy rice at the bottom) and I love it so thankfully we didn't have to fight over it.The desserts were both horrible to me.

3.0,2/12/2015,"4 stars for the tapas and 2 stars for the squid ink paella. All the tables and chairs are high and without any backs so it's not a comfortable dining experience. You can hang your coat on the hooks under the tables, or check it in. I wish the hooks were bigger though. Happy hours are from 4-6 pm and only at the bar. You get half off the tapas and $6 drinks. We ordered the following:- fried artichokes $11: super delicious! I normally don't like artichokes, but I've never had the fried version. I guess anything dipped in batter and hot oil is delicious. The lemon caper remoulade went really well with the artichokes!  Yum!- bacon wrapped stuffed dates $11: the saltiness of bacon, sweetness from the dates, creamy valdeon cheese, and nuttiness of the almond make for a great combination of flavors. - lamb terrine $16: this came with bread that you can spread the lamb terrine on. It wasn't gamey and tasted pretty good, but nothing outstanding. - roasted suckling pig $16:  mmmmm!  The skin was crispy, and the meat was tender. - squid ink paella $25 per person:  after reading some of the reviews, I requested for the dish to be not too salty. Unfortunately it was still way too salty for my taste =[. Also the portion is very small for the price. It's only covered with a thin layer of rice, and sprinkled with some seafood. The paella's I'm used to eating is huge and covered with tons of seafood. I don't mind paying for quality over quantity, but it was way too salty. I think I would've liked it much more if the chef went lighter with the salt. There were a lot of items on the tapas menu that we wanted to try.

2.0,1/27/2015,"My unexceptional experience has compelled me to write my first review... ever. So the lady and I went to Socarrat after a Broadway show. We were seated near the bar and EVERY seat is a high stool chair. Why?! It was extremely uncomfortable and cramped. Imagine having waiters elbow your back every time they walked out of the kitchen. We ordered tapas and drinks, no complaints there. And then we had the long awaited (~45 mins) paella...No one should ever pay $25+ per person to eat paella. I have never had paella until now and Socarrat has ruined the experience. Let's start off with the pricing of this Spanish seafood rice on a wok. Yes, it's on a wok, pan, whatever you wish to call it. If I went to a Chinese restaurant and their menu showed fried rice being $25+ and priced person for a minimum order of 2 persons, I would probably get quadruple the value and portion.Our Squid Ink paella had barely any seafood. For a moment, we thought the seafood was garnish but then realized the small amount they gave. Our fake-friendly server did not care to explain how to approach this intimidating dish, even when we did let him know it was our first time here. We had to watch him explain it to other people. Perhaps he was a racist towards Orientals, I don't know. Anyways, our paella had seafood like garnish with the thinnest layer of burnt rice on a wok. Almost 80% of the rice was hard, or undercooked, and felt like we were eating pop rocks. I am for certain it's not supposed to be like that. Don't worry, I went home with a quarter of my belly full and extensively researched cooking methods for paellas. My internet research was fulfilling and the findings were informative and impressive. Socarrat was neither. I am not a penny pitcher but I do like to get what I pay for and sometimes more.

Why don't you just put the actual price of the dish on the menu?  Scared no one would order it? Of course NOT, I wouldn't pay $70 for a dish that taste avg and can barely feed two grown adults.  The paella is very thin on rice and ingredients.

Don't get too many tapas before a paella, it's huge. The paella was flat and big- very crispy rice with a lot of seafood. A bit of bitterness from burned rice adds nice punch to it.

We got the grilled calamari tapas and it was splendid. We even kept dipping the bread in the calamari dressing after finishing the calamari. We only ordered the one tapas because the paella was so pricey! Seeing that the squid ink paella was the most reviewed (and pictured), we went for the squid ink paella.

2.0,10/10/2014,"Ahhh Paella!  I actually fasted the day of our reservation to Socarrat in anticipation of a giant pan of sizzling crusty rice and seafood.  Sad to say I should have gotten a piping hot bowl of ramen at Mokbar when I had the chance.So Ellen & I and another couple headed over to Socarrat in Chelsea for paella and appetizers last night.  We had an 8:15pm reservation that went without a hitch.  Though we played musical tables (we were first seated in the bar area at a small table by the door where the distinct odor of cigarettes wafted in), we made it over to the long communal table in the main dining area.  The seating was tight, the ambiance hot, noisy and dark.   The chairs were highboys like in 6th grade chemistry lab.  All this I didn't mind given Socarrat's Spanish flair & menu.  A quick rundown of our order:TAPASGam as Al Ajillo: A sizzling shrimp dish served in a little hot cast iron pot.  It was a fine tapas that everyone at the table shared and enjoyed.  We all mopped up the garlic butter sauce with the hearty spanish bread provided.  Not bad.Pan Con Tomate:  a thin shmear of tomato paste on toast.  Underwhelming at best.Pulpo a la Galega:  I was excited about this dish as I always order octopus if I see it on a menu (hearkening back to Ellen and my time on the Algarve coast of Portugal where we first tasted charred octopus on an open flame).  Maybe expectations were high but the cephalopod served was a mere toenail sized slice of octopus-let, smallish and barely charred.  In the middle of the plate was a was a mound of seasoned potato.  I was disappointed.Milhojas de Cordero:  This was a shredded lamb tapas with spinach & potato; a well seasoned bite.PAELLASWe split two paellas between the four of us; the Arroz Negro & the Paella de Langosta.  Served in the very pans they were made in, large and hot, they were a sight to behold.  The Arroz Negro was full of small round circles of calamari, shrimp in shells, chunks of fish and wafer thin slices of scallops all over black squid ink infused rice.  Good paella is about the crusty bits and I was not disappointed.  Good paella is about scraping the bottom of the pan like cleaning ice off a frozen windshield and i got what i asked for.  Overall, the Arroz Negro was a satisfying dish.Now to the Paella de Langosta, the centerpiece of the meal.  When you order lobster it is a special occasion and must be worthy of the price point.  This is why the restaurant is getting two stars.  The lobster was subpar, bordering on inedible.  Mushy, it was almost rank.  To me, it is inexcusable that the chefs in the kitchen did not bother to taste the lobster as the meat was removed from the shell.  If the lobster would have been succulent and fresh, the rating of this meal would have been four stars.  The rest of this paella; the calamari and scallops, were fine and the crust at the bottom of the pan superb.  But again, to screw the lobster on the most expensive item on your menu - unacceptable.  I take no pleasure in giving two stars, but it is deserved.",2,0,0,Aaron W.,"Atlanta, GA",56,51,56

You just dip your bread after finishing the clams and it is quite flavorful.Sangria is also pretty good choice for a group and it is good 2 glasses per person for the 4 of us. We did end up ordering another pitcher because we are obviously bunch of alcoholics.Here is my big problem with the main dish. For $36 per person, I expect a pan full of seafood and lobster as they describe it on the menu. Yes it smells good. Yes it looks pleasing. But throwing a grilled lobster and only putting scallops and shrimp around the lobster is not my idea of seafood paellela. Couple of recommendations:- Do not burn the rice to the pan; that is what koreans call Noorungyi (hardened rice at the bottom of hot pot).- Less sticky rice; not a fan of scrapping the pan to get the rice.- More real seafood and not the tiny value conscious shrimp and scallops.- Lower the price on the lobster dish because it is a robbery in my opinion.I would recommend actually Hawaiian style lobster kimchee fried rice at Tao to be much better than the paellela.

It had a great taste but I was expecting much more. The tapas were good. We had the suckling pig, but it didn't stand out. We really liked the fried artichokes. I would suggest less salt, but is appreciated the novelty of the dish. The sangria is watered down juice with a hint of wine. I wasn't happy with it.",0,0,0,Carmiña C.,"Edison, NJ",120,52,71
4.0,6/4/2014,"Socorrat is all about paella! I had high hopes for this place and it sure didn't disappoint.The Paella is cooked to perfection. It is served in huge paella pan complete with a heat platform and serving spoon.The key to paella greatness is the contrast between the soft and moist rice in the interior of the paella, and the crunchy almost burnt rice that is stuck to the bottom of the back. Socorrat has this nailed down. You can't have a restaurant named Socorrat and not have this down to a science.The paella ingredients do no disappoint. Chicken thighs, duck, chorizo, shrimp, lobster, mussels, you name it, they have it.As long as you make sure to scrape the pan with the serving spoon, you will enjoy a truly wonderful paella.The environment is very swanky and intimate. The restaurant is pretty small but that's part of what makes it cool. Get ready to wait a bit and pay a hefty price for paella. It is a bit expensive per person, about $25 each for any paella dish, but it is well worth it.",1,1,1,Eric T.,"New York, NY",15,82,76
4.0,6/2/2014,"I came here for a Friday date night with the boyfriend. We had made reservations a few days prior but still had to wait about 15 minutes before getting seated. The restaurant is quite small and the tables are very close together but the atmosphere was still relaxed and romantic.We started off with a pitcher of sangria which was a bit on the small side--it poured about two glasses each (but barely). As for the food menu, although they had a good selection of paellas to choose from, I thought the tapas menu was a bit limited. Regardless, all three tapas dishes that we ordered were delicious. Plato Campero was a great charcuterie and cheese dish, the garlic aioli on the Patatas Bravas was delectable (make sure to ask for more), and the lamb and accompaniments in the Milhojas de Cordero dish was top notch (an absolute must order). Still, the best part of the dinner was yet to come. We ordered the Pescados & Mariscos paella and it did not disappoint. Firstly, the dish is quite large, especially compared to other paella restaurants like Boqueria. Second, the chef did not skimp out on the good stuff--the dish was stuffed with lots of fish, shrimp, muscles, scallops, and more. It is the closest paella dish that I've found in the city that is as good as the ones I've had in Barcelona. We were a bit worried in the beginning about not getting filled but we actually ended up taking a third of the paella home because it was so much (fortunately!). I would absolutely recommend this restaurant and look forward to going back.

Of course, just kidding~Waiters are polite and very friendly. They also know their wine, and they gave us a great recommendation.I forgot the name of our wind.

It always gives you a refreshing feeling.Paella had a very rich flavor. You can see from my picture, it has everything in it. I think it s better than have anything only because it s a great combination of different tastes.We also had prossuito. You put it on the bread which is covered by olive oil and tomatoes.

Nothing special.A bit disappointed with their paella, which is perhaps their signature dish.

We started off with the red sangria. oh my gosh! The red sangria was the perfect blend of sweet and refreshing!We started off with creamy croquettes. Deep-fried breaded yumminess!When I think of Spanish tapas, garlic shrimp immediately comes to mind. It's prepared in olive oil, garlic and guindillo pepper. Yum!Our flatbread had tomatoes, cheese and ham on it. This was pretty good but I wish I had left more room in my belly for the paella.Next we had the braised pork belly with roasted potato and pureed date. I love dates! They are juicy and sweet! Joe really enjoyed the braised pork belly. Very flavorful and moist.The patata bravas are like steak french fries with garlic aioli and guindillo tomato sauce. This was goo-ood!The entire reason why we came to Socarrat was for the squid ink paella. This dish was so beautiful when we saw it! The rice really was black ! That is awesome. when I was eating this though, I couldn't distinguish the squid ink flavor. This paella dish included fish, scallop, shrimp. and calamari.The carne paella came with pork, duck, chicken, chorizo and mushrooms.

It was a pre-ordered dinner and we had the fried artichokes (yum), bruschetta (standard), pork belly (better than average), octopus (GREAT), grilled veggies (standard) and 3 types of paella - meat, veggie, seafood.

But, it is intimate, with low lighting in a long narrow space, and even with their communal seating at tables. Me and my date shared some tapas plates, Croquetas, Tocino (pork belly, with just the right amount of fat), Chorizo a La Riojana, and Scallops wrapped in Bacon (not the correct name, & not on the current menu). They were all so tasty and delicious.The second time was recently with a group of friends. Me and my friends had the tapas, Milhojas Cordero (lamb), Gambas Al Ajillo (shrimp), Alcachofas Fritas (artichokes), once again all the tapas plates were tasty and delicious.  We shared the Paella Arroz Negro (the dinner Paella's are for two people to share, and the price you see on the menu is per person), the black ink rice was tasty, but it's not on the same level as the tapas plates. The calamari, and shrimp tasted fine, but the scallops and Basa fish seemed like they were overcooked and soggy, both were lacking in seafood taste or the squid ink taste that was so prevalent in the rice. Socarrot what happened??? This won't stop me from going there again, because I love their tapas.

What a messy job! The meat paella was somewhat better, at least it wasn't dry, but also very salty. The staff insisted that this is how paella is supposed to be-that people like it burned. At the end that bought two flans, compliment of the restaurant.It being a bar, you also sit on stools at the table.

Waiters were very friendly and attentive from refilling water, taking our coats, taking our orders etc. Instead of individual tables, we were seated at a long table that spans the entire room. Despite being squeezed between to other couples, the setting was still pretty intimate with still enough elbow room.The prie fixe menu came with two tapas, a paella, and two desserts. The squid tapa wasn't anything too special. Just squid grilled in garlic and butter. The lamb terrine tapa was the best thing we ate that night. The meat was really tender, had a good lamb taste, but wasn't overpowering. It was also stuffed with some kind of delicious cheese. This isn't on their regular menu, but I hope they will offer it again. Both dishes had delicious sauces that goes great with the free bread.The paella was mediocre. The crunchy pieces of rice gave a nice texture, kind of reminded me of bibimbap, but the whole dish was extremely salty. I couldn't taste anything but salt after a few bites. I could have done without the paella and just ordered more tapas.We finished the meal with the chocolate beignets and flan.

4.0,1/2/2014,"Socarrat is beautiful and delicious.  I've dined here three times in the eight years I've lived on Manhattan with noteworthy gaps of time between each visit.  The first time I was on a date (thanks guys! she was impressed), the second I was with out-of-town family (thanks again! they were impressed), and this time I was with a coworker for her first time (once again thanks!).  Every visit has been enjoyable.Although I am writing this review today my coworker and I dined here, I believe, December 18, 2013 around 6:45 PM with no reservation.  The dining area beyond the bar appeared full, but the communal table was empty.  The past two times I've dined here my parties, one the same size and one a person larger, were seated at the table.  The prior visits were both later in the evenings without reservations when the place was fuller, so I don't know what factors determine being sat there.  Not being sat at the communal table was not detrimental to the evening.  I mention it only because it caused the slightest bit of confusion upon our arrival.  The hostess seemed puzzled about where to seat us.  I assumed it was her first night.  It was cold outside, and we stood at the door longer than desired before my coworker asked if we could eat dinner at the bar.  We were told we could, so the evening progressed.The bartender was availabe when necessary and kept his distance when he wasn't which was appreciated.  I've eaten at bars in the past where it felt like every chew was being counted.  I ordered a glass of the syrah to warm myself.  It was delicious and did the trick.  We ordered the datiles (bacon-wrapped, almond & blue cheese stuffed dates), cochinillo asado (roast suckling pig with a pork sauce reduction), and the cordero paella (lamb short rib with brussel sprouts, cauliflower, and broccoli).Everything was delicious, but I wish the vegetables that came with the paella had more flavor.  I assumed they would be cooked with the rice and lamb allowing them to absorb the flavors.  Instead it appeared they'd been boiled and added on top at the very end without any seasoning.Having been a manager in the service industry my entire career I want to congratulate the staff very quickly about two things I observed that may normally have been overlooked:1) Your food runner was great.  He was charmingly cordial; a detail lacking even from some high-end establishments.2) Two women having dinner at the bar next to my coworker and I started getting loud because the server had, admittedly, forgotten to ring in their paella causing a large delay in its delivery.  The manager, server, and bartender remained utterly professional until the women were satisfied.  After the women had left, no one, even jokingly, said anything negative about them.Thanks for keeping it classy Socarrat!  This is why I keep returning.",1,0,0,Jimmy J.,"Manhattan, NY",8,3,0

My favourite paella was the one was Arroz Negro because of all the seafood goodies. After some bland dessert the bill came out to 42 per a person which was pretty ridiculous since no one ordered alcohol.

3.0,12/24/2013,"My wife and I came here to have dinner a few days ago. My wife had been hearing rave reviews about this place from her friends so we decided to give it a try.We walked in without a reservation and therefore had to sit at the bar. The hostess was very personable and the bartender was a friendly guy. My wife ordered a glass of wine that the bartender recommended and I ordered a beer.We ordered the Arroz Negro paella and since it was going to be a while before it came out, we ordered the bacon wrapped dates as well. The bacon wrapped dates were pretty good - we both liked them. The paella was out a few minutes later. It tasted pretty good but definitely not outstanding. The squid ink gave the rice an interesting flavour, and there were several pieces of seafood thrown in as well. Still, we didn't think it was all that fantastic. Pretty decent, but not great.The thing that struck me here was that this place is a bit overpriced. Now we've eaten at enough nice restaurants that we don't reeeaaally calculate what we want our total bill to be, but it ended up being about $100 here. Pricing the bacon wrapped dates at $9 per plate (3 pieces) was a bit much. The paella was $24 per person , which is the cost of an entre' at a good restaurant, an in general, not unacceptable. However, the overall dining experience combined with the unjustifiable prices left us a bit overwhelmed.Overall, this is an OK place.

5.0,12/24/2013,"I visited Socarrat's Chelsea location on a Friday night. We arrived about 15 minutes than our reservation stated. We were cordially greeted by the maître d' who pointed out our early arrival and seating us within 45 seconds. The atmosphere is cozy yet sophisticated. We sat at a table intended for six where a couple had already been sitting at the far end of the table. The initial awkwardness quickly wore off when we took in the decor around us. The tables are bar height and the chairs are cushioned bar stools. Not being an expert in the topic, I would guess this helps reduce the feeling of congestion. The menu is simple, they offer Tapas, Paella, Drinks, and Dessert. But that's just about where the mundane ends. They inform you that the Parlla takes 30 minutes to make, we almost felt obligated to order tapas, good thing we did. We ordered bacon wrapped dates, fried artichokes and a Manchego platter. The Manchego platter was delicious, but left me thinking that the amount on the plate was not commiserate with the price tag. The fried artichokes was delicious and plentiful. The dates wrapped in bacon were out of this world. But only to be out done by the Cordero Paella that followed; By far the best tasting and most unique Paella I've ever had. The food was so good that although we want to continue tasting other items on the menu, there is trepidation having already discovered the great dishes we have already sampled.",1,0,0,Vlad C.,"Jersey City, NJ",30,12,29

3.0,12/17/2013,"I came here for dinner on a Monday night at 7:30pm after making a reservation through Opentable. It wasn't too crowded when my friend and I first arrived, and we were seated at a long high-top table where several other parties were seated as well. There was no one sitting next to us for the first 45 minutes or so that we were there, so it was comfortable, but once you have neighbors it can start to feel a little cramped. You're also close enough together to easily eavesdrop on the people next to you.We came primarily for the paella, but since we knew it would take a while to come out, we also decided to get a few tapas plates. We ended up going with the Croquetas (croquettes) and the Datiles (bacon-wrapped dates). The croquettes came four on a plate and were gooey and delicious. They were a little hard to pick up with my fork though since they were so soft. The bacon-wrapped dates tasted a little funky and smoky to me, but I just realized that it's probably because they were stuffed with blue cheese (which I'm not a fan of). Those come three on a plate, but we added an extra one just to make it even.For the paella, we went with the Arroz Negro. There was a plentiful amount of squid, scallops, fish, and shrimp. But there wasn't as much rice as I was expecting for $24/person, and the rice itself was pretty bland. Overall, I didn't think the paella was particularly good, and I've had much better elsewhere.Service was generally pretty good, but I probably wouldn't come back for the food.",1,0,0,Michelle L.,"New York, NY",423,287,2844

Just a far warning for people who like to lay back, this place is all stools and high tables.

The croquettes were very flavorful and creamy, the octopus was very well prepared and not rubbery at all, and the bacon wrapped was covered in bacon so of course I fucking liked it.

Did you know that in Spain people don't go to ""tapas bars"" or actively seek out tapas. Rather you go to a bar, you order a drink, and you get a tapas on the house. You order another drink, and you get another tapas. Who would have thunk-it. It's AWESOME! We each ordered a glass of white wine (which was sweet) and in return we each got two crostinis with cheese and ham. TEN DOLLARS! What a deal! I love it!!! And the tapas was great! We saw the same tapas on the menu later that was $12, not sure how many crostini's it would have had on the regular menu, I presume 3-4 (at most). Ordered the seafood and the meat paella. Both were awesome. The flavors were so distinct and fragrant. I don't even know where to begin. Salty, savory, umami, sweet, etc. Best part was that there were left overs, and heated up the next day just as good! May have been even better. I will definitely return here the next time I'm in NYC.

Third the lighting was so low that I could hardly see my food.  Finally, and most importantly, the food portions were not quite sufficient given the price.  The tortilla cost $7 and was roughly the size of a doughnut.  Yes, tapas are supposed to be small portions but they are also supposed to be inexpensive. Not sure how they can justify charging higher prices and then serving less food, especially on a dish with basic, inexpensive ingredients (potatoes, egg and onions).  The paella for two people also turned out to be just barely enough to satisfy.  So while the core elements of Socarrat are solid, they could greatly enhance the experience with a few tweeks here and there.",0,0,1,Doug S.,"Jersey City, NJ",128,39,1

Sea food lovers will not be disappointed with their sea food paella. There's always a couple of girls in the party who love the black rice and squid ink, so definitely get that as well as it has a nice flavor to it.I'd recommend this place for the after-work dinner meet-up if it's located conveniently for you.

5.0,6/14/2013,"DEFINTELY GO! One of my first 5 star rating on Yelp and I'm happy to give it to Socarrat. The space is very intimate and darkly lit so while I went to meet a friend, I think it's also an appropriate place to take a date. But it's also a casual place, so keep that in mind. It's more the mood of the place that lends itself as a date-like location. Because the space is limited, I would recommend making a reservation. I'm sure you would be fine not making one but you might as well take advantage of the service. It's super easy to do through Open Table right here on Yelp. My friend and I shared 4 tapas although I think if we had gotten one or two more tapas I would have left more satisfied. I didn't reduce the stars because that was my own fault. Between the two of us, we spent 35 bucks on 4 tapas so it was more than reasonable. We shared a shrimp, pork belly, tomato spread on bread, and a potato dish. It was absolutely amazing! My favorites were the bread and the pork belly. The pork belly came with a potato base, a spice (really hott!), and green apple. Put all together, it popped in your mouth. Even the green apple and potato without the pork tasted impeccable. The shrimp was also nicely done. My least favorite dish was the potato dish but what can you really do with potatoes? It came with a tomato sauce and cheese, so it tried but it wasn't my favorite. But don't get me wrong, it tasted fine.  The service was also great! They removed finished dishes quickly and they brought out each dish as they are ready and the service was incredibly fast! Again, DEFINTELY GO!

We started with the Tocino (braised pork belly) that come with two pieces of pork and two slices of crispy potato and date puree. Sooo tender and delicious! Just don't expect a huge portion when you order it :)For our paella entree we tried the Pesacados y Mariscos, which our waiter said was more traditional compared to the Arroz Negro. They let you know that the paella takes about 30 minutes to prepare. It was well worth the wait. It was extremely flavorful and had a great amount of seafood in it. THE BEST PART? The crunch rice at the bottom of the pan! Once you're about 3/4 finished with the dish, your waiter comes over to help you scrape every last bit of the amazing crunchy rice. I was so full but couldn't waste a bit of it!They were disappointingly out of the churros with chocolate dessert that they advertised so we wound up going somewhere else for dessert.

It's nice and all but it can get kind of breezy - when it does, dust and pollen goes flying everywhere into your food). The seafood paella was a tad on the salty side. The seafood in it (shrimp, mussels, clams, cod fish) did taste pretty fresh though. We also tried the same paella dish but with squid ink. I'm not sure how I feel about it. It was my first time trying anything with ink in it (not counting the times I've had a pen explode on my face). Seemed kind of tasteless.

You sit at a so-called communal table, which is fine, but here you are squeezed in a space so narrow that it leaves no place for the food. We first ordered several tapas: the ""queso"" consisted of three see-through 2 inch slices of cheap manchego for 7.00! The ""tortilla"" looked like a one of those frozen patties from the local coop. The fried artichokes were, well fried artichokes, but the pork belly was just disgusting. It smelled offensively like pig and the consistency was rather strange. The tapas arrived in rapid succession, and since there was no place  for all the plates, the waiter more or less hurried us to eat faster. After this horrible tapas experience we decided to skip the paella and were glad we did. The strangers we shared the table with were not happy with the mush.

We promptly ordered our paella upon sitting, considering the prep time would be about half an hour. When our companion arrived, we sampled some tapas. Over and over again, the dishes were ok, but just that - unremarkable. Tapas: The tapas lunch was actually a pretty good deal at $14 for a selection of 3 tapas. We tried a bunch of them, and nothing particularly stood out to me. I was looking forward most to the blue-cheese-stuffed-bacon-wrapped Datiles, which were a huge disappointment. If there was any cheese, it was entirely overtaken by the massive dates whose sweetness seemed to overpower any other flavor.Paella: We went with the Socarrat, which had a meat/seafood combo. For a price of $22/head, the portions of protein were small, the rice wasn't crispy on the bottom as promised, and our paella came out cold.I would certainly not come back for the food, but I have heard that the place transforms for happy hour.

She quickly said ""No,"" and that they had no availability for several more hours.  She was quite cold and short with me.  Given their mistake, the cold reception, and the poor service I have experienced in the past, I will not be returning to Socarrat.  There are too many other good restaurants in the area.",0,0,0,Melissa P.,"Manhattan, NY",1,12,0

Pros: The seafood semmed of reaally good quality and the scallops were soft as butterNice crispy edgesOverall pretty tastyWine was greatCons:Overly oily. My stomach was not happy for the rest of the night.For the price, the portion seemed kinda small. The paellas arrive in a huge pan but the  actual dish consists of only a thin layer of rice.

We had a reservation so it was a bit easier, but there would have been a wait otherwise. My only complaint is that the tables are situated so that if your party only has two, you will be seated with other people since the arrangement is more community dining. I usually have no problem with this but if you are starving and the other party's food comes first, drool starts coming out of the corner of my mouth and I start to get the ""rapid dog"" look. Now you are thinking, mussels and rice, it can't be that good right? Oh but it can. I tried the pescados and mariscos, seafood was cooked perfectly, oh gosh, absolutely. The rice was slightly crusty on the bottom and retained the juices so well, you were scraping the bottom of the pan looking for gold. Come here with a large party, not for an awkward date.

3.0,4/29/2013,"Socarrat is like that guy that you've been on a couple of dates with, who's great on paper and you guys have all these mutual friends in common, but there's just zero chemistry. I can't even count the number of times I've dined here, but each time I walk away wishing that meal had been just a little bit better.It was after dinner last Friday that I decided to finally write a review for this place. Firstly, claustrophobic seating. I'd resigned myself to the communal table seating in Socarrat's main room, but this past weekend we got seated in the bar seating in the smaller room, where you are literally elbow-to-elbow with strangers. Like, drop in on their conversations close. I've been to Soccarat's Lower East Side location and can attest that that location is way more spacious and group-friendly.Then, the tapas. We got the Pan Tomaca, Coca (flatbread of the day), the Tocino (braised pork belly), Gambas Al Ajillo, and Patatas Bravas. I always order the Gambas and the Patatas Bravas at every tapas restaurant I go to as a ""benchmark"" dish. Every tapas place will have them, they're easy to do, and yet I've been to restaurants where these pedestrian dishes were the winners of the entire night. Here, at Socarrat, the tapas are mediocre at best. It's as if the chefs decided to expend all their energy on the paellas and only appended a tapas menu as an afterthought. The gambas lacked any garlicky flavor, the patatas bravas were SWIMMING in a spicy mayonnaise, and the pork belly was greasy and listless.For paella we went with the Seafood, which comes with a multitude of shrimp, mussels, clams, fish, etc. Generous with the seafood, but the dish just didn't taste that flavorful and lacked that really deep, fishy taste you'd expect of such a dish. The waiters do do an expert job of scraping off the charred crust at the bottom of the pan, mmmm burnt bits.So this place isn't cheap, and I rarely skate by with less than a $70 tab / pp. So why do I keep coming back? I guess it's out of hope that the new date will be different, that suddenly I'll find the food renewed and inspired and conversation will flow easily and sparks will be zinging out of my fingertips.

1.0,4/8/2013,"In the ten years I've lived in NYC, I've never received worse service. Our waiter was so rude right off the bat that I thought he was kidding. I was wrong. Our party of five knew before even arriving that we wanted to order the much-famed paella. We wanted to split a few of the ones on offer and asked the waiter if he could recommend the right number to order. His response was to ask us how many we wanted. We restated the question, thinking he must not have heard, and he responded with the same question. He just blatantly didn't want to help us. As the others at the table were discussing since we had to decide for ourselves, I decided to get the appetizer order going since the waiter was just standing there waiting. When I asked for garlic shrimp,. he responded, ""I ASKED how many paellas you want."" Suffice to say, the night went downhill from there. When we ordered more wine, he walked away before each member of the party had ordered. When I stepped away from the table for a few minutes, I returned to hear the waiter and hostess insulting our party for ""complaining too much."" They saw, froze and then just started laughing.I know that the job of a server at a busy, popular restaurant in NY cannot be easy. Therefore, I always go out of my way to be polite and patient. No member of my party was rude, intoxicated or demanding. I have no idea what we did to deserve the ire and disrespect of our waiter. Perhaps he was having a bad day.

I would recommend mixing the bowl to cover the potatoes with both sauces once it gets to your table. Very tasty!   I took off another star for unreasonable prices.

Having been to Spain before, I thought it would be a great idea to try American Paella. BIG MISTAKE!!! The dish was edible but, for the price & amount of food, ridiculous! First you NEED to go with more than 2 people so the amount of ingredients you receive are not dried out. For maybe 1 1/2 cups of rice, 2 oz. of rabbit (tough), 3 oz. of pork (including the bones), 4 asparagus, & 20 snow peas; $48 is far over priced. Then I got 2 tapas which was 8 small ""fishy"" shrimp cooked in oil with some garlic & pepper = $10. Four veggie pizza ""thingys"" which were the size of some town house crackers with thinly sliced zucchini, onion paste & cheese = $10. 2 Spanish sodas which were delightful & water $100 by the time I gave tip & everything. The waiter was awesome & he scraped all the dried burnt oily rice around the pot for me to eat & explained to me that was what was called Socarrat henceforth the name of the restaurant.

The slightly charred crust at the bottom gives it an awesome flavor and texture, as does the garlic oil/butter thing that comes on the side. -1 star for the waiter bluntly refusing to give me complimentary bread until the entree was served, even though I specifically asked him for some (I was starving and they said the paella takes 40 minutes to prepare!).",1,0,0,Will Y.,"Flushing, NY",7,25,0
3.0,2/23/2013,"Soccarat had a great atmosphere until the Friday night crowd got there. It got steadily louder and although the hostesses were nice enough, the tempo is one of assembly line, next please.  We were walk-ins (gulp) and we hung around the bar and kept being told that famed table would be ready soon. When it finally was, it was just the same as sitting at the bar, side by side at bar stools.  We had pre-ordered a paella and we were surprised when the bill came and we realized we had been charged for two paellas. Well, read the reviews and they clearly say, one paella serves two people. And it was our plan to try some tapas as well.  Who decided that we were gourmands who had to be fed a dish of paella each (I am 4 foot 10 and don't have an enormous appetite and my friend is hardly a jock who stuffs himself).  So we had t make do with one tapas, and the delicious paella (with the wonderful soccarat burnt bits which are to be missed) and a dessert. We had barely spooned the penultimate mouthful when the bartender (a less than cheerful chap) deftly tried to remove it and to dish up our bill.  Well, we got the hint. This is not a place for friends to meet and hang out and chat, because all you can hope to do is yell niceties over the din and wold down the delicacies and be shunted out. I will come back and make sure I am not given the bum's rush and the service at the table is better. Or I will make a noise about it is I refrained from doing this time around.",0,1,0,Mita H.,"Manhattan, NY",1,2,0
3.0,2/20/2013,"This is probably the closest authentic to Spain paella place I've been to. I think visiting Spain and having paella in that place where it was invented spoiled me. We arrived famished and right when it opened since we didn't have breakfast. Though they said the take about 30-40 min to make, it was more like 45 pushing on 50 min. Maybe it takes time to heat up the stoves since we were one of the first people in the place. Can't imagine the wait when it's super busy though. We would've ordered appetizers to tide us over but we knew the paella would be huge and it's not like us tourists, could take the leftovers home. So we suffered and waited. The paella comes in a pan the size of an extra-large pizza. We got the namesake, the Socarrat paella, which had a good helping of chicken, beef, shrimp, mussels, clams, squid and veggies. Good flavor, so much rice. Wish it was crispier or that I could scrape more of crispy bits from the bottom of the pan. There was only two of us to share this enormous pan so more than enough food. I think I had three plate-fulls and was stuffed. We tried to finish most of it but there was at least another serving left. I think it would be perfect for 3. They also charge per person though. I believe the Socarrat paella was $22 per person. I'm sure it's more food in the pan if there was more people. Also had a glass of Sangria - not my fav. I also thought I saw a sign by the door that said it was $5, but they charged me the full price of about $10. Oh well.",0,0,0,Alison W.,"San Jose, CA",507,1862,1368

I'm sure the paella is wonderful, but we weren't very hungry, just opted for tapas and were mostly disappointed.The croquettas were just gross - obviously came from a frozen package, were about the size of my thumb, and served on top of greasy mayonnaise.  The squid was okay, but cooking it on a flat top is NOT the same as grilling it - so we were expecting something else.  The patatas bravas were fair, but the shrimp with garlic were really gross - tasted fishy.  The pimientos fritos, however, were fantastic - perfectly fried and delicious - I love this dish and could have easily eaten another one.The sangria was okay - very sweet, and I liked that they offered both a roja and rose variety.  The server was a nice guy too - engaged in a conversation with us about the Venezuelan economy.Overall when I saw the bill, my heart almost stopped.  Overpriced is putting it nicely.  I'm not interested in returning to this place.",1,0,0,Rachelle R.,"New York, NY",57,335,39

5.0,2/14/2013,"The best paella you will eat outside of Spain..de verdad! I'm partial to the mariscos (seafood) paella but the fideuà (similar preparation but with fideos - Spanish noodles that have been broken into bits before cooking - in lieu of the Calasparra or Bomba paella rice, served with or without squid ink) is another must-have. The seafood paella is simply to die for: perfectly cooked paella rice with a plethora of succulent chunks of codfish, shrimp, cuttlefish, mussels, clams, cockles, scallops, Basque piquillo peppers and lima (or are those fava?) beans. The best part comes towards the end of your meal: when you've almost completely devoured your paella, your waiter or runner will stop by and kindly offer to scrape the socarrat (the prized crust on the bottom of the pan that is the hallmark of a properly cooked paella, akin to Persian tahdig in rice terms) for you with the serving spoon, say yes and watch approvingly because, boy, are they adept at expertly prying the delicious, crispy rice bits from the pan.Practicalities:*Reservations for Socarrat Paella Bar in Chelsea are a MUST! Seems like a no-brainer in NYC but woe be the hungry group of friends who wander in one night in search of some paella, this place gets super crowded (and loud)! Since you will likely be seated at a crowded communal table anyway, save yourself an interminable wait and make a reservation via Open Table or over the phone. (You can expedite your wait by pre-ordering your paella before they seat you since paella making is a delicate art that ought not to be rushed).*Each order of paella serves 2 people, so come prepared to share. Hopefully your gustatory preferences align (vegetarian with the pescatarian/meat eater will be difficult).*While you are waiting for your paella to arrive, order some of Socarrat's legit tapas: I recommend the boquerones (white anchovies), tortilla with sliced potatoes served with a squiggle of romesco sauce, gambas al ajillo (garlic shrimp on a sizzling hot plancha), patatas bravas, almendras Marcona & aceitunas. I'm not one to ever say no to Manchego, so definitely consider the assorted quesos.*Should you not be able to finish your paella in one sitting, they will of course box up any leftovers for you to take home. I have been known to eat cold paella leftovers straight from the aluminum tin the same night or the next day...Socarrat's paella is simply that good!*I eat here frequently but I had my post-MPhil celebration here last year and they were kind enough to hold and cut the amazing cake from Momofuku Milk Bar that my friend had ordered for me..because they're cool like that. There may or may not have been a cake-cutting fee but it was the perfect ending to a perfect meal.",0,0,0,Cheryl L.,"New York, NY",0,39,63

I realize it's NY and restaurant space is limited, but this was taking it to a new level. The couple next to us was on what seemed to be an awkward Match date. The girl was VERY chatty but it was pretty amusing to eavesdrop on them. If I came back I would reserve one of the private tables. To drink we shared the sangria. It was very good and there was plenty in the pitcher. It wasn't that strong though. We shared three small plates, no paella. The shrimp, asparagus and the fried potatoes. Everything was good but insanely overpriced. $9 for 5 asaparugus stalks? Come on now... Again, I know this is NY but where do they get off charging that much for what would cost 9 cents at a grocery store? If I came back I would share the paella.

Four of us were seated at the long table and the stranger sitting next to me had his arm too close to my comfort. There are some hooks under the tables for your coat/bags but you can check your coat with the hostess, which is a plus. FOOD/DRINKS:The red Sangria was great. The tapas: not so much. The shrimp dish was a bit overcooked and chewy. The squid was uninteresting. Both were bland and unadventurous. The mushroom dish was my favorite of all three. These tapas in diminutive size are overpriced for what they offer. Now to the main dish: PAELLA. We ordered the Socarrat. I was really excited when it came out and it looked really delicious. My eyes melted. But I was sadly disappointed. Even though the flavor was great, the rice was undercooked and overall it was too greasy.SERVICE:I had a reservation for 7PM but one of my friends was going to arrive half-hour late so I informed the hostess. She was very nice, said it was okay and that we would have until 9 PM until the next reservation for our table. Now, two hours might sound like a lot of time but it is not. And because we knew this, we were not able to fully enjoy the dinner. We felt pressured. Now, my friend and I had long coats so we checked them with a second hostess. While we were catching up, we saw something drop on the table. I picked it up and it was the coat check number. I understand if the hostess didn't want to interrupt us while we were in deep conversation but throwing the number at our table without a word was just plain RUDE. Needless to say I didn't tip her so let her sulk and think over her manners.Our waiter was overtly serious. He was usually rushing around and made us feel rushed too. A second waiter, Diego, was more welcoming and whenever we wanted something we would call for him instead.  After the meals were eaten and the plates quickly removed, the check appeared instantly at our table. Talk about fast service! They deserve the ""Fastest Service"" Award.The only good highlight was that Diego, upon hearing about my birthday that night, gave us complimentary--and delicious--Bunuelos. Thanks to him, the restaurant gets the extra .5 star. EXPERIENCE:All the rave reviews + expensive prices + hard to get reservations = high expectations.

This was hands down the BEST paella I have ever eaten in my entire life, including paella eaten in Spain.We had a reservation for lunch, but since we arrived around 2, we didn't need one. But definitely make one for all other times because this place is small. Important notes: All of the tables in this restaurant are bar height and have bar stools. Some of the stools at the 2-seater tables had backs, but some did not. This is not a good place to bring elderly folks, anyone in a wheelchair, or those with bad backs. Also, the pathways are very narrow so this is not a good place to bring a stroller.The atmosphere is very intimate and dark so probably very romantic at dinner.  While we were waiting for our 6th person to show up, we ordered some tapas: the croquettes, shrimp, squid, and grilled peppers. Everything was very good, but especially the shrimp and peppers. Our waiter also very helpfully let us know that the paella takes a long time to cook, so we placed our orders for the paellas immediately after.We had the socarrat and the carne paella.

Two tapas- the fried eggplant with goat cheese and honey and the shrimp. The fried eggplant was delicious but the shrimp was not good at all-- I have had much better shrimp tapas in that style at other restaurants-- skip this one. We ordered the paella socarrat. The rice was delicious, but we found VERY little chicken, beef or calamari in ours. The portion size was huge though and the fish and shrimp were fresh (I didn't eat the mussels, cockle clams, etc., so I cannot comment). For dessert we ordered the flan. I do not like flan in general, but my boyfriend does and I know it's traditional, so I wanted to give it another try. This flan was OUT OF THIS WORLD-- the best I have ever had (I don't even like it) and my boyfriend said the same. It tasted like creme brulee and had that kind of hard/sugary top to it. Seriously, order that even if you don't like flan or even if you do like creme brulee-- it was AMAZING and up there with one of the best desserts I have EVER had in my lifetime.

I like how crispy it is at the bottom of the pan, and what a good flavor the rice its own has. We asked the waiter how they could make the rice so tasty. The waiter told us that they cooked the rice with chicken broth for a long time before they cook it with other ingredients. He couldn't say more, but I think that's part of the reason why it's so tasty. We got Bunuelos and one other thing (forget the name) as desserts.

I loved how there was a nice variety of meat, seafood and vegetables in the dish.  I particularly enjoyed the flavors and textures of the cuttle fish and the cockles.  The rice was also cooked to perfection as I find most places undercook the rice, leaving it wet with the liquids unabsorbed.  Overall the food was very satisfying and we washed it all down with a pitcher of sangria.",5,2,1,Virginia T.,"New York, NY",234,305,17

Other roommate and I were trying to figure out where to take her for her birthday and knowing us we waited to the very last minute to figure it out. The only thing we knew she loved to eat is rice. That is her favorite food after all. So why not paella?! After a quick google/yelp search this place showed up. Making a reservation day of was really easy but that could be because it was a Monday night. Got there at 8:30 and there was a decent amount of people there. The place is a small but cute. Dark setting, nice ambience. Laid back but chic. The tables are long and you sit on bar stools so I felt cool being tall. And the tabletop is a mirror so you can check yourself out if you want. It's good when you're bored. But I of course was not bored because it was my best friend's birthday - duh.We ordered some sangria. which was very good. Although a bit pricey ($34 a pitcher). I'm by no means a sangria connoisseur but I'm thinking my taste buds can't be that off. We also got two tapas - the fried artichoke and fried sardines. They were small portions and were pretty good. I think we just wanted some munchies while we drank the sangria. For the paella we ordered the Arroz Negro and the Valencia (I think that's what it's good). I personally liked the Arroz Negro the best! The rice was very tasty and came with a good amount of seafood. The other one was good too (rabbit, pork ribs and snail..interesting mix). Portions are huge and we all left very very full. It's a fun type of eating experience especially for groups of friends. Family style is the best not only because I'm asian and grew up with that but friends in nyc are now my family. Paella was around $23-25 PER PERSON. Not too shabby.

My favorite paella is the Valencia--pork, rabbit, snail, snow peas, asparagus and overall deliciousness. Their seafood ones are also quite strong. It may be a good idea to start with some tapas since the paella typically takes about 40 minutes to prepare. The pork belly is delicious. The zucchini is tasty. They also have a truffle mushroom tapa that smells absolutely amazing (we ordered it later on because the people next to us had it and the the aroma was irresistible) but it's a bit on the salty side and not as truffle-y as it smells. However, it does compliment the paella well as a side. They have a great cava selection as well at very reasonable prices.

I'll start with the good - the atmosphere is lovely. Narrow bar in the front, communal tables in a room to the side, and some individual tables to the rear. The colors are darker and it's quite a sexy space.Next to the bad. Unfortunately, like most Spanish restaurants, this place lacks any form of noise control, and the noise, with loud tables around us, became rather unbearable at some point later in the evening. Service also was not very good. We felt a bit neglected, seated toward the back.Now for the food - we had a lovely little berenjena (eggplant) appetizer that was very nice, but for $10, they served one tiny eggplant (quartered into four pieces), which is pretty damn overpriced.The paella is a bit more ""bang for the buck."" A huge heaping of paella comes for two, and they are generous with the fish. While the paella was pretty good, and it had a nice crust on the bottom - my favorite part of the paella - it was a bit lacking in flavor. Both my friend and I were thinking that we needed some sort of spicy sauce in order to make up for the lack of flavor in the paella. The seafood on top was mixed in terms of how tasty it was.

Twice I've been there and both times they managed to piss me off. I understand that, because of prep time for the paella, ordering 30mins ahead helps with the flow of turnover and that they want your whole party to be present before being seated- I have absolutely no problem with that. What's completely annoying is how they deal with seating and the 2nd time was the worst: they tried to seat a party of 3+ at the end of the long table at an L-shape formation where two of us will end up staring at a wall or strain to talk to the other two. And there were two other four tops available. They moved us when requested, but not w/out a strained look and some hesitation. OKAY...I've been a hostess, I never got hurt when trying to shift patrons around. And then our server didn't ask us if we wanted dessert. Just said he's NOT trying to rush us and gave us the bill. Alright alright, we GOT THE CLUE. Socarrat really does make the BEST paella I've ever had. Their Spanish tortilla reminds me of Barcelona. Great sangria.

5.0,8/29/2012,"Every so often my equally food loving friend and I crave paella, and for a year now we have been trying to find the most perfect Paella in NYC because nothing is more disappointing then spending a ton of money and getting the paella and realizing that it was cooked in a way that does not allow the perfectly crisped edges to form around the sides and bottom of the pan, which results in not enjoying the most perfect paella.  Our search ended here.  Socarrat serves the best paella hands down.  100% comparable to the best paella I had in Spain.  Aside from the perfect crispness around the sides, the dish was bursting with flavor, we had the seafood one, forgot the technical name, but the shrimp, scallops, clams, mussels and fish were cooked and seasoned perfectly and I loved the roasted sweet red peppers on top as well.  Dangerous good here.",1,0,0,Vanessa E.,"New York, NY",164,21,6

But given that I did live in Spain before, and I say this in the most obnoxious and pretentious way possible given that it was ages ago and I doubt I had a paella there but rather only recall a loaf of French bread my host family gave me and put a Hershey bar in for lunch, nevertheless this paella tasted excellent. If you get the paella for two, id really say its large enough for three.

I liked it better than the Soccarat Paella (their signature, i think) the seafood on top was so fresh and the rice was very flavorful. however, the rice turned rather salty after it cooled down. I would definitely order it again.Service-our waiter was not attentive nor friendly. When ordering, he kept pushing us to order the paella for 3 when we clearly stated we only wanted it for 2.  I had to say No to his face to finally shut him up.  During our meal, he came by to fill the water once and then he was gone.  He did not come by to scrap the bottom of the paella dish for the crusty bits of rice (hence the ""socarrat"").  Come on, that is the best part of the whole dish!!  He only came back to give us the bill.Honestly, socarrat's tapas was just okay to me, but they really do have the best paella.  My overall dining experience at Socarrat Nolita was much better.

I go back to Spain almost every year, so it's fair to say I LOVE tapas and have eaten probably too many in my lifetime. I would recommend:Starters:-Gazpacho. To die for. Do not share. Get your own, or else you will fight for it with your friends. They only serve this in the summer.-Garlic Shrimp. Delicious, hot, garlicky baby shrimp. Eat with bread. NOM.-Patatas Bravas. Just the right amount of spice and a reasonable portion.-Serrano y Manchego. Ham and Cheese. Can't go wrong. Good selections here.Paellas:1) Seafood. Fantastic if you love seafood. Everything tasted so fresh. Surprisingly light for Paella. 2) Black Rice. Rich and salty. This felt a bit heavy, but I love it for a treat now and then.Try the Fideos if you are feeling adventurous or lean towards pasta over rice.Know before you go:-You can try to snag a seat at the bar, but they go fast-They dont do white sangria by the glass, only red (Wahhh!) -You can only make a reservation for a table if you're going to order paella (-1 star)-Because of the above, it can be better to go with friends.

I lived in Spain for half a year so I know my tapas, and I haven't been able to find a legit tapas place in Los Angeles. Well, to my luck and sadness, I found a great one in New York! You must try the arroz negro (black rice) paella. The rice is black because of the squid ink, and the pieces of seafood on top are cooked to perfection. Seriously, this dish is legit! My company at dinner are locals and they have all said the best paella here is the arroz negro. GET IT! Also, if you like it spicy, and why wouldn't you, ask them for their homemade chili oil. OH MY GOODNESS. This hot sauce is amazing. It's not too crazy, but it totally gives your dish a kick. Sriracha, you got competition! Lastly, the paella is served with a side of garlic alioli. Can I just die now? As for tapas, please order the shishito peppers (I think these were a special that night). These were sooooo good, like chips and salsa -- you can't stop eating them! The patatas bravas here are mediocre. Once you try patatas bravas in Spain, nothing else compares.Side notes:-Service here is excellent!-Ambiance here is great for a date.

It was confusing however, that the server kept referring to the fideua as ""paella"", but whatever.My husband ordered a glass of sangria, which was OVERWHELMINGLY sweet. Sangria is supposed to be sweet, but not taste like high fructose corn syrup, which this did. I don't think he was able to finish his glass even after adding water to it.We ordered the seafood fideua, which looked very beautiful, but tasted just okay - not hing special. In fact, it was oversalted.We had chicken croquetas, gambons al ajillo, and some carpaccio.

The food, though, is excellent and it's the best place to get paella in NY. If you're coming with just another person then just get an appetizer to nibble on while you wait for your paella.

Plus, we didn't mind as we were a group of seven. However, given these circumstances, I do expect much better service, especially in New York. Since they only serve happy hour at the bar, we huddled up around the bar, although none of the tables were taken. I do understand their policy, but they could be a bit more flexible. We started with a glass of sangria which was good and tasty. We ordered a couple of small dishes which were OK, nothing to write home about. As the manager noticed that we were a bit uncomfortable, he eventually offered us a table, which we gladly accepted. We were about to order a second round of sangria, but we were told that we have to pay the full price. Is this why they moved us to a table? OK, we stuck to water. We finally shared a pan of paella which was burnt and bland, not exactly what I had expected for a place that bears paella in the name.

The constant stream of traffic to and from combined with the line up (there is only one toilet) made my date and I feel uncomfortable. The tapas were just so-so.

Service was slow, but otherwise okay.The second time, right after they seated us and we were getting ready to order, they suddenly decided to move us to a completely separate room. Without even an apology, the waiter rudely informed us that a large party was coming in and we needed to move. When we finally sat down, they had run out of several of the appetizers so we ended up just not ordering any. We got the Socorrat paella, which is supposed to be quite good. However, the rice was completely burnt on the bottom! We could smell a hint of the burning rice as the platter was handed to us and skeptically dug in. As we kept eating, we realized something was seriously wrong with the rice.We informed our waiter that our rice was burnt, and he tells us that this particular paella, the Socorrat, that been made with chicken broth, which causes it to burn the rice every time for a ""higher degree of socorrat.""  We probably would have believed him had we not had paella at other places before. Regardless of how seared the rice should be, it should not be burnt! If the waiter had not attempted to lie to us, I don't think I would be this angry, but because he did, I now understand just how terrible they treat the customers here.There are other places in town with paella that's just as good as this place but without the horrendous service and occasionally bad pan of paella.

3.0,4/25/2012,My husband and I decided to celebrate my promotion and reserved a table here for dinner. We made a reservation for 9:00 and got in a little early. We had to wait a while to get our table which is alright. We were then seated on a table which was occupied by another group when there were other empty tables around. There was hardly any place and I did not want a constrained celebration between a brick wall and strangers. They did eventually give us another table with rocking stools. The food itself was alright. There is a mandatory order of two plates of the same kind of Paella. My husband is a vegetarian and had just one option which I was not too keen on. I did not want to pass Paella in a Paella bar .That's like going to Paris and not visiting the Eiffel. Well you can see it from anywhere in the city and I could smell the fragrant rice all around me but I had to make do with that.The Tapas menu was alright. The spicy Chorizo was great. The house special for the day( Cant remember the name.. That reminds me the music is a little loud for conversation) was just a big lump of goat cheese on vegetables and I could not take in more than a bite. Pan Tomaca was alright too.I would give it only a 2 star but the third star in for our waiter Rafiel who was extremely nice and friendly.

My friend showed up on time, checked in, and was told that he has to wait for all parties to be there. No problem there.  I ended up showing up at 9:15.  We went up to get seated and were then told that there's a 15 minute hold policy, our table had been given up.  It was literally 9:15, no exaggeration.  That's a little militant, and maybe it would be a little understandable if *no one* had been there at all.  But my many years of eating at Manhattan restaurants, I have never had someone check in (even with an incomplete party) and THEN lose the table after 15 minutes.Anyway, we were then told that a table would come up in the next 10 minutes.  So we waited.  And waited.  Every 5-10 minutes we'd ask about our table, and we were told each time that someone was paying and about to leave.  After 50 minutes of this, they sat us at the bar and told us this was our table.  Are you kidding me?  We could have sat at the bar 50 minutes earlier if we wanted that!As far as food, keep in mind, there is a two-person minimum for the Paella.  So if you want Paella, you'd better hope one other person with you wants the exact dish you want.If not for the terrible service, complete with being lied to and strung along (and treated like an annoyance the entire time), I would probably have given three stars for the food.  One thing is for sure, I will never, ever go there again, and will never send anyone there.",1,0,0,Doug W.,"New York, NY",0,11,0

It isn't very comfortable. The seating arrangement. I felt a little crammed... but it does give that Spanish tavern feel. I guess that's what they were going for. Tapas. Alright. It was solid. But I wasn't wowed. I was told that we should order our tapas first since it comes out quicker and then our paella would be ready. It wasn't that much of a difference. Paella. Very interesting. There is a special way you are supposed to eat it. The waiter said wait a few moments but how long is a few moments? I just took a spoon to it after about 2 minutes only to find a few minutes later, our waiter returned and scrapped the top of the paella and told us to keep the bottom for the socarrat. I assumed it came fully ""burnt"" but I guess it wasn't. The flavor was good, the garlic aioli was good. The socarrat was good. It tasted better and better as we ate. It's unique, no doubt about that. But I think I still have to say... it didn't feel like a paella. One thing was that everything tasted rich. The wine was no longer an accompanying drink but a necessity. The bummer of the night? It's that our waiter was a little snobby. If he has spent the time to explain how we can fully appreciate our meal (it was pretty empty on a monday night around 6PM) I might have enjoyed it more.

Since I have moved to New York 4 years ago, I was checking out almost every Spanish restaurant that I would spot. I've been to more than 10, so far. But everywhere it was the same problem - made to look like Spanish but no authenticity. Having a weakness for paella, it's what I ordered in every Spanish restaurant I went. And everywhere I have faced the same problem - boiled yellow rice with spices and fillings and that's it. Probably just arroz the Mexican way and probably made by Mexicans as well. But that has nothing to do with a real paella. But Socarrat has it the way, it supposed to be prepared!Paella pan for two (nowhere in Spain I saw paella for one, usually it's 4+ servings), the way it supposed to be, prepared with LIQUID spices, boiled on top and with a crisp fried layer at the bottom!!! Mmm... It was such a reminder of Spain!!!Their tapas menu is really interesting too, though it could have been wider. They carry both Jamon Serrano and Jamon Iberico.

3.0,1/31/2012,"I think this place is cute and perhaps crammed but overall charming. The food though (that I've had so far) is decent but left something to be desired.The thing is that it's very expensive to eat here, and here's what our dinner was like for two:Had 2 bottles of white wine (yes two bottles that costed about $50 each) which tasted to me like a sweeter chardonnay but was good. I don't know if the price was justified but I'm not qualified enough as a wine taster to say. But I did wish I paid attention enough to agree to order two bottles haha!We had a tapa which was called a ""squiggly pig"" or something like that. I don't know exactly what was given to me but it tasted an awful lot like pigs feet. Maybe it would have been good to some people who like to eat those but to me I just hated it. I'm going to take that out of the judgement of this place though because I think that it was personal taste and I can't say for sure if they made it well or not because pigs feet can't be appetizing to me even if you laced it in gold while smothering it in cheese. It was very tender and salty but I can't get over that super soft cartilage texture. ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwThe main course was the Paella. We had a seafood paella with shrimp, scallops, calamari, white fish and the rice was cooked in squid ink. It was decent but I thought it would be more flavorful. Even the scallops lacked flavor which is strange because they have a decent amount of flavor in them as is. But they kind of skimped on them. They basically used less scallops by slicing them in thinner coins and serving as if they looked like full scallops. I wouldn't be surprised if the dish had only 2 full scallops that were sliced in many coins. The calamari was average and rubbery. The shrimp was good but it's hard to screw up shrimp. They're so naturally sweet and briny that they out-shined the rest of the dish. The rice...although intimidating and black due to the ink had a peculiar flavor...good but not as flavorful as I'd expect. In the menu the dish was priced at $23. I thought we were sharing a dish but in actuality they double charge you when they serve a paella for 2. So it was really a $46 paella. I guess it makes sense since it was a decent amount of food...but I have to wonder what they would have given me if I was by myself.The whole bill was $154 haha.

We indicated an open table we'd be happy to sit at, and a hostess snapped that we cannot have it as we indicated we did not want it earlier. We had done no such thing. I forwarded my confirmation emails to the hostess who promised to investigate it and respond.

She claims that the paella here is even better than the ones she had in Barcelona!When we arrived on a Thursday night, the wait was about 20 minutes with reservations. The place was chattery, but not in the inconveniently loud kind of way. We shared a counter table with other patrons and it felt like having dinner with a Spanish family - the conversation could flow as long as the food stayed warm and the wine glasses kept refilling.Anyway, we ordered the croquettes, the stuffed dates and a meat paella. Oh my dear god, the stuffed dates. Everything we ordered was perfectly superb, but the stuffed dates have remained engraved in my memory forever. The dates were stuffed in cheese and wrapped in bacon. Oh my, excuse me! I'm drooling at the thought.

We went with tapas, as the recent paella reviews on Yelp were mixed with frequent complaints of saltiness. Nothing was terrible, but sometimes mediocrity can be even more disappointing. The dishes I tried included the artichokes, patatas bravas, garlic shrimp, pork belly, some type of grilled bread topped with grilled red peppers and eggplant. After reading good reviews for the gambas (shrimp) on Yelp, I was very disappointed with what I actually got: these were not the usual fresh large shrimp with delicious garlicky olive oil that I expect from Spanish gambas. These were the flavorless shrimp that come in frozen bags by the dozen - the opposite of fresh and delicious - and they were to salty. The quality of shrimp makes this dish, and quality of the starting ingredient was definitely lacking here. The only dishes that were worth finishing were the patatas bravas  and one of pork belly with a date puree.

2.0,11/10/2011,"Seriously what is all the hype about? After wanting to try this place out within the past few months, I was truly disappointed.  Rude, obnoxious, snotty management/staff, and overly burnt, salty paella.  That sums it up.  I honestly should have seen the signs when I tried to go last week but they denied us because all of us weren't present for our reservation, even though we said we'd start ordering all the food asap.This is one of the worst paella I've ever had, and they call themselves a paella bar? Granted, I've had excellent top-notch paella in Spain and nowhere else in the U.S. will come close to it, but I had already lowered my expectations and they didn't even fulfill a 1/10 of it when it came to the paella.  The paella was barely edible - and yes I understand that socarrat means the burnt part of the rice but that doesn't mean inedible, nor does it mean super salty nor should it ever have a fishy taste (i.e. seafood not fresh)!  We barely touched the paella - literally four bites among our group.  Tapas were definitely better, though I wouldn't say they are stellar.  Again, too much salt.  Nothing really stood out, though the grilled squid was the only decent and fresh item on the menu.As one can tell by reading the previous reviews, management and staff need to learn and listen to the clues here.  Our waitress was the only nice one.  What really irked me is what the manager said and how he belittled my friend.  They need to lose the attitude and learn not to make snotty remarks about the customers - we're not even in the meatpacking district or in an upscale, pretentious neighborhood.You can do so much better - there are plenty of tapas/paella restaurants in the Chelsea area.",9,1,0,Caroline C.,"Brooklyn, NY",381,311,298

2.0,11/9/2011,"Short Story --You have to sit in uncomfortable wobbly stools next to strangers. And I'm not talking in the way you would sit next to people at a hibachi restaurant... I'm talking.. they are right on top of you wobbling around next to you.The management needs to lose the attitude. The paella is burned, overpriced, their pricing structure on the menu is NOT laid out well. Seafood in the paella was not fresh to say the least. Staff is unprofessional. Tapas are good. Won't be back.Long Story--We made a 3 person reservation and while waiting for our 3rd person to arrive, we ordered some wine. We asked the bartender about the paella wine pairings, as there was a nifty little chart to follow on the menu. She tells us to completely ignore the chart and menu recommendations, because the person that did it knows nothing about Spanish wine. Great... that's weird. We take her recommendation and order a Rose Cava- it was good. Our 3rd person arrives, we pay for our drinks and sit at a 6-person table. The manager aggressively seats us and shows us these racks under the table to hang our coats... odd and uncomfortable. All of our stools are wobbly and swaying back and forth no matter how many times we traded with empties around us, and they sat 3 other people beside us that were allover the place undecided about whether they were coming or going, sitting or leaving... extremely distracting. You could tell they were upset about the seating arrangements, as we weren't stoked either. Our waitress advises we order paella sooner than later, because it takes 30 minutes. So we picked the Socarrat paella, she tells us it serves 2, we see the price is $22. OK, we ordered it, among some other tapas.The tapas were delicious, we got the patatas bravas, chorizo, shrimp, calamari, and a special. All were awesome (and the only reason this isn't a 1 star review).Our paella arrives... the best way I can describe it is a thin layer of burned rice-a-roni with random not so fresh seafood and chicken bits on top. We took a couple of bites.. and right away I tasted an overwhelming fishy taste... I am an avid fish and seafood eater... I know what I'm talking about. Fish is not supposed to taste that fishy at all... it can only mean one thing--- it isn't fresh. The taste completely overwhelmed the sticky, burned rice that is now stuck in your bi-cuspids. My friend literally couldn't talk until she forced it out of her tooth. The waitress came by to ""scrape"" the bottom for us which is their little method they do... It was all I could do to not laugh. My Puerto Rican mother would have been cringing at the sight of such over done rice. While I have never been to Spain, I have had my fair share of Spanish food and paella and have never seen it like this... where was the sauce? I'm still looking for it. It couldn't have been any drier. My friend happened to have recently gone to Spain and had also never seen paella done this way before. We could not eat another bite.By this point, we're thinking fine... at least the tapas were good... Check please. The check arrives... the paella is $44, they charged us $22 a head. This was not clear on the menu in the fine print in the crease of the page where it said something about how it serves two for $22. Our waitress also said it comes serving 2. It needs to be more apparent that it's $22 a person and it's 2 person minimum which is outrageous. We are not the complaining or confrontational type, but after a gross paella and not understanding how we were being charge, we had to speak up. The waitress politely grabbed her manager. The manager comes over with the menu to show us where it says it should be $22 a person. We all agreed that we didn't interpret it that way at all, nor was it explained to us in this way. With an attitude and raise in volume, he says ""Oh, so you just don't understand directions?""... and I replied... ""NO ... I guess I don't understand directions."" He said ""fine I'll comp you"". At this juncture, we're still being optimistic, at least they comped us for the misunderstanding despite the attitude. Only for us to after paying overhear a waiter talking shit about us to our own waitress, criticizing us for only tipping 15%, and asking if we even took our leftover paella with us. Upon making the connection that this unprofessional jerk is literally talking about us while we're still right behind him... I look at him and he clearly acts uncomfortable because he was caught and says to us ""Enjoy!"" with a frantic smile. He then proceeds to stare us down as we wait for one of our checked coats.Save yourself the money and aggravation - make some Goya yellow rice at home.

After a 5 month absence I had dinner there this past week with 3 friends.Unfortunately, I was unaware of the new policy that they now accept reservations. In the past we would always wait. We didn't have a reservation this evening ,but we did meet early at 6:30 to avoid the peak Thursday evening dinner crowd.My guests were waiting at the bar having wine just prior to my arrival 6:30 We were informed by the somewhat unenthusiastic  hostess that since we didn't have a reservation she would ""see"" what she could do in the now 1/3 filled restaurant. I was told due to the reservations we couldn't be seated in the main communal paella table but she could seat us in the adjacent wine bar in the back on a table for 6 that we could have 4 of the seats with the stipulation they they had the table back by 8pm.6:45 ,a leisurely dinner with good friends in a 1 and 15 minutes( ,it gives me that extra 60 minutes that McDonald's wouldn't or would they?). I begrudgingly accepted- might I add I was reprimanded for stepping away while they were trying to seat us by he hostess.Now to the opposite side of the spectrum our very effervescent and enthusiastic  waitress was a excellent salesperson and model for the restaurant. Paella and tapas excellent as always, though I was very aware there was a clock ticking over my table and I felt rushed, and a busboy very eager to remove my plates and inquire if I was done yet.Now after much wine deliberation discussed at our table and as per the waitress suggestions a decision was made. I never indicated that I am not a novice in wines and do have some schooling in the grapes and appellations of the world-I did appreciated her eager approach to describe the listed vintages. Unfortunately, the chosen wine was out of stock but a sufficient substitute made in its place.As our evening concluded 5 past the hour I knew our patronage was no longer wanted. Through a forced but gracious smile by the lovely waitress I was informed that the next guests were already there.Here lies my issue, I can almost forgive all of the above but after requesting my check , I noticed a exorbitant total- almost $500 for 2 paellas,tapas and 2 bottles of wine!...maybe I should have asked the price of the wines prior. After reviewing the bill more carefully, it was clearly not our bill-luckily this time I didn't as i do so often  just hand the card off for processing. A honest mistake on a busy night,maybe- apology accepted. The new bill arrives still more expensive than what it should be only to find out I was charged for 3 bottles of wine ,the one not in stock plus the 2 others-after the explanation how the manager should have voided this prior to my getting the bill they took a tapas off in good faith for the misunderstanding .( I felt so much better now for a $350 tab and much frustration in 1 1/2 hours). Socarrat's paella maybe be good but gracious dining and customer relations need some work.With new Spanish restaurants like SILNAS opening to very favorable reviews in the neighborhood I'm sure they would welcome a patron like myself for a enjoyable dining experience without all the agita.Philip M",1,0,0,Philip M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0
1.0,10/26/2011,"Who do these people think they are???  As a party of two, you cannot sit at a table if you're planning to order $80 worth of wine and $15 worth of tapas.  You can only sit at a table if you are ordering paella.  AND, if you are ordering paella (whether at the bar or at a table), you must order TWO servings of paella.  Otherwise, no paella.  And, if you are cold when sitting at the bar in 53-degree weather, they will only close the door if asked, because the girl by the door doing nothing is feeling warm.  BTW, as you are ordering your $80 worth of wine, don't expect too many free tastes as you decide which of the obscure, mostly blah wines you should pay $13 for.  Oh, and what is up with the cheese plate change?  Before, you could sample 3 or 5 cheeses.  Now, you must pay $7 for each individual cheese.  If you want to try more than one, that's $14 for two.  Please.  This snotty system is only going to last a few months, especially with two fine tapas places within two blocks.",1,1,1,Kate H.,"Manhattan, NY",7,17,0

That's because i review the legit shit. son.My brother who is now a local NYCer,  recommended me to this place.I don't care if you take the Ltrain, walk it out, or even cab. Just try it. Here is the scope. I am not local to NYC. so when i saw boutique stores around this area I obviously got side tracked and ventured in. Sure sell Y3 or McQueen stuff on this street. My spider senses went off immediately. Yes It was in the gay part of town.Now with that said. It was one of the cleanest part of NY. Everything looks clean and neat. all the building looked new and maintained. And the people here was young and fit and trendy. And of course the hidden Gem. Socarrat.Typical cramp trendy tapas bar. One room was the bar, and the other connecting room was the main dining room. The main dining room consist of a long ass community table, with high stools.One thing I realize with Paella was that the more colorful it is, the better you feel and taste ( zero pun intended). This is the first time something visually influence my option. I'm not sure if you will understand this, but once you try the different types. you will feel much better with the Paella with the carrots and the peas, even if you effing hate carrots and peas. Like drake said this is the Best Paella I've ever had. I never been to Spain, but i would imagine it to be just like this.  To conclude I eat paella every time i see it on a menu far or near Spanish or mexican, those were all trash compare to this.However this was not cheap about 45 per person for some lovely Spanish fried rice.

5.0,10/10/2011,"Came here for dinner this weekend with my girlfriend. This has the feel of one of the cramped tapas bars I went to in Barcelona - narrow storefront, long area to walk back into, and fairly cramped seating. I didn't mind; it added more authenticity to the experience. Service was very good; we were right next to the window where all the food came out, so we got our stuff pretty quickly.The food itself was delicious. Although it's a paella bar, I probably was an even bigger fan of the tapas we had here. We tried the two specials of the day (roasted suckling pig and the razor clams), along with the tortilla. All were fabulous; this is the first time I've had razor clams here (experienced them for the first time in Spain), and they were probably done even better at Soccarat - more seasoning = more flavor. The suckling pig was basically like really, really tender pulled pork but without being slathered with BBQ sauce...so good. The tortilla was amazing; it's served with some kind of cheese-based dipping sauce (I think?) that really adds a highlight of flavor to the potato dish. We got the namesake paella for the main course, which was very well-prepared. I think the rice is a bit more flavored here than it was over in Spain, but my only complaint is that one of the meat/seafood additions (namely the beef) had no seasoning whatsoever...even the steak cubes at Chipotle had more flavor. Everything else was fantastic, though.Definitely want to come back sometime to try fideau in the paella, which was amazing at Con Majo in Barcelona.

4.0,8/12/2011,"Generally speaking, I have a love/hate relationship with communal tables. Sure, it creates a charming atmosphere. You're supposed to feel part of something bigger, perhaps part of a family... this may be true somewhere in Spain where people are genuinely nice. In New York City, 50% of the people will hate the communal table depending on the food, service and how much you had to drink. Why? You feel obligated to be on your semi-good behavior since you're sitting elbow to elbow with a stranger. This includes thinking twice about putting the flash on your camera. However, we kind of lucked out since there were 3 of us so we got the end corner (versus being super lucky: getting our own table in either room). Our waitress was very attentive but her thick accent made it a little hard to understand. She told us to pick out our paella dish first because it takes about 30 minutes for it to cook. We ordered the black rice paella for two, along with pan tomaca, tocino, and garlic shrimps. black rice paella - OMG paella. Plenty of seafood, squid ink, and socarrat. Sadly, the food gets cold rather quick but it still tastes incredible. The garlic mayonnaise makes it creamier. Sounds odd eh?pan tomaca - charred toast with chilled savory tomato sauce. naytocino - two pieces of almost-melt-in-your-mouth (75%) fatty pork belly matched with sweet date puree and slices of apple. I can do without the roasted potato. yay garlic shrimps - 8 pieces medium sized shrimp. Nothing really extraordinary besides the sauce.After 2 hours of gossiping, the manager(?) came over to tell us we had to wrap up our dinner for other patrons. It's understandable; especially seeing a line of people waiting to be seated but also couldn't help feel pretty disappointed since we didn't even have a chance to order our desserts.Socarrat is a great place to catch up with a couple of friends or to go on a romantic filled with lots of wine.

Since I became a vegetarian for about a year (I guess we still have stages at age 27), none of my friends wanted to go to Socarrat and share paella with me. They wanted meat in their paella and I didn't do a good enough job in convincing them that all seafood was better and healthier.  When I gave up on being a vegetarian I decided to go with my fiance. Neither of us had had paella before and so ordered the standard dish. Now I'm typically not a rice eater and I also don't like my foods touching or mixed together on my plate.

4.0,7/17/2011,"Went here for tapas and was not disappointed.  Everything was delicious and spicy.  The potatoes were great, as were the chorizos and garlic shrimp.  The best thing about the shrimp is that they were spicy but not overly garlicky or greasy like some shrimp can be.  Had a few specials including a roast suckling pig with amazing crispy skin.  Grilled zucchiniwas outstanding but the octopus was merely good.  Service was top notch from start to finish...friendly and efficient.  I would imagine that if the place is crowded, the communal tables for six would get very crowded with elbows and plates.  The paella looked great, but will have to go back for this.Went on a Sunday night so it was crowded but not packed.  For the most part, this would make a great place for a date.",1,0,0,Bill T.,"New York, NY",1361,2290,9300

5.0,7/14/2011,"very very good paellaour korean waitress was extremely knowledgable in spanish cuisine and she had some excellent recommendations.we got the squid ink seafood paella (2 person portion) and shared among three people. there is more than plenty, so you do not need to order per person. we also got four tapas:- vegetarian tapas of the day of grilled zucchini with goat cheese and tomato. DELICIOUS.- patatas bravas. perfectly crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. warning, this is pretty spicy- a meatball tapas special with cuttlefish. nicely spiced with crunchy edamame beans on the side- a beet and goat cheese tapas. the beets were perfectly cooked and were soft. good balance with the goatcheese-y aioli (or whatever it was)also a pitcher of white sangria (DELICIOUS!). good balance of fruit with the white.the service was great and the food came out in a quick succession, i can't wait to go back :)",2,1,1,Sylvia B.,"Manhattan, NY",161,315,831
4.0,7/14/2011,"Chelsea's little secret which opened a couple of years ago has been a sensation due to its almost like authentic Paella. A little piece of Spain for everyone or should I say, a little piece of heaven.  Similar to what you would find in Spain and keeping to it's literary meaning, Socarrat is the charred, almost burned leftover rice stuck on the bottom of the pan.  This happens during the cooking process. The result is a flavor so concentrated in the grains of rice, it will have you begging for more.Some great varieties are: The Socarrat, loaded with chicken, beef, sepia, shrimp, cuttle fish, mussels, cockle clams and green beans; The Black Rice, chunks of fish, shrimp, calamari and scallops.  No matter which one you go with, you won't be disappointed.  In addition to the many varieties of Paella and great Sangria, they have an amazing assortment of appetizers as well, from the spicy chorizo to the Gambas Ajillo (garlic shrimp).You will find the art of communal eating is practiced at this bar.  You have a long communal table, where people are tightly seated next to one another and where you quickly make friends. The wine list is fairly priced and equally good.It makes a great first date place or just hanging with friends.  Energized with a younger crowd you will feel alive as soon as you enter.The wait service is a hit or miss.  They can be really friendly or just not cool.  I understand the place gets busy, but good people skills are essential in any service industry.  They could do a better job in screening there future staff.  However, this would not stop me from revisiting over and over.  I really enjoy the food.",1,0,0,Paul T.,"Staten Island, NY",79,58,3
2.0,7/13/2011,"I came here for brunch a few weeks back. From the outside, the place is very unassuming. I think the time of day contributed to this, but I barely knew the place existed. When I realized it was there, I didn't even think that it was open.First off, I'm a bit picky when it comes to enjoying a solid brunch. I'm a big fan of open air space for brunch, places where you get a lot of sunlight, can possibly sit outside, or inside with windows. There should be this feeling of relaxation that hits you when you sit down. Sure, a place may be busy, but you should still love being there and feel relaxed by the overall brunch experience. After all, you have no where to go. Just hours to laze about at brunch. I love brunch... This place, is not for brunch. Don't do it. It has none of the above. Not even the seats are comfortable. The table is a bit awkward (being that it is one long table that extends the length of the dining area. And most importantly, the menu really just doesn't scream brunch. Especially for the place being in Chelsea. There are a million other places to go to for brunch on every corner around here. Mind you, I'm not saying that the place is bad. Just don't do brunch here.

4.0,7/12/2011,"""socarrat-noun, 1. seductive caramelization of the bottom layer of a perfect paella when the liquid is absorbed and the rice is done. 2. Paella Bar. 259 W 19th Street. New York, NY 10011.""That was from the postcard the restaurant leaves you at the end of the meal.I found out about Socarrat from Refinery29s ""29 Dishes, 29 Restaurants: What to Order in NYC."" When I saw the picture of that meat paella, I knew I had to eat there. It was even more exciting to find out that they had a location in the neighborhood I was staying at, Chelsea! I've never been to Spain before so I can't claim to be a paella expert. I think that's part of the reason why paella intrigues me. It's a dish I could never make on my own and Spain is not in my near future so I get excited whenever I see it on a menu. I like to pretend I'm in Spain whilst I eat it. I will say that the best paella I've ever had was at Chaya Venice in Los Angeles (if you ever get the chance, you must go and eat it).We started the meal with sizzling garlic shrimp and fried artichokes. The garlic oil in the shrimp dish was so flavorful and we all couldn't help dipping our bread in it. The shrimps were a little overcooked. The fried artichoke was lovely and the breading wasn't too heavy.We also had scallops with mushrooms and those were delicious! The scallops were cooked perfectly and the sauteed maitake mushrooms tasted so good in the butter vinaigrette. I would definitely order those scallops again.My friend Emily's sister was allergic to fish, which limited our paella choices quite a bit. I kind of feel like paella isn't quite the same if it doesn't have seafood in it so we ended up ordering 2! We ordered the meat paella with pork, duck, chicken, chorizo and peas AND the Socarrat paella with chicken,beef, sepia, shrimp, cuttle fish, mussels, clams and green beans.These things were huge. One paella can feed 4 people for sure. We had a lot of leftovers afterward. Our waitress explained to us that we should only mix the top layer so that we can have bottom crunchy layer aka socarrat.The meat paella had a smoky flavor but I actually preferred the Socarrat paella. It seemed lighter and the flavor was more complex. While the fish was cooked well, my only complaint was that the shrimp didn't seem to be fresh. I tried a few but they were mushy. Something was definitely off.Overall, we had a really great dinner at Socarrat. It was a casual place and all booth seating. Be prepared to share tables. Service was friendly and they constantly refilled our waters/checked in on us. Our waitress' accent was so strong/authentic that we had to ask her to repeat things quite a few times.Solid food and great atmosphere, but the best paella is still at Chaya Venice. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again the next time I'm in NYC, but I'm happy that I got to eat a dish off of Refinery29s list.For pictures of our food, check out my blog: rbjello.wordpress.com/20…",0,0,0,Jackie T.,"Paris, France",40,94,38

2.0,6/29/2011,"Say you own a paella bar. If your made-to-order flagship menu item is occasionally ill-timed - as paella is wont to be - and arrives cold, burnt, soggy or late, you might have the foresight not to seat patrons within earshot of one another. Our paella happened to be perfect - perfectly peppered with squids, shrimps, whitefish and veggies; perfectly insulated with socarrat, perfectly seasoned. Our neighbors' paella - for Socarrat is largely made up of a single buffet-style table - happened to suffer standard misfortunes, and was served in an unpalatable state of overcooked, underheated disarray. That's terrible - but that every other patron in the restaurant was privy to their 1. discovery and 2. vociferous argument with the hostess, waiter, and ultimately manager colored, negatively, just about every dining experience during the 8:30 - 10PM time slot.Now. Say you're a hostess at a popular restaurant. If your made-to-order flagship menu item is occasionally ill-timed - as paella is wont to be, and your patrons are drinking from your extensive wine menu at a leisurely, Spanish pace, you might have the foresight NOT to promise parties a table ""in 30-40 minutes"". Our wait time was in the 80-90 minute ballpark. That's okay - we were hungry for paella, and stomached the wait. But overpromising and underdelivering leaves a very sour taste in everyone's mouth - and I'm sure there's nothing a hostess hates more than hearing that she told us ""40 minutes 60 minutes ago"". Actually, I know - this one rolled her eyes and walked away when we inquired about the state of our table, and our pre-ordered paella. Twice. So, I'm torn. Great food (well, for us anyway), but several operational issues that, as a whole, dropped the experience into poor-to-middling territory.",10,9,9,Liz C.,"Brooklyn, NY",643,600,3

5.0,6/24/2011,"""Socarrat"" refers to the crispy, blackened rice at the bottom of the paella pot. I am NOT a fan of the bottom-of-the-pot rice (see bibimbap and rice made in rice cookers), but I gave my paella's socarrat a chance since it's the restaurant's namesake. I'm glad I did. The socarrat was super flavorful. It was delicious, especially considering I always, always leave any crispy rice at the bottom of my bowl.The rest of the paella was good too. As many Yelpers have said, order your paella first, since it will take a half hour to make. We had the seafood paella (pescados y mariscos, I believe), and the seafood was abundant (but not TOO much) and yummy. I think it is a perfect portion of paella, but that's just me. As much as I love food, I hate having so much paella left over that I'm paella-ed out for the next two days.We shared a pitcher of red sangria. Sangria was typical sangria - not good, not bad, and again, a perfect portion. There wasn't an insane amount of fruit, which meant more sangria!It looks like I'm going through my meal in reverse chronological order, so before the sangria, we had the calamari. Nothing too special, but it was tender and fresh. We also had one of the tapas specials of the day - lamb chops with purple potatoes (yeah, I wasn't paying attention to what they were actually called). Lamb was tender and juicy, and potatoes, despite being purple, tasted like your regular potatoes. Yum to both appetizers.Jasmine, our server, was amazing. She may look Korean on the outside, but don't let that fool you; she speaks perfect Spanish (as far as I could tell) with a great Spanish accent. She was super helpful, made sure our sangria glasses were never empty, and even did the honors scraping the socarrat from the bottom of the paella pot. I don't remember the last time I was that impressed by a restaurant server - so kudos to you, Jasmine :)The ambience was pleasant. It wasn't too loud; then again, it wasn't too crowded, since we decided to have an early dinner at 5:45. The only really minor complaint: the table could have been a little bigger to accommodate the giant thing of paella between us. No biggie, we made it work. I was a huge fan of the hooks right under the table so I didn't have to toss my bag on the floor.Of course, I checked out the bathroom. Small, but clean, and smelled nice because of the scented candle in there. And there were paper towels, +1 bathroom point.Overall, I was a huge fan. A bit pricey, but it was totally worth it. Plus, I was treated to dinner anyway :) I will be back the next time I need a paella fix!",0,0,1,Amanda L.,"Denver, CO",127,296,0
1.0,6/21/2011,"Don't go. Just don't.I was really craving for paella one evening and looked up reviews. Yelp and many other sites recommended this place. I did see a few bad reviews but thought what the hack, why not. Called at 8:30pm, they said they don't have any spots available till 9:45. Sure I waited because I was desperate for paella! Showed up 9:40 and they said the table will be ready soon. Waited 15 mins in the extremely narrow hallway (bar) and nothing was happening. My bf and I wanted to get some wine, so we finally got a bottle after asking the staff for 5 times (hella expensive, drink elsewhere before if you much go to this place). Still standing... 1.5 glass down in the hallway... finally seated at 10:30 (are you kidding? I rsvp for 9:45). We sat down at this communal table in the back (the other room). Space was tight and uncomfortable - I felt like I would knock someone off the table. Very loud - I heard all the dirty laundry next to me. FOOD:""Socarrat"" refers to the crust of burnt rice so I somewhat had a bit of mental preparation. But not at this place. The paella we order was 60% over cooked and burnt at the bottom so you have to use extra efforts to get them off the pan. There were maybe 5 shrimps and 10 finely chopped squid as topping. Really?! They charged us $40+ for this plate so these 15 pieces of seafood better be gold. The chorizo was salty and I think I would grill hot dogs better than that.FYI, the kitchen closes at 11pm so you should definitely pre-order if you don't know when you would be seated.",0,0,0,Ellen S.,"CANAL STREET, NY",0,4,0

2.0,6/19/2011,"Food 3 stars/Service 1 starWell I was looking for a place to go on a Sunday night in the area.  A friend recommended Socarrat.  It started out quite nice.  We didn't have a reservation and the people at the front were friendly and said there'd be a short wait for the table but we could sit at the bar and pre-order our paella since it takes a while to make.  We sat down, ordered a drink, maybe 10 minutes passed and we got a nice tall round table right in the open window. Sort of eating outside but not.  Very pleasant and quite, as I was with my parents and they don't really care for noisy restaurants.  We ordred a few starters, the tomato bread, cheese and some olives.  They were all really good.  And good thing we ordered them since the paella ended up taking about an hour from when we ordered it to when it hit the table.  So it arrives.  We got the paella negro.  It was a seafood paella made with squid ink so the rice was blackish color.  It looked amazing.  We had to ask a server for new plates as ours had olive pits on them.  He gave them to us, but seemed a little put off.  The paella itself was the right consistency, had that crispy part on the bottom which is always a good sign.  But it was a bit dry.  And actually somewhat bland.  It seemed like it needed some spices, or dare I say, salt.   Just kind of eh?  We definitely couldn't finish it all, and my parents took it home.  It remains to be seen if the leftovers are good. I'd probably give this place another try for food.  However, I was VERY put off by the service.  The people at the front were nice.  And the bartender was also very nice.  But I'm not even sure we HAD a server!  We ordered our tapas from a girl we never saw again.  I had to tell the hostess we were finished eating after we sat clearly done for about 10 minutes.  She took the paella away and some other guy came and dropped off the to-go bag but didn't bother to clear any of the plates.  We had actually wanted to see a dessert menu but no one gave us one or came by at all.  I actually ended up stacking the plates.  I asked the hostess for a check which she promptly gave to us.  Someone then finally came to take the dirty plates away.  Being someone who works in a restaurant myself, all of this was totally unacceptable for me.  Needless to say I did not tip 20% (though again, as a server I didn't have it in me to tip THAT bad).",0,0,0,Rebecca K.,"New York, NY",52,108,0

The chorizo croquettes, which was a special for the night and the braised pork belly with the date puree were both good as well.With so many choices for the paella, we had to turn to our waitress for help - a friendly Basque woman who was helpful throughout.  She suggested the negro and the carne. The paella rice was unique in the sense that it's more chewy but not hard so it's good and both the negro and the carne were excellent suggestions.

4.0,5/24/2011,"""Your Spanish is quite impressive"" says the waiter as I order the dishes eloquently and with the appropriate accents, in espanol of course. Granted I have some street credit, coming from Miami and all.  When I do break away from my usual Asian foods, my second guilty pleasure is Spanish food, in particular, those from Spain. Thus, I think my reviews will prove to be useful and insightful, even if coming from an Asian guy.  Repping' the 305 baby.If going with a group, recommended max  should be 6 people to comfortably sit in a table without feeling too cramped.  The ambiance is darkly lit, crowded, but never was my group fighting for attention to speak. The decor was beautiful with Spanish currency on top of ceilings with reflective counter tops.The ambiance sets the tone on the food to expect: beautiful, well executed and full of flavor.Some dishes stood out more than the others, but here goes:1) Tortilla: One of the better potato and onion omlette I've tasted. Many of the ones I've were either too much of one or the other. Socarrat's version was excellently executed.2) Calamar a la Plancha: grilled squid with garlic and parsley.  This dish was so simple yet delicious. No need to mask the freshness of the seafood with sauces.3) Tocino: braised pork belly with potatos and dates puree:  My FAVORITE dish! The braised pork belly was soft and succulent and the saltiness complimented the sweet dates puree. Totally awesome.4) Cazuelita de Chorizos: My second favorite dish! You can't ever go wrong with spicy sausage!  5) Croquettas del dia: This dish was A-OK. It had potato inside but nothing special.  This is one dish that's passable.Obviously, at a Paella bar you gotta try their paella. We got 2:  paella socarrat and the paella de carne.  The paella socarrat had chunks of chicken, fish & beef, shrimp, cuttle fish, green beans, mussels, cockle clams.  Sounds like a handful and it definitely was!  The chunks of chicken was juicy and moist but the seafood stole the show. Naturally sweet with flavor, the mussels, shrimp, cuttle fish, and clams were cooked to perfection; never dry and always juicy.    The paella de carne didn't really come with that many meat and was NOT memorable.  (you're better off with other paellas).The rice alone though left something more to desire.  It was good but not the best I've tasted.  Maybe my expectations were set high because the tapas were alreadydone well and the name of the restaurant had the name PAELLA plastered on it.  The rice itself was a bit dry (I like my paella a bit soggy).  The burnt part (conveniently named Soccarat) was a bit hard to chew too. I think my jaw started hurting from over-chewing.   But, with the rice complimented with the seafood/meats (cooked juicy and well), it enhanced the experience.Overall, tapas were excellent. Paella was good but could be better. Decor,  Ambiance, and Sangria were winners. Ole Ole!",5,2,3,Wing L.,"Long Island, NY",201,245,78

It was absolutely divine. First, the aroma is saliva inducing and it's almost unbearable to wait the few minutes before you can eat it. Each paella serves two (or more) and this one came with a generous amount of fresh seafood, each of which was cooked to perfection in both taste and texture. The squid ink made the rice so very tasty and the garlic aioli mixed in also enhanced the aroma and flavor. I had mixed feelings of wanting to eat it as fast as possible because I just couldn't get enough of the delicious flavor and also wanting to slow down lest it run out too fast!

We got a nicely situated table by the front of the restaurant and settled in with a pitcher of red wine sangria. We started off with a few tapas:- Sizzling shrimp with garlic and hot peppers: came in a stone bowl piping hot with 7-8 shrimps. Delicious!- Fried artichokes: good portion, felt like it needed some kind of dip so I used the spicy sauce from the shrimp- Suckling pig, the ""special"" of the day (in reality they serve this every weekend): tender, succulent pork... could've ate another order of this. Glad we went with this instead of the pork bellyFor paella, we ordered two (one order is for two people, charges each person individually ~$25):- Arroz Negro: black rice with an array of seafood, including beautiful white scallops- Paella de Carne: to satisfy my meat cravings of course! Came with brown rice with pork, chicken, duck, chorizo, snap peas and mushroom soffrito. The chorizo and crunchy vegetables were the highlight -- I felt the big chunks of chicken and duck were a little blandThe socarrat concept was relatively new to me but I love the crunchy rice at the bottom of Korean stone bowls. So as the Spanish equivalent, I quickly caught on and went specifically for the crunchy rice at the bottom of the pan! So good. The crunchiness even holds when microwaved the next day as leftovers.Overall, loved everything about my experience.

Consistently, we had equally indifferent, lack of service from our waiter, as we did the hostess.I can think of some other places that might have the ""best ever"" paella.  In NYC and that other place....oh..let me think, Spain?  And actually with a direct flight from NYC only taking about 8 hours, I think that is about the same amount of time it takes to wait for a seat in this restaurant.  And yes, I know I am a moron for going to Chelsea on the weekend.  But did I have to pay this high of a price????PROS:  If you want to hang out with the B&T crowd on the weekend, this is the place to go.CONS:  Everything else.Feel free to email me if you want to discuss further how amazingly awful this place is.",1,2,0,Brion R.,"New York, NY",344,242,10

2.0,4/20/2011,"Service: Just plain annoying. After waiting 30 min for a table WITH a reservation, my party of three was awkwardly seated at the bar. Is it not some cardinal rule of proper restaurant seating to limit side-by-side bar seating to parties of two? If not, it should be. We dealt with it, though, only because the hostess notified us that we would be pushed to the end of the waitlist and have to wait another 40 min. Lame. Ambience: The seating arrangement is comprised of long, bar height communal tables and a smattering of 3-4 person bar tables. It's neither the most comfortable nor efficient way to organize a restaurant, and only added to my annoyance. Tapas: - Patatas bravas - nice, crispy homefries with a good kick to them, but nothing to write home about. - Asparagus with goat cheese crostini - the asparagus was extremely overcooked and limp, and the goat cheese was barely discernible and lack any creaminess. definitely made poor choices in the tapas dept.Paella: The only redeeming part of this meal/experience. We actually ordered the Fideua made of crispy noodles, seafood, and their namesake soccarat - the caremelized crispy crust of the rice/noodles of each dish. It was savory, satisfying, and a 2 person order can easily fill up 3 people. I hear the paellas are even better.Sangria: Good, but deficient in the fresh fruit department, which I appreciate.The fact that I had a scoutmob deal cheered up the situation, but I doubt I'd come back (to this chelsea location, at least) as better tapas restaurants abound in this city.",0,0,0,Heidi J.,"New York, NY",314,79,8

3.0,4/15/2011,"My grandparents are from Spain, my Dad lives in Spain, I have lived in Spain and I travel to Spain multiple times a year, so suffice it to say that I consider myself a connoisseur of paella. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed by Socarrat. I originally had high hopes, since all the waiters were from Spain and the menu looked very authentic-- but alas the paella was nothing more than eh. The flavor of the rice was ok, but it lacked that deep seafood flavor that marks a good. authentic Valencian paella. The real kiss of death for me though was that the seafood on the paella appeared to have been placed on top AFTER the rice was cooked, as it did not have that golden brown look that demonstrates that it was cooked WITH the paella, so the seafood itself was largely flavorless. Lastly, there were sliced green beans on the paella-- which is COMPLETELY unheard of in Spain. All in all, the paella didnt taste bad, but it wasnt AT ALL what I was hoping for-- an authentic Spanish paella. The tapas we had were good (chorizo and fried artichokes), but they were fairly standard fare. I can say however, that the wine list and the sangria were excellent as its hard to find a nice selection of Spanish wines in NYC. Lastly,, the communal seating is extremely annoying. You are literally sitting at a very narrow long table, on top of the people next to you in these backless stools that really make the entire dining experience pretty uncomfortable. All in all--not bad, but not good either. My quest to find an authentic, top notch Spanish paella in NYC continues..",2,0,0,NYC C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,55,0

4.0,3/31/2011,"Socarrat was my first communal dining experience and I had read a ton about it recently, including the claims that it has NYCs best paella. We ordered a few tapas which I remember all liking but the chorizo stood out in particular. It was just the right amount of kick(and there was a lot of kick) and it was crispy on the outside. Seems to me that so socarrats chorizo is how chorizo is supposed to be.  I couldn't eat enough of it. Then paella time. The minimum (and in my opinion,the maximum) number of ppl requires for a paella dish is  2.  We found this out the hard way when a friend joined us for lunch. Luckily the place had quieted so they were able to accommodate his sitting with us. He shared our seafood paella w us and realized that w3 ppl our due right to paella (not to mention the coveted socarrat) split in 3. the paella was spectacular but it was a bummer that a little more had to be shared. Highlights: love the decor. Has a rustic, American farmhouse feel to it with an classy women's touch. The cabinetry, which flanks the dining table in the main room, certainly looks antique and authentic and was painted an elegant sea foam green. Antique looking mirrors ran up and down the walls of the main room too; anthropologie def decorated this placeAny paella dish serves 2 comfortably but I would invest in ordering another you're expecting a 3rd guest. I stuck with a Riesling that after noon but after seeing practically every other patron in the restaurant drinking sangria and figuring out that sangria is drink that socarrat is mastered; it's the regulars order.Service was attentive and enthusiastic. Our server is from Spain and knows ALOT about paella and in particular the socarrat, which he graciously offers to scrape up at the bottom of the paella pan towards the end of your meal. And all in all, after several tapas plates and a seafood paella dish split by 3 ppl (and oh yea, 4 glasses of wine, consumed by yours truly) the bill was not horrendous at all.

I've had the socarrat paella, and the seafood one and you can't go wrong.  They bring it out to you, and you wait a few minutes to let the paella settle down a bit.  On top, you have a medley of seafood, chicken, and beef (a little unorthodox), and in the middle, you have a layer hot delicous rice.  What this place is known for, and what most paella places fail at, is the layer of slightly burnt and caramelized rice at the bottom, also known as... socarrat.  It provides a great textural contrast to everything that I really dig.You can't go wrong with this place, and for the most part, everything is delicious.  The only thing that would turn me away would be the wait times at night... but that's why they have a bar, right?",0,0,1,Minh L.,"New York, NY",22,193,1

($18 a person)The Croquetas del Dia was surprisingly delicious. They look like mozzarella sticks, and are paired with a light beige sauce. Biting into the Croquetas was also a surprise, the crispy exterior was so different than they warm soft inside... it was very good. I think the underlying flavor in the Croquetas is shrimp, but I could be wrong. We ordered the Socarrat Paella... the dish took a little while to come out, but when it did it was pretty extravagant. A blazing hot iron pan is brought out and placed on a heating rack. Your told not to eat the paella for a few minutes so that the skillet can continuously cook the rice on the bottom and crisp it up. After waiting what seemed to be hours (only a minute or two) we obliterated the dish. Lasting only minutes, the beef, chicken, shrimp, rice, beans, and cuttlefish, were simply devoured. The best part of the dish is the crispy rice at the bottom of the iron skillet... don't forget to scrape it up... or have the cute waitress do it for you.  If your craving a hearty Spanish meal you should absolutely try out this restaurant.

3.0,3/6/2011,"This place is pretty posh, which I suppose is the crowd that it caters to. We came here on a Thursday night, almost impossible to get a seat totally crowded. The paella was pretty tasty, I've tasted better (in Spain) and worse (in Spain), so its right down the middle. The seafood paella is the one we got, it had lots of great flavors in it.Their selection of tapas wasn't THAT appealing to me, but I'm not that adventurous with meats either, so maybe I'm not the best judge.The sangria was just okay.

5.0,3/2/2011,"On a gray and windy early Saturday afternoon, I took my family to Socarrat Paella Bar in Chelsea on a whim -everywhere else was booked solid, so I hoped that we could get a table being the first customers at 12 Noon.That day, Lady Luck was on our side. We arrived just as the restaurant opened for lunch, and we scored a beautiful table by the entrance window. Immediately, I started shooting pictures of the still-empty space, which is very pretty: blue velvet barstools line the long and narrow hallway, red exposed brick adds charming rustic touch, and plenty of mirrored surfaces add extra dimension and luxury. A lot of intricate attention to the decor, natural light from the entrance, and a generous smile from our server Michelle - for a moment, I was in heaven. And then the food came, and the angels sang.The superstar of the show is, of course, the paella, and Socarrat makes individual orders of paella in heavy black cast iron pans, so we ordered 4 variations to try. Each paella was luxurious with seafood (or meat), and had the perfect crust for which the restaurant in named after.

2.0,2/23/2011,"I really wanted to like Socarrat. I'd been meaning to go there for awhile, and full disclosure - it was the recent Scoutmob discount that finally acted as the catalyst for me ending up there one unseasonably warm recent Wednesday evening. The seafood paella we ordered was plenty enough for two, with succulent pieces of scallop, shrimp, clams and mussels, and the namesake socarrat (the crunchy layer of rice that forms on the bottom of the pan as the paella cooks) was indeed delicious. But somehow, I left this tiny Chelsea spot with a slightly sour taste in my mouth.I attribute this not to the food itself, but more to the whole process of actually being seated and fed. When we arrived, the hostess told us the wait would be up to forty five minutes and told us we could wait at the adjacent bar. She also recommended ordering our paella in advance so that it would arrive soon after we were actually seated, since it takes up to forty minutes to prepare. We decamped to a bar a few doors down after dutifully submitting a name and number so that we could be notified when the table was ready, since the bar was packed. As time passed, our discontent grew proportionately with our hunger. We were excited to leave our watery time killer beers when the call finally came and hightailed it back to the restaurant, only to wait another twenty minutes while the patrons at our spot took their sweet time paying. The hostess apologized profusely, but as we waited another twenty minutes for the paella itself to actually show up the goodwill was gone.Don't get me wrong, the food was good and it ended up being a great deal.

My favorite Spanish white is Albarino and they had my namesake wine, Nora, so that was a plus on its own.

Seating is all communal and the decor is just beautiful. We tried a couple of more tapas, the tortilla and croquetas de chorizo and ordered the vegetarian paella.

We parked it down the street at a bar until the phone rang.We ordered a pitcher of Sangria, which was delicious, with the perfect balance of fruit and wine flavors.  This was my first time having Paella, so I didn't really know what to expect.  We ordered the Socarrat Paella that came with beef, cuddle fish, clams, fish, and green beans.  It was delicious.  The flavors were well done, not overwhelming but just really good.  I also like scraping the Paella from the bottom of the pan.  The crunchiness was kind of addicting.Now, as this was my first time having paella, I must say that there was a misconception on my part.  Thanks to an episode of Desperate Housewives, I thought Paella was all supposed to be spicy:  ""Gabrielle Solis, who lives down the block, brought a spicy Paella.  Since her modeling days in NY, Gabrielle had developed a taste for rich food and rich men.""  It was rich, I'll say, and my misconception was set straight.  The service here was excellent, so was the food, and I will definitely go back.",3,3,2,Jonathan W.,"San Francisco, CA",137,100,1

1.0,12/27/2010,"One of the most disappointing meals of 2010.Socarrat had been on my list for years after traveling to Barcelona and sampling the arroz negro at Can Ros, but the small, narrow layout of the dining room and few seats conspired against walk-ins whenever I was walking by the restaurant. Finally, I got my chance during what was arguably NYC's worst snowstorm in 60 years.The tapas looked pretty forgettable, so I headed into the meat-and-potatoes -- or rather the pork-and-paella -- section of the menu. Like a good Filipino, I ordered the cochinillo (young suckling pig) for an appetizer and the arroz negro (rice with squid ink and seafood) for an entree.I was really looking forward to bringing the ruckus to the cochinillo, but after biting through a greedy forkful of rendered pig skin, shredded pig meat, potato gratin, and electric-green spinach, the taste of the dish grossly lagged my lofty expectations. The spinach was overly salted; the potatoes were a doormat of flavor; the skin didn't have that crunchy, greasy, salty bite; and the pig meat was as lifeless and bland as an overly cooked holiday turkey.When the arroz negro arrived, I hardly recognized it: instead of the seafood pieces of squid, shrimp, cuttlefish, scallops, and fish swimming in the dark, murky ocean of squid ink and rice, they were daintily airlifted onto the pan. The entire reason to incorporate the rice and the seafood together, as a chef once lasciviously told me, is to ensure ""one big seafood orgy"" in the pan, with the juices and flavors of each of the ingredients ""grinding and writhing"" against each other, and leaving a ""glorious mess"" at the bottom of the pan. After biting into a heaping forkful of rice and seafood, I definitely wasn't turned on; I tasted no glory, but rather a complete mess of a dish. The squid was gummy; the shrimp and scallops drier and less flavorful than the previous cochinillo; and the rice lacking any moisture, texture, or residual flavor from the squid ink or the other seafood bits in the dish. Also anointing this bastard child of arroz negro were slices of red bell peppers and lima beans, which have absolutely no place in the traditional dish.  There is too much starch in the dish already to have random Jack-the-Beanstalkers sprouting in the pan, and a lemon wedge (rather than peppers) traditionally gives an herbal, citrus flavor that cuts through the full-bodied squid-ink infused rice.Socarrat is a great concept, and has been proven so by their recent expansion into Nolita. However, the food is simply embarrassing and doesn't deserve to stand up against better executed Spanish concepts like Boqueria, Casa Mono, El Quinto Pino, and Tia Pol.",12,3,8,Jonas M.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,166,0
5.0,12/27/2010,"It was a peaceful Sunday morning in December, and merry little snowflakes danced down saucily from the sky.  It was a day of possibilities, and we were treated to a truly miraculous experience at Socarrat.Against all odds, there was no wait that Sunday afternoon at 12:30pm.  We had been repeatedly warned by friends and yelpers about the brutal 45+ minute wait in the unforgiving cold, but this day, we were spared, and we took that to mean that we should order extra starters.There were actually quite a few lovely surprises which helped to elevate an already great meal to truly exceptional food and value:- During lunch, the tapas are all $7 vs. $7-$10 at dinner- During lunch, Socarrat offers paella for 1, so we got to try different kinds- Lunch paella is priced lower at $18-$19 per person vs. $22-$24 at dinner- The service was wonderful: knowledgeable, extremely patient and helpful- The music, heavy on the Spanish guitars, was rather romanticWe tried 3 starters based on recommendations from yelpers and Frank Bruni:1. Gambas al Ajillo ($7) - this little pan of sizzling shrimps, garlic, and guindilla peppers floated into the room in a fragrant cloud of garlic oil, and as soon as I bit into a shrimp and dipped my bread into the oil, I was tempted to get another order.  This was the best starter.  We got 8 medium sized shrimp and everything was tasty, including the garlic, oil and peppers.  Proceed with caution with the guindilla peppers.  Some are very, very spicy!2. Croquetas Cabrales ($7) - filled with a Spanish blue cheese, fried to a wonderful crisp and then placed on a bed of more amazingly buttery cheese, these croquetas were a rather hedonistic indulgence.  We had 4 in our order.  Highly recommended!3. Canelones ($7) - These were rather small but tasty.  4 pasta rolls (about 1.5"" long) filled with spinach and little tidbits of shrimp were covered in melted manchego and topped with a tasty red sauceWe took full advantage of paella for 1 and ordered 1 each.  Post 3 delicious starters, the 2 minute wait for socarrat to form was not as tortuous as I had imagined:1. Arroz Negro ($19) - with ample seafood and strikingly green fava beans against the inky black rice, this was gorgeously presented in a surprisingly large pan with a side of garlic aioli2. Paella Socarrat ($18) - as the house paella, we knew this would be good, but it still exceeded out expectations.  Between the two delicious paellas, I preferred this one because of the visible socarrat and the variety of land and sea.  We liberally applied the aioli from the Arroz Negro to this paella with delicious resultsThough we were full, we had to try the ""Greixonera"" cheesecake, which came in a little pan with a dab of icing sprinkled with nutmeg.  It was pretty tasty, and pretty soon, despite our plans to ""just try a bite"", it was decimated.All in all, this was a fantastic experience with some awesome Spanish hospitality and blows all of the other paella I've tried out of the water.  I'll definitely be back!PARTING THOUGHT: While we ordered quite a bit and cleared all the plates (sweet holiday gluttony), we probably would have been fully satisfied with 2 starters, 1 paella and 1 dessert for lunch, which would have been ~$40 total (for 2 people) before tax and tip.  That's quite a bargain for the best paella in NYC!!!",4,1,4,Ida C.,"Singapore, Singapore",329,437,852

Pick a place you've never been, but always wanted to go to."" And with that, he left for work. I knew exactly what I wanted; I didn't have to look at Yelp to find something. Socarrat had been on my to-do list for a while, but the right opportunity didn't seem to quite come up. This was perfect.We walked in on a Sunday evening and got seating right away, which the waiter was a little surprised about. From his tone of voice, we could tell that this was a rare, perhaps even unheard of privilege, and that even a 40-min wait was considered a short wait. Soccarrat Paella Bar is well named as pretty much the only seats in the house are along the very long communal table. There's one small table by the window, but chances are you'll be seated somewhere along the long table. Be prepared to get very cozy with your neighbors as space is precious and people are packed in tightly. The noise level is pretty loud, but not too deafening. Regardless of the typical cramped conditions found for Manhattan restaurants, it still has a romantic charm. The flickering candles, warm wood,  exposed brick, and sharing of the good food imbue the atmosphere ripe for an amative night. I wouldn't recommend this Socarrat for when you're still in the Q&A phase (Dates 1 & 2, possibly 3) of the relationship because it can be a little too loud to comfortably hear and talk. It takes approximately 20 minutes for the paella to be ready, so we ordered the roasted beet salad and the pig special for our appetizers. I wanted beets because I love them and the pig special was some kind of chef special for that night. It's a specialty in Spain and I just remember that the big appeal was the very very crispy pig skin on top of a layer of pork.We ordered the seafood paella and we were instructed to wait 2-3 minutes before eating so that a proper soccarat, the thin crispy rice crust, would form. My companion lamented that it was a cruel thing to do to us because for two minutes all conversations ceased as we whimpered and languished in front of the incredibly tempting aroma of paella. When the two minutes were up (we couldn't wait for three), we heartily helped ourselves. The socarrat makes the paella. The crispy crust achieved by the cast iron paella skillet is what elevates this this to a superior experience. The seafood was perfectly cooked -- nothing overcooked -- and the serving of seafood was ample. The rice was perfectly seasoned with salt (not too salty) and saffron. It was fluffy on top and formed the perfect crust at the bottom. It was absolutely as marvelous as I had read.The only quibble we had about our experience there was with the service. I understand that Socarrat has a long line of people waiting for the coveted seats, but that's no reason to take away our food before we finish eating them. Several times we had to stop our waiter or the busboy from taking our dishes away while there was still some food remaining. We were very startled when our paella dish was taken from us (so quickly that we couldn't even protest) because some of the delicious socarrat was still left. The socarrat is the best part and they denied us the privilege of enjoying and savoring the last few bites.After we paid, they fetched our coats from behind the curtain. Before we even had a chance to put on our coats, they opened the door and motioned us out. It's winter time! For Christ's sake, let us at least put our coats on first! The food was an amazing gastronomic experience, but I wish Socarrat would have let us walk out a little more slowly.

5.0,11/22/2010,"The Magic Wand of Lady Rachel stirs its stipulating inclinations once again...  With that in mind, this review is dedicated to one Rachel ""Cheli"" M!  Without her directive introduction to Socarrat, this grandiose and awe-inspiring dining engagement would not have been undertaken...As the saying goes...  ""What The Lady Wants, The Lady Gets (+2 Carats More)""Linky to Rachel M's Profile:yelp.com/user_details?us…Venturing to Socarrat presented an opportunity to merge the socio-economic disparities of a commoner's consumable (a la ""Arroz"") to that of an enchanting and many ways hospitable upscale ambiance.  Socarrat, in many ways, is a restaurant fashioned for the people.  The very foundation in the essence of its establishment is that of a hospitable atmosphere accompanied by what can be described as Spanish Soul Food.  The large communal table, which sets the foundation of its main dining room embraces the moderate decibel levels rendered through carefree chatter stemming from its patronage.  The exposed brick design, with accompanying natural soothing brownish red tones, is augmented by the Mahogany stained furniture and intense orange fluorescent bulb lighting.  With Socarrat, you're embraced by an atmosphere of civility and relaxation.  It's mainly about two things here...  The Food & The People.The Food:Appetizer (1): Croquetas del Dia - ""Jamon & Manchego"": With its petite log shaped form that's lightly breaded and fried, the Jamon & Manchego Croquetas are accompanied by a light serving of Lemon Garlic Aioli.  The initial observation is the welcoming textural contrast in this application.  The lightly crispy exterior introduces a buttery/creamy confine that's composed of a perfectly cooked potato, which is well mended with a proportionate amount of butter.  There's a light detection of saltiness derived from the Jamon, which works to elevate the creaminess of the of the Manchego.  The Manchego also produced a timid level of boldness, which helped to elevate the composition of the potato & butter combination.  A well rounded starter to the beginning of a meal; one for which seconds were not frowned upon.Entree: Paella Socorrat: Ingredients = Short Grain Rice, Chicken, Fish, Beef, Shrimp, Cuttle Fish, Green Beans, Mussels, Cockle Clams...  Perhaps the combination of ingredients presented more of a multitude of consumable appeal.  For many, the array of edible components would render a chaotic, throw in everything in the refrigerator & pantry, type of dish.  Nevertheless, the visual appeal of the application aided in appetite stimulation.  All components in the application were presented in a proportioned amount, thus alleviating any rendering remarks of burdensome corpulence.  During initiate tasting, the rapid diversity in flavors stemmed from the mildly timid to the vibrantly robust.  Seafood components of the application revealed a delicate subtle flavor, which was aided through proper cooking techniques as each bite of the Shrimp & Mussels revealed a scrumptious composition.  To the more robust, the Saffron / Chicken Stock base helped to provide a welcoming saltiness derived from the Arroz & Pollo components.  Although the Green Beans were rampant in the Paella, they helped to provide a welcoming earthiness and refreshing base, thus further uplifting the hearty flavors of the rice and proteins in the application.  One notable mention to Socorrat's Paella...  Given all of the ingredients used in its composition, it is praise worthy to note that the Beef was cooked to medium rare, with the Shrimp & Clams still maintaining their natural juicy structure. Such technique detail to cooking temperature is nothing short of perfection.Notes on Socarrat:- No Reservations.  Walk in Only!- Best Time to Go? 5:00pm, 5:30pm: Restaurant gets packed- Restaurant allows for patrons to order while waiting at the bar.- Suggested Paella:  All!  With the ""Arroz Negro"" Paella being the most adventurous.- Don't dig into the Paella immediately, given 3 minutes for the Socarrat to form.- Socarrat by definition...  The crust which forms on the bottom of the Paella pan.",13,5,18,C M.,"New York, NY",266,454,791

The restaurant is named after the bottom of the pan when they make the paella and that is definitely the best part! I had the seafood paella (Paella de Pescado & Mariscos) and it was very fresh and delicious. The only problem is the portions because they give you SO much food to eat!

3.0,10/27/2010,"Socarrat is a positive note in an area that, for many years, was really a culinary no-man's land, filled with highly forgettable restaurants.   Overall, the vibe of this place is nice, the atmosphere good and the food well done and authentic.    The space is small, with a tapas bar on one side and the stuffed, narrow paella bar adjacent.  Put your name in and find a set on the tapas side and stuff up on your appetizers.   The tapas is authentic and tasty and the most traditional items - tortillas, croquetas, tomato bread - are all very good.  I'm usually not one to complain about price, but I got the consistent feeling that everything on this side was pricier than it should of been.  In fact, combining our tapas with a (very small) carafe of sangria, cost us upward of $60 after tip.   After moving to the other side, you are seated at the Paella bar and make your choice of their specialty paellas.   We chose the Socarrat variety and it was pretty good.  Not sure if it was the best paella I've had, even here in the States, but it was well done.  While they are very true to their craft, I would not call it mindblowing, however.    However, for $22 a person, I think this was reasonable given the generous portion and variety of fresh ingredients.There are a couple of things that annoyed me, however.  First, even at 6pm on a Sunday, the paella bar was packed and our ""20-30 minute wait"" turned into more like an hour - this is pretty annoying.  Second, the paella bar was packed to the point that you felt like they hit the absolute max of people and then shoved in  3 or 4 more.    Furthermore, the seats at the end of the bar, nearest to the kitchen are even more cramped and inconvenient.    I could see a tourist or two enjoying the ""charm"" of the atmosphere (""We sat at this long bar with all these people...""), but this was less than optimal for a Sunday meal.All in all, it was good food.  I would be that their paella is very consistent and dependable and the tapas was tasty.    But there are better choices for tapas in this city and the space, crowd and wait may be too much for you if you're just looking for paella.",1,0,1,Chris U.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",73,235,111
4.0,10/25/2010,"Walked in with no reservation for an early dinner on a Sunday night (6pm-ish) and was promptly seated at the long communal table.  I'm not a huge fan of the communal table set-up (eavesdropping is only fun when you control whether you want to overhear convos), and will acknowledge the staff tried to accomodate our request to sit side-by-side at the bar.  Note that the restaurant is quite small, and I would not suggest groups larger than 4.We ordered a pitcher of red sangria, and 2 tapas to start - the quail egg with chorizo on bread, along with the fried artichokes.  The fried artichokes packed quite a savory punch of flavor, and the quail egg (over easy) accomplished the task of whetting our appetites for the main dish.  Small complaint was the waiter was a bit rushed and never told us the specials and forgot about the sangria (we had to remind him, and in all honesty is a bit underwhelming and overpriced).We ordered the paella soccarat, which includes a meledy of different meats/fishes/seafood.  While the cast-iron presentation is impressive, the the pot is deceptively shallow.  I think the paella could live without the green beans (which merely add color diversity to the dish, and no flavor), and use a bit more meat.  That being said, the real draw of the paella here is the fact that the rice gets a bit crispy from the pot - a real personal favorite of the gf and I.Anyway, you should also note that while small in space, there is a subtle refined sense of atmosphere - ie, dont show up in casual digs, lest you feel underdressed and ignored seated among the fashionably dressed in the candle-lit ambiance.  Definitely not cheap-eats, but the crispy paella really did hit the spot.",1,0,0,Hhhoya W.,"New York, NY",9,94,0

Paella de Pescado & Mariscos and Paella de Carne (meat, basically). Both of them on the main menu. The server was unsure if there was a special, making up something on the spot, I think, because he didn't have anything more specific than snow pea pods and chicken in mind when he tried to give the ingredients.Appetizers of grilled octopus & potato (tasty special of the day), Alcachofas Fritas (fried artichoke, almost tasted like pickled artichoke, but tasty), and rabbit bathed in oil and garlic (meat fell off the bone, but it had a decidedly oily feel). Spicy chorizo was a tasty start, too.Paella came out in hot, cast-iron pans, and you're supposed to wait before scraping the bottom, letting the rice crisp. The seafood was a delicious, milder-flavored paella filled with a decent amount of seafood to rice. The carne, on the other hand, was a heavy, darker, and saltier paella that I was not necessarily a fan of.I'm not a fan of the service here, and had to ask for water much of the time for the table since they never really checked and did it on their own, even though we sat near the wait station and kitchen window. The two staffers weren't the best with English, either... my ""I have a chocolate cake in the fridge in the back"" ended up as two desserts that we didn't want, but we tried anyway while he scurried back to get the cake we'd brought for the birthday cake.  -sigh- Ah, well. An extra $25 of bill for his mistake. The dishes were either good (seafood paella) or not impressive... and the service drops it from 3 to 2. I've had better service and better paella in the city, this is nice for a novelty stop or to get some European tapas.

Unfortunately, Socarrat totally messes with my NYC game face. With its lovely staff, communal table, friendly patrons and good food, it's difficult not to be a little bit smiley and upbeat, here. This place might, if you're not careful, even make you crack a smile at a stranger over dinner, talk to her... and horror of horrors, actually enjoy it. Seating is extremely tight, so you will quite literally be rubbing elbows with your dining neighbors all evening. Whether you want to or not, you'll catch bits and pieces of your neighbors' conversations and they will catch bits and pieces of yours. You will find yourself staring and drooling at the paella that is brought out to those around you, while you hungrily wait for yours to arrive. When your paella does arrive, you might just find yourself offering some to the nice folks sitting next to you as they try very hard not to stare. I'm not very good at delay. But on occasion, the paella really is worth the 1+ hour wait -- or 40 minutes on a slow night. But the wait is as pleasant as they come in NYC. On most nights, there's room enough at the bar for a glass of wine and maybe a few tapas before dinner. Hunger and the restaurant's policy of not serving paella at the bar, except to groups of five or more may be just the right catalyst for you to make a few new friends. Service between the bar and restaurant is fluid. When your table is ready, the lovely hostess will take your paella order before you even settle your bar bill, to reduce the wait. Haven't received your tapas? No problem. They'll track you down and bring it to you at your table once you've been seated. Once in the dining room, you *will* order paella, as the bartender once emphatically informed me I would. At first, I scoffed, but In truth, if you have any thoughts of resistance, they'll be moot once you see the delicious looking platters being brought to other nearby parties. Moist, al dente rice is cooked with your choice of ingredients from the more traditional rabbit and chicken to seafood to squid ink to a vegetables only version. The socarrat, itself (the delicious crust at the bottom of the pan). isn't as well developed as a good paelleria might make it in The Motherland -- it's thinner and darker than the perfect crust, meaning that this restaurant tries to finish the dish too quickly over too hot a flame -- but Socarrat is one of the very few in NYC to serve paellas made properly in a paella pan, with any socarrat at all. (This is in contrast to the rather abominable Sevilla, to name just one example, which mixes cooked, colored rice with chorizo and other ingredients just prior to serving). Seafood is usually reasonably fresh, though I've encountered a few off mussels. I don't taste any saffron in these paellas, but admittedly, I've failed to taste saffron in my own food, before, even when I was the one who added it. Serving sizes are perfectly proportioned for a moderately active, average sized person or a smaller glutton like me. People with larger appetites may walk away hungry without a number of additional tapas and perhaps dessert. Like a few others, I haven't found many really mind blowing tapas on the menu, yet, though most are solid. We've tried the fried calamari (not much breading and a little less tender than my favorite places), fried artichokes, albondigas, potato bravas and IMHO, the best of the bunch, sauteed leeks. Socarrat really is a lovely place to go if you want to take a short vacation away from NYC. It's easy to go and pretend like you're in Spain, on a Spanish schedule. Forget that you have a deadline or a meeting in X hours. Bring some good company or append yourself to someone else's good company. Enjoy some good food and a few glasses of wine. Probably, your deadline won't wait for you. But if you blow it, you might as well blow it enjoyably.",9,6,9,Jane D.,"New York, NY",102,255,31
4.0,7/27/2010,"Tapas are good, but standard for high quality Spanish restaurants in NYC.5 Stars for the best Paella I've ever had in the US. Try the Paella Carne: smokey, unctuous, tender, crunchy, and complex. The chorizo is not too strong, the meats are well cooked, and the rice is BOMB.Sadly, you and one other dinner-mate have to agree on the Paella since it's a minimum of 2 people per dish. Seafood would have been my choice, but I'd read in New York Magazine that the Carne was the way to go. After trying it, it will be hard to stray towards anything else. The environment is interesting; it's so small, but the staff (especially the bartender) is accommodating and nice. It's definitely Spanish in attitude, so kick back and relax according to their time clock. Food can take awhile and the only thing you'll accomplish by being antsy is looking more like a wound-up American. You must like Olive Oil- but I guess that's true for all Spanish food.",3,2,3,Amanda C.,"Los Angeles, CA",445,689,59
5.0,7/26/2010,"Loved this place! Had to wait awhile for a table but that was expected on a Saturday night and we managed to get a spot at the bar and a pitcher of lovely red sangria, with apples and oranges, to pass the time. The bartender, who looked like he was cast from some Spanish movie, walked us through the menu and the maitre d asked if we wanted to place our paella order early so it would be ready when we sat. We got the table for four by the window with a view of the street so I can't comment on the communal dining but it looked fun. The gazpacho was a deliciously sweet and garlicky tomato puree and the tocino, braised pork belly, had a nice crunchy top and the saltiness went well with the sweet puree of dates underneath. The fried artichokes were good but a tiny bit bland compared to the other tapas.The meat paella, with pork, chicken, duck and mushroom sofrito was also delicious and the waitress scraped our skillet to make sure we got all the crunchy blackened rice that makes paella special.",0,0,0,katie w.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,10,0
4.0,7/23/2010,"It's somewhere between 3.5 and 4 stars, can't decide which it is so I'm giving it four stars.Paella Bar is as the name describes itself, it allows customers to sit at a bar/communal table to eat a big pan of Paella.  We got the Socarrat Paella which was delicious.  However we only got two orders for three people and if you are big eaters it isn't enough even though we ordered the grilled squid and pork loin skewers.  I thought the two appetizers were a bit lacking, I had better at other places and if I were to go back I would skip it and order more Paella instead.  The Paella offered a good generous portion of seafood and chicken, the only negative was it had beef which was over cooked for our liking.  The Sangria was delicious.  Since I didn't have to drive, I was happy to drink more than I normally consume.  The restaurant also offers comfortable stools which are velvet cushioned.  The walls / interior reminds you of eating in your own kitchen counter (a well designed one).  The bathrooms were also clean and nice which also gives bonus points.  I think aside from the food, the one thing I'm going to remember was the walk there.  It was a warm night with the sun starting to set.  Perfect weather, great neighborhood, just wished the dinner lasted longer and I remembered more since I was a bit tipsy from the Sangria!",0,0,0,Pierre L.,"Burlingame, CA",12,408,25
4.0,7/23/2010,"If you believe in fairy tales, pagan rituals and are a sangria purist, this review is not for you*. A few years ago, during Xmas-time, I was caught by a cop for unknowingly speeding through a residential neighborhood. He pulled me over, I rolled down my window and he said, ""Do you believe in Santa Claus?"" I looked at him in confusion, which then turned into annoyance. I wasn't in the mood to be patronized. Luckily, I was only given a warning and I went on my merry way.I don't care much for Santa Claus. I remember one of my earliest Christmases. Santa had hidden all the presents in our playhouse. It was the most exciting Christmas ever. I had gotten pony plates and for a whole year I was running through crayons creating pony scenes. The next year we hung stockings over the fireplace. Santa filled them with fruit. Apples to be exact. The year after that were toothbrushes. Toothbrushes! Who gets toothbrushes for Christmas? I wasn't a bad kid and my cousin got a talking Big Bird. I had come to my own conclusion that Santa Claus did not and could not exist!Later on in one of my magical moments in NYC, I found myself having dinner with friends at Soccarrat Paella Bar. We noshed over tapas and sipped sangria. The majority of the tapas, for me, remain unmemorable. The only one that stood out was the grilled squid with squid ink. It's delicious and interesting, perhaps an acquired taste. I remember my first experience with squid ink anything. I thought squid ink pasta was weird, funny tasting and pointless. Now with my developed gourmet tastebuds, I assure you this tapas dish will turn you off of fried calamari forever. Tender, grilled rings of squid swimming in a pool of black ink it is and should be.   The sangria was light and mild. Most complained that it was weak but I didn't mind. For once, the alcohol didn't overwhelm the food or experience. If you prefer something stronger, order a glass of cava. Soccarrat also has a long list of wines without the fruit bits.On to the paellas. We had gotten two variations: one with fish and seafood, the other with black rice from squid ink. For me this was the highlight of the night. Paella has always been a special dish for my family and I love the whole cooking process. Most of all, I love that saffron is used in paella. Saffron is not cheap and it makes any dish exotic and special. It is the spice of all spices. Imagine my shock when Laura A told me that saffron is never, if ever, just rarely, used in paella. It is just too expensive and impractical. That moment was my equivalent to finding out that Santa Claus was just a myth, not through my own skepticism but by someone breaking it to me. There was no golden pot at the end of the rainbow and food coloring is unnatural. In spite of it all, I really liked both variations of paella at Soccarrat. I will say that of the two, I favored the squid ink one. It is a paella not born out of deceit.Soccarrat Paella Bar does not accept reservations. It helps when one of your party is authentically Spanish. Maybe she knows the Queen, who knows?? The really friendly and warm owner Lolo snagged us a table. The restaurant is fun and definitely a hot spot. The bathroom is all black and gothic. Definitely cool. There are many things and bites at Soccarrat that will leave you saying, ""WOW"".I left with a lasting impression and leftovers. Laura A told me paella tastes even better the next day refried and with the flavors all melded together. She was right and thus forgiven for breaking the saffron news to me.____________*I'm sorry if you had to find out Santa Claus is not real, that there is no pot of gold at the end of a rainbow, and that the sangria at Soccarrat will be too weak for you. No worries, the Tooth Fairy does exist in the form of The Rock, your knight in shining armor should arrive any day now, and you can just leave the juice they call sangria for me. I'll drink it.",12,11,12,Rachel A.,"Brooklyn, NY",732,1493,1730

4.0,6/22/2010,"I went here last night with four of my coworkers for a birthday dinner. I already wanna go back!SETTING: The place is kind of divided into two parts the right side is a LONG table with communal seating. This part of the place was packed when we came in at around 9:30 pm. The hostess seated us immediately at the other side which had smaller tables and near the bar. The lights are a bit dimmed (which I like) and the noise was good for cheerful chatter.FOOD:1. SIZZLING SHRIMP was really good - it's peeled shrimp in garlic butter & comes in a small sizzling dish with small pieces of bread.BABY EEL was ok, the texture was almost like noodles but drenched in hot butter, also served sizzling. 2. FRIED ARTICHOKES WERE AMAZING. Lightly battered, crisp and light and has a nice bite to it. everyone should try this!FRIED SPANISH PEPPERS were really good. They're just whole peppers and lightly fried so that the skin is a bit wrinlked & slightly crispy while the inside is still a bit chewy. It's a plain dish but it has a really good flavor.3. RAZOR CLAMS were ok, though I thought it was slightly on the dry side.4. CHEESE PLATE was a good dish to share, I personally loved the chorizo. Thin slices of spicey sausage OMG so good. Also came with two types of cheeses, fruit preserves, some ham and pieces of bread. 5. SEAFOOD PAELLA - I didn't really have much of the paella because I'm on a low carb diet hahahaha but the portion was HUGE. It was meant to be for 3 people but it would have been enough for 4-5. I had a couple of bites of the seafood on top and you can tell that it's fresh. Cooked prefectly (not too well done), tasted really good, clean and has that slightly ""sweet"" flavor that comes with fresh seasfood.SERVICE: The waitstaff were friendly will explain everything thoroughly if you're not familiar with the menu. Our waitress suggested that tapas & paella is supposed to be shared. (well, duh.)PRICE: With a bottle of white wine, glasses of sangria, a couple of bottles of beer & all the food, it came out to around $65 per person including tip for five people.

3.0,6/20/2010,"This is a small place that is first come first served. If you go on a weekend night expect a long wait. We had a some different tapas and tried two of the paellas.The coco del dia was the sardines with goat cheese. The bread was hard and crunchy and the goat cheese was pungent and tasty. The sardines were sour and the combination with goat cheese brought out the best flavor of the sardines. The fuet was very rich and there was more fat than meat in this cured meat. Overall the taste was buttery. The croquetas  del dia were mushroom and cheese. They had a nice crunch on outside and soft, hot, and cheesy on the inside. The empanadas we got were pulled chicken and did not taste like traditional empanadas from South America. There was a nice crust on the outside.The Paella Valencia had snails, rabbit and snow peas. The snails were good - not too chewy. The rabbit was great, there was no gamey taste and had a great flavor. The snow peas instead of peas were different but added some crunch to the rice. The Paella soccarat had mussels, prawns, cuttlefish, lima beans, and smoked red peppers. The mussels were good without any grit, but the prawns were too overcooked. The cuttlefish was cooked nicely, it was both firm and flavorful. The lima beans and smoked red peppers add a nice touch to the paella. Of course you can't really judge paella only on the toppings, the rice was great both of the paellas. Once you allow the soccarrat to form on the bottom of the pan, it adds a crunchy, burned flavor to an already delicious paella dish and makes these paellas some of the better paellas in New York. I will warn you that the paella is a little salty but not so much that I did not enjoy it.The inside is pretty dark and the music is loud so keep that in mind when you eat here.

At first sip it was refreshing (like an ice cold Gatorade after playing a sport) but after half a glass I knew this Sangria is not for me (alkie).... there's no flavor! Is this really Gatorade?? I realize later on that there was no fruit flavor when I saw the bartender pour wine out of a plastic take out quart container(like the ones you get when you get take out noodles in Chinatown).. no fruits in that small plastic container... That's why! The bartender actually added a few pieces in the pitcher for show.... so sad... White Sangria -- Please don't order this. It's really not good at all. I ordered in hopes it would be better than the red sangria, but it was worst, it had a weird flavor to it. Main dish - Meat Paella was salty, I mean not inedible salty but was salty enough for me to stop eating after 6 bites. Maybe the sausages made it too salty? The paella had too little rice too much meat? Ratio was off? Not sure, but it wasn't doing it for me. Oh and it's pretty pricey $23/$25 per person for Paella, AND after splitting it up, you get about a small plate of rice & meat .. uhhhh , not worth it! Cheese plate was standard - good Shrimp with red paper flakes - flavor mediocre, shrimps were overcooked. Fried Artichoke - Fried well, not too greasy, nothing special, will not order again.

Me and one other korean girl, we ageed that this stewy dish definitely reminded us a korean squid stew (oh-jing-uh cchi-gae) our moms cook at home but they don't sell in restaurants.The paellas, they were good but they got quite salty after the rice at the bottom got crispy. I like the rice more moist and risotto like but apparently, authentic paella should have a bit hard and crispy rice like at Soccarat's. My fave is black rice paella in general but this one didn't really imporess me. I prefered the one at La National. There, the tapas I didn't like much though. We could not finish the half of the Paellas since we got so full with tapas.... yes Pigs.... We took three take out packs of Paellas to go. All of us kind of regreted of ordering too much, more than enough which sometime leads to oversaturate your foodgasm apex to flat. One of girls said when they asked about dessert, she got a spasm that there were more courses she needed to eat. LOL  Though, we have learnt about the general debate that Tapas are too tiny or enough, which question mark certainly was crossed out that night. $57 per person including generous tip, overfed pigs with piggy bags, I still recommend Socarrat. There are still 20 tapas that I still want to try with the wine list which explains why we've initially ordered so much. Very pleasant owner tending time to time, even though I didn't understand a word he said. I was in food coma for another two hours after the dinner at Soccarat that night.",20,13,18,Sarah W.,"Brooklyn, NY",417,221,81

After having drinks in a nearby place, we received the call, got our table and had one of the most palatable experiences since I've been in the city. Wr tried 2 different paellas and both of them were delicious, I even learned that the term socarrat refers to the burnt rice that sticks in the pot, which is usually the best part of the meal. The tapas are just OK so my advice is to skip them and save your stomach space for the paellas. The wine selection is great and the price is not too crazy.

And often sacrifice. As it turned out at the end of this particular evening's outing, the sacrifice was one of our coats - lost in the chaos of the dining fray, held permanently hostage by the mysteriously frazzled and number-tag-averse cloakroom guards.Despite the casualty, our prime mission was a blockbuster success. All key objectives were achieved, and decidedly savory: entering via the bar,  _____, _____, _____,  and _____ (names classified) took down the array of front line defenses, some tapas in the form of artichoke hearts and olives. I picked off a lone amontillado for the extra commendations. In the bloodlust frenzy, we selected two primary targets, the Arroz Negro (with squid, and ink) and the Con Carne.When forty-five minutes later we finally pushed through across the bar / dining room barrier, we staked out a position at a small table facing the street - the long main table was completely inaccessible. At last our searing pans were in sight, and we aggressively took down the elaborately arranged paella, dividing and conquering the gently burnt rice, vegetables, and meat.

This place has 2 entries which I thought was confusing and so did the girls I dined with. Apparently one entrance is for their wine bar and the other entrance is for the paella bar. When you're inside you can go from one bar to the other easily which doesn't make sense why there are 2 entries. The décor is overall nice until they seat you at their bar stool seats and their long bar table. I barely like bar stool seats in a bar never mind a restaurant I should be relaxing and sipping my sangria. I was also not a big fan of their long bar style table where my elbow is bumping the guy next to me. We started off with the sangria, croquette's, and pincho moruno(pork loin). My favorite of those 3 was the sangria. The cheese used for the croquette's was too sharp. Our main course was the Paella Soccarat(seafood and poultry). I thought that was a bit salty and oily. But one thing is for sure that my friends and I agreed on, the paella and sangria did not compliment each other. It was an average eating experience.

Didn't realize it was at least $20 a person for their recommended portion of paella, plus more for tapas ($8-$16-ish) to begin.The four of us settled on three tapas and a two-person portion of the Meat Paella. It ended up being more than enough food after being supplemented with half a small cup of Pinkberry (totalled out to about 25 bucks a person for the entire night). The portions are fairly liberal and according to the the vaguely...I take that back... BLATANTLY European couple next to us, this explains the reason all Americans are fat (non-sequitor, yes, but one of the most entertaining comments of the night. and yes we did laugh out loud, prompting them to glare at us for the rest of the night).Anyway the tapas were so-so: Fried Artichoke too salty and over battered, Cod/Mashed Potatoes were so-so, Date/Goat Cheese/Bacon special was overpoweringly sweetThe Paella, though, was superb. A little overseasoned (but probably on par with other very meaty dishes) but the rice was cooked to perfection, crispy bottom that you joyously scrape with the metal spoon (or ask someone to help out).4 stars for superb paella that overshadows the lackluster tapasRevisit?

This place isn't too big but it's very cozy and had good lighting (somewhat dimmed but still bright). The bartender from Barcelona and tended to us was funny and a good conversationalist. He made this place seem more authentic. We had drinks while we waited for the seafood paella (pescados y mariscos) to come out. It came out in the more authentic big pan (as opposed to the small ones served elsewhere in the city). There was a thin layer of rice compared to Barcelona paella so the rice could cook faster and form a crispier bottom. The dish included calamari, shrimp, scallops, little chunks of fish, mussels, and sliced fava beans. I really liked the calamari and scallops.

2.0,1/11/2010,"Well, once upon a time, I had a very ""American"" in Europe weekend in Madrid, before I became the refined and cultured young lady I am today. On the last night of our trip, we had the best paella and sangria ever at a restaurant whose name escapes me now. We continued the party with some duty free Hennessey and ended the trip losing one passport and spontaneously ripping up an ATM card [only source of cash for the end of a semester in Europe] after seeing the damage at 6am after partying with Ja Rule in Capitale*. [see previous statement about not yet being a refined young lady]. Anyway, that meal set the bar pretty high when I finally tried out Socarrat. Even though it has been dubbed the best paella in the city, I was skeptical. I knew the place was small, and somehow they have created an ambiance out of it. I'm not saying it was an enjoyable ambiance, but it was an ambiance. Dim lighting somehow being synonymous to romantic for restaurant decorators. After being told it'd be a 25 minute wait, we waited an hour in the only available space for 4 people near a door that opened no less than 25 times on one of the coldest nights in life. But, let me just get to the point: the paella was mediocre at best. We got the seafood paella [pescado & mariscos] and fideua. The servings of the paella were deceptively small since the vessel was so shallow. First bite, you get the sense that this is a pretty salty dish. As you continue to explore the dish, you keep waiting for more flavors to hit you. You taste the seafood and realize the depth of flavors can't be found there. No, the seafood for every dish seem to have been cooked in a separate pot of just water, rather than to have been cooked with the rice. One of my friends asked me if there were scallops in the seafood paella after she finished eating [there were], just to give you an idea of the quality of the ingredients. The sangria was equally charming, but at least that had a kick. If this is supposed to be the best New York has to offer, I think my paella quest in this city has seen its end. *If only I were lying right now, but I am not.

4.0,1/10/2010,"Love, love, love the atmosphere here.  Exposed brick walls with wall mirrors; communal table; casual environment.  The host and bartender were very friendly and were on top of everything; we ordered our wine and paella while we were waiting (the paella takes about 30 minutes to make, so the host recommended that we order before we sat down).  We were seated in front of the bar tender instead of the communal part of the table and halfway through the meal when I finished my glass of wine, the bartender knew exactly which one I had ordered, which really impressed me since he hadn't even seen me until I sat down.  He also gave us some great recommendations on places to go to in Barcelona, where I'm planning to take a trip to soon.We ordered the quaila egg and chorizo crostini, which was a wonderfully crunchy  burst of flavor, and the arroz negro topped with prawns, scallop, fish, and red peppers and mixed with squid.  The toppings were a bland but the rice was pretty good, especially when you eat it with the deliciously garlicky aioli that the paella comes with.  That was probably the best part of the whole dish.We were too full to finish the huge paella but the bartender wrapped it up for us and gave us a quick hint:  paella is better the next day.  It's also great to eat when you're hungover, and it's delicious right out of the fridge. While we didn't have room for dessert, my friend and I did order some sherry to wrap up our meal.  Due to the number of people still waiting to sit down, the host asked us if we could move next door to the Bar de Vinos, which opened about 3 weeks ago, and offered each of us a complimentary glass of sherry.The Bar de Vinos currently serves a different tapas selection than the one offered at the paella bar, but will be serving paella soon.  It will seat parties of 5 or more (maybe some parties of 4), since the paella bar's communal seating makes it difficult to accomodate large parties.Make sure you come early to put your name down; they'll take your cell phone number and call you about 15 minutes before they're ready for you so you can make your way back.",0,0,0,Velina L.,"New York, NY",283,558,9

4.0,12/26/2009,"The only time I visited Spain was in the 9th grade so I can't really attest to the authenticity of the paella. But what I do know very well is crispy rice (the ""socarrat"" or in korean, it's ""nurumjee"" i.e. what you find at the bottom of your dol sot bibimbap), and the socarrat here was perfect. Movie theaters should sell these crispy rice pan scrapings instead of popcorn.As others have described, the wait can be brutal at times and I would suggest getting here as early as possible for dinner.  But once we were in, the service was informative and relaxed. The long communal table that dominates the room wasn't a bad thing at all--it allowed for us to gaze at the dishes our neighbors ordered without looking nosy. Our waiter suggested that for me and my g/f, we get the paella and two tapas. We started with the fried artichokes and the roasted vegetables with romesco. The artichokes were the better of the two--fried chunks of artichoke hearts with a squeeze of lemon were simple but delicious.But honestly I could've done without either of them--we were here for the paella and it was big enough for both of us.The arroz negra was a thing of beauty: squid ink paella with fish, shrimp and squid. Our waiter suggested we wait 2 minutes and then that we eat only the top layer of rice first so that the bottom layer could crisp up. When all you want to do is take a big chunk out of the pan, a lot of restraint is necessary not only to wait but also to deftly scoop out the top layer. Thankfully my g/f handled the serving spoon, saving the socarrat from my barbaric hands. The squid ink rice was flavorful and rich as only squid ink can do. There was also plenty of seafood for both of us, although the fish was a little bland. The best part of this whole dish though was the socarrat. The waiter came by when it looked like we had finished our top layer of rice, and with a spoon, dug out the crispy, crunchy, flavorful bottom rice for us. The squid rice crisped up by the oil at the bottom of the paella pan; wow to have those few bites of the socarrat made me truly appreciate the paella as a whole in all its tastes and textures.",2,2,2,Eric K.,"New York, NY",62,159,26

3.0,12/22/2009,"""Cantonese seafood stir fry"" was the first thing I thought when I saw my seafood paella ($23 * 2), because of the bright colors and the contrast with the brown rice.  You can see for yourself - one of the pictures on Yelp is the seafood paella.  It tasted just a little too ""processed""; perhaps the seafood was precooked, frozen and heated later.  I'm not expecting Barcelona greatness but the seafood was blander than I expected.  Perhaps the meat dishes are better.The rice itself was very well made.  It was crispy and had a sausage/meat taste to it (I think maybe all the rice is cooked similarly and the rest of the ingredients are added later?).  The socarrat is just burned enough to taste good, and it's surprisingly easy to remove.  I wouldn't mind just having a ""plain"" paella dish, it is that good.The jamon ($22) tastes more like prosciutto than the more full tasting, gamey meat found in Spain.  It is also very small.  Not worth the price.  The calimar is light tasting and goes well with lemon.  Wine choices are decent and cheaply priced (~$35/bottle).For a small place and a long communal table, eating here is surprisingly comfortable.  All in, this is a fine place to stop by if its convenient.  But, I hope to find something better.",0,0,0,D V.,"New York, NY",6,174,2

4.0,12/11/2009,"I thought this place was awesome. It was pretty small. think long communal table that probably seats 20 people at most and one table that seats 6 people in the front. The restaurant was under construction so I don't know if it used to be larger or will be larger in the future. I don't recommend this for big groups just because of the seating arrangement.

It ranges from $21-22/per person for paella, with min of 2 people.It came out to about $47/per person after tax/tip.. which isn't bad for a pitcher of sangria and a huge skillet of paella that could have easily fed 3-4 people.",0,0,0,Valerie S.,"New York, NY",223,283,0

3.0,11/8/2009,"Socarrat does paella well, but its staff needs to do a better job of managing customers' expectations.My friend and I arrived here at 5:50 on a Saturday night, hoping to make an 8:00 show in midtown. I was a little surprised that the restaurant was full so early in the evening, and that there would be what they billed as a 25-30 minute wait. But it's a popular place, and we figured we had a lot of time to work with, so we got a drink elsewhere and waited for the maitre d' to call us. It was when we got back to the restaurant that the problems began. First of all, the place itself is cramped and stressful simply to stand in. This is not atypical for a trendy Manhattan restaurant, and they are currently building a wine bar next door that will hopefully alleviate the problem. So it's a minor issue. More than the design, it was the constant false reassurances from the staff that bothered me. After the 25-30 minute wait time had elapsed, and after waiting uncomfortably in line for a while (and ordering our paella in advance), I inquired as to when we'd be seated, and was told ""5-10 minutes."" Then we were told that the table we were waiting for had already paid their check, which turned out not to be true. Then the owner--at least I think he was the owner--said ""5-10 minutes"" again. When our table was finally ready--about forty minutes after it was supposed to be--he looked at me and, annoyingly, said something to the effect of ""Smile, the world looks so much better when you smile."" (I couldn't tell if he was encouraging me to smile, which is one of my least favorite things in the world, or whether I smiled because my table was finally ready, and he was reacting to that.) In any case, it's a lot easier to smile when you're not getting crappy, misleading service. Service at the table was perfectly fine, except that when our paella hadn't arrived after a while and I informed our waitress that we actually had to leave soon (by this point it was 7:25), our paella magically appeared, immediately. Had it just been sitting there? I don't know, but given the rest of our experience, I wouldn't be surprised. In the end, the paella took something like 50-55 minutes to arrive after ordering, when they had repeatedly said it would be 30.Apparently I wasn't alone in my concern about the wait times, because when we left, somebody was arguing with the owner outside about the same issues. Something tells me this happens a lot at Socarrat.The reason the place gets three stars instead of worse is that the food was quite good (though not amazing). The Arroz Negro was solid, and the actual socarrat--the rice that sticks to the pan--lived up to its billing. The pan con tamace was excellent, and the sangria tasty. But overall, because of the seemingly willful ineptness of the staff, the experience was not that enjoyable. At least we (barely) made it to our show.",2,0,0,Axel F.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,20,0

4.0,10/18/2009,"""When you get to know me, you will love me"" *What else could be than love. Left wall in the back of Socarrat you will see this sentence that happen to be in front of me while I was getting dinner. Obviously, I'm not talking about loving me. Love to Socarrat, the toasted and crunchy burned rice in the bottom of a Paella which concentrate all the flavors, happening only when you use the best quality ingredients, and the clear sign that has been done right, along the juicy top layer containing vegetables and your selected meat: seafood, animal meat or both. Love to Socarrat Paella Bar, who worth the name, worth the waiting time and worth the mandatory socializing intimacy coming from the maximum capacity of around 30 people seated all together in a large common table. Soft lights, wine cellar deco, with wine as the other main element, and Paella scents filling the air, will create the right ambiance where you will enjoy the tradition of one of the most popular Spanish dishes. But as well as love will be a fact, is also a fact that you better go with a small group: 2-4 people. A fact that you will have to wait 1h - 2h or maybe more. That Lolo will do his best to accommodate you, writing your name and cell phone number in the list to call you once your space is available. Your phone will sounds 15 min before they can take your party; order the Paella/s at this moment and so you can gain some time. Paella takes time to be done. In the mean time, just go somewhere else. I saw they will open soon a wine bar in the next door.. ahhh love when people is so clever. But until then, just Yelp any other options. Miguel and Amaya attended our party of 5 people. They were efficient, very friendly and kindly explained all the questions that we had. Miguel even showed us the rigth way to serve the rice. And they were crazy busy. For beginners, my recommendation is the Seafood Paella (Paella de pescado y marisco) and Black Rice (Arroz negro) the tasty and delicious Paella where the ink from squid is used. A second visit match perfectly well with Paella Valenciana and Fideua, where short noodles are used instead rice. For advancers just get the Fideua negra de coditos (Black Fideua) and any other that you haven't try yet.... my friends I'm still in the medium grade. 1 paella is enough for 2. 2 paellas was also enough for 5. Sangria or wine and some tapas is something that you will want to experience as well. Tapas at Socarrat belongs to the ones that keep traditional flavors with sophistication coming from the presentation and the quality of the ingredients. We choosed this time Tortilla Española, of course, and the special tapas served that night : Riazor clams (Navajas) , Octopus ""a la gallega"" (pulpo con cachelos) and Suckling pig (Cochinillo) . Tortilla as simple as mix sliced potatoes and onion boiled in olive oil with eggs; simple but not that easy. The one at Socarrat is my fave version, the one with the juicy inside coming from the not totally cooked egg.  The Riazor clams are also as simple as sauteed the animal in a pan with some olive oil, kosher salt and some lemon juice drops just right before to eat it. The key: fresh ingredients. I skipped the Suckling pig but take a look to the shoot and left your mouth water for a little. The Octopus was excellent. Tender, juicy, tasty and with the part that I most love, eventually you will bit some kosher salt grain sign of the real recipe.   passion or true love? I'm suspecting that this is real love but consistency is the key, so my 5 will have to wait a little bit more until a second visit, until to reach the advance grade .. such a sacrifice.

The restaurant itself is very small, but I like the group style of seating everyone at one long table while maintaining a fancy dining feel. The servers are very friendly as well, and helpful in choosing an accompanying wine for your order.

2.0,8/22/2009,"This is a poor excuse of what people told me to be the 'best paella bar' in NYC. Simply put if you have never experienced a great paella you will like it. If you're from Spain, have been to Spain, or know what a real paella is, it will just be okay. The paella de mariscos had good color and smell but it completely lacked that fresh sea flavor that a paella de mariscos should have. The rice was cooked alright but was overshadowed by the lack of flavor. When I went they had a special of pimientos de padron. Being from Galicia this is something I really miss. These were actually pretty good and salted well however the quality of the peppers was not up to par. The brandada de bacalao was embarrassing. It resembled a potato puree with barely any cod fish. Also the quality of the olives which were served as an appetizer was less than appealing. In fact it was down right pedestrian. So much so that you could see where the olives had been pressed up and bruised inside the jar. The wine list was okay but I've seen non-spanish restaurants boast a much better spanish wine list. Additionally their selection of albarinos was lacking and both bottles which they had I had to send back due to their lack of quality.",4,1,2,Christian A.,"Chicago, IL",225,15,2
3.0,8/20/2009,"There were things about Socarrat that I really liked and others that got under my skin. Here it goes:Pros:- Great paella (many different options between meat, fish, veggie)- Cute atmosphere (the restaurant is one long table and one round table in the front)- Pretty delicious sangriaCons:- We waited over an hour for a table even though they said only 25-30 minutes (Not okay!!!! They did give us free glasses of sangria to apologize though)- The paella is $21-$25 per person....a little pricey for greasy rice with a bit of meat/fish...no?- The shrimp appetizer was not good at all...i have had much better elsewhereI must say I do want to give this place another chance. Although it is more than I would want to spend on paella and tapas, I do think the abnormally long wait was an unfortunate circumstance that left a bad taste in my mouth.

Incredibly flavorful  filled with different meats and seafood.  I would definitely return if I'm in the Chelsea area.I also thoroughly enjoyed the service and atmosphere.  While most restaurants dont really pay attention to the younger crowd (18-21) , our servers were excellent, attentive and answered all our questions.  The atmosphere is unique with its long communal style table,  however we were able to meet our friendly neighboring diners.basically, I love paella now :)",0,0,0,Eileen J.,"New York, NY",40,185,0
4.0,8/7/2009,"After reading some mixed reviews, we still wanted Paella.  They don't take reservations; we met at 6:45pm and was told by our hostess about 10-15 minutes wait.  A half hour later, Geoffrey (the manager) asked us to wait a few minutes more but now inside and with a free glass of Sangria - fine with me!  He also offered to start cooking our choice of Paella so we needn't wait longer once seated - brilliant!  The seating is unusual; one very long narrow bar in the middle of the room, two people would sit across and face each other from either side.  Odd numbered parties or groups larger than 4 may wait longer to be seated, but Geoffrey is a master at this!  If your party is not complete, you won't be on the list to be seated, so arrive all together!  It's a small dining room only holding about 30 people; but the food is delicious and absolutely worth the wait.  The banter makes it loud inside, so can be hard to hear your waitress recite the specials.  If you like red wine, try the Muruve Tinta de Toro ($40), it pairs so well with Paella - yummy!  We had Paella Socarrat (2@$21) and two starters: Razor Clams and Shrimps Ajillo ($10 ea).  For dessert, we shared Flan ($8).  Two satisfied diners, total bill less than $120 (tax included but not tip).  About the same bill as any ""Restaurant Week"" meal if ordering wine with the $35 prix fixe.  The Paella has subtle flavors; instinctively you search for lemon to sprinkle the seafood, and salt and pepper for the rice.  Have restraint and give in to the pure magnificence that the chef's ingredients will impart.  The clams were the tiniest bit gritty; but if you've ever had them before, that's a common problem as they're hard to clean.  But they were grilled to absolute perfection!  The shrimps (very fresh) were sizzling in olive oil and garlic and came with baguette wafers. It became quite clear that now was the time to break the low carb rule, simply heavenly!  The Flan brought back childhood memories of when I first tried egg custard pastry in Chinatown - gorgeous!  We left very happily wanting to visit again soon and try the other special Paellas!!  ;-)",1,0,1,Gilbert W.,"Brooklyn, NY",377,27,4

2.0,7/28/2009,"Meh!I always walked by this place and its packed every time.  Curiosity finally made me go there on a relatively slow early evening weekday and the wait was not so inhumane.  Still you have to sit on the oh-so-trendy bar stool like when you can't get a table at a regular restaurant with strangers just inches away from you.  (maybe this style of seating is appealing to many people who flock to and love this place?  besides,  they make you wait so long you get so hungry that anything is delicious!).  This ""communal style"" seating could be good or bad, depending on who you end up next to.  In other typical Spanish tapas bars I went to in Spain, the seating is often similar to this but the whole place should be open and airy, not cramped like this.   This place really tries to push the authenticity agenda which I find sort of ridiculous.The service was efficient (if not too efficient and rushed?).  I wouldn't say its pleasant or ""mood-inducing"". Remember you are already kinda straining your upper body to stay on the stool as it is!  I imagine the service might be even more rushed or even erratic when they are very busy...So, on to the food!!  the small plates (tapas) were quite yummy--and pricing was a little high but appropriate for this area.The paella was just blah.  Maybe I'm not a paella expert but I had quite a few excellent paella in Spain and it was not quite like what they serve here.  Seems like here they just throw a couple shrimps and bits of mussels on top the the rice, rather than cooking in it. The bottom crust was ok and the rest of the rice was soso and quite salty.  (more than usual?)  If you want more authentic Spanish food/paella, go to Cafe Riazor just few blocks south.All in all this is not a bad place for tapas but I probably won't go back given there are so many other choices with better cooking and service/seating than this place.",1,0,0,Pong C.,"Manhattan, NY",163,127,21

4.0,7/21/2009,"We had heard words of warning about wait times and were wary. Arrived around 8 p.m. on Sunday and saw a couple couples waiting outside the full, small dining area, which had the front doors open, making it seem a bit larger and airier than it is. we were immediately rubbed the wrong way when we stepped just inside the door and were rather abruptly halted -- nearly scolded. then when the scolder finished his conversation and led us outside, he, seemingly suddenly in a hurry, nearly wedged the two of us in the doorway by trying to rush past. and that was really the last negative part of our experience at socarrat. the scolder quickly compensated for a rough start and completely won us over. a perfectly charming lad, turns out. the waiters were attentive without being overbearing, and personable enough without being faux friendly. and the wait was reasonable, especially considering that they took our paella order while we were waiting, since it takes around 30 min. to prepare.as for the food ... croquetas del dia: on this particular dia, the croquetas were chorizo. i have to say that i have rarely, if ever, been disappointed with croquettes, and these were no exception (though i probably wouldn't describe them as 'exceptional' either, except in the sense that i just did ... except, except, except ...). suckling pig tapas special: a 2.5 x 2.5 x 1 inch slab of moist, tender pork with a thin sheet of perfectly crispy crispiness on top. square sat atop a mound of goodness -- sauteed spinach and a roasted potato round -- and a puddle of savory sluice.socarrat paella: so flavorful. no one component stood out as being the star of the dish, but the combination of everything packed a wallop. the menu lists chunks of chicken, fish & beef, shrimp, cuttle fish, green beans, mussels and cockle clams. we had fava beans instead of green beans, which is all the better, in my book. the socarrat, itself, while generally adding a nice crunchy texture, was, in places, so hard and crispy that i was concerned about dental damage.had a glass of wine (El Somo, 2006: Tempranillo, Rioja), which i settled on after the waiter let me sample a few different bottles they had available by the glass, and then some sangria, which i put in the same category as croquettes: good, as it should be; difficult to botch.",0,0,0,jason r.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,5,0

5.0,7/1/2009,"I love this restaurant - it is one (if not the best) paella places I have ever been to in NY. And ever since I had it in Spain a few years ago, I have been obsessed with finding good paella. I've actually been here a few times (yesterday was my 4th time, I believe) to satisfy any random weekday paella cravings... so I figure it's the perfect place for my first review. So here we go. The no reservation system hasn't really bothered me, but I've only visited during the week, generally a 5 - 20 min wait. But if you are trying to go with a group of 4+ during normal dinner hours, it may be a long wait. I love the décor and the way they have managed to maximize what is really a tinytinytiny space. The communal table is pretty snug and you manage to be a part of your neighbors' conversations whether you want to or not. But it's a home-y feel - almost like a nice dinner party at a friend's apt. The service varies depending on your waiter and although it does feel pushy at times, I'm assuming it's because there has always been a wait. But it has never been enough to bother me (maybe because the paella is so good?) and we've even been served complimentary desserts a few times! I've had most of the tapas on the menu and standouts include: the fried artichokes, the braised pork belly, the garlic shrimp, and an eggplant salad they had as a special. Although their tapas aren't amazing - tia pol is probably better - they are good. But the main attraction is really the paella. Most of the other paellas I've had in NY/US have been soggy, overcooked, and bland. I would recommend going with a group of 4 or 5 and getting 1 rice paella and 1 fideua paella - I usually go for the paella de pescado y mariscos (seafood) or the fideua negra de corditos (squid ink). I had fideua paella for the first time here (it's a paella from the Valencia region) and fell in love.

There is one standalone round table that's by the window.  It's crowded and waiters are always zooming around along both sides of the bar.We tried a few appetizers here, I wasn't too impressed with those.  The croquettas were gummy, an indication of overwhipped potatoes.  The braised pork belly was tender enough but I would probably not order them again next time.  The lamb chops were fresh and prepared well but they weren't very memorable and again, I would probably not order them again next time.The paella though, that was a totally different story.  We ordered the Arroz Negro.  It was DELICIOUS!!!!  It didn't look particularly appetizing or bountiful at first because it seemed to have just a few sad pieces of seafood and peppers strewn around.But it smelled SOOOO good.  And when you finally taste it, my goodness!!!

What textures!!!  And between two people, you'd definitely be more than full by just that dish alone.  The texture of the rice was soo good too.  It was crispy but it wasn't gummy nor get stuck in your teeth like how rice crust can be sometimes.  And every grain was bursting with flavor.  The shrimp that's served in this dish by the way was quite large and fresh.Overall I'd say just go with the paella and forget about the tapas.  The Paella Valencia looked pretty good too.",0,0,0,Princess M.,"New York, NY",33,337,591

The waiters were friendly and attentive right off the bat. For an appetizer, we ordered the calamari which was pretty good but not the best. The paella we ordered was the meat paella and that is the MOST FLAVORFUL dish I've had in the longest time. It's a little sweet and a little spicy, but the flavor just punches you in the mouth in the best way possible. it costs $24 but it serves two people and the serving is huge.Plus, the atmosphere is very warm and communal.

(Me, thinking no elbow to elbow seating on the communal table OR waiting, yay!).Sadly, they were VERY nazi (and quite frankly, annoying!) about seating even though the restaurant was completely empty.  They were very anal about where we put our bags, how we sit, where EXACTLY to sit.  The man made me move one seat down by saying ""Ladies, your waitress put your plate setting there for a reason"".  And I almost fell off the barstool top because of it!  UGH... Anyways, by gones, they sat us in the middle of the long communal table, face to face, which was fine. After much commotion, we sat down, tried to catch up in conversation but was sadly interrupted... a lot!  They are definitely in a rush to take your order, feed you, and take your money.  They weren't very informative with their menu (and trust me, they had a lot of GOOD stuff on there) and just overall, inappropriate.  After we had made a dent on the paella, and just sat there digesting our food over conversation, the waitress came over to help you scrape off the paella to ""help"" you finish it.  I thought, wow, thanks for putting in the elbow grease!  But then few minutes later she came by again to see if she can help put it on our plates... so we can eat and get the EFF out! I'm kidding, she didn't say that.  But she quickly asked if we'd like to get it to-go and its small enough to fit in our purses.  SNEAKY SNEAKY!  After that I had enough, and paid with cash and peaced on outta there.They are really lucky that their food was delicious, but expensive.  We ordered the black squid paella and pork belly as appetizer.  Both very very well made and simply delicious and something I'd definitely crave.  Some yelpers had wrote that they liked the communal seating because they were able to socialize with others who were touching elbows... unfortunately we had old non-English speaking tourists sitting next to us and pointing at our food throughout the end of time.  It would have been nice if we had hot Germans next to us who worked in TV...I will definitely NOT return because in this scenario, the service/ambience superceded the awesomeness of the porkbelly.  And you know how deep my love runs for fat.... that says a lot.",2,1,1,Emma L.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",138,373,168

4.0,4/12/2009,"I'm still up on the fence whether I like restaurants that are reservation based or walk-in only. Either I wait forever or I'm not seated at all. Well this is another restaurant that doesn't take reservations . Again the long wait did not detour me. The projected wait is 45 mins. Not a problem, cause the host takes your cell # and lets you roam around till you can be seated. Almost like a pager, but without being restrained to the vicinity. My girlfriend and I ordered the Arroz Negro paella. The black stained rice (from the squid ink) is cooked perfectly and the seafood is fresh. My only suggestion is when the paella arrives, let it sit or eat in small portions so the rice can sear on the bottom for a nice crunchy and flavorful layer. Also add the butter that comes with this paella! It adds a great creamy texture. You'll feel like a lard ass, but I promise you it'll be a party in your mouth!This place is pretty pricey. This place quotes prices per person and not by the dish. So if you bring 4 people sharing just one pot of paella (you do the math), prepare to leave hungry and broke. One pot approximately serves 2 people.  Not a great place to bring a big patch of people especially since we are seated on one long table like the last supper.Overall, a great experience.

4.0,4/12/2009,"I initially read about this restaurant in Time Out magazine so i decided to grab my girlfriend and head on over for a late dinner.We did have about a 1/2 hour wait which wasn't as bad as the estimated 45min-1hr that  the chubbby cute little host/ coatcheckman/ bouncer/ waiter had told us. The long bar seating arrangement only adds to the atmosphere and coziness of this place.We ordered the Arroz Negra upon recommendation from our host/bouncer. It wasn't the traditional yellow rice but it was something new and still just as good. I would suggest that when it comes out you only take a small amount and let it sit in the hot pan so the rice can be even more crunchier. Getting one dish is enough to eat for 2 small girls and we weren't overstuffed or filled with food coma, although i wish we were cause it was very yummy.The paella was DELISH!!! the seafood was fresh and the rice was well flavored. They give you a small dish of butter to add to the rice you put onto your plate for a little added creaminess. It was great and the taste was worth the wait and deserving of the hypeThe only reason i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was cause it was very expensive. For that one pan of rice it was $23 per person.

4.0,3/26/2009,"Just thinking about this place makes me drool a little bit (okay, maybe a lot). Like everyone else has mentioned, the downsides are the price and the tiny size of the restaurant. The bright side: delicious deliciousness. Came here on a weekday night, and waited smooshed by the door for maybe 20 minutes. Two of us were seated across from each other at the long, narrow, communal table. The server suggested that we order a few tapas since the paella takes about 30 minutes. We picked three small dishes--I think the croquettes, an octopus dish, and a lamb chops special ($7-$9 each). I honestly can't remember how they were (I think they were fair), because the paella completely steals the show.I chose the Arroz Negro, which features chunks of fish, squid ink, shrimp, squid, and scallops ($38 for two). As the name indicates, this is the ""black"" paella (due to the squid ink) which might weird out some people. Granted, the lighting is fairly dim, so you might not notice anyway. Portions aren't huge--the pan looks large, but it's very shallow; we polished off the whole thing. The total bill for two was almost $80 (incl. tax and tips) without drinks, which is pretty steep, but I'd definitely go back for a special occasion (or maybe when I'm craving paella).Service was genial--the people next to us were ordering wine, and I think service shines particularly in that regard (the waiter bent over backward to find something they liked). Also, this being Chelsea, the male server paid an extreme amount of attention to a group of attractive men (they received help with their coats afterward, whereas we barely received a goodbye).Tip: Socarrat delivers now...but having not taken advantage of this, I have no idea how they can replicate the tasty caramelized rice at the bottom of the pan (as described by the term ""socarrat,"" providing the restaurant's name) on the go.",3,3,1,Serena C.,"New York, NY",37,160,13

It's a long communal table and you will get seated next to people you don't know. That in itself is an adventure. We got seated in the back right at the bar. It was just my husband and I. We got to talk to the bartender who was soo nice. we ordered the Pan tomaca and Patatas bravas for tapas and then the seafood paella. It was definitely good paella, but not the best.

3.0,12/11/2008,"I had a so-so experience here.  Maybe it's because I don't like paella as much as I thought.  Maybe it's because we were crammed in cafeteria-style at a long table running down the restaurant so we were literally rubbing elbows with the folks on either side of us.  Or maybe it's cause my wallet took a pretty big hit, especially from a smaller than average pitcher of sangria.  In any case, the service and atmosphere at Socarrat Paella Bar were good.  The restaurant had a cozy feel with adequate lighting and brick walls and a rustic ambience.  We ordered two tapas (the chorizo and fried artichoke) to start off with and split the Socarrat paella, a large pan of brown rice chock with chicken, beef, fish, clams, mussels and lima beans.  The proteins were tasty but the rice could have been a little less salty.I think what really got me was the seating.  I hadn't actually expected it to be a bar.  Countless times I was distracted by the conversations on either side of me and there was no where for me to leave my purse, so whenever I had to reach for my phone or my wallet I had to get off my tall stool (I'm a short person) and squat down to get my purse from the floor.  If I had been prepared for the ""intimate"" seating and had been wowed by the paella, I might have offered up one more star.  Sorry, Socarrat.",0,0,0,Reshma B.,"New York, NY",122,312,6

Succulent duck and creamy risotto, absolutely great.  The wine was very good as well, not too overbearing.  The paella portion was a little small for the pricing but in terms of taste, was pretty good.  The rice stuck to the bottom of the pan and formed a delicious crust and there was plenty of seafood to go around between the two of us.  The pan took over a majority of the table space and was slightly awkward to navigate eating but as the place cleared a bit, it became less of an issue.  The food was good and I can't complain but at $23 per person for paella, I'd expect a bit more.",1,0,1,Donald E.,"Brooklyn, NY",24,117,0
4.0,11/8/2008,"Talk about great paella.For those who don't know paella is a saffron-flavored Spanish dish made with varying combinations of rice, vegetables, meat, chicken, and seafood and the National dish of Spain.It was my first time having it and it tasted exactly how I imaged good paella taste like. It's saffron based so its very seasoned, so keep that in mind. I had the pork ribs, snail, and rabbit paella and loved it (first time with snails too).It's served in the traditional paella pan, just a very wide oval pan (the word paella derives from the Latin word patella for pan by the way). It's a very traditional method how it's served there. While your towards finishing what's inside the pan, a server comes by to scrape the stuck on rice off the pan and serves it too you, very delicious crunchy rice and seasoning. It's a very small place but I like the intimate set up. The seating is essentially a very long bar table that at the far end is the bartenders set up and the rest is seating.

Hope that made sense.When you order paella, it's made from scratch in these cast iron pans, so from the time you order, it'll be about 25 minutes before you'll see the paella at the table.  Because of the cast iron pans, the paella comes out extremely crispy - if you've ever had bi bim bop in the hot stone bowl, it's the same thing-- rice that has a crispy bottom to the pan.Our server Miguel thought that based upon our tapas order, we should only order paella for 2 and if we wanted more, we could order more.  Here was what we ordered:Tapas:Croquetas Del DiaTocino Con Datiles braised pork belly, roasted potatoes, dates pureeChips BravasCazuelita De Chorizos All tapas was pretty good - the chorizo was REALLY good, reminded me of the chorizo I had in Barcelona.The roasted pork belly was ok, considering how much I love pork belly --I've had much better...Paella: Paella Socarrat Arroz NegroWe had ordered the tapas and the first order of paella and decided we were still hungry, so we ordered another round of chorizo and the paella with squid ink.  (But after waiting for the food, we kinda were less hungry, since we had to wait an add'l 25 minutes.)I preferred the 2nd paella to the first, the first was a little fishy to me (but no one else at the table except for me thought that, so I might just be sensitive to that flavor.)  But I thought the squid ink paella's flavor melded together better - and they had these tender pieces of squid that I really enjoyed.Our server Miguel was really great -- the woman who cleared the plates away and refilled our waters was very sweet -- so service was an A+.I think the tapas was very good - but I'm afraid the crunchy paella wasn't really for me, but I also have to say, I have many friends who love to share bi bim bop with me because I don't really like the crunchy rice but all of my friends think it's the best thing ever...so if you enjoy 'crunchy rice' for lack of a better term, you will probably really enjoy the paella here.",0,0,0,K P.,"New York, NY",73,106,3

While their Paella is good, it's still not great. It is definitely not close to my aunt's and I'm still thinking of the paella at Tapeo.  It didn't change my life but I think my standards are a little high for this dish. Although the potato torta was yummy.With that said, this place is very nice.  The decoration is simple and elegant. I would describe it as rustic posh. It's not overly loud and cozy which makes it very date appropriate as well as a good friend spot.  I wouldn't recommend a large party to a walk-in though.  I'm not too keen on the communal table . I like a bit more elbow room and preferred sitting at the bar.  Besides after a bottle of wine it's fun to start chatting away with the staff.   As mentioned, they do not have their liquor license yet which I actually enjoyed.  I'm a fan of BYOB. I headed to the liquor store on the corner of 8th ave and w.16th.  Try the Malbec from Chile.  I believe the winery begins with an M and the price was $13.99.  Good stuff.

The first thing you notice about Socarrat is that it's decor and layout are original. The restaurant is composed of one long and narrow room with one very long and high glass table. Even though the four of us sat together, it felt like we were eating with 30 people who we didn't know... sort of like at a distant relatives Thanksgiving feast. Personally... I really dug the vibe. It felt like we were in some chef's living room.For the 4 of us we ordered 6 tapas and a 3-person meat paella. The tapas were all good but none were extremely memorable. I personally loved the chorizo but I am sucker for little weenies. The paella was definitely tasty and worthy of the name Soccarat. If you didn't know (and I didn't until I ate there), soccarat is the caramelized crust of rice that  sticks to the bottom of the pan. It is the ""best part"" of a well-made paella. Now I like paella but even really good paella doesn't impress me as much some other foods. If you like good paella I think you will really like this place.
