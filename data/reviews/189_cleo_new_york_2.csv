4.0,4/30/2019,Really Great service. The cocktail I had was incredible it was a play on a sidecar but with banana and I have been dreaming about it. The hummus was delectable. My only issue was the atmosphere was a little too hotel-y for me. Like the restaurant had a rug and I find that weird. Otherwise a terrific meal.,1,0,0,Alyssa K.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",485,11,2
4.0,4/29/2019,Went here for my birthday dinner. They gave us a glass of champagne to toast our meal. This was a great welcome treat. The food was excellent. I ordered the sea scallops which were incredible. There were only three on the plate which was a small serving but I was full by the end of the meal. We also got a side of the brussels sprouts and the hummus appetizer both of which were very good. I had a glass of wine as did my husband. The service was impeccable. The restaurant itself was quite empty however the bar was very busy. They look of the place was very clean and crisp. Also the bread pudding dessert was very good.,0,0,0,Molly F.,"Manhattan, NY",69,50,1

5.0,4/13/2019,Wow .....if your looking for a great atmosphere that may be the most welcoming in the city stop at Cleo. Â Starting with Jimmy the bartender.....your welcomed with an expertly made cocktail where you can also get some great snacks. But most of all Jimmy interacts with everyone at the bar and soon everyone is chatting exchanging stories and that's what makes Cleo a must visit place.

5.0,4/12/2019,"The Cleo Miami location was one of my favorite restaurants ever with amazing food and even better service! When that location closed, I was SO disappointed. When I found out they were opening a NY location, I was absolutely thrilled and hoped it would live up to the standards of the Miami location. My boyfriend and I were excited to celebrate our 7 year anniversary at Cleo and noted in the reservation that we were celebrating a special occasion. From the start, our waiter went above and beyond to make the dinner one that we would not forget! The service was impeccable- he took our order promptly and then surprised us with a glass of champagne. The food was amazing, especially the steak kebabs, Brussels sprouts, and zucchini chips. The shrimp was a little lackluster, but definitely didn't hold it against them since the balance of the meal was incredible. Cocktails were well crafted and flavorful, as well. Next, the waiter treated us to two complimentary desserts and a handwritten note congratulating us on our anniversary. All VERY thoughtful and outside of the scope of what a typical restaurant would do to help celebrate a special occasion. We will 1000% be back and will recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to have a wonderful dining experience! Thank you Cleo NY!",0,0,0,Katie G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,3,0
1.0,4/12/2019,"I am truly shocked that this place has over 4 stars. I came here for breakfast and it was a disappointing experience from the moment I walked through the door...where I was not acknowledged (there were maybe 2 other parties dining at the time). So after waiting, I sat myself. At least 3 different people walked by me but ignored me and so after about 5 minutes I walked up to the host stand and helped myself to a menu. After about 7 minutes someone finally came over where I proceeded to order an American Breakfast and a Bellini and was told ""not sure if we can do the Bellini"". A normal person would assume that the waiter would go check on the Bellini, determine if they had the ingredients and then report back to me to see if there was something else i wanted. But no, they continued to ignore me. I wasn't offered water. I wasn't offered coffee. This is just standard for breakfast service!! I finally received the food and had to flag down the waiter for Salt and pepper shakers and ketchup....and he just kept walking by me. Waterless, coffeeless me. After my meal was 90% finished, the ketchup came. At which point he informed me that the Bellini wasn't possible. 45 minutes later?! Thanks shithead.

2.0,4/9/2019,"I was very excited to try Cleo until we actually sat down and we're not greeted by staff for 10+ minutes. The food was extremely subpar and over priced. The greek salad was cut with small cucumbers, grape tomatoes??? and a bit of feta. For a Mediterranean restaurant they really need to take a moment to understand Mediterranean food. Again the staff did not come refill drinks once.... or take our plates. I had to request more water and the bill after sitting there for 20 min.

I've only been once for brunch, but that was enough to form a great opinion.I bought a great pulsd deal for 2 people for bottomless brunch - with unlimited drinks (mimosas and spritzes - their bellinis are beyond amazing). Firstly, the ambience is amazing - it's well lit, high ceilings, and there's a nice dj playing fun 2000s music. The dj was great, but it's not too loud like some places can get. The service is also really great. They are very attentive with refilling drinks, and making sure you are okay.And lastly - the food. We started with the hummus, which was delicious warm pita with a small bowl of delicious hummus. I also got the smoked salmon benedict - highly recommended. Lastly, a small part was also the toast which for some reason was amazing, thick cut bread. Overall, highly recommended. My new go-to brunch spot",0,0,0,Kendra C.,"New York, NY",57,183,541

4.0,3/2/2019,"Came for dinner on a weekday night on a whim. This is a modern restaurant with a cool upscale decor. Perfect for a date with your significant other or a cocktail with friends. We tried a whole bunch of food. We started with the mussels and greek salad. Mussels are not usually my thing but these were pretty solid. Good flavor in the sauce. Â The greek salad was a pretty straightforward dish and it tasted like you would expect.For dinner we had the couscous with veggies which was a simple dish but was seasoned well. The chicken in a stew pot was delicious and had good flavor. The one negative was that the fries were very salty. They were thin fries and had a good crisp but were incredibly salty. The roasted cauliflower more than made up for it with a solid flavor and perfectly roasted flavor. The food was enjoyable and it came out in a timely fashion.Service was good and the server deserves a lot of credit for that. Â Overall, I am a little confused on the cuisine. Not sure if it is mediterrean or middle eastern. I think it needs to pick one type of cuisine and master it. That being said the food was not bad at all. I would come back here and the ambiance more than made up for any missteps which were very few anyway. Good work Cleo!",21,7,22,Nicholas G.,"Hoboken, NJ",4367,1076,2695

The hostess and server were extremely friendly and helpful with all of the questions we had throughout our time there (regarding ingredients that were in dishes). Totally going back just for the ricotta agnolotti. So creamy, perfect amount of cheesiness, and such a savory dish with subtle hints of sweetness; I'm salivating just thinking of how good it was! I also found their shoe string styled French fries that came with their trademark burger pretty noteworthy. Ended up staying a bit past their closure, but didn't feel rushed which was nice. Thanked the hostess for allowing us to stay the extra 15 minutes as we finished our wine and went home totally happy that we tried a new spot.",0,0,0,Shanna M.,"Kingsbridge, Bronx, NY",152,10,0

3.0,1/13/2019,"I made a reservation for brunch with a friend on a Sunday morning at 11am. We decided to try this place out after we bought a Travelzoo voucher. Brunch for 2, meaning one app, two entrees up to $24 and two mimosas for $39. Cleo is connected to a hotel and we were greeted by two doormen. The restaurant was pretty empty besides two other parties. It was super quiet, which made catching up with my friend enjoyable.They were able to seat us early which I appreciated. We started with two mimosas. I thought the mimosa was a good balance of champagne and orange juice. If you are a non-pulp orange juice fan then you will not like this mimosa. Mimosas are $5. The menu had brunch and lunch options mostly ranging between $15-25. We decided on the hummus as our app. I got the hash and eggs and my friend ordered the mushroom omelet. None of the brunch options really stood out to me; pretty basic. The hummus was delicious; served with four large pieces of pita. My hash and eggs was seasoned well and my friend enjoyed her omelet. At the end of our meal, we were only responsible for tax and tip. For all that we got, I felt this deal was worth it for $20/person.The service was good. Multiple servers and managers checked on us, gave recommendations, and refilled our water glasses. A DJ started playing around noon when we were leaving.

Â So for instance, the gratuity + tax was $60 for 2 of us because they had us drinking 5 mimosas each over the 2 hour period. Â I liked the mimosas but not that much.

We asked the waiters if they could make some adjustments, and they asked me why I didn't look at the menu before buying the package. Because there WAS NO MENU!

We started with the zucchini chips and hummus which were both the best things we ordered hands down. I would come back and only order small plates next time, as it seems this is where they excel. I got a Greek salad and added a chicken skewer which was an extra $12! I found this to be absurd as it comes with only 1 skewer of about 4 small pieces of meat. The salad was good but very small. My mom got chicken skewers and a side of basmati rice. She said the chicken was very bland and had to use the hummus we had ordered as well as a side of tzatziki to give it more flavor. Also, the chicken skewer entree comes with just 2 skewers and no sides. For $23 that seems insanely high. at least have rice on the side or something to work with.Overall, I really wanted to love this place as it is close by, but won't be running back.",2,1,2,Jackie W.,"New York, NY",66,82,28

4.0,12/17/2018,"We came for brunch Saturday around 12:30pm- solid option and good for catching up in a relatively quiet atmosphere with no wait. Brunch dishes we had were standard but executed well. Boyfriend got the American breakfast (which he gets everywhere haha) and it came with three eggs and a relatively generous helping of bacon. My egg white frittata looked super healthy (read, potentially not tasty) but the feta in it was awesome and made the dish still enjoyable. Could have used maybe a couple more tomatoes though...only 2-3 little cherry tomatoes on my plate haha but maybe they're meant more as a garnish? Overall I wouldn't seek it out but it's a solid option if you need a last minute brunch spot on the east side to catch up with friends.

5.0,6/22/2018,"I came here for the first time mid-May and have been back 4 other times (It's June 22)... LOVE this place. I dream of their Brussels sprouts ($12) and their Vinebury Cocktail (spicy vodka drink-$15). I've tried the hummus, lebaneh and babaganoush and would recommend them in that order (hummus was the best; all $9-$10). They come with 3 little pieces of bread and charge for more those which is annoying.The Saffron Chicken tagines and Spciy Cigars are delicious. Potato latkes and Zucchini chips are so-so.BUT SERIOUSLY- get the sprouts. They are life",1,0,0,Hillary B.,"New York, NY",8,132,51

1.0,4/28/2018,"A possible neighborhood gem gone bad... loved Cleo in Miami but this one isn't remotely close to the one in Miami. The food quality isn't the same, the vibe and the service either. The place is boring compared to the Miami one. The hotel is also very strange and confusing. I don't understand how this place can be night and day compared to other Cleo's and still be a Cleo. The only good food we had was the ravioli. Everything was basically served cold. The tangine looks more beautiful than it tastes unfortunately; everything was over salted and seasoned, it was overpowering. The wine list is very sad too and I was very disappointed and surprised. Desserts are a joke; unimaginative and wayyyyy too sweet. Service was terrible. Not one person checked on us after we got our meal. Didn't come back until we were done and only asked us if we wanted dessert. Don't come here if you have been to the other Cleos.",1,0,0,Mike P.,"Laguna Beach, CA",361,144,13

Food was great for sharing - had many of the starters (hummus, babaganoush, lebaneh+feta was our favorite). Also loved the spanakopita - light and flakey. The sticky toffee pudding was better than expected and the yogurt panna cotta had a firm texture almost like a lighter cheesecake that was quite nice!",0,0,0,Saraporn V.,"Manhattan, NY",1,7,5

5.0,2/16/2018,"Visited Valentine Day (2018) for dinnerWe were in South Beach last year and had our Valentine dinner at Cleo's down there in SoBe. We really enjoyed our meal a lot and were told by our waiter (Luis) that one was coming to NYC. So in preparation for Valentine Day, the Mrs. suggested Cleo's NYC (since we ate at one last year) and sure enough had opened this past November. Here too, all the food was pretty terrific, as was the service... prompt and courteous. The lebnah with feta, the 'spicy cigars', the brussel sprouts and the hummus all very very good. We also shared the skirt steak appetizer and the Moroccan lamb. Everything was just the right amount of spicy and yummy! But if I had to choose, we liked the meal down in SoBe just a little bit more. Maybe they gave bigger portions or the the Miami beach air... I don't know, just something a tiny bit better down in SoBe. Â The only thing negative I would have to say about Cleo's (NYC) it's regarding the markup on their wine. Most restaurants without ""BYOB"" mark up their wines 100 to 200 percent... annoying, but ok, it's business. So we ordered the Don Miguel Gascon, an Argentine malbec I happen to be familiar with and can walk into my Bottle King right now and buy a bottle for $14.99... $10.99 on sale. For any restaurant to charge me $60 for a $10 - $15 bottle ($15 a glass - that's a 400 percent markup!) I think, is pretty outrageous... and that was one of the cheaper wines. That aside, I really do like Cleo's. Fortunately we live in Jersey and have restaurants equal to and better those in NYC for any cuisine... AND... we can bring our own bottle of wine, a real plus!",0,0,0,Conrad B.,"Wayne, NJ",8,318,15

2.0,1/28/2018,"Food was 5 Star but service was a zero.. we ordered the ravioli, brussel sprouts, branzino and the meatball tangine.. Sat down and only after 15 minutes were asked if we wanted to order drinks and appetizers. We quickly put in the order for our drinks and a couple apps as instructed and figured our server would come back with the drinks and take our order for the mains. 20 mins later no drinks and still no one came to take the rest of our order.. then the ravioli came out when we still had our menus covering the table and still no drinks.. this was about 30 mins in, at this point I would have walked out if the ravioli wasn't so good.. so had to track our server down who had mysteriously disappeared for 15 minutes to order our mains and check on our drinks, which incidentally been sitting at the bar for 20 mins.. and she still didn't take away our menus (or write our order down). So after another long wait the branzino came out (yes we never got our second appetizer, the Brussels sprouts) followed by the tagine. Both were really excellent, the branzino was cooked perfectly and served on a delicious bed of Cous cous and the tagine Ooozed flavor and tenderness. But seriously the service was so bad and no apology or explanation or anything. We ended up not wanting to take the risk of trying to order dessert with a server who doesn't write anything down and asked a different server to cancel our brussel sprouts and we got the check.In conclusion I have never seen such a disconnect between the quality of the food and the quality of the service.. I don't know if they are understaffed or the wait staff is under trained, but my oh my I don't know how they take correct orders without writing anything down at the minimum, hence the missing items.",3,0,0,Julian S.,"New York, NY",213,3,1
1.0,1/27/2018,"No. Just no. Avoid this place. We were a group of 5 with a 7:30pm dinner reservation. We ordered standard fare -- all cold dishes except for 3 skewers and a tagine. An hour later, no food arrived. We followed up with our waiter and the manager who didn't seem remotely fazed by the delay. The skewers (main courses for 3/5 of the table) came out before the appetizers. We had to recite our order to the manager because everything was missing. The chicken was absolutely inedible. The entire dreadful experience took over 2 hours. The manager was not remotely sympathetic and had the gall to charge us in full for the whole meal on the first try. We asked for an accommodation and got a slight adjustment. Good service would be a sincere apology both from the waiter and the manager, at least one round of comped drinks, or just something! We left hungry after paying a lot of money for an inedible and slow meal with terrible, slow service.",0,0,0,Jules S.,"Manhattan, NY",67,176,1
3.0,1/16/2018,"Love Cleo in Miami, so I had to try once it opened in NY. Went the first night was very happy with the food. However, the service was very spotty. I've been back twice since then, still love the food but seem to have very slow service and the restaurant is not that crowed. This past visit the waitress, forgot plates, didn't fill the water, we had to track her down to grab out drinks that had been sitting at the bar for 20 mins, desert took 40 mins and place was empty. Not sure if I'll spend the money again to have bad service. If you're willing to wait, the food is very good.",0,0,0,Rose A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,12,4

4.0,12/17/2017,"Limited review as we just came for dessert and cocktails. We were staying at the Mondrian so it was a convenient spot after coming back from dinner. Wasn't very crowded on a Friday night and no Yelp reviews yet, so maybe they're still too new. Nice ambiance with comfy seats and quirky art on the walls similar to the hotel. We had 2 drinks, the Mezcal Mule and the Lotus Flower. The Mule was the better of the drink but at least it didn't seem like they skimp on the alcohol amount. For dessert, we got a Flourless Chocolate Cake and Bread Pudding. We husband crushed the bread pudding so fast and started trying to steal mine that I didn't get to try it but I assume that signifies it being good. Or that he was pretty drunk. My chocolate cake was very similar to a chocolate lava cake without the lava and tasted quite good. A good night cap!",0,0,0,Katie D.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",471,598,953
