2.0,4/7/2019,Brunch is way too much Money for the food & 3 drinks. The appetizers were good but the other food not so much. I got the steak & eggs. The steak was very hard. Service was good but definitely not worth the money at All. Came here for my friends brunch over priced. The outside view is great but it smells if you are there longer than 5 minutes.

1.0,3/31/2019,"After waiting an entire hour and 15 minutes after our reserved time, and spending over $2,000 in this POS of an establishment, our party was told that we had to move to a lounge area because other people wanted to sit and eat. Half of the restaurant was empty during this time, but our party was still told that we needed to move. Not to mention that half of the orders for food arrived 30 minutes after the rest of the party, cold, and down right DISGUSTING, there were no apologies or accommodations from them. The bills came out quicker than the food! The staff was super unprofessional. 20% gratuity for what? It is safe to say that I will NEVER come back to this dump.

My point exactly, he should not be at the door greeting people with his despicable attitude. Then I speak about the bad reviews On ""YELP"" he then goes to say that you can not believe ""YELP"".

We were also told that we had to pay $15 per person for those who didn't show up. Once we were at the table we were basically rushed throughout dinner and told that if we wanted to stay longer we had to go to the bar. We were there with teenagers how are we going to go to the bar?

This was completely frustrating considering i had pre-planed arrangements with my birthday group after dinner - those plans had to be cancelled. I also had to keep checking in when we were going to be seated (an update would have been nice to keep my party at ease). We were hangry at this point. The food and dj was good, but i won't be returning. I've been here plenty of times and never dealt with this issue. The wait game really put a sour taste in my mouth. Who wants to leave a birthday dinner after 1am when the reservation was at 9p? We also weren't accommodated for the long wait after spending over $1000. We didn't get a free bottle or pitcher or anything - quite ridiculous. I also felt rushed to eat. Servers were taking plates so fast and didn't refill our waters.

3.0,3/15/2019,"I have been to Sofrito for both Brunch and Dinner and have very different opinions on both. I'll start with Dinner being that it is my only positive review. The mofongo here is BOMB. I've tried the pork one, the shrimp one (favorite) and they have both, at all times, been cooked to perfection. The shrimp one has this delicious garlic sauce that I can just live in lol. It's usually relatively empty for dinner and I definitely recommend it. Now Brunch, I have come here for several occasions, birthdays etc and can say that the service, food quality and quality in general has deteriorated from about two years ago to now. To start, they no longer do bottomless brunch - which I feel is what kept the people coming. Although its considered a party brunch and the vibe is great, three mimosas at sucha pricey cost? Not worth it - ESPECIALLY since the food isn't even that great anymore. I did not even finish my meal, if I'm being honest. I had the baby paella and wasn't wowed in the slightest. My mother ordered the chicken and waffle sandwich (?) and without even asking her if she had finished with her meal, they just took it away. Aside from this, the service was atrocious - we're paying money and clearly far too much and to not get the service deserved is frustrating. In addition, it hit the hour and a half mark and we were already being kicked off the table for other reservations. If the tip wasn't included within the price, I would have left nothing and expected money back. i gave the three stars because of dinner, but brunch deserves nothing more than 2. Brunch - NO Dinner - YES!",2,0,0,Mary T.,"Bronx, NY",5,17,22
1.0,3/11/2019,"This is the worst restaurant I have ever been to. I wish I could give them ZERO star because they don't even deserve 1. To begin we made a reservation for 2 pm but we're not seated until after 3 pm. The hostess claimed I did not tell her the whole party was there even though I did. I spoke with the manager who was useless. On the website it is advertised as unlimited but when we got there the waitress said 3 drinks per person that is very misleading but we still continued. The waitress took our food order two times but when the food came out it was still wrong. We attended brunch for my boyfriends birthday 17 people total, we had a cake that had henny shots in it. The manager then comes over screaming telling us that we're aren't supposed to have it and it's extra. The cake was placed in the back fridge so if there was a problem or any extra charges they should have charged us or informed us of charges beforehand and we would have paid them. The cake was brought out with no knife or plates. I spoke to another manager who was even worse than the first. The customer service here is terrible! I will never return and I urge other people to not come here either. There are plenty of other places in NYC that treat you nice and give you better service. Our bill was over $1,000 and it's not the price that is the problem because we paid it it's just the service we received for this price.",0,1,0,Kiara J.,"Englewood, NJ",0,3,0
2.0,3/10/2019,Came her for a birthday dinner and made reservations for two. To my surprise when i entered the wait was ridiculous. It doesn't matter if you have a reservation you will still wait 45min to an hour. The place is way to small. None the less my meal was OK. It has a nice view and the music is too loud for conversations. Way better options in the city so i will not return.,0,0,0,Sasha S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,8,1
1.0,3/10/2019,"If I could give zero stars I would! This place used to be kind of bad but now its HORRIBLE!!! went there for Saturday brunch recently and found out they are lying on their wesite about what brunch entails. It says unlimited drinks for 1.5 hours but the waiter said it was ONLY 3 DRINKS! when I asked if that was a new policy and he said that it had alwsys been like that which is a boldface lie! Anyone who has ever been there for brunch knows it was unlimited. Not to mention they increased their brunch price to $42. So basically I paid $50 for bland mangu and 3 watered down mimosas, what a joke! The drinks were watered down, the food was subpar, the service sucked, the staff is not friendly, and they false advertise. Save your money this place is the worst, all the negative reviews are true!

1.0,3/8/2019,"I visited Sofritos for a Birthday brunch on March 3, 2019. There were 21 family and friends in attendance. Brunch was $42 per person, plus tax and gratuity added up $65 per person, most expensive brunch I have attended to date. My 1 star rating is for the great DJ and atmosphere, and that's where it ends. We were seated in about 15 minutes, due to making a prior reservation. A few minutes later our waiter came out with a tray of sangria already poured into plastic cups. As the waiter went around the table serving the Sangria, everyone at the table was confused because no one had been asked if we wanted mimosas or sangria. As the waiter approached me with my drink I explained that I did not like Sangria and I would like a mimosa instead. Waiter seemed bothered by my request and proceeded by telling me ok,  but you all only get 3 drinks per person. Keeping in mind that this was my sisters special day, I opted not to argue about his rude response, instead I looked up the brunch menu, which I had already previously read in detail, and sure enough it stated complimentary mimosas and sangria during your dining experience. Shortly after we were given some trays of calamari, pork chunks and tiny empanadas, which comes to the tables of parties of 6 or larger. Finally a waiter starts going around the table taking our orders, again I see our guests with puzzled faces, but music was too loud for me to hear what the issues were. As the waiter got to me, I first pointed at the appetizers (which is included in the brunch) to say that i wanted a salad and the waiter immediately interrupted me and stated No, No we already put appetizers on the table, you don't get that! While waiting for the only food that we actually got to pick ourselves, the waiter came out of the kitchen with a tray full of mimosas and sangria in cups. The waiter proceeded to take one cup and used that cup to refill a few drinks by pouring the cup into the cups that were already on the table, which were not finished yet. Basically everyone had the same question, Does this count as our second drink??? Waiter gave no response. Has anyone been to a brunch that refills drinks in this way? Am I crazy? Don't waiters come out with pitchers to refill drinks??? This was ghetto as fuck. And finally the clincher, our food has arrived, I ordered the salmon, When i was served my plate, I could not believe my eyes..half of my salmon was missing or so I thought. I got up to see if anyone else had ordered salmon and sure enough the two other people that ordered, also got half a piece of salmon...smfh! Needless to say that was it for me. After being served half a salmon for the price that we paid, not getting our third drink, being rushed and having to stop the waiters several times from taking our appetizers and entrees before we were finished, I can honestly  say that I will never return to this unprofessional place again. I have been to many brunches all over the city and paid half the amount and had great food and great service. Please don't waste your time or money here.",2,1,0,Yolanda C.,"Bronx, NY",0,2,2
2.0,3/4/2019,Cool place to hangout and grab a few drinks. Not sure what all the hype was about as I was unimpressed with the food.

3.0,2/25/2019,"[Brunch] If you're looking to have a fun time, don't care about the food or service, then this is the place to go. I had a wonderful time with my friends (a group of 10 people priced at about $55 a person including 2 hookahs) You HAVE to make a reservation or else be prepared to wait for about 2 hours, it gets wildly crowded, to the point where the waiter is hovering above your table and waiting for you to leave by constantly asking if you're done with your plate and rushing you to take it away. I took 2 stars off because the brunch menu was disappointing and extremely limited considering it's $42 a person (and you're limited to 3 mimosas). No one was fully satisfied with their food, but thank god the mimosas and hookah was strong and the music created a lit atmosphere to have fun and celebrate in. Some things to make note of is that the avocado toast comes with ONE PIECE OF BREAD with like 4 pieces of tomato and small chunks of mozzarella cheese. The French toast comes with a pineapple topping (which I wasn't a fan of, I wished they had a berry compote like most places do for brunch and I would've even settled for jam.) this seems like such little considering the price in comparison to other places. Like I said though, overall I had a great time the music was great and it's a nice fancy atmosphere.

3.0,2/24/2019,"I came to this spot about a year ago with about 20 homeys. Yeah, we was rolling deep that night! Dinner was awesome and the views were right. But could Sofrito come through clutch and deliver on brunch? I wanted to find out.I'll start by saying they made me take my Mets cap off, but I won't dock them any stars because the dress code is stated clearly in the front, plus I just got a haircut so I was looking like a snack regardless. They had a prix fixe brunch menu which includes an appetizer, an entree and three beverages (mimosa or sangria... I couldn't figure out which one had more street cred so I settled for the mimosa).I had the empanadas for an appetizer, one chicken and one beef because the waiter said I could mix it up and I'm wild. These were A++, especially with the sweet sauce that accompanied them. For my entree, I had the steak and eggs, which was slightly above average. Steak was flavored well but fries got soggy underneath the eggs and meat. The one part that left me feeling ehhh was when the bill came out and I saw that 18% tip was included already. Now I know some establishments do this, but what rubbed me the wrong way was that the menu states that 15% gratuity will automatically be added for parties 4 and under (which we were). It didn't amount to much but episodes like that make it seem like they're trying to play me for a fool which I'm clearly not. Not good business, Sofrito.It also got mad loud as we were leaving, so if I ever did forgive them for trying to deceive me, I would return early as to avoid the ruckus.",2,6,1,Jason G.,"Manhattan, NY",176,31,36

2.0,1/13/2019,"Having been to this restaurant's prior location when it originally opened Downtown on York Avenue and following it's sister restaurant; Sazon in Tribeca, this NEW location has a stunning view, great sound system, playlist, and scene setting but completely left me in disappointment and in shock.I attend a winter Saturday Family Brunch (3 Adults & 2 Children - ages 3 and 6 mths) and our bill was shy a few dollars from $200 and we were charged a 20% gratuity because we were a party of 5.  Now the waiter only served 3 adults as the adults served the children.  Mind you they had 2 waiters attending our table and were not communicating because they kept coming asking what the last waiter had just asked us.  I am not sure why they would consider this a party of 5.  In addition, they give you 3 complimentary drinks for a Brunch that is $45 per person.  This is ridiculous and not a typical NYC Brunch.Lastly, this restaurant's small chain has been known for their Spanish style food and I wouldn't even give it a B- at this location.  I will spare you the details but trust it was nothing to brag or special about it.  A corner local Spanish restaurant might be better.Please take this into a serious review as I believe if this continues this restaurant will not be successful.A disappointed and sadden NYC Family.",0,1,0,Marcos M.,"Bronx, NY",0,2,0

1.0,12/16/2018,"I was very disappointed with my recent visit yesterday for my brothers birthday brunch. First off let me start saying that there brunch is not unlimited like they say online of their website. (Before they moved from the other location which was located in Manhattan that spot was unlimited) which no one told us it wasn't unlimited so we keep asking for refills. Some people only had 2 refills because the waiter just want accommodating to us. At one point we would ask him and he wouldSay ok and never come back with any drinks. Because some of us were getting frustrated that we weren't getting our refills we decided to ask for a pitcher of sangria and mimosa that way we didn't have to bother the waiter and we can refill our own cups. They brought us two sangrias and one mimosa so we were happy we didn't have to wait around for the waiter anymore and we shared that with the entire table which was a total of 21 people. When we got the bill, we saw the charge of $150 additional on the bill. We asked why was this on there and he said because we asked for pitchers and the drinks aren't unlimited. Which again no one told us it wasn't and no one told us the pitchers were $50 each either! Arguing with our waiter I asked to speak to the manger because at this point we're upset no one communicated that there was going to be an extra charge. When asked to speak to the manager we spoke to short man with a white button down (which before we spoke to him, the waiter already mentioned what our problem was) he said can i help you. We said yes and told him about the additional chargers of the pitchers and his response without letting me finish the convo was ""well we don't give away alcohol for free here"" which boggles my mind that, that was his first response. I was like no one is asking for that but no one told us either this place isn't unlimited & that the pitchers was going to be an additional charge!! Upset and just wanting to get the hell out of there he ok to have one pitcher removed and we would still have to pay for the others. This please over was just horrible The food was ok not the worst, but definitely not the best either. I order the avocado toast, they gave me 1 piece of toast which avocado spread  on top. That's it!

3.0,10/30/2018,"Not a bad restaurant. We went for a late dinner after a Broadway show and we had, I think, the last time slot for a dinner reservation on a Thursday night which was for 10pm. The lighting was very low and felt more like a club than a restaurant. There were only a few other parties there, so we got a nice view of the Washington bridge next to the window. The hostess told me to take my wool hat off, which I obliged of course, however I was a bit upset by this request later on when I realized that the woman at the table next to us still had HER beanie on?The food was pretty good. The meat was cooked well and the desserts were pretty standard. It was a bit difficult to see the people I was eating with, or even what I was eating with the low light, but I enjoyed my meal.I definitely appreciated the Latin-Asian fusion section of the menu, but I wish it was more than just Latinx foods stuffed into a sushi roll. Get more creative!It was a pretty OK experience. Probably wouldn't drop this much again at this place; would rather find a different place to spend that kind of money.",0,0,0,Maya V.,"New York, NY",138,65,89
3.0,10/28/2018,Nice restaurant. I recently went for a Halloween party. The management should definitely hire bartenders that are SKILLED in managing large crowds and parties. The bartenders that service your regular dinner crowds won't cut it. Waited forever for drinks! Then had to wait even longer to pay for the drinks. People were leaving without paying because the bartenders weren't on their job. Definitely need to train them if you are using them for large parties.,0,1,0,Garrick W.,"New York, NY",39,41,7

It literally sits on the water, although I am not sure which body of water it was, yet it still the view was beautiful! Once you walk in, you can smell all of the fresh ingredients that they use. The bar area definitely had a lot of traffic. You could see the over size containers in the back of all of the juices and syrups that they made from scratch. My best friend ordered a long island and he could not taste the liquor, but he Surely felt it and hour later. I had a sangria and it was absolutely delicious. After taking a few sips, I truly felt that the kitchen staff would definitely know what they're doing. Since it was kind of late, I ordered the empanadas for I do not like to eat heavy late at night. They were very tasty.After a certain time, they take up some of the tables inside and make the restaurant into a lounge.

If its 5 peope or more, its 20%. They play fast and loose with this as this not stated anywhere on the menu.

3.0,8/6/2018,"Came here for brunch on 8/5/18. There was a short wait to be seated but nothing crazy. Once we were given a table, our sever promptly arrived to take our drink orders. For brunch you have the option of mimosas or sangria. Unfortunately, ONLY THREE drinks are included in the brunch. This was super disappointing because brunch typically serves unlimited drinks and that's what I was expecting. If you go, I recommend the sangria because the glasses for the mimosas are very thin and it's almost pointless if they're going to limit you. There are a lot of options to choose from on the brunch menu, which I liked. I had calamari as an appetizer and steak & eggs as my entree. Both were very good and arrived nice and hot. My cousin had pork chunks for her appetizer and I felt they were very dry, requiring you to dip them in the sauce they came with. She also had the steak & eggs for her entree and enjoyed it as well. I understand there is a limit to how long brunch is, but they are very adamant about removing you from the table once your time is over. This bothered me a little, as there were several empty tables available and I was only in a party of 2. Even though we had hookah (which was weak), we were told to find a spot at the bar. I thought at least they'd carry it over for us rather than let customers walk around with the whole apparatus, but they didn't. The music and party vibe was good pretty much all afternoon. The DJ provided a good variety of hip hop, spanish, r&b and other genres. The songs did start to repeat after a few hours but people didn't seem to mind. All in all, it's a pretty mixed review.

It was approximately 9ish- PM and the restaurant wasn't crowded in the least but it took the wait staff almost 15mins to come and take just our drink orders - the servers forgot about one of our orders and didn't come to our table once during our meal to ask us if we were okay. Moving forward it was about 945ish and the server tells us that it's last call for alcohol.

1.0,7/17/2018,"So I went to Sofrito this weekend (7/15/2018) for my birthday. I hope hope HOPE someone reads this and thinks twice before spending your money at that establishment. If I'm going there for a two hour brunch (1pm to 3pm), I expect to not be kicked out at 2:20pm because they want my table for another party. But we'll get to that later.Although the menu says ""complimentary sangrias AND mimosas,"" you only get to choose one or the other. Fine. However, nowhere on their website or on the menu do they say they limit your unlimited drinks to two per person. But sometimes it's three, sometimes it's four. I guess it depends on whatever mood your server is in. They don't tell you this when you make the reservation, sit down to order your food and drinks, or once you finish your second round. It's when you ask for the third round that they start to magically announce all of their ""new policies.""If you're paying $40.00 per person ($50.00 minimum with the gratuity that is REQUIRED to be included in every bill), then you should expect to be given your two courses and drinks as stated on the menu AND on their website. Which brings me to the courses! (You ready for this one?)I celebrated my birthday with six (6) other people. There were seven (7) of us in total. Nothing too crazy. Each person is entitled to one starter/appetizer and one entree. As the server was taking our order, I start off by telling him what I wanted for my appetizer. Barely able to get two words out, he interrupts me and tells me ""We have a bunch of samplers coming out for the table so just tell me your entree."" And so I did. ONLY THREE SMALL APPETIZERS CAME OUT. That was it. Since we're seven people in total, of course we finished it fast and asked for the other four appetizers. That's when they said ""For groups over 6 (Oh how convenient we were off by 1) we just do the sampler appetizers but we'll bring you another once as a courtesy."" So letting bygones be bygones, I asked for a calamari. They bring out empanadas and ignore me and my table the rest of the time until Entrees are ready to be served. Awesome service, right?I'm also Dominican and this place is supposed to serve Dominican food and the Tres Golpes is a typical Dominican dish. I need to know, Sofrito NYC, HOW IN THE HELL DO YOU MESS THAT UP?! DO YOU NOT USE ANY ADOBO OR ANYTHING AT ALL TO SEASON YOUR FOOD?! I REALLY NEED TO KNOW. So moving forward, I ask the server to speak to a manager. I'm ignored. I ask another server to speak to a manager. The server wanted to take it upon himself to deal with my issues. So I reiterated this whole post. Nothing was done, I still didn't get my calamari and I tipped out 20% more than what was deserved because of the automatic gratuity. I work as a server. I've been a waitress for years. I know what it means to give and get good service. Serving a customer is more than just taking a food order, punching it into a computer and bringing the food from the kitchen to the table. I unfortunately drove from Long Island all the way here and spent all this money on gas, toll and food and drinks for NOTHING!The only reason that this restaurant is even getting one star is because the music was good and the hookah was too.

The view decent thank God for hot yet great weather. So lets discuss the establishment itself........ the decor inside was simple but doable, a little club'ish. I'd like to see the outside jazzed up, but I guess the view is suppose to do that. Still think a little something could be done.The staff needs to be better trained from the bar to waiters.......overall they need to be  more attentive and the bartenders need to be quicker on service fillingnand closing orders. With that said overall we weren't pissed about service.As for the food as a foodie it wasn't the best I have had nor too bad everything was seasoned well as appetizers and entrees go.

1.0,6/23/2018,"This Review is going to be lengthy review...my wife and I went there for our wedding anniversary, so we made reservations. I called and spoke with Jaime to confirm our reservation not only was she very unprofessional but very nasty and dismissive with me, which was the first interaction with someone at the restaurant and did not want to allow that to hinder our perception on the business. gave her the benefit of a doubt maybe she has no customer service training , she may be new employee so I disregarded her behavior. Upon arrival music was exaggeratedly loud that I could not hear myself think and by the end of my visit my ears where ringing. my wife proceeded to inform the hostess that we have reservations when asked if we would like sit indoors or outdoors,my wife responded outdoors assuming that it would be a little less louder than indoors. the darling hostess reacted like it was such an inconvenience to escort us there with such a nasty expression, surprisingly there was a second hostess Who escorted us outdoors seating area As we arrive we were asked where would you like to sit pointed to the middle isle in which we proceeded to sit. Did we mention music was even louder than indoors. The male Afro-Latino waiter complained to her and seem to have an issue to where we chose to sit, I figure it had nothing to do with us. The waiter did not introduce himself gave us menus gave us about 7 minutes until he returned and took our orders during the appetizers and dinner he did not once check on us and had to get his attention for the bill. the presentation on the food looked like they just threw the food on the plate while other who obviously had the same order and was beautifully presented in addition found a piece of paper in my food. As the evening came along it started to drizzle. The waiters were kind enough to open the umbrella but it was obvious that they were accommodating more of the lighter skin Latinos then us... my first experience here I found it to be treated with disrespect and discriminated against and honesty I wouldn't know if is because my spouse was African American or the fact that we were 2 women One being a Light skin Latina, The service was disgusting I did not appreciate the way we were treated specially when we are paying for the service, In addition we had made reservations for Monday for 20 guest to celebrate my son's graduation, and now I am canceling because I do not appreciate the disrespect at an establishment where I am paying to eat.

Please keep in mind when you make reservations you can't be seated until the party is complete. You are given a 15 min grace period for your party to show up or they will give the next party your table. Immediately after being seated our server asked if we wanted endless sangria or mimosas, and our glasses were consistently filled from that point on! Both the sangria and mimosa taste delicious! The food was phenomenal! It came out extremely fast! For our party of 12 we were given 3 huge portions of appetizers. (empanadas, fried pork, and fried calamari) The empanadas were by far my favorite but I loved all of the appetizers. For my entree I went with the Baby Paella and I have no regrets!

Appetizers, our choice of meal and dessert. ***45$ per person!*** The appetizers were shrimp and chicken chunks which wasn't bad. Now for the meal most of us got steak rice and beans. Now the steak was super salty and too chewy, i asked for my steak to be well done but ended up getting 3 burnt small pieces of steak. We asked to speak to the manager and the manager didn't even want to speak, he just sent us a shot of vodka. When we asked to speak to the manager again, he took about 20 minutes to come to our table. We complained to the manager about our food and he didn't do anything in return. I took two bites from my plate and i was done. They offered to exchange our plates but we refused because we all got different things and we didn't like it. The dessert was even bad!!! It had a combination of tres leche cake with a brownie and two other things that just tasted awful. The drinks were overrated and ridiculously expensive. The manager didn't even try to take something off from our order and we ended paying 666.71$ for SHITY food. Never again.

The ambience of this restaurant is beautiful however the food in terms of taste for its price is certainly not up to par. I ordered the ropa vieja al pilon (comes with mashed plantain) and my friends ordered the regular ropa vieja (which comes with beans and rice).A couple of friends ordered the rolls which I tried...stay away from the rollsOverall the taste of the ropa vieja meat was delicious and the portion was good. The plantain was excellent as well. Issues: the meat could have been a lot more tender than it actually was. The rolls are bad. Overall I don't think food is worth the price (maybe just the ambience). They did a good job for a birthday celebration (providing sparklers on a cake and such).My MAJOR issue is the waiter never came to my side of the table to fill my water and I had no water for the entire meal.

And I overheard that this place was a hit or miss type of restaurant. So I did't feel so convinced.My Wife advised that I should book the event here so I did. We had 11 people there. I made the RSVP a week in advance so once we all got there to my amazement at the same time. They sat all of us down pretty quick. I was almost sure there would be a hick up at the door.Pros: The 3 things that make this establishment great.1. The food is so good. From the rice and beans to the Pork chops it was all good. And, i'm big fan of sangria who could be very picky on drinks. And, they were on the money. That sangria was pretty dame good.2. The customer service was by far the best. All the food got to the table In a very responsible time. And even at one point my Mom didn't feel to well and got a bit light headed just for a second and I had 4 members of staff there already. I was really impressed about that. 3. Try to be seated by the window if you ever stop by this place. The view makes this restaurant. You oversee the Hudson River and part of NJ i believe. Cons: From my point of view there wasn't many.1. The price can be a bit pricey but its NYC and you really getting good food and service. That being said you getting your money worth.2. The venue is a bit smaller from remodeling that they did. what I heard was that this venue was bigger in sq footage. So big event might be an issue do to the fact that its not a big place. 3.

Almost a polar opposite of what it used to be when it was located on 58th street a few years back. Not sure if the management has changed since then or what but the service was definitely better back then. It took my friends and I around 3 hours...yes 3 hours to be seated for brunch and this is after being told initially it would only be a 40 minute wait. We were growing impatient as we were sitting by the bar the whole time ordering drinks but didn't want to order too much being that we were expecting to be called any minute, almost to the point that we were going to leave last minute and just eat elsewhere. After the 40 minutes each of us would go up to the hostesses and ask when would we be seated and the answers we were getting were either any minute or soon and just to keep an ear out for our name. It took till about 4:30 for that soon to come which now felt like and early bird special dinner instead of an actual brunch. Nonetheless the food was good and thankfully didn't take nearly as long as it did to be seated. The music was on point and dance floor was lively which added a much needed enjoyment to the experience. Also, thankfully for Sofrito's they are located in Riverside Park right by the Hudson River which gives off a great view while eating and nice to take pics by after you're done. So Sofrito's definitely has its plus and minuses. Not ruling out coming here again but I wouldn't do another brunch here again at the same time. Maybe a happy hour or dinner on a weekday when they aren't bombarded by too many people coming here.

For a party of 5/6 more you automatically get the appetizer platter (comes with fried calamari, beef&chicken empanadas, and fried chorizo). HOWEVER, the service was very slow and unorganized. Tables seated after us got their appetizer platters first. When our appetizers were done our meals did not come out for another 30 to 45mins. In conclusion, food and the view is great.

I had appetizers shrimp patelitos which were sooooo freaking good . I had a preset menu so we ate a little of everything Calamari, breaded shrimp, carnitas, ummmm these other things that look like patelitos but its different looking like a different dough ‍ still good and we had tostones with different meats and fish on it AMAZINGGG now the Bacalou on the tostones was not my thing, and its crazy because I love bacalou here its made with a different taste i guess so not a fan. I had the skirt steak with rice and beans it was ok. The sangria was okay i didn't care for whatever made it taste sparkly maybe some kind if spritzer. Also i had the Sancocho girllllllllll that was good. I also had some of the pernil the presentation was amazinggg but i think that the taste was bland. I did not try the paella but i was told its very good and the presentation of the plate is amazing as well. I would RECOMMEND THE PAELLA AND THE SANCOCHO . AND THEY GET A 8 FOR AMBIANCE, and DECOR.

To set up the reservation my friend had to sign a contract and all that which I guess was due to the fact it was gonna be a large party. Before everything my friend made sure ask if it was OK to bring children as she herself and another guest wanted to bring their daughters. She was told that it was perfectly fine and everything would be OK. Well now it's Sunday and low and behind everything was NOT OK.  My friend was told that children weren't allowed at the brunch because of the loud music and some other reason that didn't really make sense. When she told them that she had cleared it when she made the reservation they said she was told wrong and there was nothing they can do about it. They were ""gracious"" enough to at least not charge her for falling through the contract which was signed under incorrect informaron THEY gave. We had to leave and try and find somewhere else to go, and those who valet their car wasted their 15 dollars to just walk through the door and come right back out.So as u can see this isnt a review of the food or anything inside cause we never made it in.

The food was so,so the chicken tastes a little weird & the app's food choices were missing some sazon or sofrito to say the least..... one of my main complaints is that the  staff although they seemed as if they were just trying to keep things going & keep our table clean we felt that they were hovering over us while they kept picking up plates & etc. We also felt a little rushed because the app's, salad/ sancho, entrees and desserts came out literally right in BACK of each other as if they wanted our table which, didn't seem to be the case as the place was fairly empty because of the time as it was an early 6pm dinner.",0,2,0,Denise F.,"New York, NY",6,85,117

The food options were good but the food itself was very unsatisfactory. I ordered the chicken empanadas and the kale salad. The chicken empanadas are clearly frozen and then deep fried . Unfortunately they left my empanada uncooked to the point where I ate frozen chicken in my first bite. My kale salad would have been good without the peanuts and eggs. I love salads but this one was interesting. It also had glass in it. Very few but small specks. I left all of my food in disappointment.

It was an hour later that we finally got a table. After complaining to management. All the manager kept saying is that the customers on the table don't want to leave. It blew my mind how they was handling this. If you have a reservation you should be seated for your reservation time. I saw management just chilling with the guest and it seems like there was two tables of people they knew so they was there like for three hours seated. When the reservation are for one hour an a half. I believe this was the reason for the delay. I really like the live music and the food is great but customer service was horrible and they did not even do right by us. I had a very large party.

Our first set of drinks had hair in it. Fortunately I saw this before drinking from it. The waiter was very apologetic and they remade our drinks. They took our order from their pre-fixed menu and shortly after we received our appetizers. We both got the empanada's, beef & chicken and I must say that these were the best empanadas I have ever had. It came with a guava sauce which made it even more delish!Secondly, for the entree I got the stuffed chicken breast and to be honest; it was quite dry. And I know that generally chicken breast is dry  but this  was overly dry and lacking flavor. It came with a yucca mash that was also dry and lacking flavor. Not what I expected from the description at all. For dessert, we had some type of chocolate and vanilla moose cake, which was ok at best. The bill at the end of the night was almost $200 and I honestly don't feel like the experience and food that we had was deserving of that price. Although the staff was friendly, my experience here was underwhelming because of the lack of flavor in food and the price that was not worth it in my opinion.

Zero complaints about the decor. Food: I had the prefixed brunch menu so I ended up with the pork chunks to start and the steak and eggs as my entree...and sangria!...but I'm sure you knew that already. The pork chunks were disappointing. It was either fried fat or really dry, fried pork. The steak and eggs was solid though. Service: pleasant and fairly attentive. Our waiter could have brought the sangrias a little quicker but that may have been to our benefit because they were strong as hell. Managed to get 1 extra sangria on the House since we were asked to give up our table sooner then we were ready to leave. Not a huge fan of that whole being asked to give your table up to another party  but I guess the 1 sangria made up for that (-_-)Overall: I would definitely come back.

As soon as you walk through the door you are welcomed by incredibly loud music that literally  forces you to yell to speak to each other. Note : NOT GOOD FOR  A DATE NIGHT.

The mofongo is good but there is no pork skin in it and the pernil has No flavor. The empanadas chicken and beef were really good though.

It's inside the park on 145th and Riverside Dr. Reservations: Made via web for 8pm party of 5 on a Saturday night. However the hostess called us the next day to inform us that reservations don't start till 9pm and the next available would be 10pm. Ok fine whatever we took the 10pm, however I do advise the owner to fix your website. My group arrived at 9:40, cool 20 mins early to make sure they got us for exactly 10pm. There were about 3 hostess girls when you only probably needed 1. Around 10:15 we still weren't called. I went back up to the hostess she knew who I was and said give her a few minutes. Few minutes turned into half hour. My friend went up to them this time and they claimed they didn't have us in the reservation system. Whaaaaaaa?!?! They had no choice but to seat us which was at 10:45. Service/Waiter: Horrible! Between the loud music I couldn't hear him and he had a face where he didn't smile at all and looked miserable being there. He threw napkins in front of each of us for our drinks, THREW not placed. Smh. I believe his name is Cesar and I also have a picture. At the end when given our check one of the credit cards receipts was missing as he needed 4 copies, he started throwing an attitude like ""where the 4th one?, i need it!"" And again his face made the statement.  One of the rudest waiters I've ever had. I applaud the reviews who wrote about the service. It's really not a joke or an exaggeration. Food: It came out within 15 mins after placing the orders. The portions are great. The pernil and shrimp were tasty. The yucca was not great. My friend said it tasted like earwax lmao, definitely had the texture of earwax though. Smh. Rice was dry and it was certain things that weren't as expected since Sofrito's is known. Overall: Not a big fan. Very disappointed. Service needs to improve big time meaning the hostess and waiters. I salute those who had a great time here, but I won't be back or recommend it.

That being said, never had I had to wait 45 minutes to sit at a table that wasn't even ready to take orders.After talking to the manager for that night I was notified that the table would be ready shortly, and that our party would get free shots to make up for it. Like the mythical unicorn, those shots were nowhere to be seen.When finally placing our orders after what seemed like years taken off of my body, we again had to wait. We had paid to have a 3 course meal here and though the apps were dope, the food was subpar and overpriced. The drink we ordered, never showed up(similar to the illusive shots). Earlier I mentioned a 3 meal course. This too was a let down since dessert never showed. Unless Sofritos has this weird type of dessert shaped like ceramic plates. Going to this place destroyed my soul.

First reason being the staff has HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. From the rudeness of the bartenders to the waiters. NOT knowing how a coat check WORKS and the ""security"" being rude and pushing people back (in line) Second reason was how they handled the whole New Year's Eve event. VERY DISORGANIZED and leaving us to freeze while standing in line for over an hour. Every business should know if there's going to be lines OUTSIDE to atleast out a tent out with some industrial heaters OR have more staff working the line to make it move QUICKER. The number of ladies I've seen crying in the bathroom with burns on their legs practically CLOSE to catching frostbite is inexcusable! If waiting in line to get your wristbands was bad enough you had to wait on ANOTHER LINE for coat check and those girls were just TURTLES not knowing where things were or how much each coat cost. But thank god someone came to the rescue and speeded things up! The outside was the worst of it but getting inside by 11PM with only an hour or so left of open bar, there were only 2-3 bartenders working and at a TURTLE PACE my goodness! The money for the open bar spent was not even worth it I should've just gotten regular admission and spent the equal amount of money on those 4 drinks I managed to get!

The promoters were waking up and down the line asking people if they were sure they didn't wanna do bottle service. Mind you, all of the people on the line had bought open bar tickets already. It was so cold that folks had to leave or catch hypothermia. I asked security if they would let some of the ladies wait inside of the door while the guys wait outside and they acted as if I tried to start a fight. They cursed at me and pushed me out. We eventually had to leave after waiting over 30 mins on that line shivering. No refund. It wasn't worth it. It's places like this and promoters like that, that have completely killed the party culture in NYC. I will never ever spend a dollar here or have my company do business with this place ever again. You guys suck and your treatment of paying customers is absolutely horrible. I don't care how good the food is here.

This is supposed to come with a choice of appetizer and entree and complimentary mimosas or sangria.Because we were a party 6 or more, we didn't get a choice in appetizers; rather we got a pork dish, fried calamari, and beef and chicken empanadas to share amongst the table. The pork and empanadas were good, but on the dry side; the sauce that came with them was their saving grace. The fried calamari was typical, nothing of note.Our server brought us water glasses and plastic ""champagne flutes"" for our mimosas. Our water glasses were never filled and our mimosa glasses remained empty for larger periods of time. Even after flagging down several servers to ask them to refill our mimosas, there was significant delay.My Piña Colada French Toast was pretty good. It was nice to have something sweet to offset all the saltiness of the appetizer round. The pineapple chutney worked well with the syrup, powdered sugar, and halal bread. The sausages that came with it provided balance to the flavor profile so I didn't suddenly go from all salty to all sweet.There are large windows in the restaurant so you can see the nice view.

1.0,10/9/2017,"Let me start by posing the question-- Why is this place even open? The only pro about it is the view.Alright, I was brought to Sofrito for my sister's birthday brunch, by some cruel joke of the universe and what a series of unfortunate events this was. Let's say that everything leading up to this brunch was eventful as well. For starters a request for brunch reservation was sent in well in advance, after confirming the set time, the day before the event, we received an email informing us that our selected time slot was not available and we now had two outlandish times to pick from, a) too early and b) too late. After trying to reason with the promoter reiterating that we had a confirmation for time slot x, we finally agreed on option a (forcefully). Sure we should have and definitely could have taken our business elsewhere, but my sister had her heart set on this place. Great-- moving on. So we get to what looked like a recreational pool building, fortunately it looks better on this inside. We finally sit down (oh yes, do make sure that you're whole party is there or they will not seat you), and ordered appetizers and drinks. 20 minutes later, the waitress returns with clear cups (maybe from party city) for the ""sangria"" aka grape juice (snapple brand) and  PLASTIC, yes, plastic champagne flutes to serve ""mimosas"" aka J. Roget and Donald Duck OJ. The appetizers were better than the entrees. They also arrived, at the exact same time as the meal, which was somewhat a blessing in disguise, because the food was absolutely trash. I'm talking about frozen Goya bag peas and canned roasted peppers, and uncle ben's rice that had been siting out for hours (yes, the other reviews on here are correct about the food being cold). Bottom-line--ew!The waitresses are lazy, and stand around gossiping instead of bringing your drinks or checking to make sure your meal(s) are okay.So after multiple pours of snapple and donald duck juice, and people eating the parts of their food that weren't cold, we proceeded to inquire about the hookah options, which you will now know, is false advertisement (they do it on a as they please basis), the waitress literally was less concerned with accommodating our request, and though friendly let us know that she ""needed the table now"" to seat another party (mind you nobody was waiting). The allotted time for dining was 1.5 hours, we received the check without asking with 15 minutes still left, and were just cut off and essentially kicked out.Unfortunately, the party was larger than 6 as such gratuity was automatically included, $70 for a ""service charge"" was nowhere near accurate, I would have tipped her $10, and that is a generous number with the treatment we received.What else? Oh, the DJ, just ugh. Terrible music too.This locale has so much potential, if they cleaned house (especially in the kitchen) and upgraded their champagne choice to something better.On the bright side, I do recommend the calamari and the empanada appetizers--but living in New York City, you can go to another place with better service and food to get those two items as appetizers.Again, save yourself the money, time, and aggravation and DO NOT make Sofrito an option for your next celebration/Sunday brunch/ anything.If someone from Sofrito management is reading this, please do yourself a favor and up your game.",11,10,0,Karen L.,"Manhattan, NY",3,11,4

Fine whatever, to each their own but be professional girl. Anyway, the worst part was when I got the bill. Do you know why she was smoking hookah, dancing with these guys AND took 30 minutes to give us our drinks? Because the TIP WAS INCLUDED!!!!!! what a slap in the face!

My sister had her birthday dinner on 09/23/17 at this restaurant.  We were there for a 9pm reservation and didn't get seated till 10:45pm. We had an inside table reservation for 7 people and waited so long that we asked to be accommodated outside.  Several tables emptied outside throughout our almost 2 hour wait and we didn't get seated anyway. We asked to get the appetizer platter at the bar since we were all hungry and waiting for so long. My sister had already paid $500 for the dinner beforehand so we figure that we start the appetizer during our wait. The waitress told us that the bar had nothing to do with our dinner purchase and we had to pay $65 for the appetizer.  Right after we got the appetizer platter, we were seated. My sister paid the $55 pre fix dinner for all of us and we also had another appetizer platter on the pre fix menu. So we sat there with two appetizer platters...We were seated at 10:45pm and by 12:00am we hadn't even received our sancocho/salad portion of the package.  They brought the sancocho/salad at 12:10am and 5 minutes later the dinner. We waited 1.5 hours just for the food to come out...plus the 1:45 hour to get the table.During this whole ordeal we were speaking to the manager and she was horrible. She was unprofessional and has no idea how to manage a business.  We were not accommodated at all and spent most of the 4 hours at sofrito waiting to be serviced.  The entire staff seemed untrained and unable to manage this establishment. We were given the check and the waitress had no idea that the meal was prepaid. She disappeared for 15 minutes to sort things out and we had to go looking for her to find out what happened. I had to get her a couple times because she was nowhere to be seen during the meal.  Please do yourself a favor and save your money.  If you have a big party on a weekend don't go there.

I assumed a reservation, like in any other restaurant, ensured they would have a table reserved to them inside the place, but I guess not in Sofrito. They didn't have a table ready inside the restaurant so they seated the party of 12 outside. Later the party ordered a sangria pitcher, but the glasses to serve the sangria on arrived 30 minutes after the pitcher. This is not the first time my mother comes to Sofrito, but it is the last. She gave them the service here the benefit of the doubt the first time, assuming they were inattentive because it was a busy night, but she now agrees with me that other big parties considering Sofrito should be warned about the experience.  To add insult to injury, in the parking lot our car's bumper got hit and got scratched.

1.0,8/21/2017,"Where to begin....If I could give this place a 1 star I totally will. I am not one to complain but the service was so poor I felt compelled to tell others. I visited this location yesterday August 20, 2017. I called back on August 13th to make a reservation for a party of 11. The reservation was confirmed and I was told I will receive an email later in the week. However, the email never came. On the day of (yesterday) I called earlier in the morning and a young lady apologized for the inconvenience and told me I didn't have a reservation however she will grant me the reservation because it was their mistake. The reservation was for 2pm, when I arrived at 1:35pm I was told no reservation honored and I am considered a walk in. My party did not get seated until 3:45pm every time I tried to speak to one of the hostesses I kept being told that I just have to wait. The representative ""Albania"" was so unwilling to accommodate us that I finally had to speak to the general manager and I was given a table 10 minutes later. Mind you this was supposed to be brunch. Not to mention the drinks were disgusting they serve you juice with a sprinkle of Champagne and pass that as a mimosa. They also do not allow you to keep the pitcher on the table like in most brunch places, the waiter has to go to each person and fill up their cup. When the waiter leaves and you're out of a drink you just have to wait another 15 minutes until the waiter comes back around to serve you another drink. The food was awful as well, because we were a large party we were not allowed to order our own appetizers the restaurant decides what appetizers they serve to large parties. They are about 3 to 4 items to select as a main course from the menu. Most of us ordered a quesadilla and I have to tell you that it was so small it looked like they made it with a taco dish and you're only served one. This was supposed to be a $39.99 per person brunch we ended up paying $65 person which would have been okay if we did not have to go get food right after leaving because everyone was so hungry. If you're looking to show off (twerk in a restaurant and smoke hookah) this is the place for you. If you're looking to have a nice brunch- good food, drinks and dancing this is not the place. My impression of this restaurant has been tarnished. The way they are running things is not the way a restaurant conducts business with valued patrons--I have visited other locations and have never encountered such treatment before.

WHERE ARE THE COPs WHEN YOU NEED ONE?? 3) The place looked completely outdated like some 80's to 90's joint and in need of serious update & TLC4) they mentioned dress code as ""Business Casual"", I was the only Mother in there dressed as Business Casual. I looked like I owned the place. People were walking in with sneakers, tear up jeans etc!

Despite all this, earlier in the evening we were willing to return back here one day far into the reaches of the Galaxy ONLY because of the food  but they totally made us go for good and never to return was when the waitress mandatorily imposed on our bill a 20% gratuity. We were furious because no establishment is supposed to force customers of a party of two or less than 5 people to pay any tip for that matter. We're supposed leave whatever amount or percentage of tip we believe is fair for the service we got. We totally brought this point to our waitress and our unsatisfactory. She was willing to remove the mandatory tip but I refuse only because I didn't want to cause any embarrassing to her. I ended overpaying again.

2.0,8/15/2017,"Soooooo, as a native of Washington Heights I love to see new businesses emerge in my old neighborhood.  However, why is it we can't seem to make things their best, IMO?  It's girl's night with my friends and we walk to Sofrito.  I had dined at the downtown location years ago and looked forward to it's Uptown locale.  However, this venue seems more like a nightclub, lounge, where food is served more so than a restaurant.  First of all, the music is great, with a wonderful DJ but perhaps the decibel can be held below an ""11"" until the kitchen closes.  Funny thing about the dining experience, you kinda want to be able to hear your conversation, as well as your server, who has to bend down into the table in order to hear us too.  Next up, a table nearby was celebrating something (or maybe just drunk) and while their excitement was infectious for the first 5 minutes, they soon became obnoxious.  At no point is any staff inspired or thoughtful of its other patrons to ask them to keep down the noise.  But why should they keep it down?  Clearly they can't hear one another, so.  Onto my app, fried calamari.  Wonderfully cooked, not mushy or chewy, but ever so salty.  Disappointed but I was ravenous so they were eaten.  Next, my visit to the ladies room was met with a bathroom attendant who didn't appear to have much to do in such a tiny bathroom or a smile to provide, for that matter.  Nonetheless, I left the attendant a dollar and wished her well.  Back at the Paledium,  sorry my dinner table, I got my entree, which was chicken and seafood paella.  Now why I bothered to order  seafood when I just came from New England is a wonder but I hadn't had paella in years so why not.  IT was aight.  A bit dry, not much for flavor except a bit of saffron.  Meh.  A dessert person, I am not, so we were done and walked back home.  The charming bouncer we greeted at the door waved us goodbye.  Our server was pleasant and the sangria was delicious.  THIS is a great spot and a hidden gem on Riverside but if the Heights is going to compete with the influx gentrification entering this neighborhood,  Sofrito needs to up it's game (and not raise prices).",0,0,0,Barbara D.,"Sanford, ME",76,17,0

However, this was NOT the case with Sofritos at Riverside Dr. The restaurant is indeed beautiful. We were a party of 6 and while we understood we couldn't be seated until everyone arrived - we were instructed to wait by the bar. Area that soon became overcrowded. As soon as were were seated our waiter was very persistent about putting our orders in. I asked him for some time to review the menu so that we can come to a table agreement of our orders.  We ordered the appetizers, not one minute had passed after our appetizer arrived that the waiter insisted again in taking our orders. ONCE Again, I asked for time to savor the food before deciding on our entree.  It seems like they didn't like that. I noticed that although unlimited mimosa / Sangria is advertised they held back on refilling our glasses.  Which we had to constantly ask for. Various times I would look around the restaurant and to my surprise I noticed a tall guy (probably the assistant manager)  looking at our table and saying something about our particular table. It was at that moment I asked for the check and we left.  We were not babysitting our table and I was even looking to prolong the experience but, this behavior left us insulted.

I got off the D train and walked over to the park but once I got to the park I truly had no idea where to go since the Map app was leading me to the park and not necessarily the restaurant. Anyways I was hesitant about coming here due to the terrible reviews but some friends from out of town were adamant about coming. I think this place gets away with a lot due to the beautiful views of the GWB and being on the water. Other than that it's pretty lackluster. I arrived a little late so when I arrived my friends were waiting at the bar. We were seated shortly after. Once we were seated our sever stormed our table asking for our drink orders. When I say stormed what I mean is from the moment we sat down we felt incredibly rushed. I don't remember the name of my drink but it was fairly tasty. For my appetizer I ordered the Cuban roll which was amazing (easily the best part of my night)! Followed by the calamari salad. The salad was decent with the fried calamari and mangoes. However I'm not quite sure how long we were waiting for our food but it was long enough for our server to offer us a round of free drinks so you know it was a long time (I want to say close to an hour).

Second, our waiter was actually nice guy that handled well under the pressure of a Friday night!As for the rest of the staff, every else was okay, AT BEST. My real problem with this restaurant was the food. For the appetizers, they served assorted dishes ranging from chicken wings to calamari to fried shrimp, which was all decent, if I'm being generous. For the entree, I ordered the Pork with Rice and Gandules. And let me tell you, this piece of meat was just a lump of fat with the meat itself barely looking edible. The only saving grace for the entire meal were the desserts, which included things like flan and chocolate mousse cake, which were good!  Considering this was my friend's birthday, we decided to stay at Sofrito and order 3 hookahs, since we were a party of about 14 people. After serving us the hookahs, one of the waiters approaches us and notifies us that they only accept cash for hookah. As a restaurant, there needs to be a standard of professionalism maintained, and Sofrito should have notified us that they only accept cash for the hookah before serving us! After notifying the server that we did not have cash, the only alternative offered was to take out cash from the ATM. I know, for a fact, that Sofrito makes money every time money is transacted out from the ATM in their restaurant, so on top of paying the money for the bill and the drinks, Sofrito wants to make even more money off their patrons from their ATM fees.

At first i was a bit skeptical due to all the bad reviews but i said to my self let me give it a try because i wanted to celebrate my birthday in a place where there is a nice view, good food, music and drinks and let me tell you it worked out perfect! I had a party of 12, we had a prefix menu. The service was GREAT! they even sang to me with a guirra lol. I will def return back to this place. I guess you can't always go by the review.

I came here (Riverside location) for my anniversary with a reservation and each table for 2 must have been legit 5 inches away from each other because I was touching elbows with other patrons sitting next to me the entire night. I ordered a shrimp mofongo and it was like someone mashed half a platano, poured butter on it + 4 shrimp. And that sad plate cost me almost $30 lol. This just isn't the place to have a nice dinner at, the music is too loud, they seat way too toooo many people, and the food is subpar.

3.0,6/10/2017,"A close friend of mine decided to host their birthday brunch at Sofrito's. I've visited the previous location for dinner on a couple of occasions and enjoyed my experience both times so I was looking forward to trying their brunch menu at the new Harlem location. My friend had a large group of friends about 15/20 people who attended the brunch and we all needed to be in attendance in order to be seated for my friends reservations. Once everyone arrived we were seated at a large dining table right in the middle of the restaurant. The scenery was beautiful, and the ambiance of the restaurant was also very nice. Everyone seemed to have been dressed in a dressy/causal fashion and seem to be there in celebration of various occasions, so there was a exciting and cheerful feel to the place. After being seated we were given menus to look over and it took a little while for our server to come back and take our orders. We were looking to take advantage of the $29.95 unlimited sangria/mimosa brunch special. Once our orders were placed we waited for our drinks to arrive for maybe 15 minutes are so. It was a rather large group so when it was times for drinks to be distributed we did have additional wait staff help our server. I had the white sangria which was delicious, it was served in a small mason jar accompanied by fresh cut apples, oranges and pineapples. The drinks were pretty strong and for the most part the server was attentive in providing refills and exchanges of drinks. The food took maybe half hour to maybe forty minutes to come out. It was a busy day and once again it was a large party, so the wait wasn't as bad as it could've been. Except when the food finally did come out two individuals within our group didn't have their meals brought out for sometime after the rest of group - It kind of put a dent in the whole experience. For the most part everyone enjoyed their meals, I ordered the Churrasco with eggs and home fries. The Churrasco was cooked to perfection and home fries were seasoned and tasty. The home fries had apples cut up into the dish which was a nice a touch, I would've liked to have had more home fries than apples though.  Don't think I'll return if it's with such a large group as this birthday brunch. I think it played a role with overall - just okay experience I had during this visit. I plan to pay the establishment another visit maybe on a one on one basis next time around.",2,0,0,M M.,"Parkchester, Bronx, NY",4,49,176

My co-workers and myself were refused seating because it was for bottle service only. We then decided to get a table and had to wait. Meanwhile three of my co-workers ordered drinks at the bar to pass the time and the bartender charged them a gratuity even though they ordered separately. One of my co-workers was asked to leave by the manager because she wore a baseball cap. He was very rude and she wanted to finish her drink. She was allowed to enter and buy drinks, but the manager wanted her to leave. She did leave with another co-worker.  Four of us stayed and were eventually  seated. The food was very good and we had a nice waitor. The DJ played good music, but inappropriate because this is not a club and there were children around. Also there were no souvenirs provided as other places I've been to give out sombreros, neclaces, etc. for the spirit of this celebration.  The prices were high also and the bar menu was unsatisfactory, small portions and expensive.

I went in for the Saturday brunch, the menu looked pretty interesting and who can go wrong with unlimited mimosas. We ordered the calamari as an appetizer and they tasted perfect. They were perfectly crisp and a beautiful color. The presentation was nice as well. I order the paella and after 35 minutes it came out. I was not complaining.. I was still drinking my mimosas. But as soon as I saw it I knew something was off. The color was unappetizing the presentation was just horrible. It looked as it they had a day old dry piece of chicken somewhere put it in the middle of the plate and placed other things around it. By that time I was already upset because our waiter had the worst attitude. I tasted the paella and knew I couldn't eat that. I told my waiter what I felt, just as a suggestion I was not expecting a change of plate or not to pay for my food. But at the price each plate has I needed to express my feeling towards the horrible meal placed in front of me. Eventually the ""chef"" came to my table with the WORST ATTITUDE. Basically saying ""people of color come play with the food and then expect not to pay because they don't like the taste"" I stoped him right away I couldn't have a conversation with such an immoral  uneducated person. Eventually he said we can pick something else of the menu but To not ""let it happen again"". By that time I was so over it but I was raised better, so I didn't just walk off.So just because he thinks something taste good I need to eat it.

We were meeting up with friends and they were coming in from New Jersey so it made sense to meet up at this location. Also my wife and I are always trying new brunch locations and we had yet to try Sofritos brunch. First the valet is a charge of 15 dollars that's very expensive even for NYC. We finally sit down the waiter comes over and does not introduce him self.  He takes our drink order 3 of us had the mimosas and 1 other who does not drink alcohol ordered a ginger ale. Let me say he barely came back to refill our mimosas we had to request refills. I have had bottomless at countless brunch locations in NYC and Southern Connecticut and that has never happened. We ordered our appetizers and the main course. I had the empanadas one beef and one chicken they were terrible they did not taste like homemade Puerto Rican empanadas they tasted like something from Costco, frozen and placed In a microwave. Then I ordered the chicken quesadilla what a mistake. What a small portion and once again it wasn't anything special. No here when it got worse, the place turns into a club the DJ came on which I love music but it was so loud we could carry a conversation also the table behind us was a group and they were acting well for a lack of a better word ghetto.

Even though we were there on time (as a matter of fact the entire party was there about 15 minutes early) we still had to wait approximately half an hour for a table.  When we did get seated, they didn't have enough space for everyone.  Two of our friends couldn't sit down and had to wait about 10 minutes to be accommodated.  They gave us a menu with a selection of appetizers, main course, and mimosas/Sangria.  Well, I don't know why they even have the options for apps because they brought us a platter of pork cubes, fried calamari, and empanadas to share.  Uhhhh....okay. I didn't want that but whatever.  We were, however, able to choose our main course.  I chose the pernil with arroz con gandules.

We finally saw our waiter and told him just cancel the appetizer at this point, he still charged us for it in the end, which wasted another 15 minutes waiting4th. The waiter was either shy or sexist, but he completely disregarded my existence all night and only waited on my boyfriend. Only asking him how his food was, how his drink was, etc. 5th. My food sucked... I got ropa vieja and it was gross , and the rice and beans tasted like it was sitting under a lighbulb all day like it was some sort of hispanic buffett in the kitchen.6th I asked what the dessert was, and the music was SO UNBELIEVABLY LOUD, that instead instead the waiter told my boyfriend what the list of desserts were because I was still just invisible.... at which point I told the waiter since I didnt hear anything I will not have anything so just give us the check.7th After he finally removed the extra appetizer we moved over to the bar for much needed drinks. The waitresses literally stood there texting. One of them right towards us...walked right past us, to get her phone. At this point we were waiting for Ashton Kutcher to come out because this was a such a joke  at this point that it could not be real...SO we ask the bartender excuse me can you call the manager - she jumps up and asks if we want a drink... clearly knowing why we wanted to see the manager. Fast forward the manager apologized to my complaint regarding the entire night, he comes back, and gives my boyfriend his business card at which point I am convinced they are all just sexist.  PS.

1.0,1/5/2017,"This review is for New Years Eve.  I am livid at the false statements provided by the staff prior to purchasing a $739 platinum package as we'll as the service provided. Before booking I called the restaurant to get information. I even took a site visit to scope out the place.Things I was told that we're not delivered:  1) If I purchased a table I could walk right in with my party. FALSE.  I had to wait in line with everyone else. 2) We would have seats for 10. FALSE, they gave us 3 seats. Then they tried to say that everyone doesn't get a seat when other platinum tables had 6 or more seats. 3) After reading last years issues I asked about the check in process. They said ""last year was our first year ...we have fixed our check in process. "" FALSE. I showed my printed ticket and I was not on the list. They then send me to another table to get scanned. Then I get a stamp. Then I had to go back to the line to pick up my party.  After getting patted down, they wouldn't let us in the club because we didn't have a wristband??? Seriously I couldn't believe the chaos.  Someone eventually came out and said oh yeah the stamp is good and let us in. Other things that went wrong. : 1) bottles took forever to come out. One pitcher of cranberry for 3 bottles of liquor ?? 2) we asked for our included champagne bottles around 11 30 so we could do a toast.  Since the staff was busy chatting in the kitchen ,we missed out. The bottles were sitting on a counter so we had to ask someone to hand it to us. 3) 2 bathrooms for ladies. Yes the entire place was packed and only 2 stalls.   4) we were seated in front of the only 2 bathrooms for the place. By midnight the line wrapped around our entire table.

3.0,12/27/2016,"Went here to celebrate Christmas Eve with friends and family (four of us). Hostess started out shitty as we entered and told us checking in our coats was mandatory by pointing to the sign and rolling her eyes. Looks like it wasn't enforced for everyone since we saw other people with coats on the back of their chairs. She got better by the end of our 3 minute interaction because we greeted her attitude with smiles. We had a reservation and we were about 5 minutes late. Be sure to get there within 15 minutes of your reservation or you'll lose it and they'll move on to the next guests (pretty standard). Decor was great, music was great but a little loud, food was awesome. Live music was actually great. People got up and danced in front of them. Waiter was great, quick service considering there were alot of people there. We all shared a sampler appetizer and ONE pitcher of sangria. The sangria tasted like cranberry juice so I wouldn't recommend it here. Two of us got mofongo as our entree, one got the HUGE pernil (look at my photos; it's huge), and the last got the ox tail. We got one dessert for the table. Our bill came out to $350 & ARRIVED WITH 18% GRATUITY INCLUDED. It's pretty standard with parties of 6 or more at restaurants to include tip but not with only 4 of us. Apparently they add gratuity once the bill hits $100 which is not stated anywhere. We likely would've tipped 20% as usual but it was annoying that the tip was included and it wasn't explained so we paid and moved on.

3.0,12/16/2016,"This was a lovely restaurant/bar in Riverside Park. Came here for a birthday happy hour after work. My friend/co-worker and I were early and enjoyed sangria while we waited at the bar for the birthday girl to arrive. She did not make a reservation and nevertheless were able to take up the bar side couches and chairs. My friend and I were first in the party to arrive a bit after 5, the place was empty we were let in with no problem. As the night wore on, I could see that there was a certain look to the patrons: women in fitted clothing, neatly dressed men. We were dressed for work, and our work does not have a stringent dress code. IMO, if we had come later (and not appropriately bundled up for the weather), I could see this review turning into a horror story about how this place is only trying to cultivate an image.Regarding the food: if you have gluten and/or dairy allergies like me, traditional Puerto Rican food is wonderful. I'm grateful to have been raised in this culture and have the skills to cook the food. That being said, I'm not quite certain what this menu is doing (Asian-American-Puerto Rican fusion?), but stick to the mofongo. It was good, if not a bit salty. It helped absorb some alcohol. Order it as a side and not an entree because its quite filling on its own. Why not five stars? I don't like blatant self-promotion. They were trying to get people to trend a hashtag with the restaurant's name this evening on any social media platform to earn a free drink.

2.0,12/12/2016,We went here for brunch with a baby shower crowd on a Sunday at noon.  What we found was an incredibly LOUD music scene more in line with a club than with Sunday brunch. But everyone there was just having brunch it wasn't as if there was a dance floor. The place has amazing views and ok food with unlimited mimosas or sangria. That would have bee ok for $35 pp. But after begging and pleading with staff to turn the music down we were left screaming at each other! We literally were passing notes around. There was a wedding party next to us and the family also asked to please have this music turned down to no avail. We talked to the manager and he would not budge. It was surreal. Again nobody was dancing just eating and screaming at each other. I have to say it put a damper on our celebration.

2.0,12/3/2016,"I can really honestly only give this place 2 stars and that's mostly for the location.  This place has an amazing view and the restaurant is chic and trendy.  Unfortunately that's about it.  We came as a group of 9 ladies for the Sunday pre-fixe brunch.  For 34.95 you get unlimited mimosas and a limited choice of food options; ropa vieja,  their version of a cubano sand which,  waffles and a few other options I don't remember.  It also comes with appetizers which I must say their empanadas are wonderful.  The chicharones we're mostly fat,  if not gristle and hard pieces  and the calamari was meh at best.  Once the food came,  everyone was excited,  but after a few bites and asking around the table,  everyone was mostly underwhelmed.  The sandwhich my friend and I ordered was dry and we had to ask for several sauces just to choke it down. We both wound up taking it to go and my leftovers sadly went to my dog. Also they have a DJ that spins while your eating and the music is so loud,  you can't enjoy conversation over the table.  This might be fun for evenings,  but for Sunday brunch it's kind of unappreciated.  Thankfully,  after about an hour of unlimited mimosas with clearly cheap champagne,  we started not to care and just went with it,  plus he was playing some decent jams. All in all,  for the price,  I don't think I would go back,  I just wasn't impressed.One thing to add though,  is we did have the dessert tray brought to out table and the flan is really good.",0,1,1,Lia M.,"Brooklyn, NY",52,41,91
1.0,11/28/2016,"Full disclosure--we did NOT eat or drink here--and likely never will. Our impression of Sofrito's during a quick visit to check out the restaurant that was formerly Tian was not good.  The space is pretty and the views were great, but immediately upon entry we felt unwelcome.  Why? Well, the restaurant has a dress code (which is scotch-taped to the inside of the front door) stating guests cannot wear hats, shirts without collars, any kind of athletic apparel,   and a few other odd restrictions.Okay, I get that you want to be an upscale restaurant, but really? No shirts without collars? So--no sweaters without a collared shirt? And no hats?  I've been in upscale restaurants around the world and have never been asked to remove my hat (which I was upon entry at Sofrito's).  We were literally 6 feet from the front door and about 60 yards from patrons at the other end of the mostly empty restaurant.  Maybe they don't want sweaty ""unfashionable"" people coming in off the ball field or track across the road (the restaurant is INSIDE a state park), in a jersey, but lets be real. My wife and I were taking a long exercise walk on an early Sunday afternoon, and while going through the park we wanted to see what the new place looked like and check out the menu.  We weren't dressed like bums, but the look we got from a woman standing near the bar who appeared to be a manager, well, you might have thought we had just finished a shift cleaning sewers. Honestly, the sneery look on her face was comical. As my wife commented to Sneery, that the revamped space looked nice, the woman moved toward her with a very, ""What can I do for you"" vibe--but not in a helpful, customer service way--if you catch my drift.  The young hostess at the door (who asked me to remove my hat), was pleasant and professional, but she appeared terrified that we might decide to stay and ask to be seated.No worries--that's not likely to happen--ever.",5,4,1,Bruce C.,"New York, NY",10,27,7

I chose the strawberry mojito which taste great & cost $10. After I entire party arrived we were seated. Since our party was so large we were given a preselected menu with a set prices of $35 per person. We were given several appetizers; roast pork, chicken, empanadas (chicken & beef), shrimp, calamari, and plantains. All of which taste great. We were presented with a menu to an preselected entrees. We had a chose of a pork dish, shrimp dish, or chicken. I chose the shrimp with rice. We were told our package included free red & white sangria. Once the food arrived I was amazed at the amount of food we were given. The shrimp and rice was loaded with shrimp and taste great. You will definitely take a doggie bag home due to the amount of food you receive. Everyone in our party enjoyed there food. We were also given a choice of dessert which was flan or a slice of cake. I choose the cake and it also taste great and was moist. Here is where the problems started. When the bill arrived we were charged for several pitchers of sangria. The restaurant staff brought out a total of 8 pitchers and charged us for 6. We called for the manager who explained only 2 pitchers of sangria was free with the package.

1.0,9/23/2016,"Bring your own food and drink if you insist on going to Sofrito. That's a shame because the setting lends itself to a special evening, but the rest of the equation is extremely disappointing. With a view of the Hudson that should mate brilliantly with a fine kitchen and competent crew, Sofrito totally bombs on both of the latter counts. After reading comments about the place in the New Yorker, we couldn't wait to go, but figured out quickly that we'd have to lower our expectations.We went on a balmy midweek evening and fewer than a half dozen tables were occupied. Adjacent to the tables, there was a bar with stools as well as an area with couches even closer to the water. The latter was more attractive, but off limits if you just wanted to eat. No one sat there at any time while we were there.After we were seated, we were given menus and our drink order was taken. We ordered mojitos. One was fair; the other had to be sent back.For sustenance, we tried a variety of dishes that were noted in the New Yorker. We ate them reluctantly rather than filling up at McDonald's on the corner of 145th and Broadway. They were, at best, edible.The service people were all friendly, though unlikely to have had any training. As an example, when my water glass was empty the bus boy always asked if I wanted him to fill it. Note to bus boy: Just fill it. Don't ask.One bright note: The bread was good.Why go at all? If you like blaring music and are prepared to drink anything that pretends to be a decent cocktail, you might take a chance. But don't say you weren't warned.What this setting needs is a really talented chef and a top notch supporting staff to make this a truly memorable experience. Sofrito is nowhere near what it could be and is not worthy of a long run without massive improvement. Most unfortunate!",0,1,0,Russell W.,"Weston, CT",3,76,0
3.0,9/22/2016,"I came back although I promised myself I would not (after spending $130 with my boyfriend on Valentines day and leaving annoyed and like we trashed our money). This time I came for brunch on a Saturday. They have a prix fixe menu which was good, appetizer, entrée and unlimited drinks for about $30 (you can't switch your drinks though). The chicken empanadas were delicious, my bf got the calamari which he liked, and other friends got the empanadas too. Sangria was delicious. The entrees however were a bit of a disappointment, the French toast were tasteless and weird, the ropa vieja looked so tasty but was flavorless too. I want to love this restaurant because the view and the atmosphere are so beautiful, but its just not worth the money.

The interior of the restaurant and the view are Beautiful!!!!! Spacious and holds plenty of patrons. I won't come here unless I'm made to. The location is not really convenient if you don't drive and coming from BK or Queens. The restaurant is also located INSIDE the park. So ladies, make sure you have your flats in your bag. Now to the food...Brunch was a pre-fix menu. I enjoyed the appetizers, fried pork, empanadas, and calamari. Delicious. Or I was just that hungry. We had 3 rounds of drinks. I stuck to my white sangria and it was SO GOOD! YUM!For the entree, I ordered the pineapple french toast. The concept was cute, it smelled delicious, but after 2 bites, it was too much. I felt like I was eating raisin bran cereal. Too much. If you live in Harlem or the BX and want to celebrate with a large party, this place is for you.

I also like that brunch comes with an Appitizer.  Brunch was mediocre  I feel like sofrito has lots it's flare since coming to this location. I haven't been for dinner but now I am questioning if dinner is any good. I often got the seafood paella minus the pork. It was an amazing dish. This location is great it definitely  beats going all the way downtown. They do offer valet parking not sure of the price.  If you take the train I would suggest taking the 1 train if you can. If not you can take many other trains and catch the 19 bus which takes you into riverbank.

After being seated, tables were so close together, you can literally hear everyone's conversation sitting next to you, even with the Music being so loud, it was ridiculous. Not what you would expect from an upscale restaurant. (maybe after hours its understandable). Food was good and waiter was friendly. Drink prices are way too high, $12 for 1 drink full of ice. Nice view of the Hudson river. I would definitely not return and i would not recommend to a friend. This is not a place to go on a date for dinner, drinks and conversation.

2.0,8/1/2016,Let me start of by saying that the decor of the restaurant is extremely beautiful and the view of the Hudson is breath taking. However the problem that I have with this restaurant is that the food seems like your typical Dominican restaurant but over priced. My waiter barely came to check up my table and didn't ask if I wanted water. It's crazy how much they charge for such a simple food like rice and beans. My boyfriend ordered the honey glaze salmon with rice and beans. The salmon was extremely over cooked to say the least. I ordered the grilled shrimp with yuca fried and a Mango chili sauce. The problem I had with my dish was that is was extremely oily and how could it be so oily if the food was grilled. I honestly really wanted this place to be amazing just because the restaurant is beautiful. But honestly DO NOT COME HERE the food and simple and overpriced. There are much better restaurants near by.,0,0,0,Iris V.,"Crown Heights, Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0

Food was good. I had the churrasco salad ehich was delish! Two of us had it and enjoyed it very much. Two of our party had the tilapia and coconut dish, steak and eggs and ropa vieja-all were perfect portions and very tasty.Appetizers were served family style as usual, chicken and beef empanadas, pork chunks and calamari. The empanadas were amazing and filling but the calamari and pork for the first time were a bit dry and slightly overcooked.The deserts were delicious and so were the Sangrias. Server was Noel and he was attentive, kind and quick. Actually, service was better today than ever. All of the bussers and servers were great! Now the only cons are:PARKING- I hate that there is a valet fee of $15 per vehicle-even if dining at the restaurant.Reservations and reservationists- THE WORST!! I called a few times to book and I could not even get 1 answer answered bc I was booking a party of 8 or more. They would not even assist!!! They were CLUELESS as to the food, menu, scheduling, and had no clue if live music would be playing. They really could not answer 1 question! Pretty saf and discouraging.My last con was/is that the hostess said the brunch would include unlimited drinks for a duration of two hours. Well, once our meal was over they called last call  in less than 1.5 hrs. (I felt as if they were rushing us though no one was waiting).Overall we had a lovelytime, enjoyed the food and the lovely talented live music.

Once we sat inside it was more cold inside then out. I asked several people that work there to adjust the temperature and no one did so. We didn't get out drinks until 30 minutes of seating. Our appetizers came out 20 mins after cold. We soon after got out food, I ordered the surf and turf (mar y tierra) the shrimp was bland and the steak was super tough, I could barely chew it. I asked for refills and they would come super after I asked and then they have the nerve to charge you for refills. I had quenched my thirst on the water waiting for my soda and they expect you to pay for a tall glass of ice and a little bit of soda. Lastly they had the nerve to charge my table of four gratuity. They said that they do that on Sunday's. Why should I leave a 50 dollar tip on over priced food, bad food and bad service. I asked him why and he said its mandatory on Sunday's, I told him no the hell it isn't. My friends still left a huge tip which is why I'm writing this review. They should not be getting away with charging so much for a place that smells like shit and treat there customers like shit. This is my third time there so it's not like I'm judging off of my first visit. My first bill was 800.00 My second bill was 470 around thereAnd 300 this time.

Some of their menu items i was able to switch. Like the mofongo i was able to switch to sweet plantains instead of the green one. Traditional PR is green but i have been obsessed with the dish trifongo ever since i came back from PR. The pernil is huge and not a disappointment at all. The drinks could be a little stronger.

3.0,7/5/2016,"This restaurant's outward appearance and inner decor is lovely. I really liked the set up of the interior. I loved the hot pink-ish, purple light fixtures coming down from the ceilings and the colorful, light, airy ambiance of the whole place. There were huge windows surrounding the restaurant, which let the natural light come in, giving a pretty glow. Plus, outside there is a beautiful park with a nice view of the water. I just wish the place was easier to get to, as I had to take the train all the way up to 145 St then a bus to get all the way West to Riverside Drive so it took awhile to get all the way back home to Queens. Overall, I had a great time with some gal pals and we enjoyed our time here. I just wish that we could have sat outside but the night we went, the weather was unpredictable so they closed off the outdoor area. Also, some of the food was not up to par with my standards and the music was quite loud so it was difficult to hold a conversation. I understand that Sofrito is a place for fun and dancing though so I can't really hold the loud music against them too much since that is part of their brand. The appetizers sounded amazing so when the waiter told us about an appetizer special consisting of around 5 items which would only be $10 per person, I was ready to try it because I felt like it was a great deal. Unfortunately, my group wasn't sold so I ended up not getting any. However, a couple people in my group did order appetizers so I was able to try a couple at least. I sampled the CHICHARRÓN DE POLLO and RELLENOS DE PAPA. The first was crispy fried chicken chunks, but they were more like wings. They tasted like typical wings: Nothing to write home about. I liked the other appetizer better, which was potato puff stuffed with beef. The beef stuffing was flavorful and yummy! Before the food came, we were given complimentary garlic bread. I really appreciated the gesture, but it wasn't that great. There was only a little bit of garlic on it, so there wasn't much of a garlic flavor and the bread itself was a bit dry and tasteless.For my main course, I decided to go with the fried pork chops. The meal came with one side so I chose tostones. The presentation was very nice and the pork chop was quite good. It was juicy, full of robust flavor and seasoning with yummy sauce. It was just a little bit dry but otherwise I enjoyed the pork chop. The tostones were mediocre though. They were crispy and I liked the texture and there was some flavor but it wasn't very strong. After the meal, I decided to order one of the desserts to share. The warm chocolate bread pudding with caramel sauce and French Vanilla ice cream sounded appetizing to both of us, so we picked that one. We were both disappointed by this dessert. The ""bread pudding"" was a small piece of cake with powdered sugar on top and the ice cream was melted. One of my friends told me that the ""bread pudding"" was the Spanish version but I only like the American kind... So, the cake itself was decent. It was sweet, but not too sweet and it was moist and had the lovely taste of chocolate and caramel. However, the ice cream could not be enjoyed at all. When it came time to pay, I needed change but the waiter was nowhere to be found so I asked someone else to retrieve my change. The person who took my change had a bit of an attitude over it and had someone else bring back the change to me. I found that to be kind of strange. Anyway, the restaurant had us fill out a survey about our experience and later they called me to tell me I won a $25 gift certificate, which was pretty cool. Unfortunately, I have not been able to use it because I have been so busy and to be honest, I wouldn't even think of going back if I didn't have the gift card. I just wasn't impressed by the food or service, and distance wise it is too far from where I live.",10,6,6,Kathy X.,"Queens, NY",783,438,5876

We couldn't do anything about the club-style music so we had to do our best to ignore it, even though we were seated as far back as possible. They have a patio option but it was not available, unfortunately. I must say the $15 Valet is quite pricey. I prefer to park in the neighborhood and enjoy the walk into the park. You must show your ID whether you look old enough or not, even before 6 pm, which I found very weird but it must be policy. We couldn't be seated until our entire party was available, but it was prompt. The waitress was very friendly.

1.0,6/24/2016,"Brunch Review: Ooh it's bad. I had brunch once at their previous location a few years ago and it wasn't such a wtf experience like this one. From the food, to the drinks, to the service it was a complete waste of money. I love brunch and I certainly understand that sometimes boozy brunches can be a hit or miss when it comes to the food...but all Sofrito has to offer is a view. That's it. Sofritos boozy brunch included bottomless mimosas or sangria, appetizer and entrée for 29.99 The mimosas were terrible. I think they used old OJ. Everyone around me made faces when they took a sip. The sangrias were decent, but the waitress always had to be called for refills. If other waiters pass by they don't bother refilling drinks, just take care of their own tables. Even when asked, they could not be bothered and would go fetch our waitress. The lack of communication between them certainly showed.  The edges of my French Toast were burned. My friend did not like the taste of her ropa vieja and there was something odd about the flavor of everyone's rice as well. No one finished their meal and we did not bother staying for the full 2 hours as both the food and drinks were terrible. There must be a different owner, management, & chef that took over.

1.0,6/24/2016,"Came here yesterday for my niece's graduation dinner, party of 7. Called ahead, spoke to someone who said sure, we can accomodate you. When we arrive, we are greeted to a $15 pretty much mandatory Valet charge. Otherwise you have to park the equivalent of 6 blocks over the  bridge on the street. And NO, they don't waive the fee after you dine here. So I walked in not too happy. The restaurant is pretty empty, yet I am asked if I have reservations and who did I speak to. No one seemed to know who I was talking about. With the restaurant being mainly empty, I didn't see why it mattered, but yet we had to wait 25 minutes for them to join 2 tables together. We sat outside to avoid the really loud music, (good music, just loud) but were quickly ran back inside by bugs. Our waiter Eddie was very nice and the bartender made me a great drink. Unfortunately, there was a very long waiting time for everyone else's drinks and food. Food was bland overall. No Latin flavors. Just cooked meat. Mofungo was DRY. Like choke to death dry. Water was constantly flowing, but I now realize it was because the manager was overheard telling the staff to watch our table. Because of course the table full of black women are going to skip on the bill. Mind you, my party consisted of 2 senior citizens....my mother, sister in law, her mother and her 3 adult children. The manager who was super dismissive, when I spoke to him regarding the parking fee. He basically said people spend way more money than we did and don't complain. I guess those people have never been anywhere else to eat and don't know their own worth. I sure know mine!!!I will absolutely not be back here and don't suggest you go either unless you are Hispanic where the red carpet is rolled out for you.

1.0,6/24/2016,I was initially excited to try this place because of the location. A friend and me sat by the bar which had a very small crowd. We waited for a long time to just see a menu and we had to waive over and over so we can get service. We ordered appetizer and I ordered wine. The bartender Daniel gives me the wine in a PLASTIC cup!!!! ?? I was just shocked. For such a classy looking place by the water and having more than 10 different types of wines/champagnes on their menu getting wine in a plastic cup was beyond belief. It felt like I was  in someone's backyard at a house party in college. I called the server to give me a wine glass and he rolled his eyes like I was making a fuss. I then told him I will be switching to liquor if that's the case. He then asked another server to bring a wine glass and poured the drink in a proper wine glass. Why didn't he just do that initially? I had high hopes for this place but what a disappointment. No wonder it is so empty.,1,0,0,abby t.,"Santa Clara, CA",2,56,9

Second We went to celebrate Fathers Day, we were sitting in 8 mins (good), Our waitress pissed me off so bad, He ask for orders, this is ok; He recommended a Picadera for everyone, we agreed and order our drinks. He started asking for entré already and our appetizer hasn't been served yet, I said bring the Picadera first and then we decided. Around 7-10 min He again started rushing us to order but our appetizer is not ready He said is coming. I started to get irritated because he start rushing for order every 5 mins. Then we get tired of he's temperament and canceled order and asked for the bill. We got two alcoholic drinks and 3 non alcoholic beverage, one Picadera for everyone (4 people) and our bill was extremely high going for 239 dollars unbelievable for this few things. Them I reviewed my bill and they were charging 4 times the Picadera for 180 dollars just this, I asked for manager and complained about the amount, and definitely I was overcharged.

1.0,6/19/2016,"AWFUL!! I went with 7 other friends for my birthday dinner and the service was terrible! From the moment we walked in we were rushed to sit down and any questions we had were rudely answered followed by, so ""are y'all gonna eat here or not."" My friend made a reservation for 10 at 8pm, 2 if my friends couldn't come so those who were able to make it, all meet at the restaurant at 9pm (8 of us in total). While we were waiting for a table the hostess rushed us to our table while we were picking up our bags and getting our stuff together. When we sat down we were forced to order from the ""special menu"" that is $45 a person. They weren't able to give us Separate checks so it was about $55 per person at the end. After getting over the fact that we had no choice but to spend at minimum $45, the menu was AWFUL! It comes with 3 appetizers for the table to share that was 1000000 times better than the entrées! There were literally 4 or 5 options on that menu for us to choose from. We couldn't pick what kind of rice or beans we wanted. My boyfriend ordered the grilled chicken with mash potatoes and the chicken was literally uncooked at the top and there was one scoop of mashed potatoes on his plate like a single ice cream scoop!!! My rice was COLD and my beans had no flavor(honestly your local Latin restaurant near your home is better tasting than this) none of our food was worth $45. My other friend ordered her steak medium well and her steak was wayyyyyyyyy to bloody. We were thirsty for 20 minutes before we were able to get the attention of the manger (who was a jerk) for some water! The desert was okay but the food was so awful it made us upset. Btw, out of the 8 of us, only 6 of us ordered because 2 of them did not want to spend $45 so they split the bill with someone. This is why I was annoyed because although we were a group of 8 only 6 of ordered so we wanted a regular menu but the manger kept saying our reservation was for 10 people mind you the 8pm reservation was canceled because 2 of my friends couldn't make it and we redid our reservation of 8 at 9pm. As we looked around the restaurant, groups of 9,10,11,12 people were ordering food with big amounts of food on their plates , YELLOW RICE, DIFFERENT KINDS OF BEAN OPTIONS, DIFFERENT MEAT OPTIONS! we wanted to know what menu they were all ordering from because my table was told that when its 8 or more people at this time of night only that menu is available for the chefs to make ..... Obviously not!!! My table was nice, calm & polite despite the attitude we kept getting from the moment we walked up to the place so I didn't understand why we were being treated this way. It was my birthday and I didn't want to argue with anyone but I found myself having to talk to the mangers tooooo many times and he did not give us any type of accommodations what so ever !!  The music was good but the experience, the service and the food was TERRIBLE!

1.0,5/23/2016,"If I could give this place a negative rating I would. Their service has declined DRASTICALLY since they became Sofrito's as opposed to Riverbank Grill. Their food is way overpriced as well as their drink special. I ordered the huevos rancheros which indicated that the entree came with beans. The plate has maybe 20 beans on it max. It looks more like a garnish than a part of the actual meal. Their mimosas are basically orange juice. If I'm paying for a mimosa I expect to see some champagne in there. The service could be much better. It took about 10 minutes for someone to get us water and take our drink orders. And when I asked one of the wait staff if he was our waiter or if we should be expecting someone else soon, he answered with a bit of an attitude. Noel ended up being our server and was very nice throughout the meal. The look of the place gives the impression that it's more of a classy establishment. But if you're going to be ""classy"" I would suggest keeping the place more presentable. We were able to see a table with serving trays, dirty dishes and a staff member eating at one point. That stuff should be left for behind the scenes. I understand if the staff needs to eat but maybe pick a better location. It seemed strange for me to see this ""break table"" while I was trying really hard to enjoy my meal.I really wish this place would step it up.

The least someone could have done was signal us over or be sorry for having us sit there, not to mention my hair got messed up. The wait for our table wasn't horrible. About 15 mins. I found the ladies at the front a little condescending and just not friendly . By this point I was having seconds thoughts and wishing I had taken heed to the other reviews.

2.0,5/8/2016,The reason I am writing this review and giving it a bad review is because when my entire family came into Sofrito we wanted to enjoy it. What happened was we ended up walking out because of the restaurants stubbornness. It is Mother's Day and we made a reservation a month in advanced and the restaurant even called us to confirm our reservation but they didn't bother to tell us about the fixed menu. The entire menu only had meat but that is no issue for me just for my father and one of my sisters who are vegetarians. We asked if they could help us out but they refused to provide the regular menu just for those 2 people so we could all enjoy Mother's Day together. When we spoke with the manager they budged saying all we can offer is a salad and that's it. The worst being the plate was $55 on Mother's Day.

Maybe they had a staff training prior to my experience because everyone was so friendly and polite.I have recommended my friends and family check this place out as most of them miss the old one on 59th! Can't wait to visit again esp in the summer when they'll be outdoor seating.,0,0,0,Tara S.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",65,308,271
2.0,4/11/2016,"The location is better than its previous E57th St digs. It feels a lot more open with the wall of ceiling to floor windows. The view of the Hudson is quite nice. Came here for my birthday dinner with my husband and adult son.  I've been to Sofrito restaurants many times in White Plains and Manhattan so I knew what to expect as far as the food (B-).  However, when the bill came this time, I noticed the tip was already included.  Not only were we just 3 people but the waiter didn't bother to share the information with us.  When I told him how unusual that is to tack on tip when it's only a party of three he tried to apologize and gave us a sob story about how sometimes he gets very little by way of tips from people.  Well, hmmm, let me translate...He profiled us (#1) and by being sneaky and not telling us meant he might have been double tipped (#2).  I could tell our waiter was embarrassed for the situation but not sure about which one #1 or #2.",0,0,0,Toni P.,"Norwalk, CT",0,7,0

The food was just below basic, the service was mediocre (scattered meals brought to the table and it took a while to get basic things like a cutting knife) and it was quite warm in the space. They also don't have a non-alcohol menu price for brunch and the food alone isn't worth $29.99. Not by any means. We had a pregnant woman with us and she had to pay the regular brunch price?

So my friends mistakenly gave a 40% tip without realizing it. The food was greasy, overly fried and barely edible and yet somehow not cheap.

1.0,3/11/2016,"I went here about a week ago with a large party and I had a  horrible experience and I am not one to complain but the amount of money that was spent I have to. Our party  consisted of many people from different states including myself and I could not believe what I experienced.When we arrived our party was not all there yet so we waited in area where  you can have drinks the young lady who was taking down the order did not have any knowledge of the alcohol menu when one of my friends asked for a certain beer brand from the menu she said, ""Huh, what is that??"" (meanwhile it was listed on the menu). Then when all of our party arrived they wanted us to sit right next to the DJ speakers, we requested to be moved. They moved us then we got to our seats they threw our appetizers on the table and started rushing our orders, no one was also claiming to be our waiters, one of my friends had to get up and complain we had no waiters and we had large party the manger then sent two waiters to us. The whole experience was unacceptable for the price we paid the the staff was incompetent and not organized to handle a large party and it was slow night hardly no one was there, so I can only imagine on a night when the restaurant has more of a crowd. Keep in mind the food they serve you can get at any cuchifritos in NYC for $7.00 you are paying the extra $15.00 for service and I am sorry its not worth it.WARNING: We were told if we had a large party you had to sign a contract and we had to put a credit card down and pick a pre-fix menu and there was also an option for liquor package which was suppose to consisted of of unlimited drinks for one hour. I found out later that everyone had to agree to the open bar package even if you don't drink if one person said no you could not do it and I was forced to say yes either though I am four months pregnant and can not drink, so my drinks were just sitting there while I drank water and the waiter refused to services anyone who did finish there drink until I drank mines, so in order to get a next round EVERYONE has to be done, so people where drinking mine because obviously I could not drink. Then the open bar choice is not unlimited for an hour they cut you off after three drinks and they take their time serving you the last drink. My friends drank more then the three because they complained NO where in the contract did it say only three drinks in the unlimited drink open bar option. Like I said it was a horrible experience, I will never recommend anyone here who visits NY, and its kind of sad because the place has so much potential, if they were to improve on their service this restaurant would attract a certain class of people and be a hit, but until then the place is not worth going to.",4,0,0,Ive C.,"Brookfield, CT",0,2,0

1.0,2/28/2016,"I've always had an affinity for the Sofritos in midtown. Thus, when I saw Sofritos had a beautiful new location I was super excited to celebrate my Birthday there on a Saturday night alondside my sister-in-law as our Bdays are a week apart. My sister-in-law attempted to make reservations earlier in the day but was told it was too late. When we arrived I walked in because no one was at the valet booth. I found all the valet men relaxed inside. I asked if I could have some assistance as I'd like valet parking. They responded ""Oh you can park it yourself for free"" In my head Im like okay if thats what I wanted I wouldn't be asking you lol but whatever I went to park the car on my own. We were told it was a 45 minute wait. When we asked the hostess 45 minutes later her response was ""I dont know"" 2 hours later we were seated. They completely forgot about the appetizers and brought out the entree first. I cant stress how extremely disappointed I was with my experience at this new location. You can barely hear the music which completely killed the vibe. When I expressed my concern to DJ Dinero his response was extremely rude. He said "" I just play the music I don't control the volume"" He then proceeded to ignore me. I found the Manager and asked him the same question and he agreed with me. He went back to DJ Dinero and all of a sudden DJ Dinero had the power to make it a little bit louder. Now like any other Latina when you go to a spot called Sofritos you go because you're excited to hear Latin music...not hip hop and r&b. Although great genres but thats not why I came to Sofritos. When I and multiple of my friends expressed our concern for Latin music DJ Dinero completely ignored us. I'm not sure why he's a DJ when he has no charisma, his music selection is poor and he clearly hates human interaction.

1.0,2/28/2016,"If I could give this place zero stars I would.  A lot of of things happened at this place that I rate it the 2nd worst place I've experienced so far. 1. I called to make a dinner reservation and they said sorry we only take one week in advance dinner reservations. I then asked what is I want to have dinner tonight and the host said you can come in and put your name and wait for a table to free up.2. I get to the place at 9 and put in my name for a party of 4 and the host says it's a 30-45min wait. I figured the place was packed and I will wait up to 1hr. My guests got there at 9:30pm. At 9:45pm I went up to host and asked her how much longer is the wait. She had such an attitude and was like i can't tell you I said 30-45min but it's going to be more cause there is one more party before you. Then at 10:10pm my boyfriend went up to ask her the same thing and she again with her attitude said the same thing. Then at 10:20 my friend and I went up to ask her once again and she gave us the same rude response. We didn't get seated until 10:40 which was 1hr and 40min wait. I was so upset but so hungry that at that point I just cared about eating.3. We get seated and we ordered everything at once, drinks, appetizers, and dinner. We get our dinner food and appetizers are nowhere to be found. I asked the waitress to not bring them out and what happened the appetizers come out towards end of meal with a bogus apology from waitress.4. My friend brought me a birthday cake. They bought out the cake with lights and I was actually happy at this point until the following happened. I blew out the lights and my friend asked waitress for plates and forks to cut the cake. THIS WAS THE WORST PART OF NIGHT...WAIT....the waitress says it's going to be $3 per person to slice the cake!!!!! I've never heard of this. My friend who bought me the cake couldn't believe it. I was so pissed at this point. We then asked waitress to pack up the rest of cake and she had an attitude.5. I had made bottle reservation one week in advance to be at lounge to celebrate my birthday. Big mistake. We got seated and our bottle host was actually really nice and polite and attentive. She was the best thing of night. But then the DJ came on. The music was crap!!! We would go up to DJ and ask him to play Spanish music and he would nod his head but never played Spanish music. I thought this place was called Sofrito which would play a lot of Spanish music. This was the main reason I booked bottle service! At some point my entire group of friends were just sitting looking at each other waiting for at some point good music to come on.The crazy part is the place is at a great location next to water and the decor is beautiful but the customer service blows bad. The food was actually really good too but again the really bad customer service made the experience bad. I will never come to this location again.

I said FIne.. please seat us.  I stood there for 10 minutes while she fidgeted with the screen... finally I said - hey when are you going to seat us?  her response: I dont know - we dont have any tables....uhhhhh excuse me? I have a reservation!  She says yes - but we are overbooked, and went back to chewing her gum...real fast.... In my head Im thinking so why the whole conversation just 15 mins ago about not letting my late guests sit down... I asked the next logical question: Do yu have a guesstimate in time, how long before we are seated?  Without looking up and I swear she somehow said this woithout ever stopping her chewing "" I dunno""  so I ask for the manager.  SURELY the manager will be appalled and he will HANDLE this....yeah ummm NOPE! he comes over rudely and says we will seat you when something opens... now mind you - I didnt just show up,.. I booked this reservation days ago.. I filled out their credit card authorization form to guarantee my personalized menu (which I was charged for and NEVER received) and to cover no show etc....My mom taught me never to hit anyone under 4 ft tall - so I had to call my boyfriend over to talk to him.. because I flt my left hand itching..you know that itch where you just come out of character and go on a slapping fest? yes - it was about to happen... So the little manager shows my boyfriend a table of people who are closing out their check - says to him ""they are closing out now so you will be seated next""....20 mins later... they are seating someone else,,,, I somehow make it over to the little manager in 0.3 seconds although Im teetering in my louboutins...this LITTLE MAN tells me that he NEVER told my boyfriend that he would seat us - he simply showed him the table and said - oh they are settling their check and leaving soon.. ""Hh? what? that doesnt even make sense!!!!... I know I know.. if you are still reading youre likely thinking.. why didnt you leave?? I didnt because I had 20 something people in an isolated area and it was late... no where to go and I was gonna celebrate my birthday by hook or by crook!!!!!Im going to bypass my further argument with the lil manager who suggested we should have arrived at 8:30 pm for a 10 pm reservation...yup gonna skip right by him telling my friends that even though I paid 15 per person that no showed - if they didnt like what was on the menu they couldnt sit down....Im gonna go to the point where they butchered my birthday cake..it looked like an abortion..Oh wait.. Im not done yet..so that credit card I provided them - it had NEVER been used before or after the party.. it was NEW and they only folks outside of myself and the bank that had the info was.. SOFRITOS.  fast forward to Monday Feb 15th - im curled up on the sofa with a cup of hot chocolate and a splash of baileys irish cream... and the phone rings..its the bank... theres suspicious activity on my card....turns out SOMEBODY is using my card online to purchase stuff from Forever 21.com..ModLilly..Saucey.com Delviverrightnow.com and PapaJohns.com  to the the tune of 1200.00......sounds like a young girl to me.. bc my backside is way too large for any of those clothes and lets be honest - its where a young girl that likes to chew gum really fast, would shop....I did call Sofritos and I spoke to the GM (I suspect it was the same lil man) he said he would let the owners know....I ran out of space and cant type anymore - so JUST DONT GO THERE!!!!o",8,3,0,Bailey B.,"New York, NY",509,30,11

3.0,2/4/2016,"I give it 3.5 stars. I remember going to the old location on 57th street and 1st ave. It was the first time i had ever been to a restaurant that enforced a dress code. That was also the first time i had ever tasted churrasco and i instantly loved it. I remember how packed it would get; once i waited 2 hours to be seated for dinner. On certain days, there would even be a live band playing salsa music. Some of the tables and chairs would be pulled of the floor, so that a few couples could be able to dance. Anytime i went, there were at least 10 people who happened to be celebrating their birthday that night. I was finally able to make it to this location. My cousin wanted to try it out, so we went after our comedy show at the Apollo. I checked online to find out exactly what was the address of this new location. Before even arriving i was already worried; worried about the fact that this new location is directly above a pollution plant. When we finally entered the park where the restaurant is, we had to wait on line for the mandatory valet parking; it was $15 dollars. Once inside the actual restaurant, the first thing that caught my attention was the view of the bridge; it was pretty nice and really clear, like the view at La Marina. We were told the wait was 45 minutes; not bad for a party of 5 on a late saturday night. So we sat at the bar, which was pretty long and seemed to have a huge variety of different liquors. We decided to order some appetizers while we waited at the bar. By the time we made up our minds on what to order, it was time to be seated.     For an appetizer, my cousin ordered the Sofrito Roll and i ordered the Cuban Roll. I dont know why i pictured in my head something like an egg roll when we ordered this. When it finally arrived at our table and i realized it was actually a sushi roll, i was like wtf. Anyways, even though im not a fan of cold food, the Cuban Roll wasnt bad. It had pork, plantain, cream cheese, and some other stuff in it. It reminded me of something out of Mamasushi. It was nothing out of this world. My cousin was starving and devoured her order before i could taste hers.     For entrees, my boys girlfriend ordered the Arroz Con Pollo, my boy ordered the Rabo Encendio, my cousin ordered the Mofongo Al Pilon with shrimp, and i ordered the Chuletas De Cerdo grilled with Rice and Peas. I loved my order. They gave me 3 well sized pork chops, nicely grilled, not too fatty, and perfectly seasoned. The rice and peas were also on point; not too bland, not too salty, and not too excessive like the amount of rice youre served when ordering chinese takeout. I ate all of it, despite the fact that i had just dined a few hours earlier at Penthouse 808. Unfortunately for everyone else, their experience wasnt the same. My boy is jamaican, so perhaps they cook their ox tail differently, but according to him his order was too salty. My cousin had the same complaint about her mofongo. Neither 1 of them bothered to finish their food. Everyone was waiting for me to order dessert, but i was to stuffed to eat anymore, so noone ordered anything else.     Overall, i can see why the owners moved up here from the old location in midtown. The place is definately more spacious and parking is a huge convenience to customers. Of course the view of the bridge makes a big difference, especially in the summertime when you can sit outside. The very loud noise level and lack of elegant decor prevents me from saying that this place is ideal for a date, but im sure a woman would find the view very romantic at night. Our waitress was ok; not the most attentive but she did her job. With all that said, i felt like it was missing a lot of the essence of the old location. Theres was no live band and i didnt see anyone celebrating their birthday. One of the biggest differences i noticed was the lack of diversity. At the old location you would see all races and nationalities, not just a bunch of latinos and a few blacks. Not complaining, but i just felt like i was at a restaurant completely different from how i remember Sofrito. I wouldnt mind returning.",3,2,0,Papi Chulo A.,"Morrisania, NY",30,35,1166

Our group was situated in the back half of the restaurant and I'm pretty sure there was only 1 person attempting to take drink orders for at least 50 people which led to us all waiting at least 30 minutes for a drink, if you ever got your drink at all. Instead of passing around the appetizers, they would just place them down on certain tables so I never even had the chance to try one as I wasn't about to lean over people sitting down to attempt to get a bite. Next, once seated, they took our main course orders and when it came time to bringing them to the table, they messed up who ordered what and we all ended up having to help direct them. Given the confusion with the orders, many people had to wait a long time for them to bring out what they actually ordered. I went with the chicken dish- it was completely flavorless and dry! There was a side of yuca which was a disgrace as it was a flavorless, mushy mess. Service was slow, unfriendly and actually some of the worst I have ever experienced.Despite them calling this place a taste of Puerto Rico, I guarantee you, it is NOT.

I told the manager,  he told me that he was going to give me a card for me to contact the owners.  Isnt that his job?!?  to rectify the issue with his staff for future issues. My wife asked the server for coffee.  Server says we dont serve any fancy coffee here.  Did he think we came to starbucks. When it was time to leave,  the server gave me a plastic bag for take away,  that you get from a corner store.  I asked him can I get a paper bag,  he said we dont have that.  My sister says,  what is that over there on their table.  Then he gets the paper bag.  Terrible service. Never came back to fill our water, never explained the menu when serving us, or never came back in a reasonable amount of time to see how we were doing. The place was not even packed.

1.0,1/5/2016,"This review is for their New Year's party, I believe run by Riverbank Restaurant LLC. We purchased tickets in advance for the party and showed up at 10pm for the open bar that ran from 10-midnight. The valet told us that if we left our coats in the car, we could go right in through the shorter line (mind you, it was freezing). The front door refused to let anyone in and we waited for 90 minutes with different people coming up to us saying to ""hold on hold on we'll get you in"" until  about 11:30pm when we just decided it was a scam for our money having us miss the open bar and we left to warm up before it was midnight. Needless to say, it spoiled our night and wasted our time and $100 which we are trying to get back. Nowhere was it stated that they were non-refundable when we purchased them and had they stated from the beginning that we would not be able to get in, we would have left as soon as we got there.

1.0,1/4/2016,I went here with my boyfriend for their NYE event and it was a complete mess.  Even though people had tickets we had to wait outside in the cold to be let in and the excuse we received was that the coat check was taking long.  Then they come out and say if you leave your coat in your car you can walk right in...it was about 40 degrees outside.  After about 45 mins they let everybody in but there was no more coat check.  We paid 50 bucks for a service that was supposed to include coat check. Needless to say we were not able to take full advantage of the two hour open bar that came with our ticket because we spent half that time on line waiting outside. Once we made it in we had to hold on to our coats because there was nowhere to put them. Then he bar was over crowded with people trying to get their drinks before the time was up because we were all stuck outside for so long. Management was not helpful and we were forced to stick it out because the tickets were non refundable. I feel like they took advantage of this because they made their money whether people stuck it out or not. Bad service and bad management.

I wrote Sofritos off as bias and racist and said I would never visit them again..... This was in 2013 now fast forward to last week. when I heard there was a location uptown I was hesitant however me and my friend was hungry and didn't want to head downtown.... Initially our Lyft couldn't find the place, I think they should state that they're located in Riverbank state park. First off I love the location and view! being a harlemite I have vivid memories of riverbank park growing up so this restaurant next to the water was great and nostalgic for me.The decor is chic and spacious, the night I arrived was a Sunday night so not sure how packed this place gets on a popular night.The food........ Absolutely delicious!!! Total change from my other experience. Those pork chunks smh guuurrrrllllll! Oh and that sauce finger licking good!!! For entree my friend had the pork chops and I had the chicken monfongo. We both left happy and stuffed. Expect a flavor explosion in your mouth!The drinks was just okay we both had the DR and both thought our drinks were really really watered down. Not something I would do on my dime again unless it's happy hour, the drink was about 13 bucks. The mix itself would of been good if it wasn't watered down.The service was a Grand slam!!! as I stated previously I was nervous about this restaurant because of prior experiences, however I was treated so well this time around at the new location I was very happy about that and it made me automatically decide to visit again....Sofritos is loud with a live Dj so it made it a little hard to hear each other but we were so engulfed in our food we cared.... 0%! I would say I wish the music was a bit of a mix instead of just Spanish music however it's a Spanish restaurant so hey.....

We only got three out of the eight appetizers listed on the menu.  As a restaurant with the name ""Sofrito"" you would expect that they use plenty of the condiment Sofrito on their food.  This is one of the worse food that I've had in a Latin establishment in a long time. The pork chunks were mostly ""fat chunks"".   The empanadas were just alright. The sangria was like drinking flavored acid.  The fruit appeared to have been weeks old before being used for the sangria.The entrees were just as bad.  My friend ordered the french toast and three of her pieces of toast were burnt.  I ordered a churrasco salad. The steak was good but I had to ask for dressing on the side.  Lastly the desserts were the worst of the entire meal.  The flan was like biting into a creamy lime, the tembleque must of come out of a box as it had zero coconut flavor, and the tres leche had maybe one leche drizzled on it.  Sofrito...an epic fail.  The beauty of the restaurant is not enough for me to return!",0,0,0,Ellie P.,"Bronx, NY",0,16,0

Clearly I'm not adding any new info to all the bad reviews on here for this place.Made reservations for 8pm.  Had to sign an agreement stating my credit card would be charged if I was late or didn't show up prior to the day, but once once my party arrived, we were told we had to wait ""about half an hour"".  I don't understand the purpose of a reservation system which isn't honored. The young lady at the front was not helpful at all, she just said she didn't handle reservations and that walk ins are given preferential treatment, which later she denied. Other people who made reservations also were having the same issue so this isn't an isolated incident.The whole thing turned into a circus and the manager had to address my party and I. He got us a table after waiting for an hour and many arguments with most of my group.The food was ok, Nothing special and definitely not worth the aggravation of the front desk service.The positives I do have are that the waiter we had (even though I didn't get his name) was very friendly and tough under pressure. We were a big group and very upset from the reservation situation and he was very smooth in treating us and getting our orders in. I didn't think the food was slow to come out I actually thought it was fast since I was still working on my app when the entree arrived.  The one great thing about this place is the music. The DJ was amazing and kept us very happy playing a varied choice of songs. Perhaps they should consider just being a nightlife spot with no reservations and just appetizers or lighter fare to highlight how much fun the place would be.  Dealing with the staff and food can ruin an evening but thankfully the music helped (I guess they earned their one star with that).  But I would never return for dinner, have another event there or recommend it to someone else.  If you're going for drinks or to hang without any expectations then yes, otherwise don't bother.",7,1,1,L R.,"Staten Island, NY",1,41,11

The past visits to this restaurant was 5 stars for sure but it's sad to say the atmosphere is dwindling down only b/c they are becoming careless of the crowd they let in. Last night the waitress was HOVERING over my table and brought the check on her own ! Why the rush if I patiently waited 2 hrs to be seated ? I was told one hour wait and that was fine but then I was texted for a table so the hostess made me close my tab where I was comfortably seated at the bar so I can wait standing up for another hour by the crowded hostess stand. If the table wasn't ready why Tex me !? Anyway other than that food was fast and amazing and the DJ was awesome.

The day before I called to make reservations, which wasn't a problem considering how early we were coming in. I asked for an assortment of desserts to be brought to the table at the end of dinner, saying ""Happy Birthday"" & ""Congratulations"" they made notes of that so I wouldn't have to ask in front of the people who I was trying to surprise Well back to the beginning, the place was hard to find, even with my navigation, it's in a park, across a bridge, they do have valet, which is $15. I believe that number is way to high considering there is absolutely no where else to park, someone in the restaurant said something about getting a ticket, going to a lower level, taking a elevator to park, I didn't see any parking signs at all. I believe that after spending a lot of money in an establishment valet should be given not charged, especially where this restaurant is located. The inside is beautifully decorated, they have a nice lounge area, tight dining area, outdoor space which wasn't set up the night I went (rain & wind) The music was fantastic, and thankfully not as loud as the original sofritos!

I would like to thank Junior the manager and Kwana for being patient and listening to my ideas for making the event perfect. The new venue is very beautiful and if the weather is perfect the outside views are amazing. My only gripe is that the restaurant failed to mention the additional charges for bringing cakes and/or cupcakes. It's my opinion that once a reservation is made for a shower or birthday party it should be assumed that there will be a dessert to memorialize the the occasion which is usual and customary.

2.0,9/8/2015,"I would love to give this place more stars because the food is delicious, but I just can't. This is the second time I've been there this summer and both times the service was extremely slow. This last time there are like 10 other people in the entire restaurants and it took forever for our waitress to come by and greet us, and when she did, she had a hard time understanding us. Look, I know it's a Puerto Rican restaurant and Spanish speaking can be expected but the waiters must speak enough English to get your order right.  I had to repeat multiple times before she got our order right. After we put in our order for drinks and food, we must have waited between 10-15minutes for our pitcher of Mojito. Both the passion fruit and coconut Mojito are delicious, but having to wait that long for it is ridiculous. Then our food took another 15-20 minutes. Maybe longer. Our waitress never came by to check in on us throughout this entire time. When they did bring our food out, we were missing items and no one knew anything. Our maduros arrived at our table warm and they brought out our appetizer at the same time as our meal. We had even forgotten about it at this point. When it was time for the bill, we again had to ask for our waitress. At this time, she is asking us about how our meal was and if we wanted dessert. I'm thinking its a little to late to be caring about us. This time she stuck around for the bill, which is interesting that she didn't have time for us while we were there but as soon as we request our bill and are ready to go, now she's around.

1.0,9/7/2015,"I really didn't want to complain but I have to because this was the worst time of my life at an establishment ..... First I just say SOFRITO used to be my favorite place to eat last night I was all excited to go to the new location we arrive a party of 4 seated right away not a complaint in that area it started with the waitress we order drinks a pitcher of Hennessy sangria and a ginger ale  she brought the ginger ale right back we waited about 30 minutes I asked her about the sangria and she never put the order in and said I never told her , mean while we have a conversation about the Hennessy sangria when I did order it her telling me the red was sweeter and I told her then I'll take that, the wait wasn't long for the food but when the food did arrive they gave me the wrong rice with me pernil, again not a big deal I just switched with my boyfriend, wait the waitress handed me food and there was no room on the table for it and I sat there holding a plate in my hand she just walked away I thought she was maybe getting another table being we were a party of 4 all the food didn't fit she didn't return also there were no forks or knives on the table I got up and walked inside and asked for them we made it work took some food off the plates in my hand put all the appetizers on one dish on our own and stacked the plates, at this point I wanted to just eat and get out of here..... My boyfriend and his friend got dessert the waitress once again hands me the plate and my boyfriend with out taking the other plates off the table I had to stop her and say ""hey how do you expect me to eat in my hands can you please clear the table off""  she did it... We paid and left .... Maybe it was a bad night or bad waitress I'll return I hope it better I wouldn't want to think a place I once lived went to shit",0,0,0,Roxanne P.,"Brooklyn, NY",43,2,6

It took over an hour from the time we ordered our food to the time our appetizers was put on our table. And then the food was just okay. I ordered a chicken dish that was on the special restaurant week menu but the chicken was bland.

3.0,8/30/2015,"For a long time Sofrito on 57th and 1st ave was a staple of great latin american dining in NYC. I am so bummed out about the location change. Having Sofrito at Riverbank park definitely benefits me because it's so much closer. However, they have seriously downgraded in neighborhoods. How do you go from Midtown East to Harlem? Lol... At a park, to say the least! I dont know... I'm just having a hard time seeing what used to be a ""trendy"" restaurant fit in at a mediocre park. This will definitely change Sofrito's image.Moving on... They have an outdoor area with great  views of the George Washington bridge, which was very nice. Our waiter was nice but looked flustered, as he appeared to be the only waiter for the outdoor area. With that being said, we were there for brunch and asked for sangria which we got 15 minutes later. I don't understand how it takes so long to pour something that's already made. Also, the waiters here are walking around in blue jeans. That should not be allowed... C'mon, look presentable please! I definitely didn't feel like I was at a Sofrito establishment.Sangria was very strong, for those who enjoy that. My boyfriend and I enjoyed the empanadas and quesadilla, which were not bad at all. I had the piña colada french toast. Let me tell you, there's nothing ""piña colada"" about this toast! Yes, it's coconut crusted and has a pineapple reduction on top, but that's NOT piña colada! :-( I felt misled. I was hoping there was a piña colada sauce of some sort, but was wrong... And it's too sweet for my taste. My boyfriend got steak and eggs... He said it was good but nothing to rave about. Now for my final gripe, the brunch menu clearly says on the bottom that a 20% gratuity will be added to parties of 5 or more... Yet, the hefty 20% was tagged on our bill and we were just 2! I absolutely hate when businesses do this. Not only is this simply false advertisement, but let us tip you what we believe you're worthy of being tipped.All in all, this experience was not extremely terrible, but definitely didn't feel like I was at the Sofrito I know.",3,1,1,Marlene D.,"Manhattan, NY",41,40,177

2.0,8/22/2015,"Went for brunch and was disappointed on a few aspects.  First, the whole ""cash only pay up front"" valet parking (who park a few feet away) just didn't make much sense to me. They should at least accept debit/credit for this foolery.Second, even though I took the time to reserve a few days ahead they had my reservation but no table available. How does that make any sense? We (2 people) were offered to sit at the bar and wait for a table despite our reservation. Third, my appetizer (fried calamari) tasted like old crunchy oil. The waiter didn't know what my entree came with. When I got my entree it was underwhelming. I couldn't finish either. Desert was good (chocolate mouse with ice cream) then again I'm a sucker for chocolate :) Fourth, service is kind of slow considering the amount of customers and the size of the establishment. Pros:The ambiance is nice.  Music was good (albeit kind of loud). The views are awesome.  The restaurant is nice and clean (and pretty!). Other people's dishes seemed more appealing than mine. Also, I like that valet parking is an option, just needs updating (cash only is so archaic and inconvenient). I'd return for dinner just to give it another chance (as I've been to other sofrito locations whose food was great).  I'll revisit and edit if it changes.",0,0,0,Cee L.,"Manhattan, NY",2,17,5

Since our whole party hadn't arrived, we were told we couldn't be seated.   We decided to have some drinks.  Oh-em-gee the coconut mojitos were amazing!  I'm not a drinker, but I happily breezed through two. We had nine in our group. Our waitress took our orders and comitted them to memory.  She then recapped each order perfectly.  I was very impressed.  The food came pretty quickly and was delicious.   Big portions, good flavor.  Our waitress was very attentive. There was a host who's name starts with a ""J"". Arrgh! Was it Julian? Sheez.  But anyway, he was a blast! His personality was funny and super friendly. The only drawback was the valet parking.   We pulled up and waited for a minute.  No one came to the car.  We pulled around to the parking spots and one of the guys hands us a ticket and tells us it's $15. Ummm...you must be crazy if you think we are going to drive our car all the way around, walk all the way to the front AND pay $15.  We said we were going to drive to the front and let him take it.

The sangria was strong but very delicious. I ordered the Arroz con Pollo and my boyfriend order the salmon with rice and beans. The arroz con pollo was yummy and it had a lot of chicken in it. it was large enough for 2 people. The salmon was cooked well done and was crispy and delicious.

The seating is cramped and the tables were small. We did not have reservations and waited about an hour for a table. The food was delicious and authentic and had a little spice to it. The entree portions are large and definitely can feed two people easily. The drinks were flavorful and a bit strong. A Prix fixe option was available for $45.00 a person which includes family style appetizers, soup or salad, a variety of entrees and a dessert platter. You could also get a pitcher of sangria for around the same price. Our waiter was not very helpful in informing of specials or prix fixe options. The waiter also stated that the restaurant did not carry coffee which I found odd, until my friends noticed another waiter providing the customer next to our table with coffee. Our waiter still insisted that the restaurant did not carry coffee until we pointed to the neighboring guest drinking coffee. The waiter then brought our table coffee but seemed annoyed at having to do so. A live DJ was present and the music was very good. The view is also beautiful.

1.0,8/10/2015,"The decor of the restaurant is great, but that's where the greatness ends.... First of all, if you are going to advertise that you have valet parking, at least mention that it'll cost you $15, even though it's your own parking lot. I know that's not a lot, but when you're spending over $1000 at a restaurant, you'd think they could throw in the parking, or at least have a sign that says, park and walk into the park if you don't want to have to pay the $15 valet charge. Not to mention how slow they are to park your car once you drive up to the restaurant. So we had drinks at the bar, and why did they add gratuity at the bar for 4 drinks? I'd like to leave my own tip at the bar, thank you!  Then, we had a large birthday party and reserved a table for 20. Ask us why they only made a table for 16, so a group in our party had to sit at a separate table after all the fussing and confusion... It doesn't end there. We asked for some bread for the table and they brought out our appetizers. There wasn't even even enough apps for the whole party to get a piece of chicken. Then they brought us bread after asking for it again. It was basically white sliced sandwich bread toasted and squashed with a little garlic on it. No thank you, I get better bread from the corner bodega. They  had one waitress helping us, she was way overwhelmed.

2.0,8/10/2015,"The Sofrito establishment has always had a name among the spanish cuisine category. There has always been an expected wait since it is such a popular place but my last experience there was much more unacceptable considering how empty the place was. There was a 25 min wait for valet to take your car and it came with a $15 charge. Once in we had a party of 15 or so. The seating was very tight and when anyone would need to get up for something your getting leaned on and brushed up against. Considering the large amount of Lounge area seating inside and outside (that was empty) I do not know why they did not space out the seating a bit more. I went to the bar to get a drink and waited another 20 mins for the 3 drinks i ordered. There were only 6 people total at the bar, why would it take 20 mins to get served? Then the check was $60 for 3 drinks and when I asked she told me she charged me for other people's drinks that had been sitting at the bar. So because you saw me speaking with people at the bar you charged me for their drinks? All this time taken the apps had already come out on the table and were gone! Finally my dinner comes and it was prepared at the wrong temperature. I asked for Medium rare steak and got well done and the waiter knew I ordered it medium rare and could not find where it was placed. The bill came out to about $1200, you would think if your spending that much the service would be at least acceptable but it wasn't. Again the place had no one sitting in the lounge areas and maybe 7-9 people dancing outside in total. Why was everything so cramped and service so slow !!!!

1.0,8/9/2015,"If I can give it a negative star, I would give it for this place.  My wife, my sister in law and I have been there in 3 different occasions which always resulted in something negative.  My wife and sister in law went on one occasion with my 6 month old daughter in a stroller.  They were refused service by the hosts in the front of the house  There wasn't anything clear about a no kid policy and there were kids present with the other guests at the restaurant.  So there is some selective enforcement of some policy that's very confusing.  Another time, my wife, my sister in law, my son and my daughter went in late for a nightcap and again were refused service.  Again, it was because the kids and again, kids were present.  We went a third time because it was my sister in law's birthday.  If it was up to me, I wouldn't go, but it's not about me.  This time we did get a table, but my wife, the kids and I were late and we did tell ahead of time that we would be late.  The whole party of 14 was held up until we got there.  It's outrageous that 14 adults would have to wait for 2 adults and two children to get there before getting a table.  Once we got there, we had to wait another 15 minutes for the table to be set.  The table set for us was directly in the sun.  A few of us sunburn easily so we had to go inside and back out a few times.  There was another big table in the shade that was empty for awhile before another party came much later.  It wasn't offered to us and it was refused when we asked.  By the way, that same table got served food before we did.  We did not get served until we asked about 30 minutes after we ordered.  The appetizer came and then the entree came 10 minutes later giving us very little time to enjoy the appetizer.  So, about the food.  $30 for a prix fixe meal is overpriced for the dished offered.  A beef salad, french toast or pulled pork is not $30 worth of food no matter how much mimosas and sangrias you throw into the mix.  Orange juice, cheap champagne, cheap wine and fruit doesn't cost THAT much.    Finally, we asked to give my family a physically separate check from the rest of the group, the waitstaff told us it wasn't possible and no reason why given despite us asking why.  This is the first time I've encountered a restaurant doing this. So, when we finally decided to split the bill, we were told a maximum of 3 credit cards can be used.  Again, I've never heard of another restaurant doing this.  So, the moral of this review is that I wouldn't have came back after the first time, but again, this isn't about me.  I was there only at the invite of my sister in law and that was the only reason my family was there.  After so many negative experiences, this feels like something personal against us and for the life of me, I can't figure out why.  One star is too good of a rating for this place.",1,0,0,Mike M.,"Livingston, NJ",0,4,0
1.0,8/9/2015,"So, here's a continuation to the review I left nine days ago. Today was my sister's birthday, and she had made a reservation about three weeks ago. Even though we weren't too crazy about having her birthday at the restaurant, the birthday girl gets her pick. The reservation was for 14 people for 12pm. I arrived around 1pm because my daughter had a doctors appt at 11:30am. My sister was calling me nonstop because they hadn't been seated before my arrival because the restaurant was waiting for the whole party....3 out of 14 hadn't arrived. Upon our arrival(three people), I asked my sister if her party was already seated, and she responded that they were waiting for us. We had to wait another 15 mins to have a table set up since our table was  not ready at the moment. There was another table in the shade already prepared for another party that still hadn't arrived, but we, of course, had to wait. We were seated in the sun...after we requested the shade because we had two small kids(including a six month old baby) and multiple guests that easily get sun rashes. Mind you....the other party reserved in the shade still hadn't arrived. We ordered our food and received it ten minutes after the table in the shade received theirs when we ordered and arrived at least 10-15 mins before they did. We ordered from their brunch menu. Our second course arrived before we had finished our appetizers. Our appetizers were taken away while we were still eating them...clear way to get rid of customers quickly. Our glasses of water were filled when we had finished our meal, and one of our sangrias didn't arrive until we asked for the check. The food was ok, but the portion size and experience altogether was not worth the $30 each person paid. I can't expect much after our initial bad experience. They do have a great view and great music, but that's about it. Staff and management is not well trained and should make each customers experience more memorable especially when it's a birthday party of 14 people. The owners and managers had previously told us that their regular customers weren't as classy as we were, and that they weren't happy with their staff and were replacing their staff. That shouldn't be a way to represent a business or categorize any customer. I am no different than their regular customers, and therefore I shouldn't be treated any better or worse. This experience doesn't make my opinion of Sofrito any better unfortunately. As usual, no efforts or accommodations were attempted even for two birthdays girls. The worst part is it actually feels personal due to the fact that every moment we have gone has been simply bad.",0,0,0,Gerelys A.,"Edison, NJ",7,5,0

I've eaten at sofrito downtown the food was fantastic and I enjoyed the food here was a let down.. So not only was the food drinks delayed but the service was not spectacular they didn't clear the tables when it was time to serve the cake so it was big cluttered mess. To sum all up it was to hot to be outside in 90 degree NYC weather they took to long to bring drinks and food also they were crappy with the hospitality they provided over you're better going some where else where you eat good drink good and can enjoy a great atmosphere with great service.

We sat inside because of the heatwave, but they have sits and couches outside overlooking the Hudson river and the George Washington bridge.Service: My mom and stepfather are not fluent in English so when I asked the waiter if he spoke Spanish, he said not much but got us a Spanish speaking waiter which I thought was super nice. Our waiter was super attentive. Some of our dishes came out but my two brothers, who ordered the same thing did not get their food at the same time. It turned out there was a glitch in the computer and the order did not go through. The chef came out to personally apologize and assured us their food would be out soon. He was super friendly.Food: For $30, you get one appetizer, main dish, dessert and unlimited mimosa or sangria. We each had a different appetizer and dish and we were all satisfied. I had the ropa vieja and it was good. My mom's churrasco was pretty good too. The tres leche cake was decent, the chocolate mousse (dark chocolate cake with a side of ice cream) was pretty awesome.

1.0,7/26/2015,"So let me clear up all these mixed reviews. You'll want to read this long review.This is a great place if you want to grab a drink and enjoy the view. You better have patience and get a stiff drink because the service is the worst I've ever experienced in my life. If these guys want any shot of staying in business they will need to make some big changes. Drinks took forever as we sat down for dinner. No big deal. Enjoying the view, great DJ and company. Finally drinks get here. Appetizers took forever. I'd say 45 min. Guess what? They forgot 1 of the two appetizers that were ordered. We told them I kid you not 4 times before they finally brought it out. Which by the way ended up coming with our dinner. The food was very hit or miss depending on what you ordered. If you actually go to this place don't get the sushi. Anyway to make up for the lack of service the manager told us next round of drinks is on the house. Those drinks came out a half hour later. Don't you think after all this, especially a manager should be on top of things and try to turn a bad first experience to a good one? After the drinks finally came we moved over to the lounge area. No service at all. In fact on our way to the front to pay our waiter ran into us saying thank God we are still here, he thought we left. He was worried he was going to have to pay our check. Btw when we got the check they charged us for a bottle of wine instead of a glass. It's one thing after another. I honestly always see the glass half full. I hate negativity and I never speak bad things of anyone but let me tell you, I will never be back at this place nor recommend it to any of my friends or clients. It's a real lack of service and professionalism.",10,1,0,Michael H.,"New York, NY",112,4,0

2.0,7/25/2015,"I went out with friends for restaurant week on a Friday night. The restaurant is very nice inside. The atmosphere is great. I wasn't crazy about seeing dudes with their undies showing. I thought to myself what's up with the high school boppers. The bathroom killed it for me. There was a lady that handed us paper towels which is cool. There was a table where you can purchase products. I've seen this before in other places however the overall presentation and setup totally took away from the elegance of the rest of the restaurant. I felt as if I were at a street vendor. There were earrings on the wall, ugly! There were opened brushes, disgusting. I understand people needing to make money but let's keep the quality of the restaurant the same across the board. If your going to have hair brushes have them brand new and packaged. Selling earrings is so ghetto and smile. We had the prefix menu which I wasn't crazy about. The salad wasn't anything great. I was going to be safe and choose chicken. I love chicken but I decided to try something new. I ordered the skirt steak with white rice and black beans. I wasn't in love. I had high hopes for the skirt steak but again I'm comparing it to my dads skirt steak which is awesome! I  think maybe I needed to have ordered it cooked another way. The desserts were ok. The chocolate molten cake wasn't warm. When I come into a restaurant like this I expect to be wow'd by the food. I've had better at little spots. I would come here to chill with friends if they wanted to get drinks. I don't know if I'd try the food again.Outside there is a bar and seating. The bartender Chris was very mindful of us. The bushes around the area sucked, they were ugly and they totally blocked the view if you were sitting down on the patio furniture. They need to be cut down. There was also a portion of the back area in a corner that had crap laying around, one being a ladder. I'm nit picking because the inside of the restaurant was awesome so I expect that same standard through out.The bathroom took off 1 star The back with bushes that need to be tended to took off 1 starThe cold cake and mediocre food took another star off.

4.0,7/22/2015,"My review is ONLY on the back bar for drinks.I have been here twice and both times I have enjoyed my experience.  The first time was with a group of friends and we all had a blast enjoying $5 sangria (red/white) and mojitos (many flavors), $2 empanadas (chicken, shrimp and beef) and 75 cent wings (buffalo sauce on the side).  I was the first one to walk in, the view was GORGEOUS (but I expected it since I live two blocks away), the hostesses were very sweet and the bartender in the back was....frigid (no hi, welcome, how are you? what would you like to drink?)  It was almost as if I was there to bother her and not order.  Anywho, my friends showed up quickly after.  The 2nd time I took my mom, again for Happy Hour, and we both had a nice and relaxed experience enjoying the great weather and view.The reception at the back bar needs some serious work, no napkins with your drinks and a bunch of little things that you don't ever acknowledge but notice when it's missing.  However I'm giving them benefit of the doubt because they are only a month old.  The ""renovation"" (really just decoration) is amazing!  I had hosted my bday here a few years ago with the previous owners and the decor was bland.  One star less because they sure seem unfriendly at the back bar.",0,0,0,Dee W.,"New York, NY",49,70,13
1.0,7/20/2015,"My family and I were so excited about eating at Sofrito, after it came highly recommended by a reliable friend. We were visiting from DC and spending the weekend in NYC. We got to the restaurant at 4pm, when the restaurant was supposed to open, then were asked to sit in the bar area until the staff meeting was over and then we'd be seated at our table. Who has a staff meeting after the restaurant opens?  After waiting for about 30 minutes we decided to order a drink at the bar. Kela, the bartender, made me an amazingly great mojito. So good that I decided to have 2. After waiting for 40 minutes we were informed by the hostess that the restaurant stoves weren't working and they didn't know how long it would be before they were repaired. But, they said we could order 5 things from the menu which didn't require to be heated. She wrote them on a piece of paper, apologized, and said we could be seated at that time. We tend to be optimist and decided to order something's to hold us over, in the hopes they would fix the problem. At NO point did the managers ever come to apologize or offer us a drink, or anything for that matter, to compensate us for our time and inconvenience. As a matter of fact, they walked passed us about 5 times and never said a word. 2 mojitos and 2 sushis later (I know, who orders sushi at a Puerto Rican Restaurant?), we left furious with the lack of attention, consideration and curtesy, management demonstrated. This restaurant deserves to go under and with this kind of management I don't see it lasting for long. The next day we went to their sister restaurant, Sazon, and had a completely different experience with the staff and management. They had a very similar menu, the food was outstanding, authentic PR food, the waiter Ivan was super nice, very attentive, and the managers, Pablo and Calvin, even bought us a round of drinks to apologize on Sofrito's behalf.

The design is nice, the lighting is nice, inside and outdoor seating. I wasn't a fan of the food or the drinks so I had bubbly with a little passionfruit juice and left quite hungry.

Although the new location is much nicer than the old, that was all Sofrito had going for it last night. Upon arrival we were sat outside with a view of the Hudson River and GW Bridge which was fine, however when handed the menu's this is when the trouble arose. The menu was a one page print out with items such as Chicken Breast and Burger printed on it alongside Quesadilla and Rice. When my wife and I saw this we figured there must have been a mistake. We ordered some Sangria and waited for the waiter who finally arrived fifteen minutes later. He informed us that there was a gas leak and they couldn't produce their normal menu. This would have been better to know upon arrival at the restaurant instead of after sitting down and ordering two Sangria drinks that cost us $45 dollars (a rip-off). We informed the waiter that we were very disappointed and would be leaving to his reply of ""ok.""This is not how a restaurant is run, if you cannot produce the menu you are known for please let the customers know at the door next time instead of after you have them on the hook for a $45 drink bill.I do not know if we would return because of the blatantly bad service.",0,0,0,Andrew H.,"Long Beach, NY",0,2,0

Our food took over an hour because they thought we received our order but didn't so they pushed our ticket to the side. Everything took too long. We asked for salt and pepper, that took too long. Asked for more syrup, that took too long but lets talk about the food. I was HIGHLY disappointed in the brunch. 1st of all, the online menu is completely different than the menu at the venue. I ordered an egg omelette with mushrooms, cheddar cheese and bacon. I like my bacon CRISPY &  asked for it to be well done. It wasn't. The omelette was really small and wasn't seasoned that well. The potatoes needed seasoning too. My boyfriend ordered Buttermilk pancakes and chicken sausage. THREE lil small, flat cold pancakes and two like sausage links with a handful of fruit?

1.0,7/12/2015,"Let me start by saying that i have NEVER been so compelled to write a negative review after a dining experience than I have after this place.  I came here for their brunch specials as I am a big fan of their original location, so I thought it would be nice to try their newest location.  The inside decor was very stylish and trendy, but unfortunately this played no resemblance to the dining experience to come.  We decided to sit in the outdoor seating area as it had a beautiful view of the George Washington Bridge. To start, we placed our order for the unlimited sangria and entrees.  Within the first half hour of waiting, we received only the 1 sangria with no re-fill, and had yet to receive any of our appetizers.  After another 30 minutes passed, we finally had received a refill on the ""unlimited"" sangria, and finally our appetizers.  The appetizers came out cold and looked very unappetizing.  I had ordered the empanadas, which tasted good but were very cold.  My friend ordered the spring salad, which took an extra 15 minutes for them to bring out, and consisted of wilted arugula with a few pine nuts on it and no dressing.  It looked like something that you would throw together at home with some salad ingredients that were about to expire.  After mentioning to the wait staff that we had been waiting an abnormally long time for our appetizers alone, we were brought free tequila shots for the table, which was a nice gesture.  However, I noticed that almost ever table was also receiving this which signified to me that we were not the only table experiencing problems.  When our food finally came out, I could not wait to finally eat.  Unfortunately, I did not take more than 3 bites of entree as it was absolutely disgusting.  I had ordered the eggs benedict over ham with a $5 side of bacon.  The eggs looked nice, but the hollandaise sauce covering everything tasted sour and EXTREMELY over salted.  The egg was on top of what appeared and tasted like store-bought cold cut ham.  It was inedible.  The bacon to accompany was microwaved at best and very unappealing.  My friend ordered the tilapia with coconut rice (which was an added $5 for this entree).  The tilapia looked OK at best, and the rice had no hint of anything resembling coconut.  It was something that I could have easily made at home and was rather bland.To top all of this off, I had went to use the mens restroom while waiting for the dessert.  When entering to use the bathroom stall, the door completely UNHINGED and FELL onto my leg, leaving a large red mark from scraping me.  I went to tell the manager and they did not seem to care and brushed it off with a ""sorry"".They brought us a tray of dessert at the end which was decent.  It came with chocolate cake, flan and tres leches.  This was probably the bet part of the whole experience.  We had mentioned to our server how dissatisfied we were with our entire experience.  They let us know that the kitchen had been experiencing many problems ""behind closed doors"" and apologized.  I would NOT recommend this place, and will NOT be returning.",6,0,0,Zach B.,"New York, NY",120,3,3
5.0,7/7/2015,"As a self-proclaimed ""Brunchaholic"" (aka it is my favorite meal of the day/week/month ) Sofrito Midtown quickly became a staple of mine. This was not only because of the stellar Sabroso Sunday brunch special, but also because of the always welcoming service and high octane vibe even during non-brunch hours.When I found out that one of my favorite restaurants was relocating to inside of Riverbank State Park (which happens to be across the street from where I grew up on Riverside Drive) I knew that I had to come visit. Our group of four visited on a Saturday for 4th of July brunch and were not at all disappointed. Not only was the food just as delicious as I remembered -- the sangria was refreshing and potent, as per usual! Needless to say, I was a very happy camper. The decor is vibrant and festive and there is no shortage of space (great for groups!) with the beautiful Hudson River as a backdrop.Thank you to the manager Luis and the great hostess and waitstaff for ALWAYS ensuring a wonderful experience.

Pernil was delicious. Tres leches was probably the best I've had.The negatives - The bartender was very sweet so I tipped her $3 on my $16 drink/appetizer bill. What I didn't realize, until my friend told me later, was that she'd added an additional $1 to each of our checks for her tip. Who does that?! I sure wish I'd noticed it. Second - I ordered a margarita while at the table. When the check came...$17!!! Are you kidding me?! The waitress told me the drinks are expensive at the table, plus I didn't want ice. Charged more for no ice?! That's a new one. Now I see why they don't provide drink menus.

3.0,6/27/2015,"Sofrito.....a very nice place but I didn't have the best experience this time.The new location is in a very nice secluded location now. I wasn't too sure if I could drive right in because it looks like you're driving into a park, but when we saw another car do it, we followed right behind. Valet parking is $15. The valet attendant told us that the general parking lot was blocks away and downstairs. What does he mean downstairs? The subway? I said I wasn't going through all of that with heels on so we went along.The ambiance is lovely....Indoor/Outdoor Bars, Indoor/Outdoor lounge areas, and a dining area inside. The view of the bridge and the water is just beautiful. The bridge can be seen from the inside too; One whole wall is a window. The first issue was the drink; It was awful. I ordered the White Sangria and it was a cup FULL of ice, with white wine, two oranges, and a cherry. I was not a happy camper.Second Issue: Our server was so sweet but unfortunately she messed up a little. She didn't ask the birthday girl if she wanted fried or grilled pork chops when she ordered, and ended up choosing fried on her own. The birthday girl originally wanted grilled and the server said in the nicest voice, ""Well, the pork chops are already deep-frying so how do you feel about that?"" (Insert your reply here) All in all, she got the pork chops she wanted without a long wait, but it was wrong for the waitress to assume....it made it seem like she didn't care about our service in a way....but other than that she was nice. I ordered the arroz con pollo which is delicioso and the portion is huge!! I had more than enough leftover to eat the next day. It had olives in it but I just picked them out. Third Issue: Before we got our food, the valet attendant comes up to the table and says ""What car is yours?"" My heart dropped to my stomach...I didn't know what he was gonna say. I told him, he fumbled through keys, found mine, handed it to me and said ""your car is right in the front."" I know we had a late reservation but if I'm gonna get partial service, then I should give partial payment. #JustSayingFourth Issue: The mosquitoes were in full force and we never went outside.

There's security at the door checking ID's making sure the underage won't drink. We sat outside to enjoy the sunset and our waiter Javier came over and brought us drinks. I had the Riverbank which had me buzzed and I'm a drinker so that was pretty cool. The food came out pretty quick. As an appetizer I had the tostones Montaditos which was basically shrimp and a tasty sauce over tostones. It's good to share but I ate it all myself, talk about being fat. I had the Ropa Vieja as my entree which came with rice and beans. The shredded beef had a lot of taste to it, I had to chew a lot but it was pretty worth it. We skipped dessert because we were full. My date had the Chuletas (porkchops) with white rice and beans and I'm pretty sure he enjoyed it because he left nothing on the plate. The only bad thing was the mosquitos flying around but once again we were outside and management said they will have that taken cared of. Customer service was great.
