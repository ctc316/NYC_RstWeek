2.0,3/27/2019,"This place is very inconsistent depending on who is at the front of the house. There is a woman with long dark hair who is wonderful and always welcoming to guests, but the gentleman (pictured below) always has an attitude and acts like it is a problem to attend to us as customers. He was more concerned with drinking wine at the bar with a friend than attending to us as customers. Our servers were very nice but as we were seated so far from the rest of the guests, we often had to flag down a waiter. I had kept trying to come back to this location as their Sunday prix fix is a good deal, but unfortunately the behavior of the manager has deterred me from returning.",0,0,0,Mary L.,"Manhattan, NY",1,37,9
2.0,3/26/2019,"Beware the Lamburger! It's stuffed with tomato and chopped olives. Took my first bite and it exploded like a water balloon all over the sleeve of my shirt. I was displeased. Beyond that it tasted OK. The side salad was basically a bunch of finely chopped lettuce that was almost impossible to fork up. So there's that, plus the service was mediocre. It was lunchtime and busy but not a really fast floor. They were slow to pickup that our group was missing a table setting. They had some good looking stuff on the menu so I may try it again sometime (I'll wear a raincoat if I ever do the Lamburger again though). But it's pricey and there's better options in the area.",0,0,0,Michael R.,"Elmhurst, NY",0,35,0

5.0,3/6/2019,"I love this place for what it is. I took my parents here when they came to visit and just really enjoyed the food and atmosphere. We got the prix fixe menu, which gave us the opportunity to try everything and it really didn't disappoint. We are Egyptian, so getting a good Mediterranean meal somewhere that isn't home is always a treat. The hummus and other dips were really good, particularly the spicy pepper muhammara. Then the smoked lamb tacos were absolutely awesome, and I would go back only for these once a week if I could. We then got a big sampler of all of the meats, and it was amazing. The chicken was super tender, the adana was perfectly seasoned and cooked and the lamb chops were the best I've had in a while. The only knock is that the lamb riblets were really fatty, but that's not atypical. Dessert was more than solid and the three of us left really satisfied. I'm definitely coming back.",0,0,0,John R.,"Philadelphia, PA",164,11,0

1.0,1/28/2019,"Went there Saturday night with my girlfriend and the host was extremely unprofessional and rude. We needed a quiet table for two to have a romantic dinner and the host sat us next to a large group of a loud and obnoxious party of people and there were plenty of other seats he could've sat us in. He did it on purpose and when I asked him for a new table he walked away and ignored me. My girlfriend and I couldn't believe the disrespect of this man. He was a total pompous ass. As we were about to walk out, two NYPD officers came into the restaurant because the host called the cops because he's a little sissy boy. DONT EAT THERE!!! Avoid this place at all costs!!!

We settled on Pera Mediterranean Brasserie for a weekday lunch and had window seating by the bar which made for good people-watching both inside the restaurant and on Madison. Small plates and mezzes are great for sharing. We split the grilled octopus, dolmas, and the platter of dips which were pretty tasty. I had the steak burger with kasseri cheese as my entree. It's a hefty burger that's very satisfying. The burger is meaty and juicy with the slightly trangy goats milk cheese a nice counterpoint to all that unctuous meat. I opted for the side salad over fries which was a good choice. It added some brightness to the meal. All in a great spot midtown for a working lunch. Service was attentive and Pera has a good energy about the place that isn't overwhelming.",2,0,0,Jon L.,"San Francisco, CA",203,924,1075

4.0,10/24/2018,"Such a beautiful establishment with delicious food. Came here for a work team happy hour on a Tuesday night, sat at a long table across the bar (party of 9), we did not order full dinner entres, but instead ordered several different appetizers which were all incredibly tasty. They have a very nice wine selection and cocktail menu, they also offer happy hour. I must say that the service was incredible... I don't think I ever saw the bottom of my wine glass. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because I found the plates to be very small for the price, but I guess a place like this can do that. Def a fancy spot, I would come here on a date or recommend for work gatherings. Tried the; Cheese croquettes 5/5 - they were delicious! They were perfectly cooked and come with a sweet jam on top making them both sweet and savory. Only bring 4 small nuggets, but still a must try!Hummus dish 5/ - brings several dips and comes with the pita chips, which they probably make in house.

1.0,8/17/2018,"My wife and I were dining with 2 other guests. we arrived before the other couple, and I went to the bar, which was full, to order a drink. The bartender said the bar was full but I could sit at the community table and someone would serve the drinks there. No one came over to take our order, so we just decided to go to the table to wait. They lost out on a cocktail order, which doesn't help the bottom line. Despite no drink order, it took 20 minutes for the server to come over after our guests arrived. I had to ask a busser to send her over. My wife asked the server if a particular dish, The Branzino wrapped grape leaves, could be made without the grape leaves. The server responded with a 2 letter word, No. There was no explanation or attempt to accommodate the guest. I didn't know grape leaves were an essential part of the Branzino anatomy. My other guest asked about the sauce on the hanger sauce, this seemed to completely stump her. My guest had to prod her with descriptions "" like is it a brown sauce, or a wine sauce""? She replied, a brown sauce. Not only was the service rude from the moment we arrived, the noise level felt like I was in Giants stadium, in the 4th quarter of the Super bowl. I understand if this is a sports bar, and a sporting event was on a television,( which it wasn't) but you couldn't hear the person next to you or across from you. To top it off, the food was mediocre at best, and that ubiquitous Branzino for 37.00 looked extremely over-priced when you can get much better food at  a dozen Astoria restaurants for half the price.

1.0,7/16/2018,"I made a reservation at Pera Mediterranean Brasserie several weeks ago. Because of other urgent issues, I could not be there for the lunch and called the restaurant for cancellation. The girl who took my call was nice and happily agreed to cancel it without any indication that there would be a charge for it. But to my surprise, a few days later I found I was charged 200 USD for the cancellation!!! 200 USD for a cancellation call made about 2 hours before the scheduled time?! This is ridiculous.If I was told a charge would be put to my bill, I might reconsider not to cancel or maybe reschedule the lunch. But I definitely cannot accept the charge without being told anything ahead. I tried to contact the restaurant after that and was told that they will call back. Unfortunately, the promised phone call never came. When cancelling the reservation, I was thinking of giving it a try next time.

5.0,4/30/2018,"Absolutely delicious!  That's the only way to describe the food here.Went for a business lunch and left there feeling unbelievably satisfied.  We started with the Pera Dip Trio (Hummus, Smoked Eggplant and Spicy pepper muammara) so addictive I couldn't stop eating it.  They were all very different but really good.For appetizer I had the sauteed jumbo shrimp with warm garlic-lemon samphire.  Again, delicious!  The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the citrus broth that accompanied it was a light, refreshing pairing.For my entree I had the baby lamb chops with roasted red peppers and fingerling potatoes.  There must have been about five lamb chops - cooked medium just the way I liked them.  I ordered the sauteed mushrooms w/shaved garlic on the side which went very well with the chops.For dessert I had the baklava with vanilla ice cream.  The baklava was ok - actually I've had better, but overall it wasn't bad.I loved my meal at Pera and I hope to go back real soon.",0,0,1,Kim O.,"Yonkers, NY",67,190,2

5.0,3/11/2018,"I had the pleasure to dine at Pera Brasserie for a Greek wine pairing dinner : a 5 course meal, where each dish was paired with a different kind of wine from Dougos winery.The meal started  with sautéed jumbo shrimp and halloumi cheese croquettes, both very good. I couldn't help myself stop eating the shrimp cause they were delicious, very soft and the sauce they came with gave them even more taste.Then we had a fish casserole, which was paired with some red wine. I usually prefer to combine fish with  a glass of white wine , but i had to say that in this case the red wine they served us was perfectly matching with the monkfish tail.My favorite part of the dinner was the main course, a full rack of lamb!! The meat was to tender and juicy, I would have had so much more chops than I had if it wasn't that I was already full from the previous dishes!To end the dinner wrapped feta-stuffed dates were served with the last wine of the selection, a 2010 Meth'imon ""Opsimo"".

2.0,1/9/2018,"Pera no more!I wrote this comment about another ""pseudo-Turkish restaurant"" and I will repeat for Pera; please do not create menus with Turkish Food names if neither your maitre d' nor your waiters speak Turkish...We arrived on Tuesday evening with no reservations and we were told it would take two (2) minutes for us to be seated. 20-25 minutes later and after checking with two individuals supposedly in charge, they seated us. What a bad start!Then came the second wait, 20 more minutes and we had to ask the waiter why he did not even give us bread. His response was funny: we are baking it, we ran out of bread...So basically our two minute sit down became a 45 minutes of bad or no service. Of course they can afford this, as transient people who commute through Grand Central will keep coming to the place with no repercussions to the restaurant walk-in traffic.Meze plate was average at best, not truly authentic - please don't tell me marul (thinly slices of green salad with crumbled feta cheese) is a type of meze. And, please do not put pastirma on top of humus. Please ask someone who knows what good Turkish food looks like and tastes like.After the average main course of adana kebap, we finally ordered baklava and it tasted old and chewy. Not worth trying again.Lets not forget the final scene; our Turkish coffee order and how the busboy almost slammed the cups to the table and left the cups ajar in their plates and walked away in a hurry, as if he was too busy to serve us.In Turkish we have a saying: ""Bir fincan kahvenin kırk yıl hatırı vardır"". This translates as: ""one cup of coffee matters 40-years (of memory)"". The way Pera at Mid-town serves coffee, I will remember and not go back for 40 years.Mediocre food, bad service.

The entree came with three lamb ribs, two of which were entirely fat.We politely pointed this out after which the Maitre d' came over to scold us for complaining ""we've never had a complaint! - that's how they come and I can help you get another dish if you're willing to pay for it"" when my husband pointed out that we'd had ribs many times before and we're aware of what we had ordered - she snapped back saying - ""but these are lamb ribs you see?!"" As if we had no idea what we were talking about.This could have been dealt with in many ways but I think one of the worst possible paths was chosen. It was more the treatment than the ribs. There were tables on either side of us that listened as we were reprimanded.If you want a delicious Turkish brunch on a Sunday try the Turkish Kitchen.

Once we got our server's attention, everything was perfect. The food was delicious - I had zucchini croquettes, salmon, and the baklava and chocolate mousse. The croquettes were nicely done and not greasy. Inside they were light and fluffy, and I loved the tzatziki-like sauce that accompanied them. The salmon blew my mind. Usually it's a pretty boring choice, but it was so tender and flavorful! The orzo was perfect, and the citrus flavor was very pleasant. It was a very generous portion, and I took half to go because I wanted to enjoy my dessert. The desserts did not disappoint! I'm not usually a fan of baklava, so I was looking forward to the Turkish coffee chocolate mousse more. However, even though the mousse was delicious (and served in a dark chocolate ""cup""), I ended up liking the baklava more. Unlike the typical, overly sweet stuff, this was perfectly flaky and absolutely delicious. I wish I had ordered a coffee (or wine) to go with these tasty desserts. Throughout our meal, the many waiters took great care of us. I would recommend this place to anyone.",1,1,0,Halina M.,"New York, NY",0,106,74

2.0,4/15/2017,"Last weekend, I attended a dinner event at Pera with a fixed menu and limited open bar. The space is very beautiful and decorated simply but elegantly. It is lit well for the most part but the back of the restaurant is lit by the fluorescent light from the open kitchen. The house wines were pretty good but nothing excellent. They do not have any beers on tap which was certainly disappointing. However, they do have several excellent bottled beers including Dragon's Milk and La Trappe. The cheeses were excellent and the appetizers were fine. For dinner, I tried both the citrus salmon and the lamb adana. They were good but not exceptional. The lamb was especially average. The meat was dry and the dish served was mostly french fries. If I were going to order an entree in the price range of Pera, I would hope for something a little more refined or a bit tastier. Dessert consisted of brownies and baklava. The baklava was overly sticky and sweet with not enough pastry to balance it out. However, the brownies were the highlight of the dinner. They were incredibly rich smooth. I am keeping in mind that because we had a set menu the food may not have been a fresh as if I were ordering on my own. Ultimately, this is a very nice spot but it is not worth the price which is why I am giving it only two stars. I think the food is mediocre and the setting only partially makes up for that. The beer selection is good but there are certainly better places to have Mediterranean food in the city.",2,1,0,Jack M.,"West Palm Beach, FL",331,204,442
3.0,4/9/2017,"We came here yesterday for an alumni awards event and I was excited for the dining experience since it's a $$$ restaurant. They have an interesting selection of beer and wine (two trapists beers, if you're into them) and the cocktail hour was a delicious cheese plate and cut vegetables. To start there was a chopped Caesar salad, hummus + pita, and cheese spring roll to share family style - none of which was very high quality, sadly (the hummus was too gritty without enough olive oil). For the main course, we had the adana kebab with fries, and the zesty salmon. The adana kebab was fine but didn't do anything special for me, while the parsley sprinkled atop the fries supplemented the missing flavours of the meat. The salmon was perfectly prepared... If you like eating lemon grounds... The zest was overpowering and didn't leave taste buds room for any other flavours, unfortunately. Dessert consisted of a baklava and a chocolate mouse type brownie. Baklava is meant to be sweet but also flaky on the top and morsely dense on the bottom - theirs did the bottom well with a good balance of sweet, but the top stuck to my teeth which is a bad sign. The chocolate mouse brownie was amazing, though - we liked it enough to steal another table's leftovers.Overall, the ambience and service was great, especially for the location, but the food was unimaginative and disappointing.",0,0,0,Tony L.,"Brooklyn, NY",679,391,656

I was given the standard dinner menu.  After ordering, another woman came to the bar with a happy hour menu, one that was not given to me. I look over the menu and it has all the items I ordered at less than half the price.  I asked the bartender about this menu and he advised that I had to order 1 drink and 2 apps to get the happy hour price.  I then added to my bill thinking I would receive the happy hour pricing.  When I asked for the final bill, they charged me full price for all items.  Reason is ""I didn't request the happy hour menu""  - even after I reviewed it with the bartender and added to my bill (thinking he would honor the pricing).  He then preceded to argue with me that I had to ask for the happy hour menu specifically when asking for the menu (never heard of this)??  This is the first time in NY that any bartender wasn't happy to extend a special to a customer that could potentially be a repeat customer.  When I left the restaurant, I spoke to a manager and he told me that it is the owners policy to ONLY give customers the happy hour menu if they ask for one.  BE WARNED!!!!!  ASK FOR THE HAPPY HOUR MENU!!

Managed to make it here for the last day of restaurant week and took advantage of the resto week menu with the chef's wine pairing list. I started with the mediterranean meze platter which is a pretty standard selection of dips -- hummus, baba ganouj, feta, and spicy pepper muammara(wasn't that spicy,) but heightened with different flairs. My favorite of which was on top of the feta cheese -- they garnished it with an eggplant jam that was so sweet, delicious, and surprising. It was served with these puffy fried chips. However, I often just ate it straight with a fork or with the remaining herbed pita from the bread basket.For my entree, I ordered the chicken adana, which was kind of like a chicken kibbeh with a hint of spice. It was quite tasty, but I also tried my boyfriend's shashlik steak frites, which was a lamb and beef kebab and that was delicious. Cooked to perfection. (And reheated well the next day.)The dessert was a trio of dishes, the aforementioned baklava (yuuuuuuummmmmm,) poached pears with a little slice of mild sweet cheese on it that was very surprising and tasty, and a chocolate turkish coffee mousse. Again the baklava was the star. Still dreaming about it.The restaurant itself has a very refined atmosphere and the waitstaff really makes you feel special.

For the amount that I'm paying, really expecting more from the restaurant. Original:The food here is AMAZING. This is not a place you go by yourself. Or go very often. It's expensive and I often debate whether it's really worth my money. But every time, I cave in for the Warm Hummus with Pastrma. It's just so delicious and creamy. The thin layer of oil and pastrma add to the texture of the hummus but wait, there is more. The platter comes with pita bread sticks and chips. The pita bread sticks are the best I've ever had. The are garlicky, finger licking goodness! Dip this into the hummus/pastrma and you have heaven. Enough said. I order this every single time. (I did have one disappointment a few fridays ago when the pita bread sticks came out a little stale. ugh, I forgive you Pera. Even the beautiful moon has craters.)

Nice/classy environment, but not over-the-topI had the mixed platter which was pretty good although it was heavy on the lamb and not the leanest cut of meat. I have to say it would be nice if they had a few more dishes other than lamb.  Three dip appetizer was good. Rice was  just okay.Unfortunately our waiter was a grouch.  I'm not sure why he was so angry, but he just seemed really mad like he didn't want to be there.

The staff is also very kind, attentive, and accommodating. They were on their ""A"" game.The food: for starters we got the phyllo rolls. They were delicious, which was expected.

The food was OK, but not so good. We ordered one Adana, one lamp chops, and one shahslik kebap (or something like that). The last one was cold.

For my meal, I had the catch of the day, which was red snapper with a tomato sauce and roasted vegetables. They deboned my fish, but there were still a lot of small bones in it. That's something I find particularly off-putting when eating fish, so it made it hard for me to eat a lot of it. It was cooked very well though, and the tomato sauce had a nice rich, wine taste.

IF I ever go back, my tip will be reflective of their service- 5-10%... If you specialize in Mediterranean food, you might want to actually specialize in it and make it worth my while.

I personally liked the halloumi cheese more, it was fresh and roasted perfectly! Another favorite was the Portuguese calamari, it was drizzled with a sauce that was mouthwatering!Main course, I had the baby lamp chops which were delicious. Nothing out of the ordinary or different, jus cooked to perfection! As far as drinks go the bartender was excellent! Don't remember the actual name but I started off with a cucumber gin drink which was mixed well. My coworker had an burbon with infused fig mixed drink. That was delicious and different!!!

We were choosing between Pera and the Italian place next door and trusted Yelp's reviews with our decision. When we got inside it was completely empty - only one table was occupied by a couple of employees, and even though that's usually not a very good sign, we asked to be seated. They told us that there was only bar seating available (for some reason) but asked to be seated on one of the booth tables at the window. They were really great with helping us with the wine list, and they didn't have the wine that we wanted, so we finally chose a Cava which was their recommendation. When they brought the wine to us, it was very warm, which was pretty disappointing. We got a bunch of small plates to share, including the lamb wraps, hummus, eggplant, Brussels sprouts, and fried octopus with the white bean salad. One of my friends is a vegetarian, so we asked to get the hummus without the meat on top. The food was pretty good but not overwhelmingly so. I would have definitely liked it if they gave us some bread or pita for the side of the appetizers - the hummus was amazing, and they only had some dry chips to eat it with, so I wasn't that impressed with the presentation. The eggplant was decent, but it didn't have too much flavor. My favorite dish was the Brussels sprouts - very filling and very well-dressed. I'd recommend getting that along with the lamb wraps and hummus. Everything else was kind of so-so. Finally we shared the chocolate cake with pistachio ice cream for dessert, and it was amazing!

She didn't even give us the choice to check our coats even though my colleague had bunch of stuff. She put her stuff down and then went back and stood at the front with her coat, trying to get the attention of someone to help her check it.

We shared the Char-grilled Spanish Octopus, Homemade Grape Leaves, Mediterranean Dip Trio with Lavash Chips, and Pastirma Wrapped Feta-Stuffed Dates.

My friend and I usually order the lamb lollipops - so good! I love the presentation, they look like round pepperoni chunks on sticks, sticking out of a bed of large salt grains. I don't think I'm doing it justice with my description, I've made it sound worse than it actually is. The lamb burgers are also very good, as is their watermelon (yellow and red) and feta salad. The must try here though, is the fries and hummus. Seriously, very delicious. I'm a fan. Oh!

2.0,8/26/2014,"We went with a Savored discount, fortunately, because it was very expensive otherwise.The food was ok; I didn't think it was anything special. The Montour salad we had was the best part; the complimentary bread was appealing to look at, and soft, but very dense, and the ricotta accompanying it was very dry and very very salty. The waitress was very pushy, which was annoying; after we said that the salad was for the table, she tried to push us into other starters for the table, but finally accepted that we declined; and greatly recommended the specials, which I find irksome because you never know how much they are, and in this case, my friend and I had wanted to share an appetizer and entree, but found when the food came out that the special we thought was an appetizer was actually an entree as well. (It was the better entree, to be sure - ricotta dumplings with enoki mushrooms - but very overly salted.) The other entree we shared was a Chicken Brochette, which was overly soft chicken, to the point that I felt it was either overmarinated or from factory-farmed chickens, which I've found can have an unsavory soft texture. Its accompaniment of thin bread (not sure of the name) and not terribly tasty tomato and onion sides didn't add much. The other two of our party had chicken adana, which appeared to have been enjoyed but seemed rather small (each chicken dish was about $23), and lamb chops, which also appeared to have been enjoyed, but were pricey. For dessert we shared a molten lava cake, which was very good and nicely presented, but tiny for $11; and when one of our party wanted tea, it was $5. $5 for tea?? Yes, they gave him a pot of water to keep it hot, but really?

2.0,8/13/2014,I had so much time in between courses that I decided to write this review while sitting at the table. I was so insulted that this restaurant thought it was acceptable to keep us  waiting so long in between courses that my two course meal took 3 hours!  Very frustrating because I didn't have the time for a meal that took that long.  The waiter was friendly but clueless and seemed helpless that the food took so long.  My husband ordered from the regular menu and I ordered from the restaurant week menu.  I got the wine pairing for an additional $17 and definitely not worth it.  They pour 2 ounces for each of the 3 courses and the food took so long that I sat for most of the meal without any wine.  The operations of this restaurant was poor.I got the sliced steak and frites and my husband got the pan seared dorado fish.  The food was not terrible and not good.  Just ok.  I would not return to this restaurant based upon the service alone.  The bar area is an exception.  Great bar area and attentive bartenders.,0,0,0,Jinny B.,"New York, NY",0,76,2
2.0,8/12/2014,"My company has held lots of events here because they have a large private space available upstairs and the finger food has been acceptable. It's hard to mess up finger food though. When I came here for dinner though - the service and food was pretty sub-par for the price scale of this place (~$25 after tax and tip).We ordered hummus as an appetizer - they just brought the hummus and had to be reminded to bring the chips. My friend ordered the sautéed asparagus Turkish style (a main dish), but was brought the grilled asparagus (side dish). When the asparagus main dish was finally brought to her, there was nothing that resembled asparagus in it. Three other people in my party ordered the same dish (grilled Spanish octopus), but when the dishes came, they were all drastically different (one plate had too many tomatoes, one plate didn't have any avocadoes, etc.) I also ordered the lamb tacos as an appetizer - they were ok, not spectacular (once again, expected more for the price).

2.0,8/5/2014,"I work in the neighborhood and have met people for business lunches at Pera on a couple of occasions over the last two years.  Each time I have been underwhelmed.THE ROOMThe restaurant is spacious and is decorated attractively, with a nice bar area up front.  However I find that the dining room area tends to get extremely loud, to the point where it is difficult to carry on a conversation with all of the shouting going on.  I think this is mostly a function of all the hard surfaces - tile floors, wooden tables, etc. - there is no sound-absorbing material.  This seems like a minor point, but I find it distracting.THE FOODPera's menu is OK, with some Mediterranean dishes and some more western dishes.  I've tried several different dishes (lamb burger, fish sandwich, buccatelli pasta) and the food has always been mediocre - not bad but certainly not memorable.  I came here for lunch last week and was told they had run out of ice cream for dessert....  THE SERVICEThis is one area I've always been disappointed in - the service at Pera is consistently on the slow side.  The waiters/waitresses always seem harried and are never very friendly.In short, I expect much more at this price point.  There are better options in the neighborhood for your lunch or dinner dollars.",0,0,0,Ben C.,"New York, NY",2,63,0
3.0,8/2/2014,"I've been to Pera twice, once for dinner and once for restaurant week and both times Pera was great. It's a very classy atmosphere and it's beautiful inside. For appetizers, we had the Steamed Mussels in Spicy Marash Tomato Broth, which were fantastic. They did not taste of the sea at all, and I hate when seafood tastes like the sea (I know ironic, but I just do not like the taste of smell of it.) We also had the hummus which was very yummie. For the main dish, we had the chicken brochette, which was good. However, it's literally just chicken on a wrap. I didn't like that there were no sides in the order itself. Once again, this is an expensive place, and there should have been a side already included in the order. Since there wasn't, we ordered a side of rice pilaf, which tasted fantastic, but I still believe it should be included in the order. For dessert, we wanted ice cream, however their freezer was broken. We got tiramasu instead since we didn't want baklava. I don't like tiramasu and I didn't like it here either. Their drinks are HORRIBLE. I ordered two mojitos and a long island iced tea. Both had barely any alcohol, tasted disgusting, and were way overpriced. I am never ordering cocktails from here again.

3.0,8/2/2014,"I went there for Restaurant Week and tried a few different things with friends. Now I get that Restaurant Week portions may not be very big but this was just not worth the money for what we got. The place was beautiful and the staff was nice, but the food was average at best. They brought out bread and feta cheese. The cheese was good but the bread was tiny and stale. It was hard to get the cheese on the bread. For apps we had the dipping platter, the lamb chop, and the ceviche.  The dipping platter has tiny tiny little portions and it came with hard pita chips. I'm used to getting fluffy turkish bread when I've ordered this before but it was just not really that good. The ceviche was not raw, it was grilled and had no acidity. It came with a tiny lime but wasn't enough to make it taste like ceviche.  The lamb chop was the best and probably the highlight of the entite meal which was sad because it was also tiny. We ordered the lamb adana and the steaks as the main course. The lamb adana was ok but they only gave you one peice with a ton of flaky bread which served no purpose at all. The steak was good but kinda cold when I got it. Over all this place isn't the place to go to for actual Mediterranean food. For that I recommend you check out any decent turkish or Greek place in Queens or Brooklyn. You'll get better quality and def better portions.

The salted winter mushroom side was great! We finished all of it! We also tried their recommended cake (forgot the name) for dessert and the baklava was def way better!

4.0,4/19/2014,"We stumbled upon Pera because it was close to our hotel and hadn't done much planning for this weekend nyc getaway. The hotel restaurant looked boring and crowded, we didn't want to go far, and Pera looked attractive, not too fancy for us, and had room. We were not disappointed.We were looking for something lighter and wanted variety, so we ordered from the ""Small Plates & Mezes"" section. The Meze Sampler was a sampling of various mezes - which I take to mean a cold appetizer. They were attractively served in a square platter with little compartments and included many Greek / Mediterranean items such as grape leaves, hummus, baba ghanoush, lentil/bulghur tartare, muhammara, tomato/onion salad, etc. Most of the items were quite good, but the presentation made it even better. The hummus, lentil/bulghur tartare, and muhammara were the items I remember as exceptional; the grape leaves interestingly seasoned but not exceptional. The baba ghanoush was boring - or maybe I just don't care for baba ghanoush much.This platter was accompanied by toasted flat bread wedges, but I found the table bread much more interesting (brushed with herbed oil, thick and chewy) and used that instead.We supplemented this cold platter with three hot appetizers: Smoked Lamb Tacos, Mediterranean Meatball Sliders, and Zucchini/Eggplant Croquettes. The Tacos were outstanding, the Meatballs adequate, and the Croquettes disappointing: insubstantial and without much flavor.Overall, I was pleased with the food, in taste and attractiveness. But it is hard to judge a restaurant on tapas, being made in advance and often simply prepared. Still, they did an impressive job with them, and there was enough variety that if I were to return there would be plenty of new items to choose from.We didn't get a chance to try the main entrees, where I feel a restaurant is best able to demonstrate its true talents. They did seem interesting, with a good variety of meats, seafoods, and vegetarian dishes with ""reasonable"" prices (for nyc) ranging from $20-$38.Cocktails were memorable, with interesting house-infused liquors, again with typical nyc prices of $14, excellently made, and strong. There was an adequate selection of wines by the glass.For dessert we shared a sampler of house-made sorbets. I'm a big fan of sorbet, and these were the best I've had anywhere. Blood-orange, mango, and I can't remember the other. Serving size was easily big enough for the two of us.Waiter was attentive, friendly, and knowledgable. We were able to relax and didn't feel rushed. The interior was attractive and contemporary, nice lighting, a bit noisy, with open kitchen, nice looking bar, and tables with sizes ranging from couples to large groups.For nyc I'm giving it 4 stars. I'd rate it 3.5 if I could but keep in mind I'm a hard grader. Back where I live in boring central Mass. this would easily be a 6(!)Would I be back? Sadly, with the amazing variety of new places to try in nyc, probably not.

Especially the one with the lamb bacon. It was delicious with the crispy pita.- TURKISH TACO DUO (smoked leg of lamb and honey-lavender chicken). Personally I didn't like the honey syrup that dripped from the small mini taco and added this sweet rather than savory flavor I was hoping for.For entrees, we had 4 options again but decided with:- MARINATED LAMB ""SHASLIK"" STEAK (thin-sliced center-cut loin of lamb, grilled red peppers and sweet onions) which my boyfriend thought was too dry though he ordered it medium (it was more medium well in his defense). I found it to be just right and it paired deliciously with the thin slices of flatbread/wraps and the salsa.- HAND GROUND SIGNATURE CHICKEN ""ADANA"" (marinated with eastern mediterranean spices, fresh parsley and peppers) was a hit with my boyfriend considering he thought the lamb was dry. It had great flavor and was moist. Also delicious with the thin slices of flatbread/wraps and the salsa.Dessert time and we were presented with 3 options and went with:- PERA'S CHOCOLATE TART A LA MODE (served with vanilla ice cream) where the two triangle tarts were very dense and rich in chocolate.

4.0,1/18/2014,"I've eaten at Pera several times for lunch and dinner over the years. It's a pretty refined place. The servers are quite formal and fastidious, and the food appears to be very carefully prepared. I've mostly eaten fish dishes here (usually dorado and salmon), along with some Mediterranean specialities like dolma, hummus, and a variety of lamb dishes. I've been quite happy with the cuisine. All my proteins are typically cooked exactly as I requested--medium rare for red meat and salmon. I really like the little touches, like the soft rolls, hummus, and olives that come with dinner. The wine selection is good too. I had a 2008 Worthy cabernet sauvignon that was just dynamite. My only quibbles are that 1) it's a little expensive for Mediterranean food, 2) the service is a bit slow, and 3) it's pretty noisy. But we weren't in a rush and my friend was paying with his expense account. So we had a great time. I often choose between Pera and Cibo (Italian), which is at 2nd Avenue and 41st.

We kept asking anyone who passed by if they could check on our food and they would basically lie to us that it would be out in a minute. This went on for 45 minutes before our entrees finally made an appearance.* The food was horrible at best. I had the pan fried salmon. It came over a wilted salad of greens and radishes. The entire plate was greasy and flavorless, all for the bargain price of $21. My husband had the chicken brochette. The few pieces of chicken that made their way on to his plate were of the dark meat variety. He barely ate any of it - another $18 down the drain. My husband also ordered a side of fries, which he sent back because they were too greasy. (As an aside, when my McDonald's loving husband sends something back for being too greasy? That's serious and slightly terrifying.)* The waitress finally came by to see how our food was, after 10-15 minutes. When my husband told her he wasn't a fan of the chicken she offered to have the kitchen make another one.

The dip trio was also slightly better than your average mediterranean dips. I'd probably rank them eggplant, hummus, muammara respectively. We also ordered the spice roasted lamb ribs as an extra appetizer. The 4 ribs were pretty tasty, but not too meaty and slightly on the fatty side.For the main course we ordered the Signature Lamb Adana and the Pan Roasted Salmon. Both were a little overwhelming with the butter. The Lamb was served over pita, cooked well, and was nice and juicy. Again, the butter was a little much. The salmon was also cooked well and had a nice crispy crust, but the butter was even more overwhelming than the lamb as well.Dessert: Rice pudding and Baklava.

We were seated quickly ... and that was the end of the quickness. I ordered the Pera-Style French Toast. It took a maddeningly long time for its preparation. I take one thing back: there was more quickness, when our server placed a plate in front of me and practically ran away before I realized it was someone else's meal. Considering the dining room was nearly empty, we couldn't figure out how such a screw-up was possible. I swear he wasn't even surprised--much less apologetic--when I flagged him down. We noticed that the plate went right to another table. Squick.The good news is that my french toast, when it did arrive, was absolutely fantastic, though low on egg and high on sweetness. (Remind me to stop ordering sugary breakfast and brunch items. I almost mean that.) The pistachio jam underneath was skimpy but scrumptious. The texture of the toast itself--I can't describe the bread other than similar to very thickly-sliced challah--was truly decadent, like comfort food taken to an extreme. The halloumi that laced the dish softened its sweetness and convinced me to down everything on my plate. :^DMy date ordered hummus with lamb bacon and this hummus-doubter must admit that it was the best I've ever had.

Check-in was easy and we were shown to our table as soon as the whole party arrived. Since it was lunch, service was a little hectic and, as others have pointed out, spotty at times.I ordered the calamari appetizer and it was delicious, served with pickled peppers and drizzled with a light sauce.  Next-up was the Pera burger, which to my disappointment was beef, not lamb. Ordered it medium and this burger came out more akin to steak tartar!  This can be a delicacy (I love filet American in Brussels), so I rolled the dice and ate it, but it was still a complete miss. Don't they know how to cook a medium burger? I survived with no ill effects. Overall it was a delicious burger, with interesting toppings, I could have just preferred it more cooked than super rare. I can't imagine what the medium-rare would have been.Dessert was a rice pudding with a crusty caramelized candy top. It was tasty, and my colleagues pistachio baklava looked good too.Overall, aside from the sloppiness in both service and cooking, this place has promise, since it is a bit different.  If they can work out the service and cooling kinks, I think this would be a first rate spot.I'll definitely try it again, as it may have just been an off day.

I was wrong!  The food was different and there was a uniqueness to it.  While I enjoyed it,  it was during restaurant week hence a bit of a bargain compared to the regular menu.Overall great for restaurant week but slightly overpriced for the regular menu in my opinion.  They do charge for little things like sides of yogurt which are a must if one wants to enjoy the kebabs with the pita.  Some of the other sides are also overpriced for the quality.I taught my friends some neat tricks in rolling the pita with the kebab, a hint of the grated onion side and the yogurt.  The delectable art of constructing a kaleidoscope of tastes rather than eating everything individually.  They loved the combination and I felt almost like a magician conjuring up tricks.  Always good to make someone feel a little happier.But I digress,   the places fits 3.5 stars but given it is pricey for the food plus the nickle and diming, I am am forced to take away half a star for bad behavior.Will I repeat for the regular menu?   I'm not sure.  Safe bet for a date you don't know very well or a business dinner but not a favorite for me.",0,0,0,Dark Helmet A.,"Long Island, NY",58,82,8

4.0,11/26/2012,"Here's something pretentious: Until yesterday evening, I'd only experienced the liquor raki in Turkish fiction, a drink that characters down by the glass in Orhan Pamuk's fiction as they think about loves lost and cultures destroyed.As I dropped an ice cube in the clear glass, and watched as, upon contact, it started sending out streams of milky white throughout the liquid, I saw the literary value of this beverage that can be both transparent and opaque.I sipped the raki for 15 minutes, letting it occupy the entirety of my third course. Well, I had a spoonful of the Clementine sorbet, and a couple of forkfuls of the shredded wheat and sweet cheese, but this doesn't count. My meal ended with the bottom of my raki glass.It began with a plate of sophisticated mezes, served family style with baskets of thin and steaming bread. Next to the hummus was a pile of beef tartar and bulgur wheat with enough paprika to take me back to Alkhalaki (and extend an invitation to my fellow diners for all of us to sample Georgian food in Queens. Watch this space.). Also on the plate were a couple of dolmas, minus the bitterness that sometimes turns me off with these stuffed grape leaves, and a creamed herring dip that tasted much better than it sounded.For the main course, I ordered the lamb brochette, which came in big cubes of well-cooked but not dry meat covered with pressed bread. I cut the pieces with a knife and then made small wraps with the accompanying chutneys, one onion based, the other a mixture of pepper, tomato and spices. Both were excellent.In the middle of the table were several side dishes we (Unnecessarily) ordered, including a plate of ""seasoned"" french fries that were too thick, and an unimpressive lump of puffed wheat. The yogurt salad was better, and I mixed it with bites of lamb.By the time it came to the third course, I was relieved to see raki on the menu, listed as a potential dessert pairing. This way, I had something to do during the end of the meal, but I didn't have to eat any more.",0,0,0,Jon S.,"Brooklyn, NY",128,647,1

4.0,7/22/2012,"I really like Pera, but if I had the options to give half stars, I would give them a 3.5.My friend and I went to Pera for a Sunday lunch restaurant week. I'd been there once before a few years ago on a date and had a fantastic time then, so I was hoping for an equally great lunch today. We walked in around 12:30 an it was pretty desolate besides for one or two full tables and ourselves. It got a bit more full as the time passed but was never more than a third full. The service was pretty great initially-- the waiter was more than happy to answer our questions and give us advice on how to make options vegetarian. Water could have come a little more frequently but that's about it that I would have corrected. The service was pretty fast and the portions were enormous! The amount of food we were given for our restaurant week lunch was almost absurd-- easily enough for both my lunch and dinner. I ordered the hummus with chips that came with some beef pastirma (I didn't eat the beef, but my friend said it was good). My friend had the turkish tacos, which were spectacular. Both of us said that we'd had better hummus. The portions were pretty sizeable for appetizers, but when the entrees arrived we were shocked. The fish ciabatta sandwiches that we'd both ordered were enormous. Neither of us were able to finish our sandwiches, and I barely made it through half of mine. The entrees came with the option of fries or a salad-- my fries were fresh and delicious; her salad was large and full of cherry tomatoes. With how heavy and thick the fried fish was, I wouldn't have minded a light salad. Finally, we both had the baklava, which was light, flaky, and covered in pistachios. The meal was overall pleasing and we both took home at least a third of the food they'd served us. Reasons for why I give them 3.5 stars:1) They were not the most attentive with the water, and we were both left thirsty a little too long. 2) I asked to have my food wrapped up, and I left behind the majority of my entree. I would say I had 3/4 of my sandwich left, so when I only found 1/2 of my sandwich at dinner time when I went to eat my leftovers, I was rather cross.3) The entree was great, but my appetizer was pretty boring and barely above bland. I felt like the food was pretty mixed-- luck of the draw with how delicious your food could be. 4) The meals were a bit uneven-- my friends baklava had more pistachios than mine; her sandwich was piping hot and fresh when mine was temperate and cool.5) Would I pay the cost for this place outside of restaurant week?

2.0,2/7/2012,"Went for Restaurant Week and was completely underwhelmed. Ok, the day before I had been to Gotham Bar and Grill where the Restaurant Week lunch menu was AMAZING. But even forgetting the comparison, Pera was barely OK. First, while the decor is nice, the chair I was sitting in was so beat up that the springs were almost coming through. Talk about uncomfortable....Food: I asked the waiter what he'd recommend to start and he said that their signature dish was the salad. When it came, it was basically chopped up romaine with some feta and while not a bad salad, I could have made the same thing at home with no effort, so not at all special, let alone a ""signature dish"". The person I went with had the cauliflower soup and he said it was bland. Then for the main course, we both had the cod sandwich which was tasteless and came on a plain roll with a slice of tomato and piece of lettuce. Again, while not bad, I could have gotten the same quality in a much less expensive restaurant. For dessert, the waiter recommended the baklava. What a let down! I love baklava and this was bleh, both in taste as well as in texture. The person I was with ordered coffee and grains of the coffee grind were floating in the cup! As for service, I'd say so-so. The waiter was nice enough, but not very attentive. When it came time for the dessert, we sat for probably 20 minutes before it came out - and this was for something that took no preparation at all. And it wasn't that busy, so no excuse about him being overwhelmed.So bottom line: at least the Restaurant Week menu was a HUGE disappointment.  I'll never go back!",0,0,0,Alan s.,"Manhattan, NY",0,18,0

5.0,1/25/2012,"Given Restaurant Week is coming up I realized I had to write a review for both Pera and for their events manager Elif. Over the Holidays, I planned a private dinner party on my rooftop for my colleagues and me. Initially we were trying to work with a few of the better know Italian restaurants in the city. But I found these establishments to be difficult to work with. It was hard to get a quote or even consistency in someone to talk with. Granted my request was a bit off market as I wanted to have a chef at our kitchen preparing the food as opposed to basically having a glorified take out meal.  This is where Pera and their events manager Elif excelled. She was quick to provide me a sample menu with options, she was able to get a chef and staff to work our event and even priced in rental of glassware, etc.  Basically, it was like having an event coordinator at the restaurant.At the event, they set up our tables and I have to say, I think the set up looked even better than in their own restaurant. The guys worked hard and after it was all done, they cleaned up perfectly, the food was great, we had an expansive menu for an offsite venue and everyone had a great time. Everyone thanked me for my work in coordinating the evening, but I really have to thank Pera and Elif for all of their hard work and accommodations.Aside from this experience, I do frequent the restaurant for lunch, typically for business lunches and for happy hour and even a colleagues birthday lunch. The staff is always polite and accommodating. The food is consistently good.Restaurant Week would be a good time to get a sample of the menu which is great from the Seafood Salad to the Spicy Calamari and the Croquets.

Then I got to Pera, was surrounded by opulence and wine bottle-filled walls, and felt like walking over to H&M to buy myself a little black dress. But the food...THE FOOD.

First off, the appetizers, all served family-style, included a tomato and onion salad with pomegranate vinaigrette, roasted whipped eggplant and bread with feta cheese, and hummus and chips. The BBQ platter included Mediterranean meatballs, baby lamb riblets, marinated hanger steak, grilled shrimp, and chicken brochette. Side dishes included Mediterranean fries, Mediterranean cole slaw, and bulgur pilaf. Finally, dessert included strawberry shortcake and rice pudding with a caramelized crust.Folks, I did not dislike a single damn thing I ate, and I DID eat more than one of everything.

4.0,7/15/2011,"I came here for restaurant week with a few friends, and I would say that we were all pretty satisfied with our meals. Let's go down the line, shall we?Fried calamari: a solid standard. They served this appetizer with a few pieces of hot cherry peppers, that could be a bit overpowering and hot. However, if you get the tentacle-y pieces of calamari and eat them with the pepper, the combo is pretty delish.Meze trio: stuffed grape leaves, eggplant dip and hummus. I've had better eggplant dip, so this was pretty underwhelming. It was the least popular of the trio amongst my friends as well. On the other hand, we were all singing the praises of the hummus. Warm, flavorful, and simply tasty. Accompanying our two dips was a lone pita chip, thoughtfully placed in the center of the eggplant dip. Although the chip was good, we wished it had siblings or friends; we hadn't been given any more pita to eat our dips with! Thankfully, we had been given table bread, so we finished off our hummus with that, although more pita would have been nice.We had the pan roasted king salmon, chicken brochette and lamab adana for entrees, and they went from best to good in that order. The lamb adana was a bit gamey and earthy for my taste, but my other friends liked it. The chicken was delicious, flavorful and very tender. But who ruled the night? King Salmon! (Sorry, I had to...)At first, our waiter approached the friend who ordered it and apologized that the salmon didn't come out with everyone else's dish, and comped him with free hummus and pita chips. (Hello, pita friends and family!) The waiter explained that the chef just wasn't satisfied with the way that the salmon had turned out. It was worth all of the next couple of minutes that it took for the dish to come out. King Salmon arrived in all of its glory, a dish garnished with blackberry gastrique. Wow. It was absolutely perfectly cooked; I've never had fish that melted in my mouth. King salmon, indeed. It was fantastic. The skin was crusted over, creating a wonderful contrast of textures, and the haricot vert (a very skinny, baby asparagus) was the perfect compliment to the fish.For dessert, we ordered baklava and rice pudding; the rice pudding outshined the baklava for sure. The baklava was tasty, but having eaten amazing baklava at Persepone a few weeks ago, I was just meh about it. The rice pudding had a creme brulee-esque burnt crust that made the dish very interesting, but the pudding itself was good too. Not too sweet, not too milky, just right.Overall, it was a great meal. Great service, up until the end when we waited for a long time to get our check, but we also probably should have flagged the staff down earlier.

It definitely gets crowded around lunchtime, so I'd recommend making a reservation if you're looking to eat around that time during the week. I didn't get a chance to really take in the atmosphere given the more serious nature of the meal, but at the least I got to experience the food. The lamb tacos were absolutely delicious; the lamb was so tender and was smoked perfectly to add a rich flavor. I ended up being a bit unoriginal and ordering the hickory grilled salmon for the main course. You literally get a nice slab of salmon and very little else, but you get a fish that really has the smoky depth and flavor of hickory embedded in it. I've had 'wood-grilled' fish before, but this is the first time I felt like I was really eating something that had been properly prepared in that manner of cooking.My only complaint is that the prices are a bit high relative to where I think they should be given the menu.

To be fair the appetizers were very good and creative. I really liked the hummus with walnut and watermelon with feta cheese. While eating the appetizers I told my dinner companion that. I would definitely go back to this place sometime soon.The entrees however, were pretty disappointing. The shrimp and lamb were a bit dry, the steak was alright, although the chicken was actually pretty moist and spiced just right. Too bad I'm not a big chicken person.I think what I really dislike about this place is the service. The food was served really really slowly, which I can understand because it's a business and they need to earn money (because it's all you can eat for $19), and since it was 4-9 it's not economical to feed people at a fast pace. But did the waiter really needs to give such a shitty attitude to customers? I remembered asking him something and he just turned and leave without even letting me finish the sentence. Other times he just had a bad attitude with a poker face when I was asking him questions about the food. But he was very nice to the middle age Caucasian couple two tables away.

1.0,5/21/2010,"I tried this place tonight for the 3 meze for $9 special- I also got a free glass of wine by 'friending' them on Facebook but after all is said and done- I removed myself from Facebook. As immature as this sound- this place isn't even worth the free shit. When I placed my order- my sister and I got the meze special and 2 sides. We were just sitting at the bar- no need to go overboard with a full blown dinner. I asked for the fries and cacik. Now I get- customer service is usually about getting you to buy more stuff- more expensive stuff but if you want to be high end and classy- even a place like Per Se or Jean George don't try to impose items on you. When I say no- I mean no. don't push it. But the waiter did. That was the first offense.Second offense, everything we ordered came out promptly- except the cacik. When i asked for a status update- the waiter ended up talking down the cacik. ""It's just mint and yogurt."" I know what cacik is, that's why I ordered it- what kind of employee talks negatively about a product you're supposed to sell? I'm paying aren't I? What does it matter? So I tell him- forget the cacik- I definitely don't want it now. I want my check, and yes- I asked for it.Then after my sister finished her wine, we're over half way done with our food, he goes ""Do you want water?"" Most places I go offer water promptly. No- I want my check. This is the 2nd time I've asked now.A few minutes later- can I get you anything else? No, I want my check. 3rd time.Forget this, forget my patronage, I'm done. I had pumped up so many friends about this place and their specials but I'd rather go pay full price, better service and better food- because really Pera- your food is mediocre.

The event was created ten years ago to showcase the rejuvenation of a new culinary scene in midtown New York and serves as a benefit to the Grand Central Neighborhood Social Services Corporation helping the homeless.As I'm not able to review each restaurant past their tasters here, I'll simply give a list of the highlights from the event, whose restaurants have added themselves to my must visit list on my next trip to New York.Ranking first on my list, Pera Mediterranean Brasserie. There, Chef Jason Avery sampled his smoked lamb ""Turkish Tacos,"" which completely blew all other tasters out of the water at this event. The meat was incredibly flavorful and the feta sprinkled over the top added a nice contrast.Ranking second was the Wheeltapper Pub serving a petite canapé of irish curried chicken on fresh baked brown bread and topped with old time Irish marmalade by Chef James Donahue. The curry was mild and chicken shredded. This was the first thing I sampled and it wasn't until the very last thing sampled at Pera that I was uber impressed by another dish... it was a very close second. Ranking third on my list is the Benjamin Steakhouse at the Dylan hotel. There, Chef Arturo McLeod sampled his porterhouse bites with creamy mashed potatoes and Benjamin steak sauce. Incredibly tender steak.And fourth was Pershing Square, sampling their lobster sliders with pickles and chips by Chef Aaron Bashy... quite unique, but still just a slider with too much bread.Honorable mentions include:Aretsky's Patron, At Vermillion, Bice Ristorante, and Triomphe, There was only one to completely avoid, where my notes simply said ""gross:"" Kellari Taverna.All others were simply mundane.

They managed to combine authentic food with great service and a comfortable yet chic setting with sights and smells of the open kitchen.Chef Jason Avery is in charge of the delicious dishes coming out of the kitchen. Spending some time in Turkey himself, he truly manages to create authentic dishes with the right spices, combination of ingredients with excellent presentation.I have been to Pera few times, depending on the night crowd changes from after work to families. My last visit to Pera was on a Sunday and they recently started to offer a $29 per person baby lamb roast with appetizers which I thought was a great deal. This deal is part of the Weekend Mediterranean Marketplace program they are having. You can go see the fresh daily seafood, vegetables, etc. right on the counter then decide on your meal.  According to the chef they will be having this deal on Saturday and Sundays at least for now. This dinner plan is served from 3 PM to 10 PM and before that they also have a similar deal for brunch. On Fridays they have a jazz band without a cover charge.

Pera doesn't look very elegant with all the scapfolding on the exterior, but once you step inside, you are transplanted to a corporate-laden atmosphere.  Most lunch clienteles are business people, older ladies, or maybe a few strands of random visitors. I was just one who wanted to take part of RW's lunch deal.   We sat near the open kitchen, kind of like a hibachi feel, but without all the screaming and yelling? My dining companion chose the pri-fixe.  I just went a la carte after learning that the salmon is farm-raised, not wild.  That defeated my purpose, so I went with a lunch salad, which is just a medley of vegetables, feta cheese (which I asked not to include) and chopped walnuts.  For $15, it's really not worth it, but the greens were fresh.  So my companion chose the dips (hummus and eggplant dip).  I knew the hummus would disappoint me once I saw it.  It was dark-brown (rather than a beige color) and just really dry.  It was also a bit salty according to my friend.  The eggplant was alright.  Nothing special.  I did enjoy the complimentary 'pita pillows'.  The waitress also brought out some more when we finished our first basket.  Yes, we aren't carb-phobic.  Bring it on!The signature lamb 'adana' was like a narrow row of meat.  Kind of not too appetizing to look at, but the flavor was there.  It came with two pieces of flatbread, which was really dry.  Maybe they should just make a bigger version of their pita pillows. Yes, pita pillows...that's what I'll call them from now on.The dessert choices were baklava and poached peach.  Hey, it's a Greek restaraunt, so of course got to go with the fomer choice.  It arrived in two small pieces and they weren't too sweetened by honey.  Is it the best Greek restaurant out there? Probably not , but at least I've tried it and the RW menu is a pretty good deal.",2,2,1,GarGuPi L.,"Flushing, NY",87,496,1696
3.0,7/3/2009,"A-OK because it was overpriced, but tasty.  So on special occasions when craving some refined Greek, this is your place.  Greek food isn't meant to be trendy, but they offer such a widespread here, you're bound to find some well prepared classics.  Sampling is one of the better deals here.  Excellent service is a definite plus here.At happy hour, a selection of any 3 appetizers will run you $9, which is a nice chance to sample what they have to offer.  My brother and I shared roasted eggplant, chicken livers, and beef-bulgur tartare.  The chicken livers were ordinary, the eggplant was bland, but the tartare was surprisingly tasty.  The beef held it's tender meatiness, and the bulgur offered a very nice crunch.  Along with the $9 appetizers, they offer a $30 wine selection as well.  We had a nice white from Portugal.  So for $40, 3 choices and a wine is a nice little pre-dinner snack.  Onto the table... we split the 9 appetizer tray and the mixed grill.  The $22 tray was a nice way to taste a bit of everything the kitchen offers, though the portions are merely a bites worth.  Calamari, watermelon salad, tomato salad, feta cheese, tomato timbale, hummus, dolmas, and anchovies were all fairly bland, don't know why.  Nothing else to really say.The mixed grill offered 4 meats, which were all very tasty.  It's definitely a 1 person portion, albeit a very large single-person serving. One rip off here was definitely the $6 tzaziki sauce.  It was just yogurt sauce for the meat... and it was $6.  It wasn't enough meat for 2 people, but we definitely were full after 12 appetizers.  Grilled lamb and chicken chunks were tasty, but nothing fancy.  The gyro type lamb meat was killer, for gyro meat.  Like my brother said, if it was on any gyro cart in NY, it'd be so worth $5.  Too bad, it's only found in this expensive Greek restaurant.  Otherwise, it doesn't really justify itself to be served at an upscale place like this.  Finally, the lamb riblets... they were definitely juicy and fatty, but they didn't have that BBQ tenderness.  That was not my favorite part of the grill.  Also, when my brother bit into the riblet, it was literally just fat.  More meat, more tender would be nice on the ribs.Pera definitely offers a nice twist to semi-fancy dining, but for Greek, you may enjoy a cheaper, more rustic restaurant, and for fancy, you may prefer classic French dining.  Nonetheless, this upscale restaurant has some unique dishes to offer, just at a slightly higher price than your normal Greek tavern.",0,0,0,Solomon W.,"Austin, TX",571,2577,7
5.0,6/8/2009,"Let me start off by saying that I was shocked that this place only rated three and a half stars. It is amazing. It has great food and a nice trendy upscale atmosphere. I came here with a couple of friends of mine on Saturday night and man did we have a feast! One of my friends is actually Turkish so we let him do most of the ordering. We started off with drinks. I had the 303 Madison. Strong, sweet and delicious. I also tried the cherry mojito, pomegranate cosmo and pearatini. All three were good, but the 303 Madison was the best by far. I think it had to do with the strawberry syrup they make in house. We then moved on to way too many appetizers. We had the crispy phyllo rolls, warm hummus with patirma, Mediterranean cheese plate, pastirma wrapped feta-stuffed dates, chicken ""adana"" cut rolls, Mediterranean meatballs, beef and bulghur tartar, and probably one or two others that I can't think of at the moment (yes we did have over 10 appetizers and there were only 5 of us). They were all amazing. I would have to say my three favorite were the crispy phyollo rolls, Mediterranean cheese plate and the pastirma wrapped feta stuffed dates. Oh and the bread was really good too. It was puffed pita squares with feta cheese on the side. Then for the main meal I got the mixed grilled platter. It was a little taste of everything. It came with chicken brochette, lamb loin brochette, seasoned lamb riblets and one other thing that I can't remember. My favorite was the seasoned lamb riblets. Since the sides were a la carte we ordered a bunch for the table. We had the bulghur pilaf, potatoe casserole, yoghurt ""cacik"" and the fire-roasted vegetables. My favorite was the yoghurt ""cacik"". I used that to dip all my meat in. When it came to dessert I was so stuffed I had to pass. That is very unlike me, but I couldn't fit in one more bite. The rest of the party ordered dessert. Everything looked so good! I really can't wait to come back here again. I wish I could go there today!",1,0,1,Crissy H.,"Warwick, NY",150,675,52

3.0,4/10/2009,"I have been back to Pera twice since my previous review.  While I enjoyed it on both of these subsequent visits, I was not as impressed with the food as on my original trip.  The Homemade Grapeleaves were mushy and stuffed more with meat than the rice I am usually accustomed to.  I know that this sounds more appealing, but I found the dark brown goo bland and unappealing.  The Roasted Whipped Eggplant was a creamy tart blend of fresh eggplant.  The light and airy spread was a truly authentic taste of the Mediterranean.  The Hummus was a bit bland and thick, but was saved by the crisp, smokey Turkish meat strips scattered across the top spread.  The Soujouk Lollipops were unique round chunks of hickory sausage literally skewered on lollipop sticks.  The meat was packed with flavor, but I could see beads of grease sweat oozing from its pores.  The Lunch Salad was a lettuce-heavy blend tossed with walnuts, cheese, and a few mixed vegetables.  It was tasty, but not nearly as interesting as the Mediterranean Salad with its native tomato, cucumber, and onion blend.  While I still enjoyed my marinated Chicken Brochette, I found the chicken chunks slimy.  The meat was definitely not taken from a high-quality part of the bird.  The side of Grilled Spicy Peppers packed a smoky kick.  The Mediterranean Fries were crisp and beautifully seasoned with regional spices.  Their Flourless Chocolate Cake was carved into an Egyptian-style pyramid and was plated with a scoop of ice cream, chocolate sauce, and seasoned whipped cream.  The beautiful plate tasted even better than it looked.  Flourless cake is quite dry, but this chocolate decadence was moist and sweet.  It was more like a bread pudding consistency.I am very torn on my rating for Pera, because while I enjoyed some dishes, i found others not up to par.  On a whole, the restaurant is beautiful and authentic.  I recommend trying it for yourself.",0,0,0,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

She had a laptop and kept ordering drinks and appetizers. I understand and sympathize with the need to get work done and also grab some food but the show she was putting on was really distracting and rude. at 8pm if you need to do work, just get takeout!

4.0,3/6/2009,"I came upon the recommendation of co-workers.  Apparently, the lamb burger is to-die-for.  We went in late (almost 2 pm) and there were still a good amount of people there.  Opted to eat at the bar to speed things up.  Bartender was very friendly but not overbearing.Since I'm not big on red meat, I opted for appetizers.  Though, I must admit that the burger sounded/looked delicious.  The fries that accompanied, I did try.  Crisp, not too thick/thin, sprinkled with dried herbs.  Could easily eat one too many of these.My order consisted of raw tuna(?) marinated in dill-lemon vinagrette, a roasted eggplant pidette and a spinach-pine nut pidette (think open-faced calzone but with a non-cheesy filling and dough more like pita than pizza).  The fish was very fresh and wonderfully flavored.  Eggplant pidette was ok.  Spinach pidette was delish but the filling was a little too moist.  Crust was soon soggy.  Last was a cup of tea.  Unique presentation.  Instead of a box of bagged teas, they have a box of loose tea in small glass containers with stoppers.  You are encouraged to open them and smell the tea leaves while deciding.  We went with cassis, a strong black tea.  It's served in a French press.All in all, I loved the environment and service.  Would love to come back and try more of their food.  I wasn't paying this time so I only vaguely noted prices.  Rounding up, I would say $20 for an entree, $4 per pidette (about the size of one bruschetta toast), $10 for other appetizers.",0,0,0,Tiffany T.,"New York, NY",32,230,2
4.0,3/4/2009,"First dates can be the start of something beautiful. I like most men want the woman in my life to think I am polished, savvy and successful. Picking the right place to lounge, eat and get to know each other helps to convey all of that and if I have been ""cool"" she may just say ""yes"".We sat at the communal table which seats ten or so people. It is in the middle of the bar and is made of a beautiful solid piece of wood. She and I opened menu and found a large selection of small plates, entrees and wine list on the back. Not over whelming we found a few choices that sounded very good: Soujouk Lollipops, Lamb ""Adana"" Cut Roll, Pidettes of Fire Roasted Eggplant, Pidettes of Ground Seasoned Lamb, Grilled Asparagus and Warm Hummus with Pastrma. OK, where do I start? Each dish was a perfect size to share, each uniquely seasoned, and presentation was beautiful. The pidettes are a thin crust pizza and were our favorites. The lollipops and rolls were very good, mildly spicy and good choices for meats. Now depending on how hungry you are the food we had ordered was enough but things were going well so we decided on some dessert; we had the Chocolate Molten Cake with Pistachio Ice Cream and Warm Semolina Dome. Personally, I liked the dome but, let's face it, chocolate rules and the molten cake would satisfy anyone with a sweet tooth. We had ordered a bottle of 2004 Chateau Ormes de Pez, Saint Estephe from Bordeaux and it was excellent. Our server was very nice, easy to talk to, answered a lot of questions and made some very good recommendations.

Mini ribs, meatballs, hummus, baba ganoush and fried artichoke (we skipped the diet friendly that night---it'd been 6 months since my friend and I got together) add 2 glasses of wine to the mix and you have yourselves an amazing dinner. When we asked if we should get anything else, he told us to save room for dessert. But not just any dessert, the CHOCOLATE NIRVANA. Well, if you tell me a dessert is named that before I get through my first glass of wine---I'm sold!Everything was great. Our waiter was friendly and the atmosphere just added to it.

4.0,7/18/2008,"Came here yesterday at noon sharp with a party of three. We had reservations, and the place was nearly empty, so we were quickly seated and treated continuously with top notch service. Fifteen minutes later the place was packed with the corporate crowd. The iced tea is served unsweetened with a very light, rose petal-infused syrup on the side. Nice touch; Great aroma!My food experience was actually really nice, and I think it was probably because of what I ordered. We started with the 'fried artichoke hearts' that were served with a lemon wedge and dipping sauce much like fried calamari often is, and a couple of the 'traditional pidettes.' We got the spinach and pine nut pidette as well as the kasseri cheese, which was much like a pepperoni pizza. So far so good.I can't really vouch for the lamb dish my acquaintance ordered since it just didn't look that great and I didn't bother to try it. My entree on the other hand, a special not on the normal menu, was a delicious fried 'soft shell crab' served above what I'd describe as a watermelon salsa or relish. It was original and absolutely amazing. Another special was an entire red snapper 'fish of the day' which was at the same time delicious but overall not impressive or that creative for an upscale Mediterranean Brasserie. Accompanying the main courses, we added a side of Grilled Asparagus (that's exactly what it was, hmmm) and their house fries which were decent.We finished the meal off with a couple of desserts. I was getting full, but I'm so glad we did because what arrived was nearly the highlight of the meal. A 'shredded wheat' dessert, served warm in pancake form, is crispy and at the center dense with some soft sweet paste. A honey-like sauce was drizzled over it. New to me, and I'd go back just to have that again. We also ordered a chocolate cake that came with a side each of hot chocolate to drizzle over it, pistachio ice cream with crushed pistachios and fresh whipped cream. It was dense and heavenly in chocolate pureness, not over-sweet at all.The food wasn't mind-blowing, but I had a pretty good food experience.

It looked closer in color to what I'd expect for hummus, and the flavor was just too weak, mostly whipped oil and not a hint of eggplant. At least the sesame bread for dipping was decent, but even on that end I've had much better.My main entre was lamb skewers, which were tasty.  They were done correctly with a good flavor to the marinade. They weren't anything special, but ended up being strong on their own, since I didn't like the sides they came with. The side salad, however, did have a good flavor.Service was decent, though a bit slow at some times and over attentive at others.  I had asked for an additional side dish which the waiter clearly didn't understand, since it didn't show up on the bill.  I'd had enough food, so I didn't ask.In the end, though, the meal I got was nowhere near worth the $80 range I ended up pushing into with drinks. If this place were cheaper I wouldn't warn against it, but I really cannot recommend it to anyone footing their own bill (my company will pick up my tab).",2,0,1,Michael D.,"Culver City, CA",19,134,183
2.0,1/4/2008,"Tonight 12 of us went here for dinner. We'd arranged it all ahead. Table was ready upon arrival. (good.)Drink orders were taken. Their specialty cocktails I found to be either too strong or too sweet. Too bad really, especially for the prices per cocktail. Because we were given a limited menu of options, appetizers were going to be served family style. This if fine. It means everyone can try everything. Waiting over an hour for the family-style appetizers to be served...not fine.Dinner was served -- we had the options of chopped lamb, chopped chicken or monk fish. All were just eh. OK. Nothing to write home about. a 3 sectioned plate was brought out with sides to go with the two chopped meat entrees. We had to order 2 more rounds of these veggie sides just to have enough to go around. Just as we were almost finished with the entrees, the grilled veg and rice sides arrived at the table. 30 minutes after the meal had been served. Bad.Desserts we had two options -- baklava or poached seasonal fruit (quince tonight.) Baklava was dull in flavor and poached quince was overly sweet. Again, too bad. On a high note - the Muscat dessert wine was tasty as was the coffee.The wait staff was attentive...which brings the rating UP to 2 stars.I cannot recommend it for a group. Definitely not at over $115 per person after tip.",0,0,0,Kimberli M.,"New York, NY",124,423,156
4.0,11/19/2007,"Pera has only been open for a couple weeks and I already like it better than most of my Mediterranean mainstays. Each dish was quite frankly excellent and original. We started with fried artichoke hearts, done in a chickpea batter, which was very delicious, if a little bit oversalted. Smoked eggplant, unbelievably delicious smoky flavor, much better than babba ganoush somewhere else, though again a bit oversalted. Octopus salad phenomenal - better than ceviche, better than the poached seafood salad you get as antipasti at an Italian restaurant. Beet salad was excellent as were the pidettes. The lamb brochette main course was excellent quality lamb tenderloin, not gamey tasting, no fat, wonderful acoutrements. The service was also excellent. And the space is beautiful. this place rules. ck",2,1,2,curtis k.,"Santa Monica, CA",10,50,2
5.0,9/2/2007,"pera is absolutely amazing.  I have eaten dinner here twice and each experience was noteworthy.  The decor is beautiful and I love the open kitchen in the back.  The zebra wood bar is a work of art.  Food is very tasty, with grilled meat their real forte.  The meze sampler is a great way to start off a meal and gives you a good taste of almost all the appetizers on the menu (along with a very nice presentation).   The lamb adana, the house specialty, is a must try.  The pidettes are a nice complement to the meal.  A full dinner with wine/drink will run you roughly $80-$100 per person...well worth it!",1,0,1,neil n.,"New York, NY",0,2,0
4.0,7/28/2007,"I was going to the Philharmonic in Central Park and heard about the picnic for two basket.  I was skeptical of the quality/execution of the food after the reviews, but couldn't pass up the cute little basket!!  Plus Mediterranean/finger food would be perfect for the park.  The food was superb and it definitely filled up the two of us.  It came with hummus, baba ghanoush, pita, salad, pickled vegetables, 4 skewers of chicken, and 4 pieces of baklava.  I think it cost in total $40 + $7 dollar deposit for the picnic basket.  Not bad for the amount of food and for the wonderful experience.",2,2,2,Miss H.,"San Francisco, CA",43,217,38
4.0,6/12/2007,"I took a client to lunch here.  The service was a bit slow, but the overall experience was very good.  I thought the food tasted good, and the presentation was even better.  I agree with other reviews that the interior was well decorated and had good lighting.",3,0,1,Paul Z.,"Denver, CO",12,12,0
4.0,2/2/2007,"Pera is as good as an upscale Turkish restaurant you can find.I'm surprised the other reviews are not better, I thought the food was quite good. I went as a group of five on a week night and we were ALL Turkish.  The atmosphere is nice, it has the best design out of all the Turkish restaurants in the city.  It was on the pricey side, we ordered a LOT of food and Raki (Turkish anise-flavored alcoholic beverage) and ended up paying $100 per person with tax and tip.  I think that on average most people end up paying about $80 per person with drink.  I have noticed that most people don't want to shell out this amount of money for an ethnic food experience and I totally get that.  But if you want upscale Turkish, I think this place has a lot to offer.The grilled meats were all good.  Definitely try the chicken and lamb kabobs and the Adana.  The chicken was sooo juicy and tender, definitely my favorite.  If you are adventurous, try the bulgur and minced meat tartare, this is actually the first Turkish restaurant I've seen that makes this dish in New York.  The hummus wasn't all that.  I think the best option is the tasting menu which I think was $45 per person.  You get a selection of apps, entrees and dessert.  Oh and watch the Raki intake, you WILL get plastered.  I was HURTING at work the next day.",4,4,4,Melodie M.,"NY, NY",191,68,0
4.0,12/23/2006,"Had lunch there with a friend. Somewhat difficult to locate. Once you are in, it looks much better than in pictures... brighter, fresh, open. Seating is comfy and the tables are not too small. Food was really delicious.. a bit heavy on the spices but all good. With 2 apps, 2 entrees, 2 desserts, bottle water, coffees - total $100 (before tip). I will def eat here again",2,0,2,Hector L.,"Redmond, WA",42,82,30
