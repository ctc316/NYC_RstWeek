4.0,4/27/2019,Great atmosphere and food. The menu has a little bit of everything from asian dishes to seafood to more traditional fare. Bartenders made excellent drinks. Service was on point.

3.0,3/23/2019,"Came here a few days ago with 4 girlfriends. The place has a very convenient location to Lincoln Center, which is it's biggest plus. We had a 5 o'clock reservation & were seated promptly. We had a lovely, enthusiastic waitress who made the experience very pleasant. As for the food, it was good, but not great. We ordered 5 different appetizers to share. Their rainbow roll was yummy, the spicy steamed shrimp dumplings were delicious as were the shrimp & lobster rolls. House salad was blend, octopus the same as everywhere else. For the main course we chose grilled Branzino, Branzino a la Planche (which did not have the crispy skin as promised and was basically underseasoned all around) the Scallops were pretty good. For dessert we only had cookies, which were ok, but my late was tasty.",0,0,0,Mila T.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,21,9

We sat at the bar and Josh took care of us. Such a lovely bartender. Incredible knowledge and made us feel right at home. The manager Sam even stepped in to see how our meal was going.

3.0,3/2/2019,"We visited during restaurant week. Was seated right away even though my reservation didn't seem to go through so it felt like we were off to a good start. After we were seated and got our menus, the waiter asked if we had any time constraints or a show to get to. We informed him that we didn't and jokingly said we had some catching up to do. He responded that he would be there all night. We thought it was in response to our statement. Apparently that is where we went wrong. He got us our sparkling water, asked about our drinks and disappeared. Not in the sense that it was busy at that time and he had multiple tables, but in the sense that he walked past us a minimum of  four times, assisting a table that arrived after we did, refilling water at another table, getting dessert choice from another table, etc.I know that he said he was going to be there all night but we didn't know that we were going to be there for longer than expected simply because we didn't have a show or anything. We had to literally flag him down. Then because he was rushing to accommodate other tables, he poured regular water in my sparkling water which for $8.50 a bottle, was a bit frustrating. Definitely a first world problem.The three stars are for the bus boys and the food.",0,0,0,Teandra R.,"Bronx, NY",16,44,26
5.0,3/2/2019,"Went here before a 7:30 curtain time, they were good at making sure we were on schedule. The oysters were phenomenal (although they didn't point out which were which until we asked). I had the salmon which was delicious, I loved the Parmesan arancini... wish there were more of those little guys on my plate! He had the snapper which from the two bites I could sneak off his plate was very flavorful, especially the Spanish rice. The overall atmosphere was low light and Romantic, the restaurant was packed (make a reservation) our server was attentive and checked on us often.

5.0,2/24/2019,"I had dinner at Atlantic Grill last night with two friends. It was splendid--the food, the service, and the ambience. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu--both for food and cocktails. We enjoyed refreshing Aperol Spritz drinks to start our dinner. The table shared the steamed shrimp dumplings with a bright and spicy pepper sauce, as well as some luscious shrimp and lobster spring rolls. Each of us chose a different fish for our entrees, and nobody was disappointed. We had the cod piccata with a bright lemon whipped potatoes and broccolini, the Atlantic salmon dinner, with crunchy aranacini and tender turnips and veggies, and the simply grilled swordfish, with a side of potatoes and cheese gratin, with truffled breadcrumbs. The standouts amongst these three were the salmon dinner, and the swordfish, which was the most tender preparation of swordfish I've ever eaten. We shared the banana tower dessert, which was prepared with a nut brittle cone, filled with caramel iced bananas a, vanilla ice cream, and whipped cream, sitting on top of a generous caramel and fudge sauce drizzle. They had a hot tea selection (Harvey &Sons teas), which was just the right touch for us after that dinner, although coffee lovers would probably like a latte or espresso with that dessert.",0,0,0,Sharon S.,"San Jose, CA",0,130,5
5.0,2/19/2019,"I had such a great experience here. Absolutely loved the food and haven't stopped raving about it since we left. My husband, my mom , myself and 10 month old daughter stopped in for brunch. It was our first time here. We were seated towards the back of the restaurant which is actually a different entrance on the next street over. I ordered the salmon burger which came with fries. It was FANTASTIC. I have to be honest, I I was so surprised. The salmon was soooooop juicy and well seasoned. Omg. Everything was amazing. This is for sure our new Sunday brunch spot. Our waiter was also very pleasant.",0,0,0,Destiny W.,"Hackensack, NJ",2,52,36
5.0,2/11/2019,"I can't say enough about my experiences here.  The food is amazing, the staff is attentive, and the environment is great.  I've eaten all over the city, from trendy downtown spots that come and are gone a year later, to sports bars in the east village, to the traditional midtown mainstays.  There is a reason that the Atlantic Grill is here and strong.  The dumpling appetizer is super fresh, the Brussels sprout salad is filling, and the entrees are made with great ingredients and with great prep. I've had the steak - which was so filling I had a hard time finishing, the branzino, and lately the short rib pasta special.  I'd do them all again.  I'd recommend the Atlantic Grill to anyone, particularly people who are always trying to catch the latest new spot. Take some time to come to midtown, have a long meal, and enjoy the vibe.  Especially one where you don't have people sitting on top of you like you do at smaller restaurants, where you feel like you are part of their conversation.",0,0,0,Connor S.,"Baltimore, MD",0,21,2
3.0,2/3/2019,"Came here for restaurant week with a friend but we end up ordering one restaurant week special and other dishes off the menu.  For restaurant week, we ordered the shrimp and salmon maki which was just ok.  Being a huge sushi fan, I'm not fond of all the rice and thought the portion was too large as an appetizer, but some people may like that.  We also ordered the salmon which was pretty good and the chocolate mouse which was decadent and rich.  Off the regular menu, we had the lobster bisque which was delicious, the seared scallops with wonderful corn accompaniment, sweet and savory.  For dessert, we also had the chocolate lava cake, but the lava was a little bit too thick for my taste. The location is great, right across from the Lincoln Center, service was fast and attentive.  The restaurant is so much larger than I thought with an extra room in the back where the bathrooms are located.  Overall, I may return to try other things.",0,0,0,Julie C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,126,0
3.0,1/26/2019,"Luxe Pub, Uneven.This is the old O'Neil's, a swank and upscale pub environment that I really enjoy! We ordered off the Restaurant Week menu, which was the Atlantic Grill's chance to showcase their best food and entice us to come back. The squash soup was excellent. Unfortunately my friend and I had mixed reaction to the rest of the meal. The maki my friend had did not have much flavor and the rice was thick and chewy. The brick chicken I ordered looked great, but while the chicken was moist it lacked flavor as did the polenta, and I'd rethink the mote of gravy around the plate. The valrhona chocolate mouse was good. The carrot cake cheesecake was chewy and oddly flavored. Though RW, this is one of the few times I've had a restaurant add a $7 charge for any dessert and include just 2 courses in the RW prixe fix. In summary, an uneven experience.",1,0,0,Ivy C.,"New York, NY",75,117,2

4.0,1/14/2019,"We arrived a bit early for our 5pm reservation after a matinee show at Lincoln Center. The host welcomes us and asks if we'd like to check our coats, we do. We are taken across the restaurant (This place is huge - entrances on 64/65th St) and given an awesome rounded booth meant for 3. Really an excellent table to check out the smaller bar and people watch.We order a mule and negroni and given an uninspiring bread loaf (better to save room for the menu). Didn't try the mule and negroni wasn't the best one I ever had. There are many things I wanted to try on the varied menu so we ordered some plates to share:3 east & 3 west oysters: Quality oysters, but our server didn't bother to point out which were which. I liked the horseradish sitting separate in with cocktail sauce and a choice of mignonette as well.Charred Octopus: A loved how tender and flavorful the octopus was, but the portion was rather small. Nicely plated.Truffle Rainbow Roll: If you plan on getting any sushi rolls, let this be the one! A common RR is elevated with a citrus truffle sauce, which is probably the best sauce I ever had on a sushi roll ever! We shamelessly ordered another. This pairs excellent with the house Riesling.Hunts Point Fish Market Scallops: Everything you want in a scallop - plump, juicy, perfectly cooked on a bed of roasted corn, mushroom and tofu. The thai coconut-curry was very light and did not overpower the scallops at all. We had the kitchen split this entree.Brussel Sprouts: Maple Sherry was a bit too much sweet for me and I would have prefered large bacon pieces. I had better.For Dessert we went with a new item - Banana Ice Cream Tower which is served inside a cylinder of hazelnut, almost brittle candy like, with chunks of banana and ice cream inside. Beautifully presented and a good finish. They serve a great cup of coffee.This place gets packed so make a reservation! Our server was decent, but we heard others giving diners more recommendations and going over the market fish of the day. Got the sense that they know they are a long time, popular classic so didn't try as hard.",21,8,19,Mike S.,"Long Island, NY",658,662,3101

2.0,12/30/2018,"....came here for the first - and probably the last - time over the Christmas holidays.  On the plus side, our party was seated right on the time we had requested.  The service was adequate, although the server was clearly overwhelmed with work, since she apparently had several large parties to wait upon  -  by herself.  The food was mediocre and somewhat overpriced, for the amount of food one was served.  For example, an order of scallops came with just three scallops and a bit of roasted corn and mushrooms, for a price of $36.  The Lobster Bisque, at $14, was served cold.  Most of the entrees that were ordered by those in our party were overpriced and significantly  small.There are many excellent restaurants in NYC....this is not one of them.",0,0,0,John C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,0
3.0,12/28/2018,"First off, food was phenomenal. Amazing preparation and the cookies were incredible. The service was pretty absent. I worked for this company before it was sold and the attention to detail was so intense that it gave me nightmares when I was a host, but gave patrons an incredible dining experience. Went on Christmas night for dinner with my family and our server was so swamped, with zero bus service to help, and we spend most of our dinner with old plates on the table all the way through dessert. We had most of our sushi appetizer plates on the table all the way thru the meal, and no one cleaned them off till dessert when I asked a busser toHelp. It was really gross and sad because service used to be The top priority here. I also never saw a manager, who would normally be on the floor to make sure this would never happen. Such a bummer for a place with terrific food,but this seems to be a theme.",2,0,1,Tracy M.,"Brooklyn, NY",572,12,0
4.0,12/26/2018,"We went here for Xmas dinner and it was wonderful. The interior is very nice and has a cool brick throughout the restaurant. We order the chopped salad, crab legs and crab cakes. Everything was fresh and delicious. For dinner we order the swordfish, salmon and scallops. The swordfish was great and had a nice Asian flavor to it. The scallops and salmon were cooked to perfection and tasted great. The only knock was the service was not great and they need bussers to help their over worked waiters.

3.0,12/15/2018,"I came here for dinner and the service was great, but the meal was just missing something. This was our favorite place on the upper east side, until it closed. We ordered the following:-lobster bisque: this had good flavor, but it was cold. The one thing important for a soup is for it to be hot. -chopped salad: very oily and I really miss the old chopped salad with olives, capers, feta, chickpeas and white wine vinegar (it was sooo much better)-special sushi roll: crab and mango inside with tuna on the outside. Very good and one of our favorites of the night-Cod Picatta: this was not good and it cannot be called picatta. The fish was way over cooked and there was no taste of lemon-roasted chicken with gnocchi: other than the sushi roll, I would recommend this dish. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the gnocchi was light and fluffy. The mushroom cream sauce that it came in was amazing!

1.0,12/6/2018,"Bartender James verbally attacked my dinner guest while I was away from the table in the men's room. Totally unacceptable treatment of a restaurant guest by a staff member.My friend merely asked James if he could assist her in getting a waiter to our table to take our drink and food order since no one had yet showed up at that point.. She asked the question nicely with no attitude. James obviously either had an attitude towards women OR had a traumatic, upsetting incident during the day.  It is of no consequence to anyone what transpired during his day that caused him to go on the attack.  We all have bad days no matter what field we are in and most of us (except James) have learned how to deal with it without letting it affect our job.  If James can't control his temper and nasty sarcasm, he should seek employment away from the service industry.The Manager, who was made aware of this rude treatment, simply removed 2 glasses of wine from our bill thinking that feeble attempt to appease us would suffice.  We asked for an apology from the bartender but was told that was not an option. Additionally, instead of an apology we endured the mocking hand waving and offensive grinning at us from James during our dinner. Can you imagine this?My friend has been a regular patron of the Atlantic Grill (West 64th St) for several years but now feels conflicted about patronizing a restaurant that condones this atrocious behavior by not taking action against the offending party.What would you do?  How would you feel?",3,0,0,Lawrence R.,"Manhattan, NY",2,8,0

This place is good for seafood lovers and half of their menu features sushi rolls.

Well, AG exceeded my happiness in regard to ANY sushi I've had before. Ok, so, it's a bit of a splurge(really just a bit. It's not that ridiculously priced) but I told myself: ""Kat, you need to have a good Rose' before taking a walk through Central Park - I simply had to celebrate the first day of summer with an excellent Rose' and some fresh sushi!!!

1.0,6/10/2018,"Atlantic Grill used to have a great selection of really well prepared simply grilled fish and freshly prepared salads.  Now, since it was bought out by a big chain that owns Bumba Gumps, it has become an awful factory of carelessly prepared inedible food.  We had a disgusting shrimp salad that was not edible.  Too much salt, undercooked (see-through) tiny, rubbery shrimp and huge wads of watercress and kale the chef had not even bothered to chop or get rid of stems.  Truly one of the worst salads ever.  Server and manager were very gracious and asked if we wanted to order something else.  But, by then, we had lost our appetites.  Find somewhere else to eat before going to Lincoln Center!",0,0,0,Carol C.,"New York, NY",0,9,0

The Bronzino was sautéed and had a nice moist buttery lemon flavor. The spinach is cooked with garlic, but I'm not a big garlic fan and had them cook it without the garlic... it was still very delicious.

2.0,5/26/2018,"We dined here pre Lincoln Center and have dined here several times in the past. However, ever since the BR Guest group became part of Landry's Restaurants, there has been a noticeable decline in quality. We had a reservation and were seated promply. Our appetizers were theFaroe Island Salmon Poke pickled daikon crispy rice avocado & edamame soy sofrito (This was the best dish of the night) and the Lobster Bisque. The Maine Lobster Bisque was served with poached pears profiterole and creme fraiche This dish was a mess. I couldn't find the creme fraiche, the profiterole were ridiculous and the poached pears were more like candied pears and the dish was insanely sweet. One of our entrees was theAtlantic Cod Piccata with lemon whipped potato asparagus peas and brown butter crust . The dish was good but the portion was small. Our other entree was the Branzino ala plancha with artichokes barigoule baby potatoes italian salsa verde. This dish was FAR better a year ago. Today the dish was insanely salty and fishy and dry and oily at the same time.  Dessert was the ice creams which were good. Now for the additional reasons for the low rating. The restaurant's website indicates that their Prix Fixe menu is served daily. Our server told us that it is NOT served on Saturday despite the fact that we ordered from the prix fixe menu on previous Saturday evenings. Their website doesn't indicate that the prix fixe isn't served on certain days. In addition, we were told that the ""Simple Grilled"" do not include any ""Sides"" and we would have to order a side if we wanted one. On every previous visit our server indicated that the ""Simply Grilled"" entrees included a choice of side. Even worse, the person who took our order also refilled our water AND cleared our table. Either this restaurant is really cutting back on staff to save money or they are no longer comfortable having highly competent illegal ailiens on staff thanks to our President. Anyway, it seems that this restaurant is trying to nickle and dime every patron and will probably close the way that the once excellent Ocean Grill and Atlantic Grill Upper East Side has.  Really sad what this restaurant has become.",1,0,0,Bob G.,"JAMAICA, NY",17,213,400

4.0,5/14/2018,"Well, I loved it here. Great for pre-theater drinks and dinner or a full-length dinner around the Lincoln Square area. True, the atmosphere isn't as hip as The Smith or Boulud nearby but I'll take quiet/able to have a conversation over loud/trendy any day. Plus, our waiter was incredibly friendly and re-filled our bread basket not one but three times (the thing they don't tell you about graduation ceremonies is how hungry you get after the whole thing is over). Let's start with the house bread while we're at it. I'm always impressed when there's some effort put into the bread, given that it's free and there'a always a chance it'll go uneaten. This one came in sourdough and focaccia, the latter of which was SO much better than other places, both toasted, with a pat of warmed butter. Again, I personally love it when my butter comes slightly hot. Not a fan of trying to scrape out flecks of refrigerated butter. Do yourself a solid and order the lobster bisque and spend most of the meal trying to soak up the last drops while looking as dignified as possible. Give the oysters a whirl. There's no $1 happy hour like at Mermaid Inn but I found these babies incredibly tender and sweet. We ordered one of the sushi specials - while it was good, I think it's generally a good life tactic to save the sushi for the Japanese restaurants, not the fish and grill places. They got the fish part down but the rice was unevenly cooked and there was way too much of it as filler. Also ... I got one of the best chopped salads ever. The AG's salad counts as one of my top five. The dressing could have used a bit less lemon, as the acidity got overwhelming at times, but the reason you're not seeing a photo is because I ate it too quickly. This salad actually delivered on the ingredients besides the greens filler: tons of snap peas, grapes (!!), tomatoes, cucumbers, radishes, feta, and carrots. So delicious. Tried bites of the grilled shrimp and cod. They obviously know seafood well. As for dessert. Well. I ended up liking the blueberry lemon cheesecake way more than the mango/coconut pudding, which could have been sweeter. And we walked away with these gooey white chocolate cookies on the house (as a theater treat, I think they intended them to be, but my dad and I scarfed down half the bag here). Wonderful meal here. I'd love to come back, maybe for just the bar food and the drinks. I will say, though, that the atmosphere and the proximity to Lincoln Square do reflect a more formal attire - just something to keep in mind.",7,3,8,Joy G.,"New York, NY",1203,824,173

The molten chocolate cake received high praise from my group, and had a great ice cream on the side.Food: The crab legs, according to my friend, were very good.The Bad: Service. Our waitress was not extremely personable and did not engage with the group at all. Food: I had the salmon dish. Half of the salmon was undercooked, whereas the other half was cooked to medium (???). On a whole, it lacked flavor and I stole a lemon from someone else to try to enhance the taste. Also, the dish comes with this frothy side thing? Not great, and -aesthetically- was not appetizing at all. Kind of resembled saliva, if that gives you an image. The potatoes were below average, but the spaghetti squash was flavorful. Wine: Expensive as hell and not worth the price.This restaurant is overpriced for the quality of the meal, imo. If each dish was 15$ cheaper and the wine $60 cheaper, it would have been fine.

Basically letting us know we wouldn't be late to our show.I started off with a glass of their Graystone Californian Chardonnay ($12), not to sweet and overall great taste. For the appetizer we both ended up going with the Local Red Beets & Artisanal Burrata ($16). An interesting combination of sweet and refreshing, definitely due to the roasted grapes and pistachio brittle.For the main entree I ended up going with the Roasted Sullivan Farm Chicken ($28). So good and so filling! It came on top of a bed of ricotta gnocchi, which added even more great taste. For the dessert we also shared a Chocolate Molten Cake ($11).

3.0,9/10/2017,"Had dinner at Atlantic Grill West Side last night with my friend. It was very enjoyable. We had the following: 1) 4 Jumbo Shrimp $6.00 (each)2) Wicked Shrimp Roll $15.00 spicy shrimp / hamachi*/ romaine / mango / basil / horseradish sauce3) Lobster Royal Roll salmon*/ avocado / jalapeño / shiso $18.004) Golden Roll  crab / spicy tuna* / pickled burdock / crispy rice / avocado / mango yuzu $17.005) Steamed Shrimp Dumplings sake-plum sauce $16.00 6) Shrimp & Lobster Spring Rolls spicy coconut sauce $16.007) Roasted Sullivan Farm Chicken ricotta gnocchi / maitake mushrooms / rosemary cream $28.008) Prime Creekstone Farm Rib-Eye* brûléed shallots / schmitt's horseradish butter $45.009) 2 Pieces of Toro Sushi *MP $14 eachAll in all pretty good. The sushi I wouldn't get next time - It was good but nothing special (like Morimoto, Sushi of Gari, etc)The steak was good - I ordered it Rare and it was cool in the middle which means it wasn't thrown on the grill at room temp (which I prefer and I think is the proper way). My friend's chicken was perfect. The Toro was GREAT. The Dumplings and the Spring Rolls were good but again - neither stood out from other spots I've had them. (And at these prices, they should). The jumbo shrimp were great. They obviously have a great fish supplier on that front. Would I return? Sure.

This was probably the best meal I had in NYC on this trip and the service was really good -- servers and manager were very attentive without being interruptive. I was very pleased with every part of my meal ($29 Restaurant Week prix fixe lunch menu):* Roasted fig arugula salad - just enough dressing but not too much, I liked the addition of manchego cheese and pistachio texture.* Faroe Island Salmon with caramelized kimchi on top of creamed corn -- not for the lactose-intolerant...unless you take a lactaid like I did, and the KIMCHI was my favorite part of it (one of the chefs is named Boo Lim...I'm guessing he inspired that!* Triple Chocolate Cheesecake -- was very was obsessed with this. I like that the cheesecake was rich and creamy (so if that's not your thing, probably choose something else) on top of a cookie-crumble like brownie thing on the bottom (such a nice surprise).

1.0,8/13/2017,"Seriously could they get worse?! So I planned to never go here again for obvious reasons and then after this previous review the restaurant owner group (brguesthospitality.com) or the Laundry Club reached out and asked me to take a survey to explain my troubles. I did so not to complain just to let upper management know. They kindly sent me a $50 gift card to try the place again and enjoy my time. I took that as a kind gesture and kind of saved it for a special occasion and then went. So get this. Once I checked out with the gift card (and generously tipped cash) they stopped me at the door embarrassingly and said their machine wouldn't accept my gift card. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? After all the crap now this. They DEMANDED, very politely that I pay them. I didn't have my basic cards on me so had to charge it to a credit card, which I am trying to not do. Such a waste and they were again rude. I told the manager I was given the gift card because of previous poor experiences at this establishment. The LEAST they could have done is comped  .. umm.. anything?It was embarrassing and rude. They can't even get it right when their management company steps in and tries to resolve their rudeness issues. Unbelievable.

The restaurant was bustling and the waitstaff seemed a little bit hectic, they might need to add a person or two to the front of the house. Our waiter was attentive and polite and made sure all of our questions were answered in a timely fashion. The restaurant week menu presents a great value. The shrimp sushi appetizer was amazing, unique yet not odd ball like some other specialty rolls you see from time to time. The Halal Creekstone farms steak and fries was great as well. I despise steak with distinct marinades, but their light au poivre gravy was great. The salmon was cooked and seasoned perfectly, but the accompanying corn was a little too buttery. The shrimp and pea risotto was also great but bordered on being too salty, which made it a little tedious after a few bites. Both of the desserts were great. The ice cream is very very creamy and delicious. I loved the fruity upside down cake, but my family really enjoyed chocolate cheesecake. As far as the gazpacho and the fig salad, I would say one should only order them if they have a soft spot for those dishes in general  because they were just okay.

3.0,6/18/2017,"3.5/4 stars for the food, 2 stars for the service. We ordered the seafood tower for 1/2 people, presentation was nice, the seafood was good but not great. I've had much better elsewhere. The king crab was watery and didn't have much flavor. The lobster itself had no meet and the lobster tail was very small. Oysters were okay but also not much flavor. Food aside, each individual staff member that we met had a major attitude problem! Took us forever to get water, and even longer to put in our entree order. It was actually so bad, I've never had to wait so long just to order. It took us eating the entire seafood tower (appetizer) and still waiting before we had to ask a server to take our order. That's not service if we have to beg you to order. If we weren't starving and had half a drink left, we would have gotten our entrees elsewhere.Now the drinks- we were ID'ed twice!?... Once is okay, it's normal and encouraged, we get it. But twice? I'm 28 and my boyfriend is 26, maybe we look young, even though I know I was older than the server and bartender... We didn't mind being ID'ed, I've worked in the industry before and it's not worth the risk...that said, the bartender came to the table the 2nd time to double check our IDs and actually couldn't of been ruder about it. Hovering over us as we just consumed large bites of bread in our mouths! He had major attitude about it and started feeding us a load of sh*t how they always check everyone twice... haha- BS! Can you imagine they check everyone's IDs twice? Yeah right! LOL! Idiots, honestly, to even think we believed that. Wasn't even worth my breath to argue it. I don't mind that they felt they needed to double check, but had they handled this completely differently,  our overall dining experience would have been much different, maybe even enjoyable. We never got checked in to see if we wanted more drinks, more food, dessert or anything! Clearly we were not worth their time.

5.0,5/27/2017,"Atlantic Grill provided us with an outstanding dining experience, under circumstances that might have looked set up to challenge them (they weren't, I swear). On a busy holiday weekend, the man taking our reservations was charming, and understanding of our need to accommodate some of the party arriving after work, but all needing to be in our seats in time for the opera.When we arrived, all at different times (and one never got to dinner or the curtain--thanks, NJTransit) everyone on the staff treated us with solicitous care. One person taking individual drink orders as soon as we arrived, another directing me to the closest vacant restroom, and another filling each water glass as another diner arrived, and providing fresh bread. The waiter did not have to be informed of our time limitations, and gave excellent suggestions to optimize our experience. Two of us split the beet salad, which we declared the best ever, and next time we will each get our own. We were halfway into the first course of disarmingly fresh and inventive sushi and sashimi when the third guest arrived, and the salad he ordered arrived in a flash. When his salmon arrived soon after, we others were so envious, that we asked if we could add another, and it arrived in the blink of an eye. Our check appeared at the moment we needed it.We will be back to enjoy more of their offerings at a more leisurely pace. There were tempting meat and pasta offerings and a pre-theater pre-fixe at $49 that seems a good value.

The decadent part was that they had the bread in the mussel broth so you could dig into that for some decadent carbs.

2.0,3/18/2017,"This place represents all that's wrong with the New York restaurant scene. The food is utterly mediocre; the french fries alone were a disgrace, sprinkled with vile-smelling artificial truffle oil and clearly NOT made from fresh potatoes. The fries are better at my local pub in Windsor Terrace, and for less than half the price. But the worst thing about this restaurant was the service. The waiter was rude and patronizing.  After I asked quietly what the soup of the day was, another person at the table who is slightly hard of hearing asked him the same question. The waiter's response: ""I already SAID tomato!"" On several occasions he stopped by to refill the water glasses but consistently neglected to refill the glass of the person sitting slightly out of his reach, even when she extended her empty glass. When I tried to flag him down, he ignored me. I noticed the same rudeness from the other wait staff, with one saying in an exasperated tone, ""EXCUSE me, Ma'am!"" while I was standing up to put on my coat. This server was not carrying anything at the time and there was plenty of room for her to just walk around me.To add insult to injury, when the bill arrived we discovered it had been padded with the cost of drinks we had not ordered. If you are desperate for a meal that won't poison you before or after seeing a performance at Lincoln Center, this place will do. The lighting is flattering, so there's that..!

It's also quite close to Lincoln Center so a good choice if you're seeing a show there.We had an early reservation so we could make the show so it was pretty empty when we arrived and pretty crowded when we left. It didn't appear that big inside until I discovered there's another whole section of the restaurant in the back. So the place is huge.It's classy but not over the top. You could probably get away with wearing a nice pair of jeans but I would probably want to look a little nicer.Wine list is pretty expansive with some decent options all over the place price-wise.The menu is heavy on fish and sushi but also has some meat items.It also has a general Asian feel but it's not overwhelmingly so.I'm told the kale and Brussels sprouts salad is very good but I had the edamame and they were messy but good.Checking out the menu online ahead of time I had my heart set on the branzino so that's what I got. It did not disappoint and I would definitely recommend it. The filet got rave reviews as well.Desserts were all deemed to be delicious.The service was outstanding. Clearly they are used to dealing with customers who need to be at a show at a specific time, so they ask you upon arrival and make sure you leave on time. It seems like there's a hundred people working there so there's not a problem if you need something. The price is expensive. Expect $100/person with tip even if you don't drink much.

Finally decided to try it and was very impressed! Great service, food, and spaciousness. Some creative menu options alongside more standard comfort fare.

4.0,11/25/2016,We had our thanksgiving dinner here yesterday and as usual it was very good. There was more than enough food. We go here all the time and the food and staff are always great. They are a little nutty with there reservations. I went there personally in the beginning of November to make my reservation for Thanksgiving day. When I made my reservation I asked if they needed a credit card to hold it and I was told no. Two weeks before Thanksgiving someone calls me demanding a credit card number telling me that he has over 500 reservations and he doesn't have time to wait for me to get it I was a little setback. So if you were going to make a reservation make sure you give them the credit card ahead of time so there's no confusion when you go there. Other than that it's clean and has a great atmosphere.

Also, there was absolutely no flavor. However, there were some good plates. The poke was delicious but tiny. The oysters were good but definitely not worth the price.

4.0,7/7/2016,"Looking for a convenient place to eat on the Upper West Side not too far from Columbus Circle but not too swanky, I settled upon Atlantic Grill. Just off of Broadway and across from Lincoln Center, it's very convenient to get to. Despite being a bit late on the reservation and waiting for others, the host was polite and patient, and getting seated was no big issue. Our food and drinks were brought out quite quickly by our server, and the overall ambiance mixes the upscale with a more casual feeling. On the side of the drinks, the beer menu is a relatively unimaginative selection of craft brews, but the cocktail I had was better.The food here, though, it done quite well. I started with the soup of the day, which was a chilled potato and leek soup, served with small slices of avocado served atop a crisped piece of bread. I've never had this soup served cold before, but it was nice and hearty without being overly creamy, and the avocado added a nice dash of smooth creaminess that helps accentuate that aspect of the dish. For the entree, there are plenty of seafood options, but I ended up going with the Chilean sea bass on the recommendation of the waiter. I wasn't disappointed, even though the preparation was a bit different from other spots. It was still just as succulent and juicy, but instead of the fish being poached or buttered up to accentuate that, it was served with a miso glaze that had a bit more of a kick to it (probably due to the liberal use of ginger). Served with veggies and some strands of vermicelli, this was quite pleasing, and I really enjoyed the twist on the preparation.We didn't end up doing dessert, but I would like to come back and try some of the other dishes sometime. Everything else was done quite well, and it's a relatively laid-back spot to get a nice dinner, even if it is a tad on the pricier side.

4.0,6/18/2016,"Good food, good service and good location near Lincoln center. Some of the items on the menu are slanted towards the Asian fusion style while others seem more Italian oriented (pasta etc) or just general seafood (such as oysters). We ordered oysters, the lobster and shrimp spring rolls, cod, shrimp dumplings and a sushi roll. They were all quite good with interesting sauces. Lobster spring roll is quite a rarity btw and it was so flavorful! Note that this stuff is good from an ""Asian fusion"" point of view but that does mean that some sauces are sweet-ish. This is a general issue worth a commentary: The American desire to make things sweet has been playing havoc with ethnic cuisines in the city. So many dishes and their consumers are suffering because of this - pad thai, chicken tikka masala, the abominable sweet and sour chicken. But what can you do? It's a losing battle. In the context of this 30,000 feet view of the food situation in the city, Atlantic is very good. The place is huge and has good ambience. Something that stood out for me was the service. We told the staff that we need to get to Lincoln in time for a show and they really hurried things along and made it work for us. They also held our reservation for 25 min even though we were late.

The environment tends toward classic rather than trendy which had us excited for some solid seafood.Unfortunately, our server was sweet but seemed confused the entire time. I did my research beforehand and was excited that other gluten free yelpers had a positive experience here, unfortunately mine was just ok. When I asked about gluten free options she just recommended the plain grilled fish and maybe the sushi instead of maybe walking through potential modifications.I eventually landed on a salad (had to ask again if it was gluten free because she didn't mention any starters being GF) and some sushi. The sushi was delicious - I got a lobster chile roll and shared some spicy tuna with my sister-in-law. They did have gluten-free soy sauce that the server said she would bring with my sushi, after at least 30 minutes we finally had to ask someone else to bring it out.Ultimately for ~$100 per person with just some shared small plates and wine - I don't think I'd come back to the Atlantic Grill",0,0,0,Deanna A.,"Buffalo, NY",543,119,59

3.0,5/4/2016,"We went here on a Sunday early afternoon before seeing The King and I at Lincoln Center. Since it was still brunch, it was nice to benefit from the drinks included. We shared the salmon lobster roll, which was good but nothing out of the ordinary. I had the salmon burger and my husband the hamburger. Again, the burger was fresh, but somehow lacked flavor despite the spicy aoli sauce. My husband barely touched his burger, not due to taste , but he felt full. It was a bit rare though even for his taste. The breadbasket on the table was very good so unfortunately we filled up on that before our meal came. I wanted to try the rice pudding since I read a good review about it. It was horrible! Yes it tasted coconut, but it was just too thick and not creamy and a waste of $11.00!

The roasted pear salad was delicious as was the steamed shrimp dumpling in sake-plum sauce. I opted for the sushi of the day for the main and I was not disappointed. We sampled all the desserts. If you are a fan of rice pudding, their coconut one was out of this world, not too sweet. The chocolate molten cake was heavenly, and my daughter chose three different sorbets.  The server was helpful with suggestions and very sweet. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the fish was so fresh.

From service to food selection this place can satisfy all.First off it's huge. Great for a group of friends or a date night. The ambiance is classy mellow. You won't hear music or have to shout to talk. It's great if you are catching up with friends and want to talk. Secondly, the menu has an array of food choices. You can find anything to eat on this menu. There's sushi, fish, steak, salads, and some Asian appetizers. Our table ordered a lot of the starters instead of entrees which were great to share. We got the crab cake sliders comes with two, but you can ask for more. Definitely the best app. Lobster shrimp spring rolls, potato croquettes, truffle fries, and shrimp dumplings. We also ordered a parpedelle  pasta for the table to share. Next time I recommend everyone getting an actual entree because they all looked delicious. Ask for the market price soup of the day. All in all we stayed for about two hours catching up and enjoying a nice meal.

The menu does feature seasonal dishes in addition to sushi, so the choices are always excellent. My latest favorite is the homemade pasta with lamb. This dish is perfect, the flavors are simply, well, perfect! Never said that about a dish before! In fact, the attention to detail in the kitchen is evident in every dish. The latest scallop dish is both original in flavor, of course cooked just right, and delicious to my wife who is a scallop fanatic. The bar also deserves kudos for making my southern comfort old fashioned just right, even properly muddling the fruit. Its these little touches that count. Great wine pours and in addition terrific selections. Sounds like I own the place, I know, but not so, truly just a customer who eats out a lot and appreciates a place that pays attention to every little detail. Even the deserts are fascinating, with different flavored home made sherbets and ice cream. To be honest I don't care for kiwi sherbet or pumpkin ice cream but I know they will try different flavors soon, they always do. Bring back that salted caramel ice cream! My favorite server moved on to a new career, and they recently hired a new manager after wisely promoting the previous one so my advice to you new people - don't screw things up!

The food was decent, but the portions were tiny for its size, and you're left looking for second dinner shortly after. If I'm going to drop $33-44 on an entree, I want to be full for a couple hours at least!They have a $48 three-course pre-theater prix fixe, but the entrees weren't the most exciting (chicken, salmon, and jumbo shrimp) so we decided to order a la carte. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly albeit it was a tiny piece. It was served with a small side salad with radishes. The swordfish may have been a touch overcooked, but the kimchee broth needed more salt (and the ""korean gnocchi"" is just rice cakes/dduk).The papperdelle with lamb and pecorino seemed okay (I didn't try this one), though some parts were uncooked. And the red snapper special with the potato puree was delicious but was nowhere filling for any human over 75lb. Even with  sides of fries and broccolini, it wasn't enough.Since we were still hungry, we then ordered pumpkin ice cream, chocolate molten cake, and the banana pudding for dessert. The former two were delicious, but the banana pudding was incredibly underwhelming. You're better off skipping their banana pudding and going to Magnolia Bakery a few blocks away, for half the price too.Our server Robert was attentive and patient, continually checking on us throughout the meal and making sure our waters were always full. But a few hiccups include the cramped space - servers kept bumping into us during the meal - and the bread basket (as cold as the 30 degree weather outside) came mad late, nearly 20 minutes after we ordered, and just 5 minutes before our entrees came out.Sadly, I doubt I will be returning, but I hope they consider decreasing the price or increasing the portion (unlikely, but worth a shot).Notes:- Bathrooms are downstairs (I wonder if this is handicap accessible though?)- Private dining room in the back, good for large groups- They have a bar area in front!- Most of their menu is listed on their website.- They also have an east side location on 77th and 3rd.",5,1,3,Jess C.,"New York, NY",591,305,582

I chatted with the waitress and the host who all wished me felicitations and brought me desert with a candle. When the check came they had insisted on charging me only for my entree in spite of my having had oysters, a salad entree and desert. I was so touched by this gesture. It was such unexpected kindness. Please patronize the establishment of you are attending the opera. The food was delectable!I highly recommend the ""east west"" oysters and the ""Heirloom Beet salad"".  I immensely enjoyed the ""Diver Scallops"" as well.",1,0,1,Susan T.,"UPPR Saint CLAIR, PA",43,5,2

They were taken away and we hoped that they weren't just left to sit in the kitchen until we were ready for them. This is exactly what happened. Two fish main courses, dry and room-temperature.

1.0,8/28/2015,"I think it was when the waitress ""accidentally"" bumped our table with chairs she was carrying through the dining room that my skin started to crawl and I began to have the cold sweats.  The wine was bitter, the appetizer smelled like fish the scallops had so much sand in them i think they may have been served in a beach towel fresh from Cape Cod.  The waiter was non-existent except when he was pushing a further course or additional glass of the tanic acid they tried to pass off as wine. The carpet had a peculiar odor and there was so much salt in the entrées that I think I may have mummified my tongue. As for the prices, they were so out of proportion to the meal that it was laughable. It's like there were all these extra zeros everywhere on the menu and they didn't know where they belonged.  I felt like I had been transported to some roadhouse on the way from Fargo to Bismark. It's clear the joint survives on the naïveté and impulsiveness of he local tourist population who are here and gone so quickly they may not remember if the meal was served in Lincoln Square or on their fold down tray on the way back to where they came from.  I recommend steering clear of this place and let it die a slow miserable death like so many other doomed New York City dining establishments.",8,12,2,Anthony H.,"Marina/Cow Hollow, San Francisco, CA",62,30,6

Appetizers were great!My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed the Filet Mignon, Diver Scallops and Squid with Linguine entrées.The only issue was the check.

It was four scallops and quite tasty.  The person I was with ordered the prawn.  By prawn I literally mean one prawn for about $32.  Um, where was the rest?  We shared truffle fries.  They tasted like frozen french fries with minimal truffle.  With that, we skipped dessert.  We wouldn't return nor would we recommend it to others.  Unless they are skinny models with rich husbands.

Looking back now, I really should have had sent the piece of meat back in the kitchen because it was unacceptable to serve such a thing. Also, it was the size of charcoal. Without kidding, I asked the waitress where the steak was because of the chimichurri sauce on top I thought the steak was broccoli. The frites were great and crispy, but was what the thing with all the fired onions?! Ridiculous. More like a side a charcoal with my fried onion bits. This dish was quite terrible and again, I regret not sending it back to the kitchen, not acceptable. Such a distinguished place should know how to cook a steak well done and have the decency to not serve charcoaled flesh. - chocolate was okay, nothing to die for. - lemon cake was pound cake with a layer of lemon. This restaurant week deal doesn't not live up to the reputation the restaurant had carved for itself.",1,1,0,Juliane L.,"New York, NY",386,643,1412
4.0,2/24/2015,"*Went here for Restaurant week 2015We were seated immediately at our reservation time, although it took a little longer than expected to order our food once we got the menus, which i noticed a few other people had the same issue. Once we did get our order in, we were well on our way. We each had the Florida Snapper Cerviche for an appetizer.  It was very flavorful and the fish was fresh.  Definitely opened up our appetite.We ordered a few pieces of additional sushi a la carte, the Salmon and the Hamachi.  They were both fresh as well.As entrees we ordered the Pan Roasted Salmon and the Maki sushi tasting.  There was a slight communication issue in terms of how many pieces there were in the Maki tasting.  We ordered the extra pieces because when i asked our waiter how many pieces it included he said 6.  In reality, they give you a Crab Maki roll and a Spicy Salmon  roll that each are 6 pieces along with 2 pieces of Eel sushi. Both items were very good, and very filling.  We barely had any room for dessert but we made room and had one of each of their choices, their Caramel Chocolate Torte and the Lemon Tart.  The Tart was savory as expected while the Torte was good but a tad too sweet for us.The staff was very friendly, and overall it was a very good dining experience.  We plan to come here again outside of restaurant week!",0,0,0,Dave C.,"REGO PARK, NY",127,20,1

This was a big deal for me as I had another reservation earlier that day and still had to wait 30 minutes for my table there. The food was great too. We ordered the Vietnamese grilled shrimp which had a great flavor and was a perfect sized appetizer. We ordered the Shaved Vegetable Salad which was good too, very fresh but nothing spectacular. Lastly we ordered a special they had that day which was a dish with Cod and bread pudding. That dish I'd also say was pretty good too, not phenomenal but still good. The decor of the place was really nice too. It had a classy appeal but didn't make you feel like you had to dress up to be there which I loved. So it's very good for a date or a birthday or something. Lastly the wait staff were very kind and helpful from the second we walked in to the moment we left. The only thing is that sometimes it's hard to grab someone's attention because they're always moving so fast. Oh lastly lastly, unless you're wearing a really thick coat I wouldn't give your coat to the coat check especially if you're trying to catch a show at Lincoln Center or something.

My friend and I dined here pre-ballet.  The service was friendly and efficient. The California roll with shrimp, crab and eel was spectacular. Branzino a la Plancha was cooked perfectly, though the vegetables served underneath the fish were a bit too al dente. The side of spinach was just ok...very small portion and not enough garlic and salt. They put a few anemic looking onions in it which were unnecessary.  (Okay, I realize onions are pale and white but they were not seasoned enough.) the coffee was superb.

Upon first look at the RW menu I was impressed with the amount of selections and what they were. Well, when we got there the menu was smaller and had nothing I cared for on it. There was mention of a cod dish online and that's what I had my heart set on. On the regular menu was a different cod dish so I decided on that.It said it was a miso cod with bok choy, long beans and black rice, I still don't know what long beans are because all I saw was mushrooms. The dish was served in a bowl, rice and shrooms drowning in an overpowering ginger sauce topped with a small to medium piece of cod - which was cooked just right- but then they topped it with what tasted like buffalo sauce. I'm still confused about that. Needless to say I wasn't impressed.The other dish ordered was the sea scallops with summer corn, tomatoes in a lemony sauce. Again, I found the sauce overpowering. Scallops have such a magnificent flavor to them that I don't feel they need that much seasoning.

To supplement, we had a roasted beet salad and some potato croquettes. Everything was beautifully plated and the seafood was excellent and fresh. The beet salad was garnished with little delicately fried balls of goat cheese and everything was resting on a bed of arugula.

3.0,6/25/2014,"This is a classy restaurant which can be good for groups. It's huge and stretches from 64th to 65th street. The cuisine here is centered around seafood. They have sashimi and sushi as well as traditional american grilled fish. I'd classify the food as a fusion of Asian and American.The service can be hit or miss here. When they're busy, the service suffers, but if you come on a quiet night like Sunday, the service is excellent. I think the waiters try their best given the human resource constraints.The food is great here, but the portions are a bit on the small side and I would advise ordering a side or two if you get the grilled fish. I haven't had a bad piece of fish here though and their food is definitely worthy of four stars. So why three stars? Mainly due to the prices. I guess since the restaurant is located in the swanky Lincoln Center/Columbus Circle area whose proximity to Central Park jacks up the lease. But as a consumer in NYC with plenty of options which a merely a taxi or subway ride away, value has to be taken into consideration. I think this place is great, but it is a bit pricey. I live in the neighborhood so convenience often wins out, but if you live further downtown, I wouldn't recommend making the trip up here just for Atlantic Grill",0,0,0,Kevin C.,"New York, NY",288,574,317

I can't judge for other dishes but a lot of my friends ordered the lobster, tiny portion though. My salad was beautifully presented and it tasted great as well. However, my chicken was grilled to death I felt like I was chewing cardboard. A friend of mine ordered a steak medium rare, also took a long while to bring out.

The former were very good although probably not something that will stand in my memory for a long period of time, however the scallops were fantastic.

4.0,4/26/2014,"Located right next to Linkin' Center, our party of four showed up for dinner at five. We were this early because of a Gershwin concert at Avery Fisher at 7:15 and we wanted to leave ourselves plenty of time to complain about the food and send everything back three or four times and still not miss the show. So, the time had nothing to do with the Early Bird Special (this isn't Boca, after all). Boy, were we disappointed. Nothing to complain about!Upon entering, the long bar is on the right. My first test of a bar is how well they can make a Negoni. Shouldn't be difficult, but you'd be surprised. (As a Negroni aside, see my review of Lincoln). This one was done pretty well, albeit with a slice of orange rather than the peel of a rind, but, hey, it's booze, so who cares.We were seated at an ample booth in the back room, right under the structural steel which is the main decoration. When I saw it, I knew I'd been here before when the restaurant was under a different name. Monk's Inn, possibly? Had the lobster bisque, which was not great, but passable, and the cod with some kind of black stuff. A little spicy, but still very good.Good service, good bar, good rating.For sure this was the best meal of the day!

The ambiance was more like an all-American pub than an upscale restaurant. I gave only 3 stars for the food. I tried nearly everyone's appetizer and entree (which is the best part of showing up with a large group). I found most of them were good but uninteresting. I ordered the sautéed lobster with veggies. It came floating in a large bowl of butter. I would have expected something more creative than melted butter as the main flavor in my meal. Overall the food was lacking in flavor.

Luckily I stumbled onto Atlantic Bar & Grill, which fit all my requirements.We arrived early so we checked our coats (including two bouquets of flowers) and was seated in the booth table that I requested upon making our reservation.First up was the Balcony Tower ($48) for two people. The tower included Maine Lobster, Red King Crab, Jumbo Shrimp, Littleneck Clams, Ceviche, Marinated Prince Edward Mussels, and both East & West Coast Oysters. My favorite parts were the oysters, since they're my favorite shellfish. Both East & West Coast oysters were very fresh and delicious. I also quite liked the Jumbo Shrimp, which were very sweet, and the Maine Lobster. Every piece of shellfish was expertly opened and deconstructed for easy-eating. I just wish there was more!I also had the Fiery Maine Lobster & Salmon roll with honey calamansi sauce. The lobster was very sweet while the salmon was salty. Together with the spicy sauce, it was perfect.We finished off the night with a Warm Apple Crumble ($9.00), which was on the special menu. It comes with a scoop of Salted Caramel Ice Cream, which really helped balance out the sweetness of the apple crumble. They even put a cherry heart-shaped truffle for the special occasion!Service was very attentive without being intrusive the entire night. We never felt rushed or pushed to order.

The light (very mildly spicy) red sauce drizzled on the bottom of the plate did add a cool flavor to it. Still, not worth it.Entree - we ordered the Grilled Catch of the Day and the Artic Char. The Artic Char was clearly the winner of the table. Plump, seared on one side to oily crispness, and cooked to medium-rare. Definitely worth it (if you get the Artic Char, that is).Dessert - Mocha Panna Cotta (gluten-free) was SO WORTH IT. I never thought some cream, milk, sugar, and jello could come together in such beautiful shape and flavor. This panna cotta with raspberry sauce and white yogurt pretzels was unforgettable.  Overall: Go for it! Even though it was a busy night at the restaurant, we were attended to promptly, and our dishes came out surprisingly fast after we ordered.

I ordered the grilled trout and they provided a lemon with it (finally). The halibut special was very delicious. I do not remember what sauce they used but I wish I did. The complimentary soup in a shot glass is no longer a blood pressure spiker as they eased up on the salt. The service on the other hand has not improved. They no longer make you wait 10 minutes after clearing your table to give the dessert menu. They traded that improvement for other issues. The complimentary shot glass soup was ice cold. The woman carrying it should check before handing it to people and should feel it is cold when she does. The appetizer and entree timing were way off. Once, our appetizer just arrived and 30 seconds later the entrees arrived. The man with the entrees just stood there for 2 minutes staring at us then announced himself with an ""eeeeehhhhhh."" I had no idea how to reply to an ""eeeeeehhhhhh"" but I saw he was holding 2 dishes that were the same and since we both ordered the halibut we figured he was for us. We had to ask the manager to confirm. He then came over with 2 empty plates and tried to find room in our very crowded table for them but he gave up and left with the plates. I had no idea what he was trying to do. Our server came by with coffee and then had to ask us if we ordered coffee, but we did not. Good to see he could keep track of what went where. On our second visit, the server was not listening to our order. She interrupted us a couple of times. I tried to order the special of artic char but was told it was no longer in stock. There was no communication to tell the servers when it ran out. I got my hopes up since I liked artic char and had to find something else. Overall, the service is not bad but you can see there was poor communication between the staff and some staff members were not working. I have no idea where to categorize the ""eeeeehhhhh.""",0,0,0,Rod B.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",12,229,0

Service is good considering the number of people and the time crunch of people going to the ballet & opera (with starting times about 7-830Pm).This is a reasonably priced restaurant with some ambiance.

4.0,12/8/2013,"I had been wanting to check this place out for awhile. They have a location on the UES and one near the Lincoln Center. We were able to get last minute reservations for the one near the Lincoln Center at 9 pm for a Saturday night. Normally we have to wait an additional 30 minutes when we go to restaurants even though we have reservations, but here, we were seated within 5 minutes of arriving. We were taken to the back of the restaurant to the main dining room, which was less noisy than the front of the restaurant. I was able to talk with my wife without having to yell over other diners. Now to the food:The tuna tartar came in a jar with wonton crisps. Very unique and very good. The warm brussels sprout ceasar salad is a MUST! Super delicious and bursting with flavors. Do not leave without ordering it. The salmon entree was okay, could have been better if it was cooked medium rare, like I had asked, and not medium well. The sauteed lobster over short rib ravioli was good. While we were having our entrees, a waitress was walking around to each table and giving out shot glass samples of the restaurant's butternut squash soup. It was fantastic. Sweet but not overwhleming. Just strange that they wouldn't bring it out in earlier during appetizers or before the entrees came out. Nevertheless, happy to have had it! For dessert, we ordered a slice of the salted caramel cake. Glad I tried this place out.",0,0,0,Sam V.,"New York, NY",3,100,0

The food was incredible (we shared a spicy tuna roll for an appetizer, I had the branzino and my partner had the arctic char) - everything was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The 3-star review is really about the service, which was not up to the standards you would associate with such a high-end restaurant. Maybe the problem is that we were seated in a smaller room downstairs, where there are eight tables but (apparently) one waiter. The waiting time for orders was way too long and finally the house manager had to step in to help out. Good for him for seeing the problem eventually, but again, that sort of thing is not what you expect when you drop $200 for dinner.

1.0,9/13/2013,"I've worked in many restaurants, so I know that mishaps are inevitable.  But it is how an establishment recovers from a mistake that makes the experience.  Unfortunately, Atlantic Grill failed miserably with their customer service on the night my friends and I dined there.  We ordered food, wine and champagne. After delivering the water and champagne, we didn't see the waiter for another 15 or 20 minutes.  We had to ask a bus boy to get him to order more wine.  Of 6 entrees, 1 was way overcooked and 2 were cold.  The waiter made the woman with the overcooked steak cut through the middle because it seemed he didn't believe her.  When the waiter brought back the corrected food, he said unconvincingly, ""All I can do is apologize"".  Really?  That's all?  A man in a suit, who may have been the manager but didn't identify himself as such, served the wine and then asked if everything was okay.  We kind of all looked at each other and said, "" I guess"", and he quickly shuffled off.  Since most of us got the Prix Fixe, the desserts were included, I ordered my own dessert.  But when the desserts came, they gave us 3 or 4 extra desserts ""on the house"".  I'm not sure if this was supposed to appease us for the massive mess up with the food.  But why would we want tons of extra dessert when it already came with our meal.  Needless to say, none of the food that was ill-prepared was taken off the bill so we questioned the waiter.  He acted rude and then said we just wanted free stuff.  When the person paying tried to explain why she was upset, he became combative and said something like, ""well just forget it then, forget the gratuity!"".  It was just bizarre behavior. On the way out, we stopped the manager and told him of our horrible experience.  He just apologized and said that the server shouldn't have acted that way and thanks for the feedback.  He told us to come back another time and they'd be sure to treat us right.  I wish they would've just treated us right in the first place.  For the amount of money we spent, the experience absolutely did not measure up.  The food is okay, but don't expect to be treated well.  :(",0,0,0,Danielle B.,"Sammamish, WA",0,8,0

3.0,9/8/2013,"This is a very large restaurant very close to Lincoln Center. Our reservation, for 4, was for a Saturday evening at 7:30. We were told we would have a 'quiet' booth. We were led through the loud front room, through what looked like a staging area and passed the bathrooms into the back room. This large space is filled with booths that can easily accommodate six people. It was very comfortable for four people. However, we quickly found that the booth was too deep to allow the waiter to serve and pick up dishes easily. Being on the inside, I found myself passing plates back and fourth. A minor inconvenience, but one that should not occur. Although the music was quieter in the back, the other patrons more than man up for the noise level, making it difficult to hold a normal conversation. The service, although reasonable, was exceedingly slow. The food was adequate, but seemed more routine than 'fine dinning'. Kitchen shared salads were on the small side. Tap water, often refilled, was not chilled, having almost no ice. Main courses seemed to included vegetable and starch as an afterthought. As is normally the case, it seems that the more expensive the entree, the smaller the portion.

I decided to go with the most interesting sounding ones (Naked Cowboy and the Kusshi) - both were delicious!! I enjoyed the Kusshi a little bit more because it was sweeter and a bit more plump, even though it was smaller in size.Other food options, I had the White Shrimp as an appetizer and my friend tried the tuna roll. Both were ok. The shrimp was definitely over-done but the vegetable medley underneath made up for it. As for the entree, we both decided on the Crispy Skin Salmon and it was delicious!! The skin was perfectly crisp and the roasted vegetables in their balsamic sauce was just great. By the time dessert came around, we were both stuffed!! We opted for the upside down cake and the chocolate cheesecake. The cheesecake was not too dense and tasted more like a mousse (which I preferred) The upside down cake wasn't anything too memorable.

3.0,3/25/2013,"It's like a swanky Red Lobster: pretty decent food, but ultimately an uninspired experience.  The wine list was well-chosen but spare, but having bottles in stock appeared to be an issue- they didn't have the first one that I asked for, and only had one of what we ended up beginning our meal with.The fish was perfectly adequate, but unmemorable.  Nothing was crave-worthy.I had this vibe the whole time that the place was joylessly going through the motions of being an upscale, interesting restaurant, but knew that it wasn't them.  Atlantic Grill- I hope that you can resolve your identity crisis and find your soul, or at least settle into your niche as a destination for forgettable business dinners and wealthy cads with second-tier mistresses.",3,3,1,Chris L.,"New York, NY",32,123,1
3.0,3/24/2013,"Atmosphere and service go a long way in my opinion. Although I was not impressed with the food, the atmosphere will bring me back. There are plenty of menu options so I would recommend sticking with the simply grilled seafood selections, the raw items or the sushi. I was generally a fan of the appetizers ordered. The shrimp dumplings and the grilled octopus were very good. For the main entree, I would stay away from the hazelnut-crusted scallops and the lobster gnocchi. The scallops were an ingredient overkill and somewhat forgettable taste-wise; presentation was way overdone. The gnocchi had some pretty muddy flavors and an overall lack of texture; presentation was dull and honestly unappetizing.Also for what it's worth, I have an allergy to poultry. For this reason, I tend to gravitate to seafood. Every once in a while, I come across this issue: chicken stock is used in several of the sauces for seafood or even seemingly vegetarian dishes. Understandably, most people would never notice or probably even care, but I really think this is a pretty cheap shortcut to introducing flavor. Regarding the actual restaurant, the look and feel of the dining room is really nice. I love the decor, from the brick walls to the red booths, the lighting, the art...was just a really great look and feel. The service was excellent. The hostess walked us to our table, checked our coats for us and was very pleasant. We had two servers who both had a great attitude and were very helpful. As the other reviews mention, it seems a bit loud. There are two dining areas, so if you don't like noise, the area on the 65th Street side may be a little better since the ceiling is higher. Both sections could use some acoustic tile.I also wanted to mention the bathroom. Come on guys! This restaurant is by no means cheap. You could probably get someone in to clean the bathrooms. The dining area is beautiful, but one step in the bathroom and you might as well be at Starbucks.Again though, I would recommend Atlantic Grill and I will definitely return.",1,0,0,John K.,"New York, NY",72,43,16
2.0,3/18/2013,"This was our first, and likely last, visit to Atlantic Grill.  I made an Open Table reservation with my usual request for a ""grown up"" table for after the Met's Saturday matinee across the street.  We arrived a little early and were told that we could be seated immediately, but only the raw bar and sushi bar were available until our reservation time, when the kitchen opens.  No problem, except for the tables of small children issuing blood curdling shrieks from competing sides of the dining room.  Assured that they were in the process of leaving, and noting the freezing drizzle outside, we soldiered on.  Now would have been the perfect time for the gentlemen seating us to mention the existence of a second dining room behind us on the 65th Street side of the restaurant, a dining room free of feral tots, gamboling about like chimpanzees and howling like wolves.  If this virtual Eden was not available yet, we would have been happy to sit at the bar with some drinks and oysters until the kitchen opened.  Unfortunately, I didn't notice this dining room until we were halfway through our meal and any chance of salvaging this nightmare was long gone.Aside from this, the food here is quite good and the portions generous, so order accordingly.  Service is very warm and accommodating, ALL of the service; it's almost creepy!  Dining room on the 64th Street side is very, very loud, bright, and should be avoided at all costs, unless you are dining with or prefer to dine with unsupervised, hyper-stimulated toddlers.  The dining room on the 65th Street side is loud, but not AS loud, dim, and features large, cozy booths.  I really, really, wish I had known this from the start; I'm sure we'd be giving this restaurant another visit.",0,0,0,Bechi C.,"Howell, NJ",25,83,25

(I wonder if they were running out in the kitchen?) There was only two small shreds of lobster meat in it.  My boyfriend ordered the cod.  The fish was fresh and cooked appropriately, but the sauce it came in tasted like heavy cream, butter and salt with slices of fingerling potatoes mixed in, a pretty uninspiring and lackluster recipe.  The service was kind of all over the place.  Initially we were told by the hostess the kitchen would be open at 4:30pm and until then it would be the raw bar.  The waiter comes up and says the kitchen isn't open till 5:00pm.  Then has to go as the manager to find out the kitchen is open at 4:30.  I ordered a glass of Malbac and they bring out something that looks like a white zinfindel.  When I questioned it, the waitress initially said it was the malbec and then as she looked at my reaction she redacted her statement and said she would ask.  It wasn't the Malbac so she took it back.   We then had another waitress come up and ask us what we had wanted to drink after another one had just taken our order.  Dinner was served by an entirely different waiter.

4.0,9/14/2012,"My friend picked this place for summer restaurant week.; one of the few we were interested in this summer. Is it true that the restaurant week menu is ""weaker"" than the regular? Let's see. I don't think it's anything short in terms of choice.I liked that they served sushi and American. Three of us got the tuna roll as appetizer and the fourth got something else. All of us got the steak entree and none of us could finish it. That just seemed like the solid choice. I can't remember what we had for dessert.

5.0,8/24/2012,"Awesome in every way!We came for restaurant week in summer of 2012. It was a Friday at 6:15 and we were seated immediately. We were going to see a show, they asked us when we need to be out. We said our show was at 7:30, we were out by 7:26.As a young African-American, relatively hip couple, we were drastically different from the diners who were present at the time. It was cool though, because we didn't feel the slightest bit of judgment or pretentiousness. The Mrs enjoyed her sushi app. I had the peach salad. I didn't think mine was a good combination. It felt like salad, with three big random slices of peach thrown on top. I didn't get the sense that it was incorporated into the dish.For dinner, the Mrs had the organic chicken, which she liked, but felt the polenta was a little paltry compared to the amount of chicken. I had the grilled sirloin, which was muy delicioiso and muy juicy-oso as well. I got a lot out of it too, I got a second lunch out of it the next day.The desserts were the bomb as well. I might be biased, I'm a sucker for any strawberry shortcake, especially if said shortcake, has a lot of cream. The Mrs got the chocolate torte. I totally forgot how that tasted, I was too into my shortcake.I feel the biggest restaurant week-ness of many restaurants is that you feel they have the food pre-made in the back, and they are pumping out the dishes as fast as they can. I like the feeling that my meal was well thought out and prepared as if it were any of the night. At Atlantic Grill, I didn't get that rushed experience, even with the 1.5 hour time constraint.This place will go down as one of my favorite restaurant week locations",1,0,0,renje g.,"Brooklyn, NY",296,1087,5

For dessert, we had the strawberry shortcake, which was light but good, and the sorbet, which was average. I would come back for sure! It wasn't too noisy and the waitress was very nice.

Then as I walked into the restaurant, I was blown away.My godmother selected this place as part of NYC's Restaurant Week. Under normal conditions, I wouldn't consider dining here, because the prices are outrageous.  The Atlantic Grill is so large in capacity that it encompasses the entire block, very appropriate to accommodate theater-goers. We didn't know what to expect as we were escorted from one side into the next. We sat in a booth, anxious to try the food and welcome a new experience.Our server, Andy is an absolute sweetheart from Mississippi. I mean he and pretty much anyone who waited on us were very friendly and polite. They made sure we had everything we needed to guarantee a memorable and pleasant experience. We laughed as we dined amongst ourselves and with the staff. Customer service is definitely a priority in this restaurant, because one of the four would periodically check in with us to make sure we were okay.We kept our order to the menu designed for Restaurant Week. It was a little easier on our wallets. Now the meal that I  had was the watermelon gazpacho with a small salad, a sirloin steak, and strawberry shortcake. They even gave a free shot of their regular, spicy gazpacho to every diner.  The food was absolutely delicious. No complaints at all! If you're a big spender, then check it out.

As for entrees, I had  the organic chicken which had a great crust but the inner part could have been better cooked from my perspective.  The creamy white polenta was a great side but there was so little of it.   My husband's grilled sirloin steak was clearly the winner for the night.

The veggie chips that came with it tasted like they came out of a bag, but the char itself was so good.-Gazpacho (the daily soup): too much cantaloupe flavor; masked the other flavors.-Hazelnut crusted sea scallops: Really good. Comes with four scallops, which is more than I thought there would be. The flavors work really well.-Arctic char: Tastes like salmon. It was cooked really well, but perhaps not my favorite cooked fish.-Baked atlantic cod: Also quite yummy.

Needless to say my husband and I were upset by this but decided to show our ID's to set this waitress straight. My husband and I by no means appear younger than 21 years old and my husband has salt and pepper gray hair. The one thing we did have in common is that he was Latino and I am African American, the only such nationalities in the restaurant at the time. To add insult to injury, we were then approached by the manager of the restaurant as a follow up to the indignity of having to show identification. We ended up cancelling our drink orders to avoid further humiliation. Our waitress tried to placate us with free appetizers but having to endure this discrimination left a very bad taste in our mouths. We are incensed that such a thing still happens in NYC.

While Atlantic Grill is very expensive, the food is pretty awesome.  The fish is very fresh and the shellfish tower is spot on.  Oysters, clams, mussles, crab, lobsters,  shrimp and ceviche in a triple-tiered tower on ice with incredible dipping sauces. Yummm.  The chops are pretty decent too.  And the molton chocolate cake with coffee ice cream and carmalized bananas.... must be ordered.  The most annoying part about this restaurant is the prices.  Everything is $5 more than it should be.  Wine for $15/glass.  Entrees are $27-$33.  Appetizers are $12-$20.  The bill is always $150+ for 2 people.  We still go because there isn't really another solid fish spot like this near us.  The proximity to Lincoln Center is definitely the reason for the prices and I don't blame them.  It's just annoying for locals and leaves you with a slightly sour taste when you get the bill.  Overall a great spot, probably one of the better Lincoln Center restaurants when considering your alternatives-- all the Boulud stuff nearby which I find all to be sort of weird and European and overpriced, Fiorello which is good but not great and overpriced, and that sushi spot which frankly isn't that good.  Your next best bet is probably Rosa Mexicano if you can get a rez there before 9 PM.  P.J.

The decor was course brick work and rough wood which worked well in the low lighting, and created a relaxed and intimate atmosphere. Being a Saturday night, it was busy however the staff coped well and we were not left waiting for orders / courses. In addition, our waiter was friendly and able to recommend an excellent Argentinian red to pair with the steak. The only let down, and this is why 3 rather than 4 stars, was the food. Taking Ocean Grill as the bench mark, which I gave 4 stars, the food could have been better. Specifically the balcony seafood platter was a little on the slim side for the price, and my steak, cooked black and blue, was a little dry.Overall an enjoyable meal, but something in the food was lacking compared to its sister Ocean Grill.

4.0,1/20/2012,"We ate dinner at the Atlantic Grill before a show at Lincoln Center.  It was an easy walk, even for my 83 year old mom.  Service started out very good, and tailed off as the restaurant got busier.  My food was delicious (butternut squash and apple soup -- very rich; homemade casarecce with a delightful seafood sauce; double chocolate espresso bar).  My mom really liked her simply grilled shrimp and scallops.  My daughter thought her short ribs with papardelle were OK.   If we go back to Lincoln Center, we'd try it again!",1,0,0,Ellen L.,"Chadds Ford, PA",5,20,0
4.0,1/20/2012,"i eat a lot.  and my idea of a lot, is not a big salad or a half sandwich.  i'm talking about a steak and potatoes with a fist sized bread roll darnit.  with that being said, i approach restaurant week with something akin to disdain.  the prices aren't fantastically awesome for the amount/quality of food you get.  thankfully my cousin did her research about a restaurant week spot that didn't skimp.  after thinking it over, i decided to say yes.  don't get me wrong, i go to nice places too (i think i clean up well sometimes...hopefully), but i HATE leaving a restaurant hungry while $80+ bucks are down the drain.  service: i was dressed down for a place like this...well very dressed down in sneakers, leggings and casual dress and a snowboarding (i.e. loud design) jacket.  i wondered if they would make a stink about my clothes, but they didn't even blink and were absolutely sweet.  the waiter and servers was thoughtful and attentive to our water glasses and the fact that we were sharing dishes; so they made sure to grab us new sharing plates.food:  appetizers ordered: the somethingsomething roll (can you tell i didn't think much of it?) and the seafood salad.  the roll was like a california roll topped with sauce; definitely not memorable but not bad for a california roll.  the seafood salad was light and a nice way to start the meal. the seafood salad was not a rinky dink plate, but big enough to share between two light eaters.entrees: the squid ink pasta with seafood and the sirloin steak. the squid ink pasta was not bad, the pasta was cooked well but the flavors were pretty much just parm and butter to me.  towards the bottom of the bowl, the butter sauce was a bit too salty.  however, it was a solid big bowl of pasta.  The sirloin steak was fantastic.  we ordered it rare, because i love my steaks bloody.  it was tender and a big piece of steak considering it 's restaurant week.  it came with roasted  fingerling potatoes, radishes, carrots and beets; these were a very nice side to go with the steak.  i generally don't like sauce on my steaks because i feel like it's evil to do such a thing.  but i caved into tasting the sauce on the steak, and loved it. dessert:  we both ordered espresso bar dessert, and also decided to go off the menu and get the 20 layer cake as well.  the espresso bar dessert was rich, creamy and satisfying as a dessert.  it had a cake layer at the bottom, a mousse and topped with a layer of ganache. on the side was a scoop of ice cream.  the one downside of it was that it was so rich that it felt like it was sticking to the back of my throat (milk would have been awesome at this point).   the 20 layer cake was heavenly.  my cousin thought it to be too sweet, but i thought it was fantastic. this was also creamy and rich, but the flavors and textures were better in my opinion. this also came with a scoop of ice cream, which i believe was pistachio.  ideal restaurant week dinner picks: seafood salad, sirloin steak, espresso barhad a great time and loved it!",1,0,0,Doris C.,"New York, NY",149,263,1355
3.0,1/18/2012,"My friend and I sat next to Dmitri Hvorostovsky during lunch! That was the exclusive highlight of our experience this afternoon at Atlantic Grill. The orzo that came with my friend's salmon was overcooked and flavorless. The sauce that came with my squid ink pasta was excessively oily and flavorless. They took forever to bring us our drinks, but apologized and gave them to us on the house. They took forever to bring us our appetizers, and to bring us our entrees, and to clear away our plates, and to take our dessert orders, and to bring us our desserts, and to bring our check, and to take our check. Plus they forgot to include the gelato with my friends dessert. And they forgot to bring the sorbet with my dessert. But they gave us a bag of homemade chocolate chip cookies on our way out. Long story short, it's a mixed bag. The good: the seafood is really fresh, the service is friendly, and it's an attractive comfortable setting. The bad: it's a little bit disorganized.",4,0,1,David L.,"New York, NY",849,1168,1211

4.0,1/5/2012,"Went to an early dinner on New Years day, after a show at Lincoln Center. Went here on a recomendation from a friend who is a CIA graduate, and a very good chef. I always trust his judgement. Was very impressed with the location and decor. There is nothing like this outside of NYC and the owner had this place designed to really complimement the old style architechure. Although it is a huge restaurant, spanning a block, it is not intimidatingly large because there are many different sections. This lends itself to a feeling of intimacy.There is a sushi bar which I did not try, but probably will in the future. I am a liitle picky when it comes to my sushi having had the best Japan has to offer, all over the country of Japan. And after sampling their food for the first time I am convinced the sushi will be good.The lobster bisque was first rate, the lobster with gnocchi was good (not great) and the service was excellent. Based on just my meal I would have rated it 3.5 stars, but I rated it 4 stars based on my fellow diner's rants and raves about their meals.

1.0,10/2/2011,"Don't go to the West Side Atlantic Grill - stick to the UES one. HORRIBLE & amateur service. The food is wonderful as always but the service and management are dishonest & lazy. The wine hadn't yet been served as we were half way through our bisque & I finally flagged a busboy to get our waiter. They bring a different bottle of wine & don't even mention that they've switched it until I bring it up. He proceeds to tell me that the original order wasn't available - fine, but don't just bring a different one with no mention. Finally, our original waitress comes back yet is so lazy (wasn't a busy night) that we have to ask to have the wine refilled. The manager comes by & makes sure things are fine after the wine debacle & we fill her in on the details of the wine switcharoo, the slow service, but note that the food is amazing as expected. At the end of the meal, the waitress proceeds to bring us a bill with multiple charges from the bar that were not ours. As I discuss this with the manager, she says that it isn't considered being overbilled it is only considered a mistake and also does nothing to try to smooth over the situation (like perhaps a coffee or dessert). The management obviously is as amateur as the staff. I was excited to have an Atlantic Grill on the West side but will NEVER GO BACK AGAIN.

4.0,9/26/2011,"Came here for dinner on a Thursday night and there was a decent crowd, we were seated right away. My friend and I kept reviewing the drink list for over 10 minutes because there is a drink called ""Pineapple Express"" which sounded amazing but it was a very odd combination of beer and vodka which we didn't think would mix well, but we took the chance and ordered it and OMG it was great!!! The flavors were awesome, definitely a must try. If I get the chance to come back here again hands down this will be the drink i order. My friend and I order the shell fish tower as our meal which was great, if your in the mood for a light fare this is perfect. For dessert we were anticipating the red velvet cheescake and unfortunately was dissapointed. The cake was dry and there was more cake than cheesecake, I expected even layers at least. We mentioned to the waiter that we were not thrilled with it and he was really nice and gave us a bag of chocolate chip cookies.

The soft shell crab sandwish was also very good sans the special mayo. I'm not a chocolate eater, so I went with the soever trio: coconut, blood Orange and a flavor that escapes me at the moment. The blood Orange and mystery flavor were completely devoured. Not a fan of coconut too much, but the sorbet was good. It almost tasted a little bit like rice pudding.

The atmosphere was nice and the service was good, though the food was a bit unremarkable. I got the black truffle & melted leeks omelette with creme fraiche, along with home fries and toast. The omlette was OK, but there was no hint of truffle at all (actually I couldn't taste any leeks either). So, it was just a big eggy blob in desperate need of salt, pepper, hot sauce, etc.. The potatoes were pretty heavy and gross, obviously reheated all morning and coated in paprika to give it some color. On the positive side, they did make a nice Bloody Mary!In the end, I found Atlantic Grill to be a few ticks above a generic brunch place; it's a nice place to sit and have a meal, though you probably won't be doing backflips over the eats.",3,2,1,Jeff S.,"Bucks County, PA",592,1834,584

Then I moved on to grilled red snapper for my main.  Also good, though the portion was on the small side.As a gluten free patron, I didn't have tons of options, but more than I do in most places.  They were willing to leave out ingredients and alter dishes, which I always consider a good sign.  AND all of my plates came out with a bright red ALLERGY tag on them.  Quite the sight for sore eyes.  This is really a 3 1/2 star review.  Boosted a bit for accomodating gluten free pretty well.  But the fact is, this food is overpriced for the quality and the quantity served.  And my boyfriend literally got two shrimp and two scallops with his grilled entree, which is ridiculous for close to 30 bucks.",1,0,0,Layla C.,"Montclair, NJ",129,542,0

The design is more modern and feels very different from the UES location. The service is very attentive. We had beets with blue cheese, scallop carpaccio, and octopus to start. My beets were extremely sour from lemon or vinegar and I had to return it. For entree we had the cod, grilled scallops, and lobster risotto. The cod and scallops were fine but nothing at all memorable. I was expecting much more and a bit surprised by this. The risotto was tasty but was a bit too heavy. The dessert was the best part of the meal - Ice Cream Bon Bons were my favorite; Pumpkin Profiterole Coupe was good also. Overall I liked the food on the UES much better.
