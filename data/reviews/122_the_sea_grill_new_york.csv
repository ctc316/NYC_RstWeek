5.0,3/24/2019,"This was a definite 5 out of 5 stars experience. The ambience was perfect with the restaurant situated at on the skating level of Rockefeller Center. The service was impeccable. Unfortunately, we didn't catch our waiter's name but he was a trim gentleman, glasses, with dark hair parted to the side. He deserves recognition, he took such pride in his job which is so rare to find these days. The food was equally as wonderful as the ambience and service. My boyfriend had the crab cakes which I'm told we're incredible. I had the surf and turf which was a fun and delicious play on the typical steak and lobster. It was short ribs and scallops which were both cooked to a succulent perfection. We had a few appetizers and sides as well. Overall, a truly wonderful experience!",0,0,0,Lori R.,"Boston, MA",184,75,13
3.0,3/17/2019,"I was at The Sea Grill a few days ago for lunch, and while it's pretty empty when you show up for the start of lunch service, it gets pretty packed by the time you hit early afternoon. I can imagine it's decently popular with the business crowd due to the location, but there are also some families that cycle in and out, sometimes to see relatives who are skating on the ice rink. The restaurant is pretty cozy since it's below street level, but I can imagine that the rink brings a nicer view than there would otherwise be during the summertime. The service was alright, if a tad awkward, with the main plus being that it serves lunch on a pretty quick schedule once the order is in.Although there are some land options, I stuck with seafood - seemed apt given the name of the restaurant - and I generally came away with a decent impression, although it felt overpriced given what it was. I started with four oysters, split between Beau Soleil (East Coast) and Kumamoto (West Coast). The flavors were solid, although the Kumamotos were a bit on the smaller side, even given they tend to be smaller to start with. The bigger issue is each oyster sets you back $4.50, which is a bit ridiculous. The main was nice and light as well - I went with the Casco Bay cod, which had a nice crisp and was pretty flaky, although I felt that the texture was a little too glossy. However, the flavor resembled a light saute, and the creamed spinach it was served on wasn't as heavy as one might imagine. The salmon, despite sounding good, seemed to be a little undercooked, however - kind of disappointing since it looks pretty good on the menu.Overall, I'd say that Sea Grill is your run-of-the-mill business spot for a meal in the heart of Midtown. It is overpriced - like pretty much everything else in NYC, and particularly in this neighborhood - but the seafood is decent, if not cooked too consistently. I might pay a visit again down the road at some point.",2,1,2,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",371,1653,169
2.0,3/16/2019,"Go somewhere, anywhere else. Jumbo crab cakes were the worst. Under-cooked, under-seasoned. After the second bone, dinner was over. My daughter ordered the scallops. 3 gritty, under-washed scallops served on an overly large bed of wilted spinach.Most interesting? Our waiter could clearly see we weren't pleased.

5.0,3/13/2019,"I've been here before and always liked it.  I had not realized that they do themed events so when they announced a Mardi Gras dinner, it sounded like fun.  We had a nice table with a great view of the skating rink and skaters.  The service was outstanding throughout the meal.The menu included four courses.  For the first course, they brought a tray with a sampling of several appetizers-one for each of us that included oyster po'boy sliders, blackened shrimp, BBG glazed pork belly and boudin balls.  All were quite good.  For the second course, I had the crispy crab-stuffed shrimp and they were delicious.  For the third course, I had the shrimp and grits.   The shrimp was cooked perfectly.  The grits were good though never been the biggest fan of grits in general.  The braised collard greens were also good.  The dessert choices all sounded wonderful (bananas foster, pecan bread pudding with bailey's ice cream and warm beignets.  I had the bread pudding which was great and the ice cream was wonderful.  They had some nice touches to match the theme including a mask and beads for each person.  There was music that was supposed to match the theme and didn't really though it was very nice.  It was a relaxing night and very enjoyable.",0,0,0,Betsy B.,"Tucson, AZ",50,529,920
2.0,2/18/2019,"Reservation made: 1/17/2019Dine-in Date: 2/14/2019We made the reservation through Open Tables on January 17, 2019 to celebrate our Valentine's Day here. As soon as we sat down, there was a waitress who was saying ""yes, this is included in your meal"" or ""no, I'm sorry, this is not included, but you can have this instead."" I thought that those tables were dining at The Sea Grill with some sort of Groupon deal, I thought I was missing out on something.When we were ready to order, we've asked our waiter the difference between the Seafood Platter for Two ($38) and the Seafood Platter ($9 per person). Waiter started doing math in his head which was just awkward,.. then he stated it's a difference in portion so we've ordered the Seafood Platter ($18) along with an order of Crab Cakes ($12) so we can still have room for our entrees. I always love the crab cakes, it's truly their signature dish, along with the key lime pie. When waiter was told that we were ready for the check, he said ""are you sure? because you're entitled to desserts!"" I laughed because I thought he was making a Valentine's joke to my boyfriend. I explained that I already had a lot of sweets today, but the waiter was quite persistent, ""are you sure? How about some coffee? Or did you want to take it to-go?"" I wasn't quite satisfied by his sales tactics, so I still shook my head, requesting for the check.Once we received our check, we were astonished. Sprite $11Seafood Platter $38Crab Cakes $12Filet Mignon $95Salmon $95+Tax $286It seems that for Valentine's (holidays it says), everyone who is dining at The Sea Grill was opted-in to a prefixed meal for $95 per person. Waiter let me know that there was an email that I should've received. When I checked the email I got from Open Tables on January 17th, there was nothing written. Then I checked my email from February 13th, which I used to click the link to confirm my reservation, I noticed that when I scrolled further down, there was a ""What to know before you go"" which indicated ""On this day, The Sea Grill will serve a special prix-fixe Valentine's Day menu ($95 for dinner), in lieu of our regular a la carte menu."" I didn't even understand how we were able to order outside of the $95 meal that costed us extra. Or is the phrase ""in lieu"" being misused?So the conversation between the server went something like:Me: I'm sorry, what? $95?- Yes, today we are serving a prefix meal of $95 per personMe: Why weren't we informed?- It was sent to you in an emailMe: You should've let us know we were ordering additional to the $95- I did earlier (when we were asking about the difference between the two types of Seafood Platter)Me: ????????????? All this time I thought others were here on a Groupon special, the other lady was explaining well to the other customers what is included and what is not- I am sorry but there's nothing I can do, everyone is paying $95Me: Do you this this makes sense? And this Seafood Platter, you said it was gonna be $18- Yes, I believe that's an error, we'll fix that for youHonestly, our Valentine's Day was already pretty much ruined. Our effort in making this day special had all gone down the drain. I just paid $190 for a piece of steak and salmon. We've had our Valentine's here annually, including our first date. I didn't want it to be our last. With 15% tip, check totaled to $306. But can I say that this isn't the worst part?I gave a call to The Sea Grill next day hoping that the management would understand my frustration. After all, they're a reputable, up-scale restaurant. Today being the 19th, I've still haven't heard from the General Manager. The host that I spoke with, had all the details and the reason why I was calling. But ""as per the General Manager,"" she offered free desserts during our next visit. Sea Grill has admitted that their staff failed to inform us in detail about the prefix menu and the extra charges, but ""cannot"" do anything except ""comp desserts."" Honestly, the money isn't the issue here-it's the principle. Sea Grill says they've failed to do something and admitted that they are making corrective actions, but they are having their guests pay the consequences of their mistakes? This is an experience I'll never forget. Every time I hear complimentary desserts, unfortunately I will no longer have an appetite for it. My boyfriend and I have been returning to The Sea Grill because it was ""our restaurant."" I'm pretty sure everyone knows and probably even has one themselves. Unfortunately, we will need to suffer with bitter-sweetness every time we return.",0,0,0,Hee Yeon K.,"Manhattan, NY",374,120,1023
5.0,2/17/2019,"Still one of the best seafood restaurants in NYC. Opened ages ago in Rockefeller Center and it is still excellent. We came for Restaurant Week and that was a good idea. Otherwise this is expensive. But the 3 course meal was wonderful. Had the seafood bisque, shrimp salad and crab cakes. Then we had salmon, and sole, and cod and a pasta dish. The desserts were great, The wine list extensive. And the ambience was wonderful. Plus a view of the ice skating rink and you have the best setting for a great meal.

I'd highly recommend the bay cod over spinach and getting a seat by the rink in the winter.

4.0,2/9/2019,"My boyfriend and I came here one night for restaurant week before seeing a Broadway show and had a great time. We had a reservation for 530 on a Thursday night and were seating right away at one of their 2 person tables right along the windows facing the ice rink. I lived the decor of the restaurant. To start they bring out a selection of breads, an olive loaf and a baguette which were both delicious and fresh out of the oven. For the appetizer we both started with the seafood chowder that had lobster shrimp clams and bacon. We both really enjoyed it, there were large chunks of all the seafood, although I felt like the broth needed a bit more salt. We also got 2 beau soleil oysters which were incredible. Shout out to our waiter for making a great recommendation on the oysters. For the main course we got the sushi platter as well as the cod. Both were really good. The sushi was very fresh and absolutely delicious. I enjoyed the 2 different types of rolls on the plate. The cod was cooked perfectly and I loved the flavor of the bed of spinach it was on. They worked really well together. To finish, we got each of the desserts, the warm apple tart with ice cream and caramel and the dark chocolate ganache cake with ice cream. Both tasted good, the tart was pretty standard, nothing special but the dark chocolate cake was delicious. Very rich and decadent and absolutely delicious!Overall a great meal, definitely glad I got a chance to try it for restaurant week!",2,0,1,Alina V.,"New York, NY",257,274,682

I loved it!Our waiter was wonderful. Very patient with giving suggestions and explaining all the dishes we inquired about. Service was great, fast and extremely efficient. Food was plated beautifully. You can tell the cook took his time preparing every dish. Food was very fresh my only dislike was the food wasn't quite seasoned very well.

From our table, we had a wonderful view of the Rockefeller Center skating rink.We were first brought over some phenomenally delicious bread. We ordered from a three-course $80.00 pp.lunch menu.-Appetizers ordered were an amazing shrimp roll and a delicious and colorful squash salad. -Now, a drum roll for our Entrées!

5.0,12/17/2018,"I can't believe I haven't left a review this whole time... My bf and I have been coming to The Sea Grill every year for our holiday dinner for the past 3 years. They have a prix fixe menu during the holidays and it's always delicious. We started with some Champagne and Oysters (separately, outside of the first course version) and we always go for the Crab Cake starter - it's chock full of crab in a delicious dijon sauce, lightly caked and 100% delicious. We also got the House-made Linguine and it. was. FABULOUS. I could have just had that for every course honestly, but I'm a pasta addict... It was creamy without cream and had a delicate mushroom taste with just a hint of refreshing lemon. For the main course, I had the 2lb lobster with couscous which was great - a healthy amount of lobster in a nice sauce. I didn't know there was bell pepper in the couscous or I would have asked for a different carb because I absolutely hate bell pepper and it makes my stomach hurt. I delicately picked out the pieces though (lady that I am) which worked out fine. My bf had the surf and turf which was short rib and grilled shrimp with polenta - essentially his favourite meal ever. He thoroughly enjoyed the whole thing!By this point I was way too full for dessert and I couldn't have half the things on the menu anyway. The bf had the warm chocolate steamed pudding though and it looked fantastic. We love coming here every year and watching people fall on the ice. This year we even saw a proposal! The ambiance is great, the staff is friendly and the food is always good. I generally wish the prices weren't so steep, but seeing as you're in Rockefeller Center with a view of the ice rink, you pay what you get.

So, onward to my Sea Grill Review. I've been to the Sea Grill a half dozen times in the past, all during the time when Ed Brown was at the helm. I returned to the Sea Grill this past Saturday evening. We were seated promptly at our reservation time at a window seat where we could view the skaters. We ordered what used to be the ""Harvest Dinner"" but now is the Prix Fixe. The menu changes daily. Food wasn't bad but something the waitress did was inexcusable and is going to be the reason for my 1 star Yelp Review. We were brought ""amuse bouches"" but one on them was far smaller than the other. It occured to us that they were supposed to be mixed together but the kitchen neglected to do this. Our appetizers were the Salmon Sushi Roll and the Soup of the day. The soup of the day was excellent as was the sushi roll although it was served unusually warm (I wondered if the NYC board of heath cited them for holding cold foods at too warm a temperature?) Then came the action that I felt was inexcusable. The watiress removed the utensils after the appetizer but when she was bringing the utensils for the entrees, they were on a plate, with her order note pad upside down on top of the utensils with the ink touching them. They might as well have been on the floor and picked up. This was really inexcusable. Also, when the busboy was removing my appetizer, he dribbled the soy sauce all over the tablecloth, the floor, and the designer bag that the woman at the adjacent table had over the chair. Really careless. Our Mahi Mahi entrees were quite good. Dessert was another story. We had Apple Tart and Chocolate Hazelnut Torte. The Chocolate Hazenut Torte was OK. The apples in teh apple tart and the citrus creme fraiche ice cream were fantastic. But the crust was hard and rubbery.

4.0,7/31/2018,"We came here for dinner during restaurant week. We both had the 3 course meal. We were expecting smaller portions but they gave big portions which was a huge plus. I had the crabcake, the pink snapper, and the cherry olive oil cake. The crabcake was $9 extra. It was delicious but probably debatable if it is worth the extra $9. The snapper was nice but the spinach was too salty. I had to go through a whole glass of water just to deal with that amount of salt. The cherry olive oil cake was enjoyable. My friend had the chowder, pink snapper, and key lime pie. The chowder arrived hot which was a plus and the key lime pie was a huge slice. The pie was not too sour either. Some of the menu options had nuts in it and I am allergic which was disappointing. I know most people can eat nuts so I am not holding it against them. Our server(s) were attentive, kept our water glasses full, and got us out of there quickly. When you get the check, they gave a free plate of desserts and I saw two of them had nuts. I asked about the others and the server stopped caring. He said he did not know what was in them and his attitude reflected that he was not going to check with someone who did know. He was doing so well until the end too. Overall, this place is nice but if you are allergic to nuts be careful!",0,0,0,Rod B.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",12,229,0
4.0,7/29/2018,"We had a really nice restaurant week dinner here. Our server was fantastic, the ambiance is pretty and the food was nicely prepared. I tried the salmon roll and my boyfriend had the shrimp salad to start. The salmon roll was good, the fish was fresh and the shrimp salad was nice and light, but lacked a bit of flavor. The entrees were good, I had the cod which was perfectly cooked and nicely seasoned, he had the surf and turf which was pretty standard, I felt the cod was better. For dessert, I mentioned I was pretty full so our server brought me a trio of sorbets (chocolate, coconut and cherry) for dessert instead. The chocolate was really good, but the coconut just tasted like vanilla and the cherry was a bit artificial tasting. My boyfriend got the key lime pie which was good but lacked any flavor of lime.

My friend and I came for dinner around 7:00 after participating in various outings around the city. We arrived and were swiftly taken to a beautiful table overlooking the Rockefeller Center ice rink. The host staff were very friendly and accommodating as we entered. We were offered complimentary coat check as well. The menu looked great from the start. For drinks, my diet soda was excellent and my friend loved the Pinot Grigio. For my appetizer, I ordered the Blue Point oysters. They were fresh and delicious, perfect size and brine. The cocktail sauce that they were served with was also delicious. My friend had the Spicy Tuna sushi roll for the appetizer, and they were delicious as well. For our main course we both ordered the crab cakes for our entree. They were the best kind, with about 95 per-cent real crab meat, and little filler. The house-made potato chips that came on the side were some of the best I've ever had. We really wanted to have dessert, but had to pass because we were absolutely full. Throughout the meal, the waitstaff were very attentive and friendly, especially our waiter. They made sure everything was taken care of. Overall, I had a thoroughly enjoyable experience at the Sea Grill. The food was excellent, service attentive, and ambiance and view impeccable. I knew it would be good because Rock Center Cafe, Grand Tier Restaurant, and Naples 45 are excellent. They are all in the same restaurant group.

Boyfriend and I got the restaurant week tasting menu which included 3 courses (app, main, dessert) - I chose to get the oysters which were really fresh, the steak with shrimp and the keylime pie for dessert. The steak was cooked medium rare and was perfectly red right in the middle. My boyfriend had the sushi which was fresh and also had the perfect portion of wasabi to go along with it underneath the rice. The dessert was great but I couldn't finish - the pie was too sweet for my taste but i'm sure others would've easily been able to. The service really pushes this review to 5 stars - we got there a little past 5:30 and we told our waiter that we had a show to catch at 7:30 - he got us out by 7 and we didn't feel rushed at all!

He also took photos for us and even brought us to the back area to take photos in front of the rink, where the statue is apparent. That was nice. He was just very helpful in general. I forgot his name, I'll see if I still have the receipt.Second of, the atmosphere, nice of course.. My boyfriend is into restaurant atmosphere, that's why he picked this place and we also got a seat by the window, we could clearly see the rink! We got to witness a proposal too. Now the most important thing, the food. Yes, it is in the pricey side but there is prefix and that's what we picked. We got the...Crab cake - delicious! the waiter said 90% crab meat and he wasn't lying. I'll post pic. Lobster chowder - I don't see much lobster but still had a whole lot of seafood in it. Pretty good.Casco bay cod - his entree, it was good.. the cooked on the fish is nice but it does need a little more salt.Fish a la plancha - I forgot what kind of fish but there is olive and spinach in it. If you don't like olive, don't get it..it's very strong. It almost tasted ""rotten"". LOL! But after a while, I got used to it and it was fine but the spinach though, it left a weird feeling in my mouth.Key lime pie - good, not too sourApple tart - The tart is a little too soggy for me. In addition, they gave us a little smoke salmon on the house and also petite four as dessert.In all, it's a nice experience. Come  here, if you want to wow your date or for an occasion.

4.0,2/6/2018,"My first stop for NYC's Winter Restaurant Week. The rw menu caught my eye but the entire menu had great variety of choices to choose from. I like how this restaurant proposes restaurant week as a celebration on their menu. The restaurant is literally right next to Rockafeller skating rink. I entered through the elevator on the streets. The host team greeted us and offered us complimentary coat check. They gave us a nice table by the window and nicely accommodated our reservation requests. If you sit by the window, you'll get a great view of the ice skaters. All the staff we encountered were very attentive, patient and professional, from the second I had enter until I left the premises. We were choosing our alcohol of choice when I noticed the special restaurant week wine menu. They offered a few choices of red and white for the price of $42. The pinot grigio was perfectly light, very fruit forward with a mineral crisp. My friends finally ordered after some time. We were offered bread for the table and asked for extra condiments. The chowder came out lukewarm which made it hard to enjoy a creamy soup. It would have made the cut if it was served hot. The crab cake was one of the best I have ever had but the presentation of this dish could use some work.  There's about 98% crab meat with minimal filler over a ground mustard sauce. The portions of the oysters were a hit. Here I was thinking oysters would just be a couple of pieces but I got half a dozen of their oyster selection. The oysters were a good mix of Kusshi, Chefs Creek and Blue Point. They were fresh, briny, and plump. The scallop carpaccio was kind of a sad dish, it was warm. It would be nice if this dish is served ice cold, perhaps over a bed of crushed ice? The yuzu made me ordered this dish but I wished we had chose something else instead. The portobello fries are a MUST GET. I am a huge mushroom lover and The Sea Grill definitely made this right. A decent portion with an amazing sweet soy on the side. I was ready for another order. I was so ready for what the second course had to bring. My friends and I really enjoyed the linguine with mussels, and the cod. The key lime pie and honeycrisp apple tart was disappointing. It left a bitter ending to a great meal. The server Nichole was informative, personal and patient. It was a very warm and pleasant experience. Timing was great.

I'm pretty sure the waitress forgot as she took our order and asked about drinks. We had to remind her. The meal was amazing. We had 2 different fishes and oysters. The oysters were amazing! East and West. I had the cod and I do wish it were a little more flavorful. Slightly bland, maybe I didn't have enough of the sauce on the plate. The person that I was with had a peanut allergy and by default to be safe for them, I too have a peanut allergy. We asked if the dessert was ok for us and she took the time to go ask to be sure.

Came here with three of my girls for a birthday celebration and we were sat by the window of the Rockerfella's Iceskating Rink view and greeted by our waitress who was absolutely sweet and very thoroughly descriptive about how each dish was prepared.For starters we had;Jumbo lump crab cake - this is a specialty of theirs which they even offer on their regular menu as a main course. I love crab cakes but not often at all do a lot of places make them well... however this was probably some of the best ones I've had. It tasted of all purely sweet stone crab meat, barely any fillers to the mix and lightly crusted with I believe crackers.Raw oysters - came with 6 pieces on the RW menu which is really generous and I was stoked to hear so of course I had to order this as a raw oyster lover myself! They gave a selection of two each of their different types of oysters selection ranging from east & west coast which were fresh tasting oysters.Portobello fries - comes with a spicy mayo sauce and a soy sauce of some sort sauce. Crispy and delicious as a side order! Absolutely should order thisSea grill chowder - seafood with bacon clam chowder, also delicious. Which is was served a little hotter as it was just luke warm.Scallop Carpaccio - ordered this as a la carts for $18 and it was just average. Could've done without this dishMoving on to our entrees;Pan Roasted Casco Bay Cod - the cod was absolutely delicate, buttery, and just flaked right off. the portion was generous and the white wine emulsion complimented this very well. I even loved the potato purée on this plate that was puréed with another additional fish that gave this ""mash potato"" another notch of unique flavorHousemade linguini - my friends ordered this and it was good but I definitely did love my cod dish more.

2.0,1/16/2018,"A few weeks ago, I hosted a holiday dinner for 18 people.  Overall, the evening was a huge success.  My guests enjoyed the food, and loved  the view of Rockefeller Center's iconic ice skating rink.  The evening seemed to be going well until I received the bill.  Unfortunately, after a detailed review, I found that two extra bottles of wine were charged without my authorization.  What was most astounding was not that I was  charged for wine that I NEVER ordered, but the reaction of the servers. Upon bringing this to their attention, one server tried to convince me that I had actually placed the ordered.  Unbelievable! Not only was this not true, but I was very clear in terms of how many bottles of wine I wanted for the evening, and when asked as to whether I wanted to order additional bottles of wine, I clearly indicated that it was not needed.  Most of my guests still had wine in their glasses.  When the server realized that this was not convincing, he then indicated that one of my guests ordered two extra bottles of wine.  First of all, not only was this entirely false, as my guests would never take it upon him/herself to order wine for the table without checking with me.  However, even if this was true, wouldn't the server check with the host before ordering two very expensive bottles of wine, considering that the host is paying the tab.  After much discussion, I asked for the supervisor.  Luckily, another discussion was not needed with the supervisor, as the two bottles of wine were removed from the final tab.  I believe that the servers were trying to pad the bill, and exploit an already expensive evening.  Lastly, I was hoping to host future annual holiday dinners at the Sea Grill.  However, they have not only lost my business, but have gained a reputation as being untrustworthy, and more interested in price gouging.   My advice - examine your tab in detail to make sure that the servers are not padding your bill.",2,0,0,L.

Felt as if they were purposely over staffed to ensure a quality experience for all. 1st course - Seafood clam chowder. It tasted like a really yummy leek and potato soup with a couple of clams. Didn't look or taste as seafood filled as the pics from other yelpers. The raw salmon dish my dad ordered was better. Get that! 2nd course - Crab cakes. Jumbo lump for the win! Just get it if you like crab. Minimal filler. Delicious mustard sauce. 3rd course - Apple tart with ice cream for dessert. Inhaled in 3 minutes and I'm not even a sweet tooth. The flaky caramelized crust...yum. Total tab for three people was $479 not including tip and we only ordered non alcoholic drinks. You absolutely pay for the experience when dining here on a holiday.

But then she came over and was cordial and gave us the drink menu. I liked my drink my wife didn't like hers. She noticed after about 15 minutes my wife was not drinking hers and offered her another all is good. Then a couple walk in with a baby wanting to sit at the bar. They were from Oregon and had a mountainous look to them but no big deal the baby was cute and they were nice. Well, the bartender couldn't be any ruder to them to the point my wife and I were shocked. This couple was so nice and did nothing that they deserved to be treated like dirt by this lady bartender. The guy said it was his first time in NYC and people were nice to his surprise until he got to the bar and ran in to this lady. I give this review more so to the management of the restaurant than the customers. Everyone should be treated equal and this bartender needs a lesson in class.",0,0,0,Richard F.,"Vernon Township, NJ",2,26,2

Just what you'd expect in 1959.I was surprised that Chef used frozen shrimp, and not fresh, in the chowder.Chef also seems enamored with freeze dried items.  My potato chips were from freeze dried potatoes, not fresh. Desert was most disappointing.  freeze dried apples in the apple tart.And the crust was stale-ish.The crab cakes were good, in an old hotel kind of way.This used to be a stellar place to dine.It is still fun dining right next to the skaters, too bad the food doesn't measure up to the view.",0,0,1,Geo G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,18,0

She talked up the cauliflower dish, which wasn't great. She also sold us on this method to cook fish on a chrome dish. The fish was supposed to be crispy and moist, instead it was a bit chewy.

5.0,8/23/2017,"Last evening I dined at The Sea Grill with my friend.  The restaurant was having a special evening called Paella Patio Party.  I was invited to the dinner by Philipp Pothoff, the General Manager of The Sea Grill because I had had an unpleasant experience when I had dined here two months ago.  Mr. Pothoff wanted to show me that my previous experience was an anomaly and in no way represented what The Sea Grill is capable of.In my entire restaurant experience, I have never made such an about face as I did last night.  That is why I rewarded it five stars.  As soon as we entered the restaurant, we could not have been treated better.  But this review is not about the way we were treated.  It is about the incredible evening of food we enjoyed.The Paella Party started with a plate of four appetizers-gazpacho, croquets, octopus and a tortilla.  Visually colorful, they each had their own flavor.  The appetizers were served but the salad bar next was a buffet.  I loved most the grilled eggplant with pistachios.  The eggplant was soft and mushy but not oily and the crunch from the pistachios made it intriguing.  Heirloom tomatoes, shishito peppers, Spanish white beans, and roasted potatoes could've made the salad bar an entire filling and healthy meal.  But we were just getting started.Obviously the highlight of the meal was the Paella and it deserved it.  It was fun to look at and it was certainly fun to eat.  It was kind of like the kitchen sink of paellas.  Im trying to think what wasn't in there?  Obviously, half of a lobster which i assumed was boiled and sauteed with spices.  There were mussels, shrimp, calamari, clams,chicken wings/drumsticks, chorizo and stir fried saffron rice that i tried to but failed not to eat.  And maybe I shouldnt' say this, but I did not only have one lobster tail!And that went for the dessert selection to.  The dessert was either served or you could get up like the salad bar and retrieve your own poisons.  And I took a lot of the poison-I thought the chocolate pudding with cherries was the best and next I liked the rice pudding.  I really had no room left for the almonds torts, candied oranges, anise and almond cookies or the lime shortbread cookies.  I do admit wishing I had a big napkin and a paper bag so I could've stuffed some of these goodies out of the restaurant to have later.So I think you know the answer of whether I would go back.  In a heartbeat!  I gave The Sea Grill another chance and they took it and ran with it.  Bravo!!!",1,1,0,David E.,"New York, NY",363,21,0

Granted it's facing the ice skating rink at Roc Center, so the shoe fits, but at least lie to your customers a bit.... Put lipstick on a pig- pretend not to be shuttling people through trying to hit your nightly goals... but I digress. Every staff member was warm- and likely frazzled from the trauma of horrible tourists and business people that a) choose to eat in roc center and b) can afford it. The food was good- not for the money they charged- but good enough- as in it wasn't bad. Oh- and they did write happy anniversary in chocolate on our plates.

There was a nice view of the ice skating rink, where you can see people having fun as in a winter storybook. The restaurant had a pretty romantic ambiance, but the food was simply just okay. I ordered The Sea Grill Chowder as the first course with Spanish-style Cod as my main course and The Sea Grill Key Lime Pie for dessert. My friend ordered Red Snapper Sushi Roll as starter with Local Sea Bream and Key Lime Pie as her courses. The chowder had a generous portion of clams and smoked bacon portion and bits and pieces of lobsters with a few small shrimps. I thought the taste was okay, but honestly thought my friend's snapper roll looked more delicious. The Spanish-style Cod was well-cooked and beautifully presented. I thought it tasted pretty good, but didn't quite like the chorizo topping. The restaurant gave a pretty generous slice of key lime pie, but it was alright in taste but nothing spectacular about it. I would say this is a great spot if you are a tourist visiting the Rockefeller Center to at least experience once - maybe even as a romantic date on a night without the kids, but don't think I will be coming back anytime soon - unless they have new items that catch my eye on the menu for the next Restaurant Week.",1,1,0,Erica S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",164,7,14

The crab cake was pretty good and flavorful, but not worth the $9 supplement IMO. Chowder and roll were both just okay (but my sushi standards are super high now after eating some real expensive sushi restaurants). My sea scallop ceviche appetizer tasted super fresh, but my sausage-stuffed calamari was a miss. The grilled calamari itself was delicious but the sausage stuffing was a bit bland and threw off the taste of the dish. I would've much preferred just the calamari by itself. The key lime pie and apple tart desserts were both pretty standard and solid--good, but nothing outstanding.This is definitely a great restaurant/location to experience at least once, and a decent choice for restaurant week, but I'm not sure that I'd come back for the full price menu.",1,0,0,Stephanie H.,"Seattle, WA",275,157,39

Our server was very friendly and checked up on us very frequently. Since we (two people) were sharing the dishes, he even told the kitchen to add one more lobster ravioli for us since it usually comes in 3 pieces, so that we can each have two. Heard this is the #1 place for engagement proposals. I can see a proposal going swell with a romantic skating session outside and ends with a fancy and delicious meal facing the Rockefeller center. As for the food:1) The seasonal scallop in white truffle with lobster recommended by our server was extremely delicious. The shrimp cocktail appetizer was so-so.2) The foie grais ravioli dipped in lobster cream sauce was a little too oily and salty.",0,1,0,Jenny X.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,164,83

It was cooked perfectly tender, succulent, moist, delicious. My boyfriend ordered a 2 lb lobster which was over cooked and a disappointment. The presentation of the food is beautiful & artful.

My rating was based on the following: accessibility, presentation, ambience, service/food, and overall experience; with each category equaling to 1 star each. Where they lost a star with me was with service/food as well as overall experience. Service could have been better in the sense that I get you have to put up a face for your guests, but please do not put such a fake attitude to the point where you seem annoyed with the person you are serving. It would also have been nice if the servers are not rushing the guests to practically leave. When I was in there there was a total of 5 parties including myself. It was not busy at all and I noticed a server continuously making comments and actions to get a family to leave quickly. What I found more unusual and I wish I was over reacting was that all the servers were staring at me. (I was a party of 1, and keeping to myself so no I did not call for attention). Another reason they lost the star was because between courses the food started making me feel sick which I find to be alarming. Unfortunately, the food was in desperate need of flavors, at least some salt or seasoning would have been nice. Overall experience I feel like they did not live up to their ""fine dinning"" name.

3.0,8/3/2016,"Location is fantastic. Right at Rockefeller Center, beautiful outdoor seating and very good service. Not overbearing, but attentive - right in that sweet spot. I had the oysters, paella, and cheesecake. Oysters were good, on the smaller side but with very nice flavors. Paella was decent, a touch overcooked on the seafood, with really nice/interesting rice. Cheesecake was very good, but I would have skipped the sorbet topping. Pricing on the food was reasonable for the location. The wine was egregiously overpriced. I get that this is where restaurants make their money, but $75 for a $15 retail bottle is too much.",0,0,2,Sofya K.,"Rego Park, NY",15,304,639

The appetizers are absolutely wonderful.I guess I'm not supposed to expect sushi to taste like a Japanese restaurant from a Western grill restaurant. But if you're going to put it on the menu, I will assume it's going to be good since the place is quite pricey.I also ordered a lobster mac and cheese for the table but it was way too salty for me to handle and we left more than half of it.Back to the sushi I was talking about, their ginger tastes spicier than their wasabi and that kind of threw me off. They need to use less sodium soy sauce.The quality of the sushi was average; I definitely had better. I'm not saying its bad or anything, I would rather order a lobster or something else than their sushi. Meow",1,1,1,Lily H.,"McLean, VA",165,12,6

Edamame! Rock shrimp roll was deliciously simple but pricey. I appreciated the chopsticks, small plate for wasabi/condiment mixing, and the soy sauce. Lobster Mac and cheese was cheesy-licious. Fair amount of lobster meat. Salmon sliders were tasty, 3 in the app. Fresh fish (mahi mahi) was good. Offered bread a second time.

I'm always a little on the fence about visiting restaurants during restaurant week as I feel their ""signature"" dishes become watered down and, en masse, take away from the speciality of the dish itself.Sad to say that happened here with a seared salmon over shishito peppers and an asparagus foam. Under seasoned and while shishito peppers usually make me happy, these were a little on the soggy side (as if they'd been sitting for a little while under those heat lamps in kitchen). Additionally the dessert was 'eh' at best (key lime pie and chocolate cake) at our table.The service was wonderful, and the wait staff were incredibly knowledgeable and accommodating.

The desert was good especially the key lime pie. And believe you me I'm not a key lime pie fan but this pie was made very very well. Usually key lime pie is tart but with this was perfect.

My wife had the seared scallions which were cooked perfectly and presented on a bed of mashed potatoes. The desert was excellent which Maple cheesecake with candied pecans. I could eat just a handful of those pecans and probably call it a dessert on it's own. The atmosphere was great as we got to watch the skaters on the ice at Rockefeller center.

3.0,11/25/2015,"My boyfriend and I dined at the Sea Grill for a late lunch as part of the Radio City VIP Christmas Spectacular package. Included in the package is a 3 course meal at the Sea Grill. We were lucky enough to have a table right next to the window so we could watch the ice skaters on the Rock Center rink. The restaurant is trendy yet very comfortable. And, nothing is really better than people watching while you eat!The menu for the Christmas Spectacular 3 course meal was very impressive - many different options that could please different appetites. To start my boyfriend and I both had the seafood chowder. The chowder was good, but was a little underwhelming - too many potatoes and not enough broth or other ingredients. For my main entree, I had the rigatoni and jumbo shrimp scampi. I was quite disappointed when the entree came and it was just little, tiny micro shrimp. I'm not sure if the ""jumbo"" was meant to be ironic, but if I had known this, I would've chosen something different. The flavor was very good though - a spicy take on a classic dish.My boyfriend ordered the salmon which was a very excellent cut of fish. I wish I had ordered this! For dessert, I had a chocolate pudding and my boyfriend had a cake with pumpkin ice cream. My chocolate pudding - paired with pistachio ice cream - was delicious. Our waiter was extremely attentive and the entire restaurant has excellent service. The high prices are really for the wonderful location - it doesn't get much better than rink-side dining at Rock Center.

That's the difference here, its an experience not just a meal. . I had the Caesar salad minus the oysters (allergy) it was served cut in quarters, with an excellent ""real"" Caesar dressing.

3.0,7/22/2015,"I met an old friend from grad school here last night to enjoy a restaurant week dinner.  It's a great location at the base of Rockefeller Center, adjacent to the ice skating rink, but if you sit inside it's tucked far enough back that you don't have swarms of tourists staring at you; and indeed the restaurant itself is not too touristy considering its location.  The restaurant week menu had ample selection although a couple of items did come with an additional charge which is always a pet peeve of mine.  I had The Sea Grill Chowder for an appetizer which was an additional $5.  The chowder was delicious but given the meager portion size probably not worth the extra $5.  For my entrée I went with the Cod which I found to be quite succulent and highly recommend.  There were only two options for desert but that was ok because I never say no to cheesecake.  The cheesecake was savory and came topped with a kind of raspberry sorbet that accentuated the creaminess of the cheesecake nicely.  One nice feature of the Sea Grill's restaurant week menu is that it comes with two half-bottle wine selections.  We chose the cabernet which was delightful.  Our waitress was friendly, knowledgeable, and checked on us frequently.As we began to leave I felt a slight rumble in my stomach and knew that I had to use the restroom.  However, it would have been too awkward to say goodbye to my friend while remaining in the restaurant so I convinced myself that I could hold it until I got to my girlfriend's apartment on 70th and 2nd.  After I said goodbye to my friend on the corner of 6th ave and 49th st I ducked down into the subway station where the stomach pains intensified and I let out two loud farts that temporarily relieved some of the pressure.  Thankfully the sounds of my farts were muffled by the cacophony that is the NYC subway system and no one noticed.  I walked down the stairs to catch the F train to 63rd/Lexington only to see the train pulling out of the station as I got to the bottom, not a good sign.  Shortly thereafter, the M train pulled in which is normally of no help to me but then the conductor announced that the train would be running along the F line, surely a sign from God in my time of need.  As the train pulled out of the station my intestinal pains returned and it was at this moment I realized it was going to be a very close call as to whether I made it to my girlfriend's in time.  We pulled into the next station at 57th st and the conductor came on the intercom to announce that we were being held due to train traffic ahead of us.  I began to panic which only made the situation in my bowels worse.  I started to think the other passengers I made eye contact with knew what was going on inside my godforsaken body, their faces expressing a combination of bemusement and mild empathy.  After an insufferable amount of time we pulled out of the station and quickly arrived at my stop which just so happens to be the station furthest underground in the entire NYC subway system.  At this point I would have traded positions with any of the Chilean miners.  Looking up the first of several series of stairs, I felt as though I was being forced to walk to the top of the Empire State Building, but I powered through with the help of several pressure relieving silent farts.  I emerged from underground recharged and began to think that maybe I'd make it after all.  I debated walking north on Lexington to 70th because there are generally more restaurants with restrooms along this route that I could avail myself of if need be.  But with my new found confidence I decided to head east and go for broke.  This turned out to be an awful decision as the intestinal pain returned with a vengeance and I began eying various patches of shrubbery as potential restrooms.  I crossed 3rd ave at 64th st and eyed the sign for Tony's restaurant which always looked like it belonged more in the suburbs than the Upper East Side to me.  My entire body was sweating but I told myself - you can make it! As I got halfway towards 2nd avenue I stopped - this was it, the point of no return.  I turned around and sprinted as fast as I could to Tony's.  I threw open the doors and ran downstairs to the main dining room, frantically weaving my way through a gaggle of senior citizens making their way out.  I blew past the hostess, who thankfully didn't say anything to me, and asked the nearest waitress for directions to the bathroom.  Downstairs to the left I went, where I found two, glorious, open stalls.  I pulled into one and put the seat down, noticing several drops of liquid ringing the seat.  There was no time for my standard toilet paper seat cover and I hoped the liquid was just water; but deep down I knew.  I didn't even bother unbuttoning my slacks; instead I just yanked them to the ground. And then, finally...sweet relief.Overall I'd give The Sea Grill 4 stars but I'm taking a star off due to nearly shitting my pants after I ate there.Thank you Tony",3,8,0,Alexander R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0

For the main, I ordered the grilled branzino over wilted spinach. The fish was grilled nicely, though the spinach was a little oily. For dessert, I ordered a fresh-pressed coffee and the much-raved about keylime pie, which was tasty (and seemingly lighter than their other signature dessert - chocolate pudding with chocolate syrup and pistachio ice cream - was a bit too full to get that, but did try a bit of someone else's and it's quite good if you're indulging). Then I noticed that everyone at the table got their coffee besides me. Okay - one service blunder, okay, fine. I didn't finish my dessert, so I had it boxed...and was simply never handed it.  I'm not trying to be snobby here, but when you're paying as much as you are to dine here...you'd expect much better service.Good food...service could use some work, especially for the price.",0,0,0,Steve L.,"New York, NY",157,309,1204

3.0,3/10/2015,"Restaurant Week Review:Most restaurant week menus appear disappointingly bland and the main reasons I opted for the Sea Grill were because it offered more than 3 entrees, and for a seafood restaurant, a majority of those options weren't chicken or mushroom risotto.As interesting as the dishes looked on paper, the flavor of the dishes themselves didn't really leave much of an impression. It's unfortunately one of those cases where there was nothing bad about our meal but there was nothing great about it either. The chowder was good thanks in large part to the smoked bacon. The rest of the meal was ok.Overall, the restaurant's slight ""old school"" vibe, which came across as more dated than classic to me, and location right by Rockefeller Center weren't doing it for me.Service was great though so my actual rating gets bumped up to the 3.5 star average.",3,0,0,Christina F.,"Brooklyn, NY",95,289,11

It came over spinach, with tomatoes and capers. The skin was really flavorful and it was cooked to perfection. For dessert I had the cheesecake and they were really accommodating to my nut allergies and boroughs a pear compote instead of the pecan ice cream that it normally comes with.

How fitting for a seafood place? The lighting was perfect and the window looking out to the ice skating rink was a nice touch. However on the other side of the restaurant the windows were open to the underground concourse and sometimes people were looking in. Then I felt like I was in a fishbowl. Our server was very nice and polite. They did not offer Riesling by the glass but she remedied this by opening a bottle for me and it was almost the best I ever had. She didn't even charge me for that glass because it took a while to even figure out if they could give it to me. For the inconvenience it was free. The bread was cold. But it was still tasty.

The outdoor seating area is open, and yet feels secluded at the same time.However, I do have to give the place 2 stars based on the service. The restaurant was about half full, with plenty of service staff on hand, yet it took a while for our waiter to come and take our order. My friend and I ordered 3 dozen oysters, and some wine. The waiter asked if we wanted anything else, and almost seemed disappointed we didn't. Later on, he saw that our shell bowl was full, said he will replace, and went off and forgot about it. When he finally did come back (sans replacement shell bowl), and asked of we wanted anything else, or dessert, he was visibly annoyed when we said no and asked for the check.

I usually don't eat the bread served before the appetizer but for some reason I really liked their multigrain rolls- or maybe I was just really hungry! We went with the restaurant week menu and tried the blue crab avocado sushi roll and noodle salad for apps. The salad was yummy and the roll was also good- lighter on the salt and the sushi would have been perfection. We ordered a crab cake to share and it was also very tasty- not as salty. My friend ordered the shrimp entree and I had the ravioli. The shrimp entree was a bit on the bland side and the ravioli was more on point with the hollandaise sauce it came in- my friend was dipping her shrimp in my sauce to give them taste! We ordered the cheesecake and merengue/chocolate desserts- the only 2 available on the menu which I thought was a bit disappointing to begin with. The cheesecake was good- nothing extraordinary, and the other was also okay- nothing too crazy. We ended up paying $150, including tip, for the meal, a cocktail and a glass of wine... insane for restaurant week- can't imagine what it'd be like on a regular night! The waiter was extremely friendly so it didn't hurt to tip him but the meal was not worth all of that... Granted it's in the heart of Rockefeller Center but that's just price gouging right there.

3.0,3/5/2014,"Great experience and lovely view! The food was a-ok only because I expected a looot from this place, given the stars, $ signs, location, ambience, and overall ratings. I think the service was A+++ from hostess, coat check to wait staff and the follow-up from management, I think those areas warrant 5 stars+.   The view was amazing and beyond what you can ask for.  However, it is important to factor in food.  I'll provide another review when I give this place another try.  I do plan on coming here again.  For now, here are a few reviews on what was ordered - appetizers include the 'hen egg' which was part of the special.  You are supposed to break the fried hard-boiled egg to let out the yolk as it covers the potatoes.  Usually, the potatoes should be infused with either some sort of herb like rosemary or something very strong in the flavor profile. Potatoes to begin with are bland in flavor so just salt alone may not be enough especially because you want to incorporate the yolk flavor which is a very heavy and rich texture, in order to even out both aspects.  The paprika or some sort of spice was on the shell of the fried egg but it was not prominent enough and if it was present in the potatoes, it would have more of an even flow to the entire dish.  Now, not to be analytical but these are the details that is expected from top restaurants of this caliber.   Meanwhile, another appetizer that was ordered was the lump crab cake.  It was good in that the crab cake meat was there, not much filling but the once again, the flavor was not as strong as it should be.  In addition, I am not usually the type to want strong flavors but this dish was obviously lacking something, as well.  Overall, it was cooked very well in that it had great timing and incorporated ingredients. The entree consist of the ravioli.  The pasta was very fresh and obviously made on the spot or the day of... so that was excellent!  Otherwise, the filling of the scallop - although it was fresh, it did not have the herbs that would make a complete and well-thought out ravioli.  Furthermore, desserts were good but a bit too sweet.  Tried the pana cotta and the chocolate mousse cake.  Once again, it was all presented and done  in such a wonderful way so I appreciated that.  As mentioned, will come back to try the other items.  Noticed a sushi bar that looked very professional, clean and busy.  It looked as if the cuts were very fresh.  Will definitely come back to try again and to enjoy the view!

It's so pretty around Christmas overlooking the rink and tree it's really a special evening every Christmas Eve. You get to see a least one proposal on the rink while your there.

And if it snows it's so breathtaking to watch from the warmth of your table.The service is so nice and the restaurant decor is beautiful. The wine list is good and we always leave more than happy.

4.0,5/14/2013,"I've walked by the Sea Grill so many times but never been in there before. Many people feels that this place is a tourist trap because it's inside Rockefeller Center with a beautiful view of the ice skating rink. Without a doubt, it's expensive but prices are right alongside with other upscale restaurants in NYC. I came here on a Friday night afterwork, 2 of us had a table by the window, restaurant was not packed when we were seated at 6:30pm, it got busier by 7:30. Our waiter, Costa, came over promptly with the wine list/drinks menu, he was excellent and attentive in every way. He gave us a chance to order our drinks before giving us the food menu, so we don't get overwhelmed. He then went over the food menu in great detail, highlighted a few items and told us some of his favorites. We were undecided between Omakase or a la carte. With the Omakase, he said we can basically tell him what we don't like and the chef will do his magic to whip up something nice. Ultimately, we ordered a la carte.We shared 3 appetizers and each had an entrée. (It was a lot of food!!) I love it when restaurants offer to split our appetizers into 2 portions in the kitchen, so the presentation remains intact. We started with King salmon tartare, which isn't entirely fresh king salmon, it has a tint of smoke salmon in there - fine by us, delicious. Next up was ""Poached"" oysters in creamy sauce, this was my favorite. Finally we had crab-cake - Costa mentioned it's 98% crab and he wasn't kidding. For entrees we had trout over spinach and sea scallops with mussels/clams in a broth, both were cooked to perfection. They fried the fish skin on my trout, it was delicate and crispy!When it came time for dessert we decided to split one to share. While I usually go for pastries of some sort but I was too full to handle anything heavy, so we had ice cream and sorbet. It was simply the perfect way to wrap up a good meal.I must say that I was skeptical to come here prior to my meal based on other Yelpers' reviews, but after we spent 3 hours to wine and dine here, I thought it's well worth to come back again!",1,0,0,Pamela L.,"New York, NY",12,175,131

My cod, though a bit bland, was great. I especially liked the vegetable pasta on the bottom (strands of vegetables so long they looked like spaghetti). The key lime pie's texture was amazing. They even give an assortment of chocolates, cookies, jelly, and macarons on the house when you pay.This place is amazing. Not only are the food and the service spectacular, the restaurant itself is beautiful.

4.0,8/8/2012,"I came here during the 2012 NYC Summer Restaurant Week for a friends birthday dinner. There were so many different options to choose from but we decided on The Sea Grill because it offered an optional fourth course (for a special price, of course).When first arriving to the restaurant, I was a little confused as to where it was located, but you have to take the elevator down to the restaurant. The restaurant has a very clean, modern look, and I really liked how the lighting was not too dim to the point in which you cannot see the other guests or the food. Our waitress (sorry, forgot her name) was very friendly and funny. She definitely entertaining and informed us of all the different dishes and their specials. Of course, we all opted to order from the RW Menu.The first course I chose were the mussels. This appetizer was generously portioned and the broth was nice and spicy. I definitely enjoyed this dish. A friend had the fluke tartare, which I had a taste, but it wasn't as enjoyable as the mussels. Me and my friends ordered the Jumbo lump crab cake mid course and we expected it to blow our minds. We were told that the crab cake is baked and not fried and all crab meat, so it wouldn't be full of breading. I was hoping for a crispy exterior, but it wasn't. However, it really was all crab meat! BUT, my crab cake had a fair amount of small shells. For the main, I chose the diver scallop ravioli. This dish was amazing! The yellow wine emulsion was to die for. I definitely savored this dish to the last bite. I chose the black forest cake sundae to end my meal, and boy was this dessert rich and chocolatety. It was amazing. I tried some of my friends lemon sorbet and it was a little on the tart side.Overall, my friends and I had an enjoyable evening. With tip, tax, and 2 glasses of wine, and 3 crab cake mid courses, we ended up spending about $62 each (4 of us total).",2,0,0,Tiffany L.,"Brooklyn, NY",11,25,35
2.0,8/3/2012,"I came here with some friends last week for Restaurant Week for dinner.  There were 5 of us.  I was not impressed with the food.  We all ordered the lobster pot which had a $9 surcharge.  My 1/2 lobster was raw.  I have a fear of sending things back to the kitchen since I've heard of people spitting in your food etc, so I gave my lobster to someone at my table who did not mind it raw-ish.I had the mussels for appetizers and that was actually decent.The waiter was quite pushy. He kept pushing us to order wine off the list and to order appetizers that had surcharges.  We ended up being suckered into ordering a bottle of wine and 2 crab cakes.  The crab cakes were good.  The wine was average. It would have prob cost $20 at a liquor store but they charged $60 for the bottle.  We brought our own bottle to celebrate our friend's bday and the waiter said they had a ""small corkage fee"" which would be $25.  For that amount, we decided we could celebrate at home with no corkage fee. When we finished our first bottle , he came around again and must have asked at least 3 more times whether we wanted another bottle.The food was just so so.  The bill was very large..$400.

5.0,6/28/2012,"Fresh and fantastic Sea Grill Rock Center isn't my usual stomping grounds but it worked for everyone invited to the dinner in honor of the birthday girl who wanted seafood and oysters in particular.From the amuse of a mini taco filled with a fried clam strip cabbage pickled yellow beet and chipolte mayo to the fabulous plateau de fruits de mer which rivals my previous favorite rendition at Balthazar through beautifully butter poached lobster, perfectly steamed trout with yum yum sauce lots of brilliant vegetables with subtle Asian accents through desserts an adorable presentation of ice cream pops and maybe in honor of the special occasion some warm madelines which Proust wouldn't have recognized or approved of. But, I'm just a big eater from Cali and I thought the addition of nut flour (was it hazelnut?) and tiny shavings of bitter chocolat turned a rather plan tea cake into a treat and the nicest breakfast I've had in months.The famous crab cake was the least interesting dish on the menu and slightly overpowered by the mustard sauce, IMHO.I would recommend counter- intutive seating, sit INSIDE during the summer and Look out at the tourists while you sip a nice rose and enjoy the taste of the sea.A tip of the hat to Lisa H.

For main course, my wife had the lobster tail on a bed of risotto and I had the rib eye. Both main courses were very good as well. Can't remember what we had for desert, but they were pretty good. At the end of the night, they gave my wife a small box of truffles as compliments for dining with them on V-Day which I thought was a great touch in terms of service.

For dessert we had a few small cookies and coffee.  It was so cute to watch the marriage proposal on the rink!  I bet it happens a million times a day but it was romantic.",0,0,0,Kimberly L.,"San Francisco, CA",816,852,812

Although we were amidst businesspeople and I few *I SWEAR* reality TV stars, I felt fine. The ambiance is gorgeous. You look up and BAM! there's Rockefeller Center... 30 Rock, SNL, sighhh. And then there's that ginormous golden statue thing that is also quite pretty. We sat outside, but the walls sepereating the indoor from the outdoor are full glass, so I could see inside. Both were glamorous yet still sea-themed (like blue and white color scheme). 10/10 for presentation my folks!The service was average, it took a while for the drinks to be refilled, the bread basket to come, ect. However, they did give us a free crab thing ""on the house, my dears!"". Overall, my mom tipped a little more than normal, because they were nice.Onto the food, my mouth is melting thinking about it. I ordered a full lobster (that's right) meal... with some rice thing and soup stuff but honestly, that lobster was the highlight of the last 15 years of my life. Huge, fat, tender, BUTTERY... could it get any better? The deserts were impeccable (fancy language for a fancy restaraunt :) ). My mom ordered some clam dish which was also very good.

The avocado with touch of lemon juice was not overpowering at all. The capers and the olive oil was in very good grade.the entree we tried was the trout which was cooked just right. The skin was crisp and no fishy taste to it.  Th spinach underneath was too oily in my opinion. The rigatoni with lump crab meat was great. A lot of crab meat in it and the veggies was very fresh. For the dessert, we tried the passion fruit souffle which was so yummy. The key lime pie was very smooth and creamy. The watermelon sweet dessert was good as well.

There were three different types of bread and there was two of each. Loved them all. They brought us an appetizer, which we didn't order. It was a very small plate with a piece of fried calamari and a garnish. It was good. As an entree, I had the mahi mahi with some spinach, which wasn't on the menu. We also had some table shares of grilled asparagus and black truffled potato puree. Everything was so good. It was all very filling and appetizing.

3.0,4/14/2011,"I dine here several times a year due to convenience to my office.  It is consistent and the staff and hosts have all been there for quite a while, mostly.  Service is good, not great, timing of food from the kitchen vs. appetizer progress does not always match up well.  The location is unique but I have to say that seeing all of the skaters either primping or falling is not as entertaining as it used to be for me.Today I had a fried oyster roll with romaine and spicy aioli.  They clearly use the grade B shellfish for this dish and then fried the hell out of it.  The oysters were dry but well cooked! and when wrapped in rice and spiced up actually tasted pretty good.The waiters, always pushing a catch of the day convinced me the halibut was the way to go, prepared a la plancha which seems to be just pan seared with a fancy name.  I know Halibut is a really tough fish to do well because it tends to dry out quickly in the pan.  Well it dried out but was offset somewhat by the wilted escarole, light sauce and capers that it was served over.  The pistachio ice cream was absolutely fabulous!Waiters are a little too professional (continually seeking to pressure you into ordering more or more expensive dishes).  However, in the end my client and me were happy and not over stuffed when we left.This place is expensive and low on the value spectrum.   Great for business lunches or entertaining Mom when she comes to town.",0,0,0,Joe D.,"Nyack, NY",0,14,0
3.0,2/27/2011,"When I was visiting NY some friends brought me here for lunch since the restaurant week deal was going on. I think that it was so worth it to come during restaurant week. It was about $25 for a prefix 3 course lunch.Ambiance: the location made a difference. The restaurant had a nice view towards the outside central part of the Rockefeller center. The inside was very pretty, I liked how it was bright and had a lot of natural light.Food: as a starter I got the house cured smoked salmon. It was salmon with a top layer of avocado sauce. This was fantastic! For entrée I got the fish that  was sitting on some greens and came with caper sauce. The sauce was good, but my fish compared to the ones that my friend had was a little on the dry side. Dessert was the best part of this meal. There were some chocolate pearls, small crepe, chocolate ice cream.  It was a variety of things. You can check out the picture and see what I'm talking about.Overall it should be more of a 3.5. Location was excellent.  They didn't do a good job on the most important part of the meal, which was the entrée. The dessert was the best part followed by the appetizer.

3.0,7/22/2010,"I've heard of stories about restaurant week.  Since the prix fixe meals on the menu are listed at a great rate, sometimes the fear is both the service and the food can be lackluster.  In truth, I can will tell you, the service definitely was not the problem in this instance. The service was excellent: courteous, funny, and very congenial.  For that alone I would give this place a 4.5.  The food however was not as astounding as I would have liked.My choices for this review:Appetizer - Tomato and watermelon gazpachoMiddle Course - Tempura fried soft shell crabEntree - Scottish Salmon with Sweet Corn SuccotashDessert - Cherries Jubilee with baked meringue and almond ice creamMy partner in crime got the following:Appetizer: Salmon tartareMiddle Course - Crab cakeEntree - Slow roasted chicken breastDessert - Caraibe GateauHere's our breakdown:The appetizers were both prepared well.  The salmon tartare was very reminiscent of gravlax with distinct hints of dill, while the soup was really refreshing, and the sprouts as both color and taste were a great addition, adding a freshness as an opening note with a nice end note of creaminess to it.A good start.For the middle course, we were heavily suggested to go with their famous crab cake.  When we tried it, we understood why.Unassuming, this lump crabcake was juicy, well seasoned, and very well prepared.  It's no wonder it's a Sea Grill staple.  It must have been baked, because it didn't have any of the short comings of a generally fried piece of seafood.As for the tempura fried soft shell crab?  Not so much.  It was hard fried, with an end note of old frying oil.  The green papaya salad was overly spicy to the point of taste and was sent back to the kitchen.... on the suggestion of our waitress (who got bonus points from us because of it).When a new version returned to our table, it was far better, although not 100%.  You could taste a hint of old frying oil, but nothing like the first order.  It was also not overly cooked this time, which was a joy, however the papaya salad was still a bit hotter than necessary.  In other words, there was no proper balance to the dish.Did the main course win out?  My salmon was medium rare, as I had requested, and very fresh.  You can always tell with good salmon when it's slightly rare.  When you taste it, the end note should be buttery, and it was.  I was also very pleased with the succotash which offered a nice compliment.  It too was very fresh and really a good offering.  The roasted chicken however was (as my secretive ghetto co-hoards would say) ""the sh*t"".  It was excellently seasoned, with a great mushroom jus that really came out end the end.  My friend paired it with a prosecco, which ended up being a fine choice (yes, bubbly can be had with a meal).  Although the start was a bit sharp with the champagne, the finish was very well rounded.  Needless to say, I was very envious over her choice.  Who knew?Now for dessert.  Although I'm a huge fan of key lime pie, finding a place that does cherries jubilee well is rather uncommon, so I made my choice.  My friend would not say no to chocolate.  We were both very pleased with the offerings.  The meringue was very deceptive, visually blending in with the almond ice cream.  The cherries jubilee was a very good pairing to the slight nuttiness of the almond pieces and the creaminess of the ice cream.The Caraibe Gateau was so richly chocolaty, my friend could not finish it.  It reminded me of the old time chocolate truffles that would just be so dense, but would melt instantly in your mouth.  She took the rest of it home.Although I would have loved to give this place a better rating, the fact remains that a dish was returned.  The moral of this story?: Don't order fried items from Sea Grill.  They don't change their oil enough to have their food taste the way they should.My friend and I will be returning at some point to try their shellfish prix fixe menu with wine pairing.  Hopefully, their offerings will inspire me to up this rating by a star.",1,0,0,Janifer C.,"Orlando, FL",66,75,5

The spring prix-fix we had is different from what is up online for their menu now~The bisque was to die for, so creamy and delicious. The salmon tartare was good enough, and the soft shell crab tempura was as well - a little too much on the salty side though. The daurade fish went really well with the sesame ginger-like sauce it was flavored in. The sea scallops were also good, but grilled and the burnt taste of the grill really overpowered a lot of the dish, which was too bad. Overall, the bisque appetizer was ironically the winning dish of the night. Finished with warm chocolate steamed pudding (verrrrry rich and decadent) and a strawberry rhubarb shortcake sundae (very light and delicious, albeit nothing spectacular).  Petit fours to complete the meal and we walked out a very full and heavier couple.",1,0,0,Ann L.,"New York, NY",9,151,0

WHAT: What else?! seafood! and yummy dessert! Great customer service! Probably the best customer service I experienced in NYC! We basically had a waiter all to our selves. We made reservations via online... and came during the early night.WHERE: The location is perfect! great view of Rockefeller ice skating rink. We had a table right by the window... so we could see all the action on the ice. Half of the time, the ice was being cleaned, so we got to enjoy the ""calm before the storm"". WHEN: Came here in April 2009 while on Spring Break with my bff. Found this place via yelp. WHY: Wanted to have a nice dinner before ice skating... and out of all the places in the building... this place stood out the most to me. If I wasn't planning on ice skating... I would've not came out of my way to have dinner here. To sum it all up... I enjoyed the salad, main dish and dessert! The bill came with little treats on a tray. Nice lay out, clean bathrooms and great view. Very charming. If you're visiting NYC and want an enjoyable dinner with a nice view of the rink... this place is perfect! On the pricey side... but I guess you're paying for location and the fact that everything in NYC is expensive. I would imagine our bill for 2 was over $100 easy and we don't drink alcohol.

No one raved about their food. No one even complimented their food. But no one complained, either.The major star penalties come for the service. My table asked the waiter to suggest a dry white wine. He suggested one, we tried it, and it was pretty well into the sweet range of whites. When we told him it was sweet, he insisted that no, it was dry, especially compared to a riesling. Well yeah, most wine is dry compared to riesling, but that's not saying much, and heck, riesling's pretty dry when compared to an ice wine. When we assured him that he should not be recommending it as a dry wine, he once again told us that it was. We told him it was sweet. He gave us a brief history of the varietal, concluding with an assertion that it was dry. We assured him that, no matter how other vineyards might process this type of grape, the wine we drank was sweet, and he shouldn't tell people it's dry. He told us again that it was dry. We let it drop so he'd go away.Our party of 10 was seated in an otherwise deserted section of the restaurant, but we were divided into two groups and seated at adjacent round tables instead of any of the tables designed to accommodate larger groups. When we asked if we could drag the two tables together, the employees said it was not allowed.During our meal, waiters from other sections would loiter near our table to rest for a moment, chat with each other, etc., which was fine except for the waiter who would stand there and contemplatively pick his nose for a few minutes at a time.There's a bathroom attendant, but don't worry about tipping her. While i was in the bathroom, she sat in the corner and talked on her cell phone the whole time. I'm perfectly happy to dispense my own soap and collect my own paper towels, but i could have done without hearing the details of the attendants personal life while i used the toilet.Our water also had a slight tendency to take plates away before the diners were finished, counterbalanced with an occasional tendency to totally ignore that we were done with a plate and leave it on the table for 15 minutes. He took my teapot while there was still a full cup of tea left in it, but i got to stare at the remnants of my dinner for a long, long time before it disappeared.If you do end up here, though, the chocolate pudding dessert (which is more of a flourless chocolate cake than what most Americans consider pudding) is really quite good.",5,3,1,Kate T.,"Portland, OR",32,437,12

4.0,11/16/2007,"Some people my boyfriend does business with were in the city so we took them here for dinner before we went to see a play. We'd made reservations and were late, but it didn't seem to matter--there were a lot of empty tables, seemed like you could easily walk right in for dinner without reservations. (This was a Thursday night during the Broadway stagehands strike, though, so maybe it was light in the dining room because of that?) It is a cool place to take out-of-towners, because the view of the skating rink is a lot of fun and is great for filling lulls in the conversation. This particular night was also the night before the Christmas tree was lit, so it was great to have a view of the big tree before the crowds started to swarm.I don't know if they were so accommodating because they knew we had a time crunch and had to leave quickly to make a show, or if that's just the way they are, but the service was very nice and quick. However, if they're like that normally, I would feel too rushed. Hard to say.Like others have said, the food may not be as special as the prices suggest, but it's tasty and the view makes up for the price--and of course, it's always better when someone's company is footing the bill. I really wanted to go with the tasting menu, but we were unfortunately pressed for time, so I had the salad with greens, apples, and a sherry vinaigrette, which was a little spicier than it needed to be; and the crab cakes, which were great, nicely seasoned and lumpy and crisp on the outside, and the mustard sauce was so mellow with just enough kick. The potato chips on the side were okay, a couple were cooked maybe in too-cool oil and were chewy instead of crunchy. I tried my boyfriend's butternut squash risotto that he'd ordered as his main course, in addition to salad, and it was definitely enough as a main course, filling a hefty bowl. It was a great risotto, creamy and perfectly seasoned. They also brought enough tuna tartar appetizers for the table--the bite of the fennel in the background was a nice surprise, though it slightly overwhelmed the fish.Overall, it's a pretty good fall-back place for a fancy business or parents-in-town lunch or dinner if the restaurant you'd really love to go to doesn't have any tables available for the day and time you'd like.",1,0,1,Mary B.,"Brooklyn, NY",10,94,14
5.0,9/13/2007,"This was perfect. Every single thing we had was five star. Our waiter was knowledgeable; the rest of the staff obliging and helpful. (Though it was a quiet night.) We never wanted it to end. Each course was just as perfect as the preceding. Additionally there was the delightful bonus of calm and steady service. We were never rushed, but left to meander our way through the menu, pausing to savor and delight in our choices. Each dish was delicately prepared allowing for the natural marine flavors to shine through.

4.0,8/15/2007,"Definitely worth a trip to this lovely place!  Located right in the heart of ""Touristyville"" - the Sea Grill overlooks the skating rink at Rockefeller Center in the wintertime.  It's definitely a cut above the usual cheesy tourist restaurants.  Yes, you are paying more, but you are definitely getting your money's worth.  The staff is extremely knowledgeable and attentive - they know their wines and your water glass is not empty for long either!  The decor is very nice - clean modern lines and a very comfortable setting.  I'm not a fan of dining out in the touristy areas of NYC, but this is one of the few places I will make an exception for.  The seafood is all VERY fresh and top quality.  Unless you are entertaining guests from out of town who want to see the surrounding touristy sites, it's best to go ""off season"" (IE: not in the middle of Summer or the period between Thanksgiving and New Year's) - I was once taken there for my birthday in March and it was so nice to enjoy a nice relaxing yet fancy dinner while watching the skaters right outside the window.",0,0,0,Michelle L.,"NY, NY",82,170,76
1.0,7/3/2007,OK - I went for a business luncheon there and got a Scallop Salad (salad with three scallops on the side).  he food was ok - until I realized that I wasnt feeling well.I ended up with the worst case of food poisoning I ever encountered and still cringe when I walk by on my way to work.,0,0,0,Liz V.,"Brooklyn, NY",21,39,0
4.0,6/8/2007,"I went to the Sea Grill  around Christmastime. I love New York at the holidays and I didn't pay, so I am sure my review is biased. Having the skaters at eye level was so much fun. The food was pretty good. I am not a fan of food looking like the animal it once was - so the tiny crab appetizer they gave us, that looked like the crab just walked out of the ocean, was not my favorite. The steak was an additional charge on top of the prix-fix). It was a good meal. I would recommend going during the holidays and especially when someone else is paying.",0,0,0,Erin V.,"Chicago, IL",13,75,0
4.0,5/16/2007,Nice central location in the Rockefeller center although I'm sure it would be a headache during the tourist season. The salmon here was quite good and it wasn't overcooked like it usually is at so many places I go. After the pleasant experience here I braved the salmon at other restaurants and to my dismay it's usually still overcooked everywhere. The service here was also very good.,0,0,1,Cat T.,"Los Angeles, CA",181,552,24
4.0,4/13/2007,"I went with a native NY-er and we had a table at the windows overlooking the ice rink.  The food was surprisingly good (given that the restaurant is located close to a major tourist trap).  Alas, I was in tourist-heaven.",0,1,0,Rie S.,"Seattle, WA",1,35,0
2.0,3/13/2007,"So here is what my two stars boils down to:  was the food at Sea Grill good?  Yes.  But are there better places to go for expensive seafood?  Hands-down yes.  Are there better places you could go to that cost less?  Hands down yes.  Sea Grill strikes me as the kind of place that subsists on one offs -- i.e., the steady stream of tourists thanks to their wonderful view of the Rockefeller skating rink.  Would this place survive if it was a place for neighborhood regulars, or one to survive on its reputation for fine food (e.g., Le Bernadine, gramercy tavern), not a chance.To be specific, the food tasted like it had several bars of butter melted in.  I had their prix fixe shellfish menu.  It was good enough, I guess.  Started off with some flash cooked (buttered?) rock shrimp, which was unimpressive (and tasted a little fishy).  The next was a giant sea scallop, which was good but not mind blowing (and was in a thick ginger butter sauce).  Then we had some butter-blanched lobster which was good (cooked very little), but again, not quite delicious.  The dessert was a blueberry souffle, but the texture was more granular than souffle (as if the grains of sugar hadn't melted fully).  Some of the service was very gruff too. All in all, I left feeling sorry for the person who paid for my meal.  I didn't feel like it was worth the price.",3,0,1,Sarah T.,"San Francisco, CA",73,99,1
4.0,8/25/2006,"Since I work in the building I had always wanted to try this place, but wow, do not go unless someone else is paying for it, like with an expense account. The restaurant thinks it's a lot more upscale than it looks. Service is ultra-polite and formal to the point of weirdness. When making reservations, they warned my sales rep that they were really strict about their dress code, for example. Anyway I had the shrimp sushi to start, which was delicious. Then I had the scallops, which were also excellent. Tried my sales rep's shrimp a la plancha (a special grill they use) and it was pretty good.",2,0,1,T T W.,"Duxbury, MA",35,90,5
4.0,7/20/2006,"The Sea Grill is under the same management as Rock Center Cafe, so do not expect the decor of either places (both downstairs next to the skating rink) to be too breath-taking. I dined at Sea Grill last night during restaurant week and it was one of the better prix-fixes I've had this time around.  I had the tuna with orange slices (I forgot the fancy name) for appetizer, which was average; my friend ordered the scallop ravioli which I think was the best out of the the appetizers.    White fish over a mixed spread of corn was the entree and it was absolutely fabulous, much better than what I'd expected; my friend got the sushi (but I think you should only go sushi in a Japanese restaurant, namely Tomoe or Yama).  Anyway, they offered two types of fish--one tougher, another flaky-- my fish was the latter and was tender and muy perfecto!  The corn and beans underneath was heavily flavored and a little spicy which complimented the lightness of the fish.  ....my mouth is watering right now just thinking about it. Desserts were average if not a little bit disappointing: the two choices were different flavored ""muffin"" look-alikes (choices were white chocolate and caramel) paired with sobert.   The service at this place was a little kooky, but could have been an isolated incident.  Overall, I had a good meal and would probably come back; but when you live in New York, unless its for the very best, it'll probably be a while before you come around the same thing twice!",3,0,1,Amy Y.,"New York, NY",149,121,0
