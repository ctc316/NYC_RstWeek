Started with antipasti, a platter of beautiful vegetables all bright and flavorful.The 3 pastas this night were a ravioli, a beautiful shrimp and red sauce dish and a pesto pasta.

4.0,4/28/2019,We tried unlimited pasta set. The pasta part was so so. Maybe because the portion was too large for me. But I have to say the bread box and the appetizer were amazing. The sauce going with bread went on well with them. I may try some other dishes bext time other than unlimited pasta. Unlimited pasta is really not my thing.,0,0,0,Shirley Y.,"New York, NY",55,71,322

3.0,4/19/2019,"I don't like to write bad reviews, however for a place this pricey I think it's worth noting you should avoid spending a lot of money here there isn't a lot of value here. We ordered the rice balls stuffed with mozz as an app which was delicious but not worth the price. It was $9, not much for an app however it came with three tiny balls smaller than the size of a ping pong ball.. delicious but not a great value. I appreciate that they made chicken parm for me although it was not on the menu, however it was actually one of the worst chicken parms I've ever had. The chicken was thin, pinkish red and very chewy and stringy. Did not cut nicely either. I think the quality of the chicken was verrry poor, I couldn't finish it (and chicken parm is one of my favorite Italian dishes) I was disappointed to say the least.",0,0,0,Brittany R.,"Tenafly, NJ",1,13,2

2.0,4/18/2019,"Every time I've come to NYC, I've dined at Becco's.  Last night's dinner was a disappointment.  Service was inattentive and rushed.  The food left much to be desired.  The trio pasta quality was not like it used to be.  I'd rather they raise the price to get better types of pasta dishes and at least one with some protein like they used to do.  A friend ordered the pasta trio, I ordered just two appetizers -- asparagus soup and fried calamari.  I received a large quantity of the calamari and the price reflected it.  Maybe one can't order appetizers only.  The other friend ordered the chicken parm special. Since they've expanded, it has really changed the atmosphere and for the first time since dining at Becco's for over 22 years I felt it was more like dining at a buffet place in a casino.  I've apologized to the friend about my highly recommending dining there yesterday.",0,0,0,Sandy C.,"Ansonia, CT",0,5,0

3.0,4/15/2019,"I'm sad to give 3 stars to what once was one of my favorite Italian spots in the whole city. They have an all you can eat pasta special, with 3 special pastas rah day - but you can't pick the 3 flavors, it's just what they have. Today they had rigatoni with like a weird nutmeg (sweet!) flavor bolognese. A cannelloni with a bland almost flavorless white sauce. And spaghetti. It's fine, it would be fine, except their policy is ""you can't share pasta"". I get that, it's to keep ppl from taking advantage. However if I'm getting a $25 pasta dinner with NO great options, you're saying my friend can't have one bite and try it? The other dish was our once-favorite chicken limon, with a delectable lemon sauce w/ garlicky spinach, olives and caper berries. Tasted delicious. Chicken was way dry. Just like last time, so I guess we won't order that anymore. :( We had to leave quickly (their timing and bussing/back-waiter staff were wonderful!) Our server though? Not so much. Not very friendly, not fun, & totally unapologetic about the STUPID ""rule"" about taking a tiny taste of a companion's dish. Too bad. The hosts, bussers + pasta servers represent the place so well. Bad pasta, dry chicken, semi-rude waiter. The 3 stars are only because we have had wonderful experiences in the past... I'm sad about this one.",0,0,0,Jenilyn R.,"Manhattan, NY",124,15,7

Since I love watching PBS create, I love seeing all of the cooks on there and Lydia Bastianich is on there frequently, so when I heard she had a few places in NYC, I was all over it. Our whole day, we ate lightly in anticipation for our Italian meal tonight. Honestly, I wanted the cream de la cream of Italian food and I've had better at much reasonable prices.

2.0,4/6/2019,"I am generous with two stars.  Omg people what is the hype with this place?  I seriously question Joe's opinion about good quality food because Becco was subpar and lacking in so many areas.  Let's start with the initial reservation and confirmation process... hire friendly staff!!  My first experience on the phone and I was left on hold for 10 minutes.   No excuses and I did share this feedback with management but it was excused because it was assumed that I called during a busy lunch hour. Simply not the case. Oh well! Onto the waiter we had.... I asked if he could have the team sing happy birthday to my my dining partner and he said as long as I buy dessert.  Honestly, I was going to buy dessert anyway, I would never expect good customer service anyway!! Olive Garden sings happy birthday  as do many other places with or without paying for dessert.  Needless to say, I was beyond disappointed at this point.  Let's talk about food, shall we?  Overpriced to start. Quality of food was not even close to a chain restaurant. Things weren't properly seasoned. $13 for button sized, hard risotto balls - ugh! What was I thinking coming here. Joe seriously has me concerned about his taste buds. Before I watch his tv show knocking how others cook, and if something is lacking flavor - he needs to re-evaluate Becco.  I generously gave two stars but would have rated 1.  The two is because the bread and olives were good.  Lastly, it took 50 minutes for our entrees to arrive and so not worth the wait. I won't ever come back or recommend",6,5,2,Food L.,"Shelton, CT",40,295,1902
3.0,4/5/2019,"Overhyped because of Lydia's name.  Most everyone ordered the pasta sampler.  Last night it was rigatoni's bolognese, spaghetti with red sauce, gnocchi in a Gorgonzola sauce.  I liked the rigatoni.  The spaghetti wasn't anything special.  The gnocchi were good but absent most of the night.Servers come by with each of the three different pastas.  Felt like we had to constantly flag them down and then they were a bit stingy with the gnocchi when they finally came.  It was annoying as was the snooty attitude of the hostess.  In NYC, there has to be better Italian and pasta options.  Would not return",5,0,1,Alex T.,"Ocean City, NJ",11,145,275
1.0,4/5/2019,"Good Food but Snobby ServiceTook my husband there for our anniversary because he loves Lidia. The initial waiter was helpful.  However, we were then switched to a waitress who had asked if we wanted wine. My husband & I do not drink. Yes, there people in this world that do not drink. She instantly became uninterested and barely paid any attention to us from then on. She did, however, fawn over the table next to us because they appeared to be more affluent. My husband and I do very well for our selves but we do not believe in 'flaunting"" money. Although we could easily afford anything, this waitress already made a decision on who we were. Needless to say that although the food was very good, we will not be returning. She managed to just about ruin an anniversary dinner by ignoring us and having to wait for service and our bill.

We were at the restaurant over an hour and only saw the pasta servers once!

4.0,4/1/2019,Super impressed by our pre-theater meal at Becco. The place was jumping yet service was quite efficient - I guess they are used to people dining with limited time. They have a great selection of wines for $33.  And the pasta special is a great deal - salad or vegetable misto plus unlimited servings of three kinds of  pasta for I think $22.  Entrees all come with salad and portions are nice sized without being too filling so one can have a good meal without breaking the bank. We had a very tasty bread pudding for dessert.,0,0,0,Denise P.,"Brooklyn, NY",95,386,259
3.0,4/1/2019,"Classic Italian eatery in the theater district that lures people in with their unlimited pasta offering. They give you unlimited portions of three types of pasta that changes daily, which is hit or miss. Obviously avoid this place if you are not looking for carbs.Their other offerings look decent, and are typical Italian dishes but seems over price for what you get.Service is also lacking at this establishment. The times I've been here, I've been forgotten by the waiters. Recently I waited 20 minutes after sitting just to order the food. When you get seated they ask if you are seeing a show. I have always said no, but if I come back here, I think it's best to always say YES.

We had a drink in the bar as we waited for our table with early reservation for 4:00. Drinks were NYC expensive. Nice table for two by the wall but had to change chair to find a little stability. Bread, spread and olives on table were excellent. We opted for the Sinfonia di Pasta and were really happy with our choice. It comes with a choice of Caesar Salad or Antipasto Misto which was our choice. This was a plate of marinated and grilled vegetables [super] and either a seafood side of octopus salad and a bite of skate with romesco or burrata with honey and fresh peas. We each had a different version with the octopus salad a winner. The three pastas [and you get all three] were spaghetti in red sauce with basil, orrecchiette with pancetta and cabbage and Sicilian style gnocchi made with a touch of semolina and then seared and bathed in a light cheese cream sauce [looked just like scallops]. Gnocchi were our number one choice. Servers walked around the room each with a different pan of pasta so it was all you could eat.

5.0,3/28/2019,"Becco came highly recommended.  I went for lunch with my MIL and SIL and the entire experience did not disappoint.  We started with cocktails, both the Blood Orange Martini and the Grapefruit Negroni.  Both delicious.  We then dove into the carpaccio and the antipasto caldo.  The carpaccio was delicious, fresh and came with freshly shaved cheese and arugula.  The antipasto was delicious.  The eggplant rollatini was probably the best I have ever had, the clams casino were perfect.  For lunch, I ordered the pesce intero del giorno.  They brought the branzino over to me once it was roasted and asked if I wanted it cleaned, I did.  Once it came out cleaned it was plated with roasted potatoes and shaved leeks.  I was happy I opted for this dish.  My sil ordered the peperoni ripieni and it was a larger portion than we expected.  She was thrilled with her decision.  My mil ordered the trancio di Salamone, she was very pleased with her dish.  I tried a piece and enjoyed the flavor but she opted for her salmon to be cooked more well done than I prefer, so it wasnt cooked to my liking.  No fault of the restaurant, simply how she ordered it.  Overall, we had the best time and most attentive waiter.  We will return!",0,0,0,Sarah C.,"Laurel, NY",12,6,8

5.0,3/25/2019,"One of my favorite restaurants in the world!  Seriously.  Not kidding.  Approachable. Amazing food. Beautiful ambiance.  Outstanding service.  And, it's in a great area.Completely wonderful cuisine that is affordable (even the wine!!!) in NYC's theater district.  Caesar salad or antipasti with three different special pastas are toted around the dining room by an accomplished wait staff, constantly refilling guests' plates.  Oh, and the cost is under $22 at lunch and under $26 at dinner.  And the wine?  Many choices for $33 a bottle!  Yes, real wine - not stuff with a screw too, and many choices.  Now, if you don't want the chef's specials, don't worry, because the menu is outstanding!We went once for lunch and once for dinner while we were visiting NYC (yes, it's that good).  Lunch choices were rigatoni with a tomato sauce, fettuccine with fresh crab, and mushroom ravioli.  Oh my goodness!!!  Heaven!!!  We saved room for dessert (I don't know how), and it was the zabaglione with berries.  That dessert choice was over-the-top sweet, but I survived.When we returned for dinner (make a reservation, and the restaurant has a coat check), we were seated in a gorgeous room with an atrium ceiling.  Service was impeccable, of course.  The choices that evening was spaghetti arrabiata with fried spicy shrimp, asparagus ravioli, and fusilli primavera.  Not a huge fan of the fusilli, but the other two dishes made up for it.  Dessert?  Oh yes, as it was our last night in the city.  I went with the zabaglione again (thankfully not as sweet) and my husband had the gelati trio.  Simply amazing!!!!So, please try to go if you can.  A delightful hidden gem that is worth a trip to NYC!",2,0,1,Jennifer S.,"Tucson, AZ",40,79,245

The food was the most disappointing part. The Bass was flavorless and the rest of my party had similar feelings with the Pasta Trio (that's not gnocchi).

3.0,3/16/2019,"Our first trip to NYC and my wife only had one restaurant she wanted to visit: Becco.  She was very put off by the way the evening ending.  We had a reservation for 7 pm on a Friday night and it was needed due to how busy the place was.  We were greater and very promptly seated.  The tables are tight like many big city places so be ready to be close to your fellow diner.  We both started with a drink which were well made and came out quickly.  We both had the white bean soup which was 5 stars and should have ended the meal there.  Not because of the food though but rather the service.  I ordered the stuffed peppers and my wife ordered the meatballs and a side of vegetables. I also ordered the 3 pasta as an add on but never received them nor were they on my bill so I think that is an error on the waitresses part.  I was a bit disappointed because I wanted to try them but was full from all the other food.  The bread they brought out was disappointing from my perspective.  The soup was great but needed just a little more salt and pepper which were on the table including fresh cracked pepper.  The vegetables were just Luke work so we barely ate any.  Water service was okay but not stellar since by glass went empty a few times with waits between refills.  Besides not getting the pasta I ordered when the waitress came back around she asked if she could clear the table and we said okay.  She never asked if everything was okay or if we wanted the vegetables she just cleared it all away.  She never asked if we wanted to see a dessert menu either.  After sitting at the table for at least 5-10 minutes with not even any water, my wife asked the hostess if we could get our bill.  That took a long time as well and when we finally got up to leave my wife mentioned to someone that we were not even asked about dessert which the waitress overheard and decided she needed to shout back that was because of the hostess telling her we wanted our bill.  We never would have asked for the bill if we didn't feel forgotten.  Plus the waitress had the chance to ask us when she was clearing the table but never did.  I know it's a tough job, and maybe they are understaffed, but no comment needed to be said since no explanation was asked for.  Plus  the 18% tip was already left.",4,0,0,Paul L.,"Green Bay, WI",22,80,64

3.0,3/12/2019,"We tried Becco pre theater last night and thoroughly enjoyed it.  A few quirks keep this from being a four star review.  We had reservations but when we entered, they told us to stand in the bar (even tho most of the tables in the dining room were empty) because they were too busy on the phone to seat us.  Huh?  We eventually complained and they seated us. The room was eventually very crowded and we were happy to finally leave when we did because we were cheek by jowl with the party at the next table.  We ordered fish, pork chop and the pasta intermezzo.  BTW, all the comments on here about the bread served up with the bean dip are correct - it is super yummy.  And we found two of the three pastas to be delicious, the ravioli being the weak link as it seemed sort of greasy or something.  The fish and pork chop were fine although the filleting of the fish left a lot of bones in it. And my husband did not care for the way the peppers and tomatoes on his pork chop tasted, he thought they were an odd accompaniment to pork.  The bar prepared two excellent cocktails for us - I know this is the place for cheap wine, but try a cocktail, bartender was great.  And finally, the biscotti and amaretti were good, but the espresso we dipped them in might have been instant...  So overall, a good dinner and a decent value and great proximity to many theaters but not deserving of four stars which I reserve for fine dining.",0,0,0,S M.,"New Canaan, CT",0,184,0

We ordered drinks at the bar having to yell our drink orders to the harried bartender over people seated at the bar.  We kept having to apologize! 20 min later we were seated at a table in a crowded room far from relaxed. Four of us had the caesar salad with the pasta trio special. The Caesar had so little dressing on it and was impossible to flag down a waiter for more dressing. The pasta trio was very average. Celebrating a birthday we ordered a piece of cheesecake. Baked into the cake was a piece of black hair...sticking out of EACH  side of the slice!!!

They put a basket of bread, breadsticks, hummus and olives on the table as a complimentary starter.They have a great menu, but every time I usually do the table side unlimited pasta for $20.95. It's just too good to pass up. You start with either an antipasto or cesare salad then can have as much of the 3 homemade pastas they make that day. They are always changing however they usually always have a pasta in a tomato sauce as a staple. I have gotten Chicken Milanese (it's not on the menu) before that they've prepared for me. It was delicious! The wait staff is always very attentive and friendly. Definitely go here if you are in the area, you won't be disappointed!!",0,0,0,Jessica P.,"West Milford, NJ",0,16,6

We were in NYC on business and I realized when I got home (days later) that they charged us an extra bottle of wine.  I called the restaurant and Simon graciously took the extra bottle off of my tab.

1.0,2/26/2019,"・NO SHAREABLE OPTION FOR ENTREE (NOT FOR TINY STOMACH ADULTS & KIDS)・PRICE ISN'T MATCHING TO THEIR QUALITY OF FOOD/SERVICEThe waiter mistook my friend's wine order, the menu was totally unclear, and he didn't explain that they don't have shareable option for entree. Then what happened, we got over charged $26 as penalty for ordering additional side pasta because we were sharing the $25 entree. We didn't decide to share if we got the explanation from him at first. Now we were paying $26 for just a side pasta (Including questionable taste pesto, which we couldn't finish. Salad, chicken, pasta...the quality of food itself wasn't that we expected for this pricey restaurant like other people reviewed here). We would order $25 each entree if we knew it at the beginning.It was apparently his fault, but the most disgusting thing he did is, he put all his fault to amigos who were always taking care of us. He just obeyed this waiter. It was NOT amigo's fault. Explanation about the system & menu is the waiter's job. The waiter was just taking the order including mistaking the wine order.Very good to know that this is how you do the business.Broadway, tons of tourists who can't understand your insanely complicated menu (Not even English in some parts), very nice to scam money from the innocent people without feeling any guilty.Great job.

3.0,2/24/2019,"I came to Becco with my friend before a broadway show. We made a reservation for 4 pm and it was actually very crowded at that time. The menu doesn't have pasta options you can choose from. Instead, they make 3 pastas daily. You can choose to get unlimited pastas with salad for a certain price per person. They also have an option that you can add a midcourse of the pastas to any entree for an additional 9 dollars per person. My friend and I had the pastas as a mid course. To start, we shared the mussels. They were served in a white wine lemon sauce. The sauce was delicious. The pastas of the day were a buccatini in amatriciana sauce, artichoke ravioli, and pappardelle pesto. The pastas were good. My favorite was the buccatini. However, I don't like the way they were served. The severs walked around with plates of each pasta and served small portions of each one going from table to table. They served them all on the same plate, which wasn't ideal because all the sauces from each of the 3 pastas were mixing together. For my entree, I got the pork chop which was served with a variety of peppers. The pork chop was very dry and I was really disappointed. The service was attentive. However, I wasn't impressed with the food and I definitely will not return.",4,2,2,Jeanine Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",277,222,707

2.0,2/24/2019,"Disappointing and mediocre. The service gets a 3 but the food and value a 2. The antipasto misto was almost not edible--the skatefish was like something from a high school cafeteria, and the octopus was very tough. Of the three pastas of the day, only one, the spaghetti, stood out as being truly fresh (handmade) while the two others were forgettable. My wife's fish was better than what I chose for dinner, she had better things to say about it.The desert we chose was an apple strudel and it was not very tasty. The experience of dining felt incredibly crammed in with passable service, but with the prices a high as they are, the whole experience just didn't sell us. If you're seeing a Broadway show, I can see why this place would appeal because from the beginning they ask you what time is your show, and the mixed pasta selection is brainless to order, with quick turnaround. But for my wife and I who had already seen a show, totally different story--there's no need for us to ever come back here, and I don't think Lydia would eat here.",3,0,0,John L.,"Queens, NY",0,31,4
2.0,2/21/2019,"Arancini was very small portion. Personally didn't care for the smoked mozzarella flavor. Hangar steak is stated on the menu as served rare or medium rare, but it is grilled which gives it such a charred and burnt texture and taste. That is such a stupid thing to do because this dish could be absolutely delicious. The polenta, root veggies, and fried leeks are great. The dessert was ok, the fruit was fresh and tasty.

4.0,2/18/2019,"So, yesterday we went to see ""Waitress"" at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre and thoroughly enjoyed the show,  Since it was a matinee, we made reservations at Becco, about a block-and-a-half away.  We were a group of five.  Since we arrived early for the show and there was a long line for the parking lot across the street from the theatre, I decided to drive around and park at a lot close to the restaurant.  After the show, we made the short walk to the restaurant and arrived on time for our 5:00 reservation.  Although the restaurant was crowded with a line to get in, we were seated relatively quickly.  We were seated in the main floor dining room; however, with people holding the front doors open they let the cold in and it was quite chilly whenever the door was held open.  Our table was a regular-sized table with the side leaves open to make it a circular table, but it was still a bit cramped for five people.  Since Ceasar salad came with all entrees, most of us passed on an appetizer, but one of us had the rice ball appetizer which consisted of three golf-ball-size rice balls, without the traditional meat-peas-mozzarella stuffing.  These were just meh.  The Caesar salad was good, but I thought the dressing was a bit vinegary.  For the main course, I ordered the branzino which was nicely filleted with the skin removed which I liked.  This was the largest branzino I ever had and it was quite good, served with crispy potatoes and shredded leeks.  My wife had a bone-in veal cutlet parmigiana which was a bit chewy, but good.  My son had a pork chop which was undercooked and he was not happy with.  He informed the waiter who offered something else, but my son demurred.  His pork chop was later taken off the bill - nice touch.  The service was very good with our water glasses constantly being filled.  For dessert, my wife and I shared a chocolate mousse cake which was also good and I had what was probably the best tasting cappuccino I've ever had.  All in all, I would rate the restaurant as 4 out of 5 stars.",0,0,0,Bill S.,"Bayside, NY",21,13,2

1.0,2/10/2019,"This place was terrible... Shamefully terrible. We had the three pasta dinner. The Caesar salad was watery and not flavorful. The ""table side pasta service"" involved having a scoop of pre cooked pasta slopped unceremoniously onto our plates. The penne with vodka sauce was borderline okay, but the pasta was way over cooked. The pasta primavera was inedible... more of a weird ramen noodle stir fry than a pasta dish. The ravioli were clearly over cooked, mass produced freezer product. All three of these pastas that in no way worked together were heaped onto the same plate so that their sad watery flavors could all mingle and become even more tragic. We also ordered a bottle of wine from their 33 dollar wine list that was just not good. At all. The bottle we received was clearly something in the 3-5 dollar range. We thought that Joe from master chef wouldn't attach his name to something if it wasn't at least decent, but oh were we wrong. This place is a train wreck if you care about food.

I understand that it is a popular, busy place, but the tables are completely on top of each other. It's also an uncomfortable feeling when the hostess is circulating every two minutes keeping track of where you are in your meal on the iPad. While I praise their efficiency, it's not very comfortable for customers who are trying to enjoy their meal and not feel as though they are on the clock.

4.0,1/31/2019,"I wanted to check this place out since I heard they were on the list for restaurant week. I came here for dinner expecting Becco it to be a pasta filled Italian restaurant - well do not expect that! They have a lot of delicious options on the many, however, very few of them are pasta. I have never been to an Italian place that only has 3 pasta dishes on the menu. Regardless my experience was still good! I started off with a glass of sav blanc and some delicious bread box. Their bread they give you right as you sit at the table is AMAZE! The bread sticks were my personal favorite. The bread is served with olives and an olive oil tomato hummus that was TO DIE FOR. Upon realizing this Italian place did not offer many pasta dishes, I searched for seafood or poultry options. I decided to go with the lamb for my meal. I also ordered the breaded shrimp with the spicy marinara sauce. I hate when restaurants list items as ""spicy"" and then when you eat it, it turns out to not be spicy at all - well this sauce was a pleasant surprise because it actually had a bit of a kick to it and it paired perfectly with the filet shrimp.

1.0,1/27/2019,"So disappointed. Made reservations over a month ago... it was my daughter's birthday and we were planning to come into the city for the Harry Potter play. The play is in two parts so features a two hour dinner break. We had 5:15 reservations and arrived at 5:10. After waiting for 10 minutes - which was fine- we were walked to a table that was literally touching the tables on either side of it. If someone needed to use the restroom, they had to move their entire table over to create a 4"" passing area. I have never seen anything like it! I asked for another table, but was told that the other tables had less room ( I'm not sure how that's possible - but the hostess seemed honest enough). It was too late into our dinner break to find a table elsewhere, so we sat down. Service was fine, but drinks came out very slowly - I was still waiting for my Diet Coke ( that I had ordered 10 minutes earlier) to come out as I was ordering my coffee for dessert. The special three pasta plate was fast - as promised- but the flavors were undeveloped and one of the pastas was slightly over cooked.  My daughter enjoyed the gelato, but my biscotti were slightly stale and sloppily presented. TLDR: This restaurant is in a volume mode. Quality and experience are not being offered. Quite possibly a hazardous place to be in a fire.

2.0,1/26/2019,"First thing to note is that this is probably not the best place for vegetarians. Usually, an Italian restaurant has plenty of options for vegetarians but my experience here was simply not good. The entree list is actually pretty long and extensive. Unfortunately not a single dish was vegetarian friendly. So, I looked for the pasta page and...well...there isn't one. Here's the thing. They DO have an unlimited pasta thingy where they just keep coming to your table with a large pan of pasta that they serve everyone. That's pretty much your option. There was a pesto pasta that was pretty basic and then there was spaghetti and marinara sauce. Also about as basic as it can get. It comes with a Caesar salad but since that has anchovies, what they bring you is a plate of chopped up romaine lettuce with a bottle of balsamic and a bottle of olive oil.  I mean, not even croutons or cheese. Literally just a plate of lettuce. But, aside from the not-so-vegetarian friendly aspect, let's talk about the pasta. They were serving 3 different pastas the night I went. A server comes out with a large pan of pasta and makes his way around to all of the tables and serves the pasta. Then they come with the next pan of a different pasta and plop that on your plate right next to the one you just got. Finally, they come around with the third pan of pasta and plop that one right next to the other 2 on your plate. I kinda felt like I was at Olive Garden or something similar where there really wasn't much attention to detail and for a place that appears to be somewhat classy, the three pastas just swimming around on the same plate and the unlimited pasta that they keep bringing out really made it seem like an Italian buffet type place.So, all in all, just not what I would expect from this level of establishment.",0,0,1,Rich H.,"New York, NY",137,228,120

For example, tonight my mom and I were finishing our meals and a busser came by and asked if we were finished. I said I was but my mom vacillated for a second and said that she was, but as she was responding he turned and walked away without taking my plate, even. It was weird. The Caesar salads are okay; I think the dressing is made in house but otherwise they're just okay. We also ordered the apple strudel for dessert, and it was dense, not flaky at all, with more of an apple sauce texture inside.

Let me preface by saying we were a group of 9. 7 adults, a one-year-old and a 5-year-old. Both children were extremely well behaved throughout. Yes, crumbs were left on the floor. Sorry. When we arrived (1:00) a table was ready for us. we were told to place the high chair anywhere. After literally moving the table ourselves, we set the children up and sat. The waiter then told us, the children would be in harm's way. We once again moved the table and high chair,  No assistance was offered in this very difficult maneuver. You see, tables are set in a very tight sardine can! We did make it clear to the waiter that we were not there pre-theater. Orders were rushed in. I requested a drink, which eventually came with appetizers.  Now, I feel I can't blame waiters. They almost seem programmed to work the pre-theater crowd! Odd thing is, we had a huge gap between apps and main course (our forgotten time) .At one point, a guest at our table spilled water. Several servers saw it. At no point did anyone come over to assist. LOL Good thing we aren't the needy type. We move tables AND clean them!Also, be aware of where you sit. I'm 95 lbs so I can sit pretty close to the table. However, because I was in the main aisle for servers and patrons, everytime someone walked through, I was jolted. Weigh it out. Probably a great place for pretheater and programmed waiters.

When we asked a waiter if there were any nuts in the bread basket, he said that there were nuts in the breadsticks. When we asked another waiter, he said that there were no nuts in the bread basket.

3.0,12/25/2018,"My family had dinner at Becco yesterday evening. We eat there quite regularly and I must say, last night I was extremely disappointed with the service. We had an 8:45 reservation and were seated 30 minutes later. This was an unreasonable delay. They were hardly apologetic. What is the point of having a reservation if they don't seat you then? When we were finally seated, our party of six was brought to a table upstairs in the small room facing the windows. This table was not meant to seat six people. We were extremely cramped and I was asked to get up from my seat so that the waiter could serve pasta to the table next to us. Eventually they figured out a solution so that I wouldn't have to get up every time they wanted to serve that table. Thank goodness! Now onto the food. The food at Becco is always very good and last night was no different. When you sit down they bring delicious bread with bean dip and olives. We then had Caesar salads (they come with each entree) and they were delicious! They added kale to the salad, a nice addition.Aperol spritz ($14)- this drink was refreshing. One of my favorites! Chicken Parmesan ($26)- a thin chicken breast prepared well, lightly breaded and topped with tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella cheese and basil. Trio of pastas ($26)- last night the offerings were rigatoni ala vodka with shrimp, mushroom ravioli with truffles and spaghetti primavera. The rigatoni and ravioli were very tasty! I wasn't so fond of the spaghetti but there was plenty of food.Pesce Spada ($26)- the swordfish was lightly breaded and served with spaghetti squash. The fish was delicious. Dessert sampler ($7.50 per person)- this came with bread pudding, chocolate cake, ricotta cheesecake and panna cotta. All were good!Even though the service that we received last night was substandard and unacceptable, we will likely return to Becco since the food is so good.

He had the Peperoni ripieni which he said were good, not amazing. I had the unlimited pasta trio with the antipasto misto which I thought was just food not great. The 3 pastas were spaghetti, pasta primavera and a veal lasagna. I personally found all the 3 pasta ok/good but nothing special, very basic.For the price it's not bad and worth it.

When we arrived at the restaurant, we were herded like cattle into a very tight area. Totally understandable. unfortunately the evening went downhill from there. We were seated at a table right next to where the busboys and waiters stand and throw the plates, silverware, stock the bread etc. it was ridiculously noisy, besides the throwing of the silverware and dishes, the backdrop of the staffs conversation and arguments did not add to the ambience of the evening. Now to the service and food. Service non-existent. Even though we were surrounded by staff they did not acknowledge our existence. The table of 6 across from us couldn't take it anymore and left. We should have taken our cue. When our food arrived, no one checked on how it was. We ate because we were starving even though we tried to get people's attention. It took me 15 minutes to get a refill of my water. Bottom line , 3 of our party had steak, 1 cold, 1 not cooked the way requested. When Mgr finally asked how was our dinner, my husband told him, and basically he just walked away, not offering any remedy. Our waiter was of no assistance at all. I had the special, which was tasteless and way over priced. This is a tourist trap, I would never eat here again. Olive Garden is probably better option.

The restaurant is very limited in space, while waiting for the 10 extra minutes we we're told to wait up against the bar, being bumped up against as tables were leaving. The seat we were provided was on top of the servers station. The entire meal all we heard were dishes clanking. The table across from us left from the poor service and noice! The service we received was also not great. Our server was not attentive, when a guest has to continuously ask for more water/wine/bread these to me are basic essential meal components, there is a problem.  I had asked for more of the spread for the bread since there were 5 of us and clearly portions were not accommodated for more than 3. We never got more spread I asked 3 different times! The bread station is next to our table!!! This restaurant has employees that are dedicated for these specific tasks. We got to hear/see the busers being reprimand in front of us. I'm here to relax and enjoy dinner not hear employee work matters! I ended up feeling sorry for the bus boy who was yelled at. My Salmon was delicious. However my portion was not to par in comparison to the rest of my family's plates. One of the steak entrees at my table was over cooked, another was cold, out of three steak dishes all being the same not sure how either of these  issues happened, but yet they both did. Our server did not check on our entree until 10 minutes in. How does that help? The over cooked steak should have been corrected, yet it was not because he almost finished his meal before our sever came back. It was not even the sever who checked it was one of the managers, he just said sorry. How does sorry undo a $30 mistake?! The 5th dish was veal, and thought it was uneventful, not flavorful.

It started off when we were sat down at our table, we ordered drinks and then we never saw the waiter again... 30 minutes went by so we asked for the manager, he offered to take our order - however, since we apparently never had any wait staff assigned to our table, we didn't know any of the specials or even what the pasta courses were for the night. We waited about 2 hours total for our food.  When it finally came, the pasta courses changed... that would have been fine if someone had communicated that with us. Because unfortunately I ended up being allergic to the food that was plopped on my plate.  In addition, the food was all freezing cold (probably because we didn't have a waiter assigned to bring out our food). At this point, all my family wanted to do was leave - so we asked for the check. DOUBLE CHECK YOUR BILL because they tried to charge us multiple times for things that we never ordered / food that was never served to us. Overall, I am never going here again.  If you ask for any help from the wait staff or managers they will roll their eyes and tell you they do not have time for you.

We dipped the breadsticks in the provided bean dip/hummus which had a nice flavor. The focaccia was slightly chewy but still decent, the other bread was downright tough bordering on stale.  Our three pastas were a cocoa pumpkin ravioli which was rich but good, a penne with vodka sauce and shrimp , and a taglialini with broccoli, oil, and garlic.  All the pastas were cooked perfectly al dente. We liked all 3, but the best was definitely the penne with vodka sauce. We got a strawberry tiramisu for dessert, which was very light and fresh.

After tasting the  undercooked pasta be glad that it is not an option. I went with the grilled calamari special that was under seasoned. I decided to go with the rib special that should have been named fatty meat special. The good news was that the serving was small.

The calamari was to die for, and I was pleasantly surprised by the asparagus with mustard sauce.The experience went downhill from there. We got the unlimited pasta option and instead of being served plates of pasta, the waiters walked around with pans and ladeled however much you wanted onto your plate. That made the experience seem more personal and homey. However, the seasonal pastas were subpar. I could barely stomach the penne with beef, as the taste was bland. The butternut squash ravioli was interesting and slightly sweet but too dry and al dente for my liking. The only tolerable pasta was the spaghetti with tomato sauce.

We arrived at the restaurant at 6:20PM. The Hostess checked us in,confirmed that we had 8:00PM show tickets and told us to wait in the bar room .""it will be just a few minutes"". So we proceed to go to bar room which is packed. People are at the bar, at tables, standing,coming in, trying to leave, waiters are trying to walk through and hostesses are calling names. At one point i started to panic because there was no room to move and i am claustrophobic. Definitely a fire hazard we finally stood by the hostess. They finally called our name at 6:50PM. We followed the hostess around and then upstairs to our table. She confirmed that we had show tickets. We then sat and waited for 10 min. Without anyone coming over to us. We finally saw a wait person at a table near us(they were seated after us and also had theater tickets) and told him that we also have show tickets. He asked if anyone came and told us the specials. We said no. No one has come to us at all. He proceeded to tell us the specials and took our drink order. The waiter then came over .we explained that we were gf and he told us what we could order. I ordered the hangar steak and my husband ordered the pork chop. The waiter came  back and told us that the pork chop would take 35 minutes so my husband changed his order to the swordfish. We got our bottle of wine which was very good and sat and waited. It was not very relaxing as i kept looking at my watch. Our food finally came at 7:35pm (remember, we had 8:00 show tickets). The food was very good but we had to eat and get the check. There was no time for coffee or dessert. When i made the reservation i told them that it was my husband's birthday. We paid the check, walked to the show and sat  as the lights went dark and the show started. Not a minute to spare!. I would NOT recommend this restaurant. I wanted a nice relaxing meal instead i got a rushed, nervous and unenjoyable meal. They could not handle the amount of people. It is like a factory.  There are hundreds of other restaurants to choose from where you can have a nice meal and still get out in plenty of time to make your show.

The restaurant was filled with tourists and was extremely loud. We ordered the pear salad and the arancini, along with a glass of wine and a seasonal spritzer. Salad was good, great Gorgonzola but the arancini was essentially like cornbread and cheese in a ball with canned tomato sauce. Terrible. We wanted pasta but your only option to have pasta was to order an entree then add pasta for an additional charge. We had drinks and our salad (sent the arancini back) and left. Staff were very accommodating, but the food is no where near authentic Italian cuisine. Extremely disappointed. If you're a tourist, please try something else in the area.

It is a great mixture of boujee, local, fancy, and casual all at the same time. This is not the kind of place where you need to be in a sport coat and wing tips to get in, but you won't be out of place if you are all dressed up before a night out on the town. I was in town for the NYC marathon, so I was dressed very casually and it was not an issue.Being that I sat at the bar for dinner, there was no wait, but there was a line for tables, and they were booked solid for the night. It is by no means a large place, and you could very easily walk right past if you did not know it was there, much like many of the small restaurants in the area.The bar had a solid selection of alcohols at the standard Manhattan markup. I think an whiskey old fashioned made with Bulleit was around $15. The drink was strong and made well.For dinner I went with the pasta sampler. It same with a penne in vodka sauce with shrimp, a pumpkin ravioli, and noodles in red sauce. I had the meatball appetizer to start in order to incorporate a little more protein into the dinner. The meatballs are served on a plate with marinara. You get three large meatballs cooked to perfection. Once you are ready, the pasta starts coming around and will not stop until you are done. Everything was prepared well and tasted great. I was not a fan of the pumpkin ravioli, but that is mostly because I don't really dig on pumpkin too much. Service was solid, prices were as to be expected, and the food was prepared well.If you want to try a fun little place in the Hell's Kitchen area of Manhattan, check out Becco.

Although we were served very quickly, the waiter did not come back over to our table to check on us for the entire meal, and only did so after being called over by my friend.

I would prefer being able to choose a pasta of my liking from the menu, rather than having to rely on the pastas of the day. However, the $31 bottles of wine and flavor in the dishes redeemed the constraints on the Becco menu. Not to mention the atmosphere.

They start you off with a great bread basket complete with olive oil, hummus, olives and these delicious rosemary breadsticks. There's also a ""Wines for $31"" section that allows you to try something different without breaking the bank. I always go for the chicken parm special. It's a huge hammered flat chicken cutlet covered with mozzarella and red sauce. They also give you a Caesar salad to start off with any entree, so you are not left feeling hungry.

5.0,11/4/2018,"I'm a huge fan.  As an  out-of-towner, I rarely re-visit a place I've eaten at on a prior trip because there's so many fantastic restaurants to try.  I made an exception for Becco.  On my first visit to Becco, I visited days after Superstorm Sandy, when few restaurants in the area were open. I had a magical experience that first visit and this sequel was no let-down. The restaurant is divided into rooms and I find that the deeper you are in the restaurant it becomes more romantic and intimate. This time we ate in the front of the restaurant, which was fine, if a bit loud and lacking the spark that permeates the other rooms. Service was attentive, knowledgeable and lacking any chip on the shoulder. The server deserved high praise.The one problem at Becco is the menu has too many things I lust after. The ""Joe's"" veal chop measured up to its description and hype.  It was an outstanding, thickly-cut veal chop atop garlic mashed potatoes and a balsamic reduction/sauce. The chop was cooked to a perfect temperature and was so well seasoned, it could have stood apart from the balsamic, but offer me balsamic and I'm dragging my napkin through it to sponge it up. This dish had no flaws. My son's hanger steak was a huge success.  You would have thought you were eating a filet.  The steak was again cooked to perfection and seasoned well.  They cut the hanger so expertly, you had to wonder if it really was a hanger steak.  The striped bass was a special on the night and it was indeed special. It was melt in your mouth cooked over an intimidated pea puree, perhaps the only tiny down note on the night.  I love pea purees and this one was fine, but it disappeared next to the fish. The bass was soft, moist and wonderfully paired with an assertive mix of spices.I haven't even mentioned the house specialty, the trio of pastas on the night. I wish there were either more daily pasta choices on the menu or among the three offered each night. The spaghetti pomodoro was, as you would expect, excellent. While I prefer Scott Conant's interpretation, this is not far off, perhaps just lacking in the mouth feel of the fresh pasta. I broke my diet for a few bites of the chocolate mousse cake which was exquisite and well-received by my picky eating family. The wine and cocktail menus are well thought out and carry something for every one. Here's the real shocker about Becco: it's reasonably priced. If you eat in Manhattan you know to expect sticker shock, but that's not the case at Becco.  Thank you Bastianich Family for growing, evolving and sticking to the standards for quality and service you developed.",0,0,0,rhett t.,"Miami-Dade, FL",0,68,0

We were a group of five fighting on where to go and stumbled upon ""Italian"" as our choice. The time was now 10:35 at night. Being in the city that never sleeps, we thought we could get food a bit later. The atmosphere was that of a authentic Italian restaurant, somewhat kitchy. The restaurant was mostly full at this time. Once our waiter arrived at our table he made sure to let us know that the kitchen closes at 11. We did feel a bit rushed. We ordered 2 bottle of wine and his recommendations we spot on to what we were looking for. The wine was very reasonably priced. I went with the Pasta Trio served table side. There was a lot of pasta as you can expect, which was also delicious. Everyone ordered something different at our table, from lamb, lobster and pork. Everyone left feeling satisfied and full. We were offered dessert and dinner cocktails we declined and ask for the check. The bill was not bad for 5 meals and 2 bottles of wine, 1 bottle of sparkling water for the table. We were pleasantly surprised.I would recommend Becco for anyone looking for Authentic Italian food in NYC near midtown.

2.0,10/1/2018,"I was crushed and so very sad leaving. I have Lidia's cook books, Love watching Joe on MasterChef, we knew this time in NY we were going to try Becco and see how Italian was supposed to taste. This was our hopes, reality kicked us in the butt!Made a 3:45 reservation so we could eat then get on the road to head home. We arrived 10 min early but it didn't seem like the hostess had a table assigned and just picked one. There were only two other diners in the front dining room. We were sat along the isle next to a door. Didn't know where this door went but we ended up finding out the entire time we were there. Our first waiter got us drinks and told us some specials, don't know how he remembered them all. Never heard a special list so long. He then comes back with another waitress saying that he is heading home and she will be our server. Ok, it was 10 min, didn't they know this before? We gave our orders and the bread service comes. This was actually very good. The bread, while who knows how fresh it is because they are pre-made into boxes and stuck in a cabinet, was still very tasty. Ok didn't know about where they kept the bread but I saw that when I went to the rest room. My wife and I were both having a Caesar, mine as part of the pasta meal and her as a side. Everything comes as a fancy large portion and served table side. Good idea but poor execution. My favorite thing about a Caesar salad are the wonderful croutons. Well the guy that served us must have pushed all on the one plate and none on the other. Had it not been my wife that I could say, well were married so I get half your croutons, I would have been out of luck. Oh and that door. during bread service and salads that door was a non stop flow from the basement to the kitchen. Seriously like a clown car, where did all these people come from. Not my idea of good decor to be looking at dirty basement steps the whole time I sit there. Now the pasta's, this is where I was kind of expecting to be wowed. I got the pasta trio served table side. Impressive way to serve. Three waiters come to the table with heaping piles of pasta to serve. Now having worked a long time in restaurants myself I have to wonder, they dont make that pile for just one person, is it taken back, sitting around till the next person gets it? Oh well, that was just a thought. The short rib penne was outstanding! plenty of short rib, sauce was perfect, just a great dish. The veggie cannelloni, also a great dish. What I was surprised about is the Spaghetti. was not good at all. Yea it looked home made, but was not done. Would not twirl onto a fork and the sauce was just bland. Only pasta left on the plate.. I know I got long winded but I have to talk about that door! Here is my biggest complaint and why I really wanted to give this 1 star but my love of the books and Joe just wouldn't let me do it. So the door. That door never shut. it must have been during prep. maybe they keep food down there, they defiantly keep tables. They must have been setting up for something big. as our entrees were served we did not get the pleasure of looking at our plate with joyousness anticipation. No we watched 2-3 guys wrestle 8-9 foot tables out ""THE DOOR"" being as long as they were, they of course did not fit easily.  The results a whole lot of banging and a lot of shuffling around. My friend had to push his chair in a few times, he says he would rather be safe than get whacked in the head with a table at dinner. Just when they finally get the thing out and we start eating, here comes another one! It distracted us so much that we all said, well that was a waste of a meal. My #1 question? If there are only 3 tables at the time and at most during our meal 5 tables in the dining room. Why would you seat a party right next to the busiest door in the restaurant?",5,2,3,Mitch T.,"Lancaster, PA",485,132,49

If you're going with folks who are going to the theater it's probably OK.

Everyone enjoyed their entrees. The only disappointment was the desserts. We ordered the Strudel di Mele, Panna Cotta, and Biscotti per due and they were very ordinary.Overall a great reasonably priced for NYC restaurant with good service, meals and drinks.

4.0,9/23/2018,"Wow, this was a solid 4 star dining experience. If I lived nearby I would be dining regularly as the prices are reasonable and the food is delicious. We tried the Zuppa di Pesce Misto which is described as a sautéed day-boat seafood in ""lobster brodo"" served on a bed of soft, white polenta. This dish was only $26 and delectable. My husband ordered the unlimited pasta dishes and I tried a few bites of each of those as well. All three were delicious, and by no means ""olive garden pastas"" as another reviewer wrote. Our server was curious when we finished which dish we preferred and neither the seafood nor the pastas fell short. We loved all the food. The wines from their $31 list are exceptional and our waiter knew exactly what we should order based on the style of white we were looking for. Service is above and beyond. Only reason they don't get a 5th star is due to the close proximity of the tables. Now I knew this having read reviews ahead of time, so was not surprised and by the end of the evening we felt like we were best friends with the couples on either side of us. By the way, they were locals so that shows you it's not just tourists visiting Becco.

5.0,9/22/2018,"This is my go-to spot in the theater district. It's very popular and hours are tight if you have a show time, so make reservations!! But if the wait staff are aware of a time restriction they will move things along. I highly recommend the prix fixe pasta flight, about $20 for lunch or $25 for dinner and you can indulge in unlimited Caesar salad (I don't eat it but my husband and friends love it) and then 3 rotating and also unlimited pasta dishes. The wait staff start you off with a generous tasting of all 3 daily offerings, and then return to your table as many times as you want to refill your dish (so if there's one particular choice you prefer, you can keep getting more of just that one, or you can keep refilling all 3, or any combination you want!). They are not stingy or slow with the refills, either. They have appetizer and a dessert ""sampler"" options as well. You also have the option of ordering another entree (lots of other great classic Italian options on the menu) and for about $9 add on a mid-course of the pasta trio.

5.0,9/11/2018,"This is kind of a find of the century and I can't even take credit for it. This past weekend we were celebrating my friend's birthday belatedly and in efforts I scoured yelp trying to find a place she hasn't ever been to before. Which is honestly incredibly hard because she does that food blogging/instagram stuff so she's been literally everywhere. This popped up when searching around for a happy medium of Manhattan for people transportation wise. I remembered someone I briefly dated had raved and raved about the place. Surprisingly, I remember minor details and things like this people mumble years later. Hello, Becco!For only $24.95 (19.95 during lunch hours) you can get their Sinfonia di Paste! What does that mean, Ingrid? Please, pray tell. Okay! It means three types of pasta, fresh and handmade, rolled, boiled etc, different sauces, different styles - UNLIMITED. What? Yeah, you heard me. UNLIMITED. They don't even guilt trip you if you asked for that truffle mushroom ravioli like five times. Waiters just keep rolling by with giant pans of pasta and are like 'Who wants some sup?' I was genuinely impressed with the quality and how well everything was cooked. You even get started with the choice of a caesar salad or antipasto. I went with the later because it sounded more exotic. It involved a lot of pickled vegetables, squash, mozz, sundried tomatoes, olives, a bit of squid, some kind of random breaded chicken, more vegetables, honey ricotta. Just the weirdest but most delicious hodgepodge of treats. Actually, I forgot to mention another exciting part. They start you off with their breadbasket and breadsticks but they place a well of olive oil mixed with some kind of tahini like hummus on the table. All restaurants should follow this place's lead. Screw butter. Bring on the oil and hummus. The pasta we were treated with was a spicy tomato sauce wider and longer than normal farfalle, a truffle mushroom ravioli, and a white clam sauce linguini. They change up the variety every day so that nothing here stays the same and rotate some of their pasta options around. Hard to pick a favorite. The wine is also only $31 a bottle, for pretty much every bottle, and they have a pretty wide selection. If you go all in you're basically paying for like 3 meals at once kind of experience and that's great considering the price-tag is pretty much what you would pay for a small portion of pasta at an expensive Italian restaurant these days.",4,3,3,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",843,1384,11457
4.0,9/10/2018,"Becco has been sitting in my bookmarks for a long time. I don't remember the circumstances surrounding it landing there, probably because it was an Italian restaurant and it had a high number of reviews. Anyway, one of my colleagues who lives in the midwest was visiting and wanted to meet up for dinner. Seeing that he had never been to NYC before and we only had a few hours, I figured I would show him midtown and grab some dinner here. You might think I was living under a rock, but I only recently learned that Becco is owned by Lidia Bastianich. I'm a fan of other Bastianich endeavors like Eataly, so I was looking forward to seeing what Becco had to offer. Located on Restaurant Row in the Theater District, the restaurant has a very midtown sense in that it's quite spacious inside. In addition to the front dining area upon entrance, there's a bar area and another dining room in the back; I also heard they have upstairs seating. The decor is simple and classic - white table cloths, Earth tones, etc - nothing too funky or out of the ordinary. Becco is best known for their unlimited pasta; I wasn't necessarily looking for unlimited carbs but I really wanted to see what the fuss was about and kept that in the back of my mind while skimming the menu. The bread basket that started contained a variety of options - my favorite being the thin crispy breadsticks; they also served a white bean dip with the bread that was quite tasty. For my starter I had the caprese salad; this was good, the mozz was fresh and the tomatoes were beefy. Unlimited pasta aside, they have a nice variety of mains. What's nice about the mains are that they're served with Caesar salad *plus* you have the option to add the house pastas on as a side/mid-course. I saw this as the perfect opportunity to try the pasta without going overboard, so I decided to choose the swordfish as my main and add on the pastas (I opted out of the Caesar salad since I felt it would be too much). The swordfish was good, it wasn't too thick and the sweet corn relish it came with had a lot of flavor. They make three styles of pasta daily, and you get all three when you choose the option. When we served spaghetti marinara, a seasoned ravioli-type with a butter sauce, and a cavatappi with a bolognese-type sauce. All the pastas were tasty; I prefer mine to be al dente (these were all little too soft for me), but they're being made for the masses and served family style to everyone so they're partially forgiven. Service was good; everyone was friendly with the entire meal running pretty smooth. Overall, Becco serves solid Italian food. In hindsight, I wouldn't order pasta with a main, I would go either/or because it was just too much food for me; I was BUSTIN. I can imagine they see a large number of tourists, and while that isn't really my scene I need to give credit where credit is due. I would definitely be more apt to try other Italian eateries in Manhattan before coming back to Becco, but I would also recommend this to anyone who is in midtown looking for a good meal.",12,5,9,Jason M.,"Bronx, NY",474,719,3173
2.0,9/9/2018,"Unfortunately, another tricked-up restaurant that appeals to the ""all you can eat"" pasta crowd. If you're Italian you'll be disappointed, especially if you expected a fine dining experience because of it's affiliation with Lidia Bastianich who initiated that three pasta routine in her Kansas City restaurant years ago. If you're a tourist you may be impressed by a lot of food for not much money. The prices are modest but who cares? I'd prefer to pay $18 for a glass of wine rather than $12 if the wine, in this case a Sangiovese, is close to undrinkable. The tonna vitello was acceptable but no more than that (try it at Paola's on Madison Ave. to see how it's done), but the pastas were a disappointment.

3.0,9/8/2018,"Heard great things about this restaurant from a friend who went last year, but our experience was anything but great.  We were visiting from out of town, and wanted a good, casual Italian dinner. We were celebrating our anniversary, and noted this when making an online reservation. We were given a small 2-top upstairs, wedged in the corner, which was not a good start. Oddly, nobody from the hostess to the server, to any other staff acknowledge our anniversary. The kicker is that we received our bill at the end, and it had a typed note referring to our anniversary on the reservation notes. It wasn't wishing us a happy anniversary, but simply an internal note.Yet the real reason we are disappointed, was the food and the service. Because we did not order alcohol, and there were only 2 people at the table, our server quickly gave his full attention to the larger tables in the area. He was not attentive at all, especially when we ordered the pan-served pasta, which was a great, fun way to be served, except for the small fact that nobody ever came back to check on us. We really enjoyed the creative way the pastas were prepared and served, but we thought it definitely could use more flavor, as well as the caesar salad.

3.0,9/2/2018,"Despite having a reservation, our party of two was seated in the back of the restaurant in some auxiliary dining room which was brightly lit and made it feel more like sitting in the kitchen. My dining partner chose the fixed price unlimited pasta menu. For starters you get a Caesar salad or antipasto. Antipasto consisted of 8 or 9 different bites ranging from octopus, spaghetti squash and a sun dried tomato, etc. Separately, they tasted good, but, not well thought out. It didn't seem to go on the plate together. Everything seemed like an afterthought. Caesar salad came with all entrees. Nothing to write home about--tasted like a mayonnaise dressing with a very slight taste of anchovy.The three unlimited pastas were practically thrown on the plate and the waiter/servers never changed my husband's plate. So a plop of tomato basil farfalle would be swimming in a puddle of previously served mushroom ravioli.I ordered Zuppe de Pesce served over light fluffy polenta. The scallops were plump and tasty, however the shrimp and salmon seemed dry due to the lack of ""zuppe"" in my dish, not much broth.On the positive side, the prices were reasonable considering the location.

The swordfish was nicely sized, it was three small pieces of swordfish surrounded by a corn tomato and mushroom salad. What really filled me up though was the calamari.

Fast, read the specials list, and frequent check-ins to see if things were OK.  One recommendation would be a nice leaflet or page with the specials listed on it... hard to memorize the 8 different specials so I opted to stick to what was on the menu.The bread was eh, and the prosciutto and cheese app didn't satisfy.  Way too fatty and bland prosciutto instead of the salty meat we know and love... and the cheese were lil niblets... tasty, but lil.My lemon chicken came on a bed of spinach and I felt like I cooked it myself at home.  There wasn't anything (other than the single caper berry, yes 1) that made it taste any different from a sauteed breast with spinach I'd make on a lazy weekday night.  It also left me wanting a starch.  Slap a single fingerling potato on my plate next time and I'll consider upping this review a star.My friend got overcooked salmon that he picked apart on his plate and didn't finish... yikes!The people around our table were getting 3rd and 4th helpings of bottomless pasta so maybe that's what you come to Becco for?  Toss in some breadsticks and rename it Becco Garden (when you're here your family)?Next time I'll throw on some elastic waistband sweatpants and hunker down for 6k calories of pasta and finally leave satisfied.  Just sad my friend and I dropped serious $ on regular dishes and were left with an ""eh"" experience.",0,0,0,Anthony R.,"Boston, MA",21,50,2

Entrees come with a free caesar salad, and complimentary olives and white bean puree with a variety of breads. I got the meatball appetizer which came as 3 two-inch diameter meatballs, and the double-thick pork chop (which was about 12 oz) with peppers, that was very flavorful. My wife got the salmon entree, which was prepared perfectly but plainly flavored, and the mozzarella appetizer. Peppers were great but the mozzarella was ordinary. Overall, the food was good (much better than any chain) but nothing out of this world - lacked wow factor. The waiter and service were excellent. They will ask you if you have theater (Broadway) reservation.

5.0,8/6/2018,"As someone who used to watch Lidias show I was extremely excited to try Becco. I should mention I consider myself an authority on great pasta. The wait staff was very accommodating and the atmosphere is typical of a high end Italian restaurant. We started with a bottle of wine. All of the wine was $31. We let our server pick the wine for us after describing what we liked in a red. The Zizzolo bottle he chose for us was absolutely perfect. He was very knowledgeable of the menu, the many specials and their prices. We then got an order of meatballs which were a great start for us to pick on. 3 very big meatballs for $9 is very fair. Despite the food quality being so good, the $25 unlimited pasta is an incredible deal especially in Manhattan. The antipasta that comes with the pasta meal was generous and varied. My favorite was the octopus salad. The featured pastas of the day were the artichoke ravioli, shrimp penne Alla vodka and spaghetti primavera. All three were delicious and I made sure I had room for seconds. The servers are constantly moving around the restaurant asking if we would like to refill or pasta dishes. I personally enjoyed the artichoke raviolis the most but the shrimp penne Alla vodka is a close second. Obviously I would love to come back and try their pastas in the future.",3,0,0,Luke M.,"Greenlawn, NY",3,53,8

One of our party asked if they had veal cutlet alla milanese, and was told yes, but what came was a breaded veal chop. Another person ordered polenta with prosciutto. The prosciutto tasted like a very tough and very salty bacon, and the polenta was tasteless.  I ordered vitello tonnato-- also salty and tasteless.

4.0,7/26/2018,"I had been wanting to try this Restaurant Row estabilshment for awhile now and finally had the chance. The interior is refined and elegant, with nice lighting, white table cloths and wood accents. My friend and both participated in the Sinfonia Di Paste, which includes salad or antipasto and unlimited table side service of the 3 pastas of the day... All for only $25.We were first served complimentary bread box with bread sticks, focaccia and multigrain bread. My favorite type of bread were the bread sticks. They were so addicting with a satisfying crunch and tons of yummy seasoning. I loved it so much that I even took some home with me. The bread came with hummus like dip swimming in olive oil. There were also several types of olives, which I did not try. I had the antipasto misto, consisting of a wide assortment of marinated and grilled vegetables, along with some seafood. There were zucchini, green beans, carrots, mushroom, tomato, chickpeas, and fava beans all of which tasted fresh. However, there was a bit too much oily sauce on the plate. There was also lightly breaded fish which was tender and flavorful. In addition, there was a small salad consisting of pieces of grilled octopus, potatoes and onion which was pretty good. I enjoyed the savory sauce that accompanied it. After we finished the first course, servers came around with the pastas of the day. All the pastas were cooked perfectly al dente. My favorite was the fusilli with green peas, onion, tomatoes and ground beef. It was packed with flavor and the meat was soo tasty. I also liked the mushroom and ricotta ravioli with a delightfully light sauce. The last type of pasta was generic spaghetti with tomato sauce which was basic and not that impressive. My friend and I decided to share dessert and we selected the Torte di Zabaglione e Cioccolato, which is chocolate mousse cake with Amarena cherries and chocolate. It was absolutely delectable: Rich, incredibly smooth, velvety and creamy mousse with strong taste of chocolate. The cherries and syrup added a sugary, deeper and more intense level of deliciousness to the cake. The service was wonderful and the servers came by frequently to see if we needed a refill of water or pasta. I would certainly return if I am craving pasta and also to try the dessert sampler. It features 4 different types of dessert for $7.50 per person, which I think is a pretty good deal. If I had noticed it on my initial visit, I would have ordered that.",13,8,11,Kathy X.,"Queens, NY",783,438,5876

Let me start out by saying I am not a big fan of Italian food or pasta, so I honestly wasn't expecting much or looking forward to eating here.We arrived right when it opened for lunch and were seated. I ordered the Antipasto Misto to begin and enjoyed it. It was a good portion of food and everything had great flavor. We all ordered the Sinfonia Di Paste, which is an unlimited amount of three special pasta dishes the restaurant offered that day. It included a goat cheese and truffle ravioli, veal fettuccine, and another pasta with red sauce. Not being a pasta person, I thought I was going to have a few bites and call it a day. Trust me when I say I ate until I could have exploded. Everything was excellent! My favorite had to be the goat cheese and truffle ravioli. It was phenomenal!The only reason I'm not giving Becco 5 stars is because we had to wait a long time for the pastas to come out and the service wasn't the best.

The anti pasta that came with the pasta trio was filled with a wonderful variety of deliciousness!The pastas were excellent, the service sucked.At any given time there were at least 6-8 waitstaff around the bar waiting for something to do.

Two of us wanted another try to the pasta they liked the best out of the three and told each person trying to clear the plates we were waiting for more pasta.And NOTHING came.

It did take a while to get sat even though we had a reservation but once we were brought to our table the service was excellent the whole night. Our waiter let us know that they had a special group menu for larger groups. It was $45 I believe for an antipasto spread with salad, unlimited pasta course, 3 mains, and dessert. The mains were swordfish, chicken parm, and steak. All of it was unlimited. The only downside is the whole table has to participate but luckily they were understanding we had a vegetarian in our party and allowed her to just get the standard unlimited pasta deal. The antipasto selection was pretty large. Personally I went for lots of the octopus with onions. There was some fish thing I was unfamiliar with and a selection of grilled vegetables and other odds and ends. The salad was good as well. The 3 pastas of the day were enjoyable. There was one with crab, some mushroom truffle ravioli, and a vegetarian pasta with red sauce. The one with crab could have definitely used some more crab but that's expected. Overall all of them were pretty good. The mains were delicious. The swordfish was on a bed of greens with bacon. It tasted fresh and was well grilled. The chicken parm was tasty as well. It was the size of a plate and very thing. Certain pieces seemed to have some large salt crystals which made it extra delicious. The steak was amazing as well. Beautifully cooked and tender, it was served on a bed of potatoes. I didn't actually get to try any of the dessert because we had to run but I heard it was pretty solidService the whole time was attentive. We got something like 10 bottles of $31 wine and with tip the total was only $80 a person which I think is a steal for what we got.

Tried to switch tables and maitre d' could not accommodate us, but did buy us a round of drinks (I would rather have been comfortable and able to enjoy my meal). I got the pasta special and was not offered any additional portions, and had to ask 3 times for the one pasta I liked (which I finally got as we were getting bill) Is it really unlimited if no one brings a second serving??? My daughter didn't like the pasta choices, so ordered just plain linguine with tomato sauce, was told this is not the unlimited special. Was charged the unlimited price ($24.95 for a plate of plain linguine!) She had a side of meatballs which were inedible baseballs and were $12. So...$37 for a plate she took 2 bites of. The server did her best to take care of the tables under these crowded conditions. i wish I had walked out, but had theater tickets and was hoping for the best.

Shredded veggie, (could not discerned what it was) a bit of left over fish and octopus.The pastas were okay but nothing to rave about.Bottom line, we probably don't need to go to Becco the next time we're in the city.On the positive side, our servers were very attentive.  NO COMPLAINTS!!",1,0,0,Paul M.,"Hamilton, NJ",0,38,12

2.0,5/24/2018,"Decent bread and wine, but any other positives stop with the bus stop feel of the dining experience.  The tacky decor and sprawling cold interior are better suited for a gas station than an Italian restaurant.  Substitutions are not allowed, and dietary restrictions were barely accommodated for.  Caesar salad comes with every meal.  After ordering the pulled pork entree, I mentioned I did not want the salad.  When told it just came with it, I said I just did not want it.  When pried, I mentioned my dairy sensitivity.  I was told they could substitute for the misti salad for a $2 upcharge.  I agreed, just to satisfy the waiter, although I did not want this either.  The waiter then mentioned that the mashed potatoes coming with my meal had butter in them.  I asked if this could be substituted as well and he offered me broccoli in place of potatoes.  The meal came as PLAIN pulled pork.  Not a hint of any sauce on it.  It was quality meat, but un-sauced pulled pork is just too bland to be palatable.  Pair that with plain broccoli and there's not a lot of incentive to eat the meal.  All of the food runners and bus boys were delightful and helpful.  Overall, the dining experience could have been decent, but was significantly worsened by the rude and pushy waiter.",0,0,0,Katie T.,"Wayland, MA",0,15,0

3.0,5/23/2018,"Fun place to visit. I would go back, but I have to say it's not as legendary as folks make out. The highlight came early. The Calamari, it was very good. I'd also say the Caesar Salad she was above average but not spectacularly so. I had the all you can eat pasta trio. The servers bring them around every so often. Though I had to flag them down to make sure I actually got all three.The Rigatoni was average, but perhaps it might've been sitting too long. The lump crab fettuccine was pretty good. The Swiss Chard Ravioli was the star! I would have been more impressed if that were the only one I had eaten or if my dish was as good as my friend's chicken and risotto. Then I probably would give Becco four stars. 3.5 stars and I'm giving it just 3 because celebrity chef restaurants that don't deliver do the world a disservice. It's near the theater district so they'll do plenty of business regardless. At least the service was decent overall.",5,1,3,Ted R.,"Oakland, CA",1032,682,630

4.0,5/21/2018,"We had a 6:45pm reservation on a Friday night. It was a busy day since there were many graduation celebrations and Becco was packed when I arrived at 6:45pm. I was told multiple times that they were getting the table ready but we weren't seated until around 7:20pm. Why would I have a reservation then? There were about 10 people consistantly outside the restaurant waiting so that means they don't have their act together.However their food and price saved them. The unlimited pasta choices were delicious that night with mushroom ravioli, clam linguini and a farfelle in tomato sauce. I liked all of them and was definitely worth the price. We also ordered appetizer of burrata and pork belly (they are separate dishes). They were both delicious. The pork belly tasted like expensive ham LOL We also ordered the daily special of halibut (done perfectly), braised short ribs (good) and a garlic mash potato that didn't have any garlic in it. At the end, we ordered two desserts and they waved the plating fee for my birthday cake, which was fair. All in all, good place for a big group since it is not expensive with good food. It's pure luck whether or not you will have a good unlimited pasta day and we did. Service was slow but good and waitress was attentive.

3.0,5/10/2018,"I definitely expected more from this restaurant and was pretty disappointed by the experience/food that I had. My friend recommended the trio of pastas which is all you can eat for $25 and it consisted of a pesto pasta, an asparagus ravioli, and a shrimp spaghetti. While the pastas individually were decent, I don't think any of them were particularly amazing and most of them felt really cheap so I don't exactly think I got my $25 worth. For each of the pastas: the pesto pasta was a bit heavier than I would've liked, same with the asparagus ravioli. However, the shrimp spaghetti was cooked perfectly even if there weren't that many shrimps. I'm also not too big of a fan of the service because they come around whenever they have pasta to refill and it took sometimes 15-20 minutes to get another round of pasta. The initial pasta also took around 30 minutes to come out which was odd considering the fact that they should really have people bringing pasta out rather frequently.Anyways, it wasn't terrible, but I can definitely think of better Italian places so I would recommend you go somewhere else.",4,2,1,Michael L.,"Manhattan, NY",1032,172,59
1.0,5/9/2018,"Last Sunday evening May 6, 2018 a party of 4, once again made our reservations a month in advance for 6:30pm.  We finally got seated at 6:40 which wasn't bad.  We are all New Yorkers so we know the drill, and have patience and understand.  We finally were seated at table 20 in a remote corner like ""sardines"".  We were squashed and could hardly raise our hands to eat.  The food was very good. We all had the lamb chops. They were cooked to perfection.  That is why I am giving a rating of 1 star.To add to our discomfort, a gentleman at the next table was yelling and ranting in a foreign language and becoming extremely animated with his wife. We spoke to our waiter and asked if something can be done, because we felt very uncomfortable and could not enjoy our meal.  Several tables around us were turning around and staring at this ""loose canon.""  At one point he got up and left, then immediately came back.  In today's climate, needless to say, we were even more uneasy.  We again requested to our servers to please have someone do something.  This person was upsetting the entire room.  We were told that nothing could be done, and continued serving our food.  This hysterical patron was getting more boisterous and extremely agitated.  We all were fearing what he was going to do next.Then at the table parallel to his, a woman very nicely got up and asked the man to please stop yelling that he is upsetting the entire room.  He said he was sorry and became quiet.  A few moments later a ""muscular man"" approached our table and asked what was going on.  We told him the situation and explained that he was  5 minutes too late.  We asked for the check without having dessert and left.  A patron diffused the situation since Becco's staff wouldn't.  A year ago I had given a rave review on BECCO. Today, I am ending my REVIEW WITH ""I WILL NEVER STEP FOOT IN BECCO'S ever again"". It has become too noisy, crowded, and has lost its zest, as far as I am concerned.  There are so many restaurants on RESTAURANT ROW and throughout the City.  We do not have to be subjected to that treatment again, both in the uncomfortable seating arrangement AND the abnormal atmosphere that wasn't attended to immediately.",0,1,0,Elaine G.,"Eastport, NY",0,20,22

He got a little miffed when they asked him specifically about the food preparation and he just turned and walked away from them. Finally the owner came over and explained that yes the food was prepared with the consideration of the daughters food allergy.  They were then happy and began their dinner.  This was extremely hard to watch and apparently the waiter does not understand that a peanut allergy can kill someone.  This ruined our experience of this highly recommended restaurant.",0,0,0,Duffymp48 ..,"Jennings, FL",76,26,39

It is pretty popular and can get really crowded. We got a drink at the bar when we got there and then were led to our seats. The place is much bigger than it looks. They have a really big downstairs area that's mostly in the back half of the restaurant, and then they also have an entire upstairs place. The tables are pretty close together but they do a good job at making sure you don't feel too squished or like you're with another party. The menu is simple enough and easy to choose from. They have a pasta deal that is 3 of their pastas they are serving that night for $30 and it's unlimited. It looked like this is the only kind of pasta you'd be able to get, but I didn't mind because they were all really good and super filling. The waiters were super attentive, very nice and the ambiance was great.

You are sitting within inches of other people which is pretty common in Manhattan. The staff is very friendly, professional and hard working. (I don't know how they work in such close quarters!)

Husband had the Caesar salad and said it was nothing special.3 pastas were: penne in marinara w/basil, artichoke ravioli, and fettuccini with ham, mushrooms & peas. Only the fettuccini tasted homemade. It was good. The ravioli was flat and almost empty. ""Filled"" with a tiny bit of cheese and something they called artichoke. The penne was just boring, red sauce very unimpressive for an Italian restaurant. I make it better myself. My husband had the swordfish and said he liked it. It came with roasted spaghetti squash which was very good. (I ate it he didn't) Didn't have an unpleasant  experience here, but it certainly is not outstanding Italian food, which is what I was hoping for.

3.0,3/20/2018,"If you are looking for authentic Italian food, you should look elsewhere.  While I  understand they cater to the theater crowd, they miss the mark on quality ingredients and authenticity.   Let's start with service.  Service was good except for our server not knowing certain answers to questions. With such a limited menu, that was surprising but our server was very polite and professional.   Our appetizers were very good..... bresaola and polenta with speck and were the best part of the whole meal.  The Caesar salad was mediocre at best.   Drenched in dressing and scooped out of a communal bowl, I should have opted for the antipasto option.  Next, for the main course, here's why I would never go back or recommend Becco to anyone.  We both ordered the pasta special dish that gives you 3 unlimited types of pasta of the day.  When I made reservations, my email stated that I could check Facebook to see which pastas are offered on that day.   They were never posted.  We ordered it anyway because we craved pasta and unfortunately there are no pasta options like ""primi"" for dinner.  It's either the special or order a meat, chicken or fish off the menu.  Very disappointing.   Also, what was never explained and we didn't realize was that all the pastas would be brought out in large serving bowls from the kitchen and placed (all 3 together) on a plate.   I would never order pasta that way, mixing different sauces and knowing that the plate wasn't made to order.  Sure enough, the spaghetti pomodoro was not al dente (one bite is all I could muster) and the cheese ravioli and the penne Bolognese were also overcooked and bland.  Moreover, when we asked for more penne Bolognese (the best of the 3), the second bowl was horrible, as the pasta was swimming in liquid and you had to request some from the top in order to get some bolognese. This is surprising when you consider how Lidia claims Italian heritage and her shows on PBS show real Italian cooking.   I can't imagine her family would eat like that...  mine (100% Italian from Italy) would not. Wine selection is limited to only Italian wines but at $31 per bottle, it's a good value for selection offered.    Cafe macchiato at the end was not good either.  When we got up to leave, one side of the dining room was closed off for a private party, forcing us to navigate past the kitchen serving hall and there were many servers clogging up the hall, bringing out hot food past leaving diners, a recipe for disaster.   While we waited to pass, I was able to see the ""assembly line"" pasta set up in the kitchen and I realized that this is not a place for pasta or individual plates requests (felt like I was in the Army again). The atmosphere and staff are nice and that's the only reason they get 3 stars instead of 2.  If I could give 2.5, I would.  Glad we tried it because we had a great meal at Eataly once but there are literally dozens of great Italian restaurants in the city that offer better quality ""cibo"".",0,0,0,Thomas M.,"Fort Lee, NJ",17,2,0

I ordered Zuppa di Pesce Misto which is seafood (shrimp, scallops, salmon and tuna) and polenta in red sauce. Main menu comes with Caesar salad. It was fresh! My bf's dad ordered the rib eye steak. It looked so big and he said it's pretty good. (He is from Texas so I trust his opinion on steak) Since I am on a low carb diet (had to come to an Italian restaurant and say no to pasta was very hard) , my bf and I shared Piatto di Formaggi for dessert! it comes with 4 cheeses, strawberries and grilled bread.

We also had fresh prosciutto and mozzarella which was perfect. My main was their signature Osso Buco ala Becco.

I finished it all!  All entrees also came with a Caesar salad.  We were stuffed but had to have the house made cannoli and an espresso.  It was fantastic!  We had a young lady that that tended to us the first half of the dinner and a nice gentleman the second half.  Both of them and the rest of the staff were very helpful; friendly and great to talk with.  It was a wonderful experience and when we come and visit NYC in a few months we will be sure to be back.",1,0,1,Mark W.,"Clackamas, OR",149,206,782

2.0,2/28/2018,"Wildly disappointed in my meal today at Becco. My father was there over the weekend and recommended that everything was delicious and in fact it is a restaurant that he frequents quite often. I decided to take friends from out of town. I'm giving 2 stars because the unlimited pasta (which they're known for) was pretty good,wine was good and service was okay. Otherwise, I was extremely disappointed with the quality of the food. Our group started with Arancini which even though we're in NYC 3 small balls for $13 is horrific. They were not flavored well and the marinara sauce on the side tasted fishy and was watery. We also ordered the Antipasto Caldo because we wanted the Clams Casino which you cannot order by itself. The entire platter was ruined by sitting on a lemon butter sauce which was way too over powering and did not blend well with the flavors of the dish. The stuffed mushroom was good, but the lemon destroyed it. Baked shrimp was the best part of the dish and when it usually comes with spicy tomato sauce it was also mixed with the lemon sauce and had an off flavor. Lastly the eggplant rollatini on the dish was embarrassing. The mozzarella on top of the cheese was over cooked and dry, the eggplant was mushy and overall was not good.My dinner companions got the unlimited pasta, which is a good deal. I got the zuppa di pesce and it was not good. The polenta was over cooked and chunky, flavor was not there. The fish was overcooked and crispy.

Last night the food was ""eh"" and my party was seated next to most largest loudest obnoxious group of diners in the city. Between yelling out F bombs and adding more diners to the table then a sardine can, I was waiting for the numerous staff to calm things down a bit. I love a fun time out but this was way overboard. At one point they even had the hostess standing on her tiptoes adjusting a ceiling lamp hanging over one of my guest's head to get a better look at it. The waiters and management staff did nothing to tell the group to keep it to a low roar. This just made the stale price fix pasta special they've been serving since the beginning of time even more unappealing.

It was a good mix of one veggie-heavy dish, one cheese (ravioli), and one seafood (shrimp), so each was quite different.

Seems to draw a theater crowd at about 7:30 the place cleared out. (We went early since it was for work). Atmosphere feels like old school Italian. There is an upstairs with plenty of seating.

I am not sure if it was just because it was a busy Holiday and you should probably never dine out on Valentines Day, but nonetheless it put a damper on mine.Recommendation: Whatever you do, do not order the Pasta Trio ""All you can eat pasta"". This should have been a red flag, but I got sucked into the pasta frenzy. BIG MISTAKE. Besides the fact that they slap all three pasta dishes on one plate (leaving you to feel like you're back at your middle school cafeteria), the pasta dishes themselves did not make up for it. The Fettuccini tasted like boiled pasta served straight out of the water. The penne was blah. The beet ravioli seemed to be the only thing saving me from grabbing Five Guys after dinner. Also, the seating arrangement upstairs is quite peculiar - we basically sat right next to another table and it was smack dead in the middle of an aisle.  Awkward.In all, a disappointing dining experience.

To add context: their best deal is the ""pasta of the day"" where, for $20, you pick from 3 of their pasta specials and you also get an antipasti plate. They serve the pasta ""family"" style, with servers running around with massive bowls of pasta to fill (and refill, it's unlimited!) people's plates as-needed.

Very good entree.3 pastas of the day: short rib fettuccine, pesto rotini, and candy wrapper filled with fresh mozzarella and ricotta. Beautiful long drop shape on the candy wrapper like a long wonton. Tomato looked fresh and brightShort rib fettuccine was incredible. Perfect texture and degree of cling to the sauce. The chew on the pasta itself was a pleasure. In the sauce, I tasted cooked down veggies, probably carrot onion celery but also some acidity and fruitiness from red wine. The short rib was some of the best I've ever had. Perfect texture- meaty, succulent, and had a slight jiggle to it which I expect is due to using prime beef with a nice distribution of fat and collagen throughout. Despite being braised and lending its flavor to the ragu, it maintained a beefy richness that wasn't cloying. I would come back just for this.Pesto rotini had little bits of green bean in it which provided some freshness and textural contrast. The pesto tasted freshly made with real Parmesan and basil - cling to the rotini perfectly. The mixture of starchy pasta water, fat, and cheese made a nice emulsion to cling.

I guess I expected more from a restaurant affiliated with Lidia Bastianich. Yes, you can get all-you-can-eat pasta for a pretty pricey sum, however, the quality and taste is just average in my opinion.

For those doing the all-you-can-eat, the servers come around with large plates of food, making you feel like you are at some kind of recreation of an Italian-themed wedding at a theme park. Although the service was attentive, I couldn't help but feel like I was part of a herd of cattle being fed.Overall I did not have a bad experience, but I would say that the price is not really justified for the level of food you are getting, I would rather do my pre-theater dining someplace else.",2,0,0,Laura Y.,"Denver, CO",77,165,61

My date arrived 20 minutes early and they sat him at our table and served him a first round of bread service so he did not have to be out in the cold.When I arrived, we feasted on the large portions of homemade crunchy breadsticks, foccacia, and italian bread with olive oil, some type of pepper spread, and assorted olives -- this was a great bread service start to a meal.Because it was a strange time, we had 3 different waiters throughout the course of our meal and every one was friendly. On the Restaurant Week menu, it is $29 for three courses but at Becco you can supplement $9 and get a serving of the unlimited pasta trio. If you don't do this, you are wasting your time. It will be the best $9 you spend all week.The first course I received was an Antipasto Misto that came with assorted grilled and cooked vegetables and an octopus salad. All of the components were fresh and tasted just like they would when my family makes our Sunday dinners. Next came the star. Three separate servers arrive with 3 large, steaming pots of different homemade pastas; at our lunch, we were served homemade fettucine with baby scallops and arugula, mushroom ravioli with truffle butter sauce, and rigatoni with a classic marinara. I am slightly biased as all 3 of these pasta dishes incorporated my favorite pasta flavors, but every single one was spectacular. The scallop dish was beyond flavorful and unique, and the few bites where the truffle sauce seeped onto the fettucine were divine. The raviolis were soft, fresh, and so flavorful without being too heavy (yeah I don't know how thats possible either). One of my favorite pastas of all time is a classic rigatoni with marinara and a little parmesean, so I was in pure bliss while eating their version.Next I chose the salmon dish with brussel sprouts, olive oil, and microgreens. The simplicity of the dish was beautiful, and the salmon was very high quality and the seasoning crust was crunchy, prominent, and complimented the tender fish beautifully. The olive oil flavor truly shined through and the brussel sprouts were a little on the soft side (I prefer mine with a little more crunch), but delicious nonetheless. Finally, I was served a type of chocolate mousse cake with dark cherries in a tangy juice and a chocolate sauce. This was not small slice of cake -- this thing was huge. It was so light and airy, however, but the chocolately density remained. I don't know how they did it, but they have a very talented pastry team back there (coming from a pastry chef). Every portion we received was larger than most restaurants and for a total of $38 a head, you will not receive more food of such a high caliber of flavor and quality as Becco is serving. We actually joked as to how the restaurant can possibly make a profit off of the meal. I cannot wait to come back and try more dishes. It is very difficult to impress me with Italian food, and I was yet again very taken aback. If you are in the Times Square area, please skip the Bubba Gump and Hard Rock Cafe tourist traps and treat yourself to a meal at Becco -- best part is, it may even be cheaper.",0,0,0,Luciana C.,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",171,23,115
3.0,1/27/2018,"We had lunch here while spending the day with our daughter who lives in NYC. For starters, we ordered 3 items from the Antipasti menu to share.Arancini - nondescript and quite flavorlessLidia's Gamberi - a bit overcooked which made the shrimp tough and chewy Prosciutto con Grana Padano - without a doubt, the winner of the 3! The melt-in-your mouth prosciutto was some of the best I've had!On to the Entrees..My wife had branzino which she thoroughly enjoyed. Unfortunately the dining room was a bit too cramped for it to be fileted tableside which is always fun to watch.Our daughter opted for the Paillard which she described as ""good"" as in just OK. No raves there.I have a custom of having a pasta dish with ""red"" sauce when I visit an italian restaurant for the first time so I had the spaghetti al pomodoro con grana padano. When served, the dish was barely lukewarm and the pomodoro sauce tasted like tomato paste.

5.0,1/14/2018,"Just returned from a day in NYC which included dinner for 5 of us at Becco. Such a great find!! First of all, they were very accommodating when we arrived 1 HOUR before our reservation time & still rewarded my Open Tables points also. Downstairs seating & bar areas are adorable! We were seated upstairs in a cozy dining room. Nice atmosphere, linen table cloths, attentive staff. Our meal was wonderful. The MEATBALLS- Do it! These are served as an app. You get 3 large. My family are meatball snobs. We'll only eat my homemade & these were VERY comparable. Ended up ordering a second plate since we ripped through the 1st few so quickly. Needed more with our entrees. The Caesar salad is very good also. I was confused seeing listings labeling this place ""family style"" but then seeing the entree listings. So here's the deal - the menu consists of a variety of entrees but also includes a ""meal deal"" which is a Caesar salad or antipasti course then the pasta course which is 3 different pasta specials they bring to the table & serve to everyone who ordered this meal. Yes u get ""3"" different pasta entrees! So good! Tonight the dishes were cannelloni , a rigatoni with a brisket ragu & spaghetti with red sauce. Loved them all. They bring a big bowl of grated cheese & leave it on the table. Huge plus++. I hate when restaurants don't do this & u have to ask for cheese. ""Say when"" ugh it's never ""when"", leave it so I can reapply & get my cheese fix with each bite! Thank u Becco !My husband ordered a separate entree of chicken parm it was wonderful! They supply a large wooden bread basket with 2 different kinds of bread, breadsticks & a side of garlic butter & olive oil. We had the calamari app which was great. The only thing we weren't crazy about was the arancini. Everywhere makes this differently & theirs just wasn't to our liking so personally wouldn't recommend. Overall wonderful meal, the service was spaced out nicely. They ask when you arrive if you're attending a show & what time you need to be there so they make sure they keep you on track. For dessert we had the chocolate mousse & gelato trios. Both great. Don't forget the large $29 bottle of wine menu. Our waiter recommended 1 close to Cabernet, it was delish! The kids loved their Shirley Temples. This restaurant is located on a block with a string of eateries. I don't doubt we made the perfect choice:) I would recommend to anyone for a before or after theater meal. If you can eat after the theater even better to bring home leftovers!! Wish I had some now.

We both got the 3 pastas and they were just ok. The pasta wasn't al dente and the sauces were bland. One in particular was not good at all, pasta with 4 cheese sauce, a step above boxed macaroni and cheese. The antipasto was equally uninspiring: plain kidney and white beans and only one piece of grilled zucchini. I ate the single grilled veggie and left the plain beans that tasted like they were from a can. The $29 bottle of wine was nice but not enough to ever lure me back.

3.0,12/27/2017,"My friends and I hit up Becco before a show, and considering what you would normally pay elsewhere in Hell's Kitchen or Times Square, it was a pretty good deal. We got the pasta tasting meal and for $25 a person plus tip, we rolled out of the restaurant pretty sated and rather happy.The hostess immediately seated us upon arrival (yay for Open Table), and the restaurant was PACKED. Do not go here if you are looking for an intimate or romantic evening. It isn't happening. I didn't move from my seat once I sat down, but the waiters and bussers are good about navigating the craziness with their hands full of pasta and plates.The pasta isn't the best I ever had, but considering the fact that I have paid as much at Olive Garden for significantly lesser quality, I can't complain. There were a few things that could be fixed, like the fact that the green beans in the green bean and pesto pasta were an obvious after thought (like one green bean per serving) and the shrimp in the penne ala vodka with shrimp were those teeny salad shrimps. The pumpkin ravioli was a hit at our table though, as was the antipasti. Definitely a great choice, and would choose that over the rather raggedly droopy looking Caesar salad any day.Our server was semi-attentive, we didn't really need much, and the pasta servers (they roll around carrying huge plates of pasta to serve us gluttons) kept our plates full and our water glasses were never empty.Pro-tip, if you are going to get a glass of wine, don't. Just buy the bottle. $14 for a fairly average glass pinot, but a bottle would have been $29.Would go I go here again?

They had a pasta sampler option that is AYCE at $25/person, with a choice between a salad and an antipasto plate. It came with 3 different pasta options: spaghetti with meat sauce, fusilli with a mushroom sauce, and gnocchi. Service was prompt. The salad and the antipasto were great. Very fresh and very tasty. The pasta was another story though. Let's just say, judging by the menu and what I was tasting, they charge Michelin 5-star prices serving Macaroni Grill-level food. The pasta was just a little better than your average pasta joint for people that have not tasted real Italian food. I cook better than that at home. Let's just say I did not taste any wine in any of the sauces. I don't understand...why they're so popular, why they can charge so much for mediocre food. I guess location is everything.

Decided to go ahead and stop in Saturday before a show. The host staff were so rude stating that we couldn't even come in if we didn't have a reservation.

1.0,12/6/2017,"My wife and I usually enjoy Becco for a pre-theater dinner. We always order the trio pasta and have always enjoyed it. That's why tonight was such a disappointment. Each pasta dish was subpar. The orrechiete, the best of the bunch, was watery and bland. The spaghetti was over cooked and drowned in an overly spicy ""tomato and basil"" sauce. The gnocchi was close to inedible-large hockey pucks seared on one side with a cream sauce that tasted like someone had just opened a carton of dairy creamer and poured it on the pasta. Again, we have been to Becco several times before and always had pleasant experiences, but we don't think we could talk ourselves back into a return trip after this latest offering the next time we have theater tickets.",0,1,0,Max G.,"New York, NY",4,34,3
2.0,12/6/2017,"I have been a fan of Lidia Bastianich since she opened her restaurant back in Fresh Meadows -back in the day. I remember being a child and going to this restaurant with my parents-and it was a huge deal. Fast forward thirty some years....on holiday my husband and we decided to have dinner on a Monday night at Becco. The place is packed. We were early for our reservation. In a nutshell: Becco is great for their $30 wine selections (which are quite decent) and their $30 three pasta daily ""all u can eat"" pasta. Thassit. Sorry. I was craving clams so We ordered an app that consisted of 4 clams which were accompanied by some attempt at stuffed mushrooms, butterflied fried shrimp and eggplant rolatini. The best thing on that plate Was the eggplant. The clams were small, chewy as was the bacon on top of it. The stuffed mushrooms were mushy (gills need to be scraped out before you stuff a mushroom). The shrimp was inedible. My husband ordered the beef and Farro soup which was actually exceptional. I ordered a special- pasta with white truffle-which had a hefty price. I was brought out polenta. When I reminded them I had ordered pasta instead-everyone went into panic mode to correct the issue. Props for that. The hubs ordered the salmon - which on arrival was already overcooked-my pasta situation just aggravated the situation. Both of us have worked in restaurants- we don't turn anything back to the kitchen. Personal choice. Once my pasta arrived-it was lovely although it was a little over salted for my taste. They attempted redemption with desert and brought me a sample of everything on their dessert menu. They had a seasonal cranberry sorbet which was glorious. All in all- service is a 4; food is a 3. Pasta and wine for $30 respectively is the way to go here.",1,0,0,Eldita B.,"Miami-Dade, FL",5,51,50

The Cesar salad arrived wilted as if it had been mixed with dressing the day before. The short ribs arrived with nothing but fat. There was not a bit of beef on the ribs. After sending the ribs back they were replaced with much meatier ribs. Makes you wonder if they knew they were serving fatty ribs.

Mind you, this place is table to table packed and there really aren't many options for that type of request.I reminded them again when confirming the reservation one day prior. Nonetheless, they pleased me with the perfect table in the back, against a wall...and that was on a Saturday night, reservations only.Food is all delicious. Good bread variety, olives and hummus in oil to greet you. $29 bottles of good wine, in NYC, is also very hard to beat! We finished a nice Montepulciano.Prices here can be spotty, depending on what you get. I thought some prices were very reasonable, again, for NYC. Others were priced a bit out there. Kinda bizarre.Spaghetti pomodoro for each of the kids and they split an app of 3 meatballs. The balls were ok for them, but as they said, not quite as good as dad's. :p Something else to note - their pasta was fresh, not made from dried. I know the difference in taste as I also make my own. Price analysis - $12 for 3 big meatballs in gravy as an app vs $12 for a kid's portion of some spaghetti with tomato sauce. Didn't make sense.Our app of pork tenderloin (vitello tonnato) was ok. Not outstanding, but tasty and different.House brings a large portion of caesar salad for each adult entree. Always pleases me to see salad included in the meal.Entrees of stuffed peppers and zuppa di pesce over polenta were both good. Each got a bit tiring, so we swapped plates as usual to finish.For dessert, chocolate mousse cake and panna cotta. Both good and most desserts priced fair at $8. Oddly, a single espresso was $5.50. Like I said, some prices seemed a bit off.All in all, we were all very happy and have another restaurant to add to the go-to list. Ciao!",1,0,0,Mike E.,"Pearl River, NY",0,41,6

We ordered drinks, it took a while to get our drinks, maybe 10-15 minutes. We ordered dinner and...nothing. One hour after we were seated we still didn't have any food. No bread, nothing. We asked our waiter as soon as we got his attention and there had been a mistake of some sort. Soon thereafter we had bread followed by antipasto. I ordered the three pasta special. One of the three had a meat I don't eat and they said they would have no problem swapping it out for a mushroom ravioli. Well, I got two of the pastas which were decent but after a considerable wait, I had to ask for the third pasta. The ravioli arrived as we hit the two hour mark. The folks at the table next to us were underwhelmed as well. They ordered desert and after waiting 20 minutes inquired into the whereabouts of their desert. Someone with a baffled expression asked them what they had ordered ( I heard this question several times) he said, we don't have that!

4.0,10/27/2017,"Pre-fix pasta meal was an awesome deal!  Becco is located along Restaurant Row in the Theatre District, so once we were at the table, our server asked us what time our show was, which I appreciated because the staff is mindful of when people need to skedaddle.  Fortunately, we weren't in any rush, but the fact that our server asked made for a great first impression.  Any business that cares about pleasing their customers is an instant win for me. I wanted to take advantage of the pre-fixed pasta special that Becco has.  For $25, you get your choice of a starter and can have an unlimited amount of three different pastas, which changes daily.  Especially given that it's Lidia Bastianich's restaurant, this is a screaming deal. The three pastas that night were a spinach gnocchi, basil & tomato rigatoni and a goat cheese pappardelle ragu.  They were all delicious, and had their own distinct flavors.  As soon as you tasted the pastas, it was clear what flavors you were meant to taste such as the freshness of the basil and whole tomatoes in the rigatoni or the spinach in the gnocchi.  It was well prepared.  I also was especially pleased with the goat cheese pappardelle ragu because the goat cheese was abundant and made a huge difference in the overall flavor, bringing out a light flavor in contrast to the bold braised pork ragu.  The braised pork ragu was awesome, and felt lucky to have tasted this particular pasta since one of Bastianich's signature dishes is her braised pork over pasta!  The servers also frequently go around the room, to offer more servings if they see your plate empty.  Plus, you must take advantage of the $29 bottles of wine!  Whatever you're in the mood for, they'll have a $29 bottle with your name on it.

After being seated we waited 30 minutes before we were asked what we would like to drink. I told my family we have to get the meatballs as they are the best. They served our salad and then brought out our dinner. They forgot our meatball appetizer.  As we were halfway through dinner they bring the meatballs which we refused. Of course they apologized and gave us a dessert sampler on the house but our waiter never asked us if we wanted coffee which we did. The check arrived with the dessert so I said I guess we are not having coffee.  He was very polite to the table next to us and offered then coffee.

While the all-you-can-eat ""Symphony of Pastas"" and the affordable wine list are more budget-friendly than most Manhattan restaurants, I'd gladly pay extra to get a bit more sophistication back into the ambiance and service. Our meal Saturday night (at 9 pm) was lackluster, with tables jammed in so tightly they abutted the service station, causing careless waitstaff to brush their backsides against us as we strained to hear each other over their commiserating and the clatter of plates. There were even two tables nestled amongst the planters on the sidewalk outside, forcing diners to share their dinner with those waiting, smoking, and milling about out front! A noisy table of inebriated older men shouting about football across the room significantly impacted everyone's dining experience, and let's face it - those tired antipasti and pastas are the same every time, for many years, a disservice to Lidia's legacy for those of us who grew up watching her every weekend.

I came here years ago with a girlfriend (we stumbled upon it by accident) and got so drunk sampling grappa that I questioned whether the perfect storm meal that I had was as brilliant as I remembered.  For years I couldn't for the life of me remember what it was called or where it was located.  I just visited NYC with my son and Becco was recommended to us by a beautiful gentleman at Jin Raman (also fantastic!) what a great surprise it was to find out it is Lidia Bastianich whom I remember well from cooking shows!  Becco, Italian for beak but slang for mouth,  has a beautiful array of bottles on the wall filled with fruits and italian moonshine! I recommend that you request to dine in this area of the restaurant at a table or bar. You will hear Italian spoken at the bar and will feel like you are in a small restaurant in Italy. It is the best ambiance for sure. The osso buco is my all time favorite dish ever. It is so tender it melts in your mouth and the reduction is rich and so flavorful. The bone is topped with a crunchy crumb for a delicious meaty creme brûlée. They serve a nice bread with a white bean and orange spread that you can spoon the marrow on for a delicate treat of light fatty goodness.  It was served with a risotto made with a chewy farrow that was creamy and amazing.the dish is $42 and worth every penny! This is a large plate of food and slap your Nona delicious! My son had a nightly special trio of pastas, a light clam linguini with big fresh clams, a spinach ravioli in a rich cream sauce and a pappardelle bolognese.

Very large, well furnished, and well-lit restaurant- there was even a sunroof in the back where we were seated. This place takes special pride in curating an extensive selection of red and white wines-categorized by full and medium-body- all for $29. That was a highlight for us, we chose a 2015 Campania white wine that was so great I'll definitely look for it again. The food was also absolutely delicious and, surprisingly impressive value. We ordered the special, which comes with either ceasar salad or selection of antipasto, and three kinds of house-made pasta in unlimited portions. We chose the antipasto and it was seriously SO GOOD. There was a red vinegar octopus salad, fried skatefish, a selection of ricotta cheese and honey that came with peas, and various grilled vegetables. Huuuuge spread and it was all so fresh and perfectly seasoned. We took our time enjoying this spread and the service was careful not to rush us whatsoever. The pasta special today was mushroom ravioli with brown butter sage sauce, spaghetti with tomato and basil, and fusilli with veal bolognese. They were all very good. My friend favored the spaghetti but the ravioli was my standout item. My friend went back for seconds of them all. The service was impeccable and accomodated my allergies as well.

We were seated upstairs and the noise level was pretty high, even after all the theater people left. Your entrée includes a Caesar salad and one can order the Pasta second course for nine dollars, which is very reasonable. The downfall for me, personally, was the Caesar salad is serve tableside from a big bowl and the same goes for the pasta. So, I would've liked the pasta to have been hotter and couldn't even finish it so I took it for leftovers. I had the halibut, which was a little dry but tasty. I just seems to me the only things they plate in the kitchen are the main dishes and desserts. I think I would prefer the pasta be cooked to order. My husband and I shared the dessert plate for two. The Pana cotta was very smooth and delicious but the other things we thought all had a similar taste, well, except for the chocolate mousse cake.

Although the price of the lunchtime pasta special is appealing ($19.95 for three varieties, all you can eat, including a salad or veggie antipasto), the pastas simply weren't as tasty as I expected they would be. Although the pastas themselves were properly cooked al dente, most of the sauces were relatively bland. The pesto with string beans was OK, but the ravioli with red sauce lacked flavor, and the fettuccine with arugula and shrimp was utterly tasteless.

4.0,9/11/2017,"The Pastianich family deserves a whole lotta credit for this restaurant: simply delicious! Partnered with Mario Batali, I now understand why people come to this place specifically for their pasta special. This is a rustic Italian restaurant, bringing the traditional dining experience of Italy here to New York, where you order your starters, then your pasta, and then your meat (if you've ever dined in Italy, you know pasta and meat are two separate courses). However, if you plan your meal out correctly, you may find it better to skip the starter course.Simply put, you go here for the pasta special; its three homemade pastas prepared different ways and changes daily. You can get it as your main meal, or you can chose to get it as your mid course, which are smaller portions of each. On the night I went, the three pastas were 1. Fresh Tagliatelle Pasta with Tomato Sauce and Herbs, 2. Pasta Bolognese, and 3. Mushroom Ravioli with a Black Truffle Butter Sauce. Let's just say that if you're on a carb only diet, this place is for you!Oh also, did I mention that before the pasta, everyone gets a Caesar Salad as a starter? By the time my entree got to me, I was stuffed, but of course, with that gorgeously prepared pork chop with garlic mashed potatoes staring back at me, I couldn't not take a few bites. It was a shame I was going to theatre after, or else I would have taken it home.Speaking of, this restaurant is located right on restaurant row in the theatre district, so the staff knows exactly how to work service. Before they even ask for your drink order, they ask if your going to see a show that evening, so don't be scared you're gonna miss the first act of whatever musical you're going to see.

The waiter was extremely rude and on a couple of occasions even completely looked through us when we called for him. Another waiter had to jump in to assist us.  That kinda shit attitude doesn't work anywhere. Not even the basketball court. What my friend ended up getting for his meal was one big fried veal. That's it! If the waiter would have at least answered our questions, and not keep rolling his eyes, we would know what we are ordering. I had to swap my meal with my older friend just so that he could enjoy a bit (though I hated mine. Have eaten better at Delis in NYC). Don't waste your time here. Not really worth the all you can eat pasta, which is also pretty sub par.

That's about the best I can say about the service though since it was overall inattentive and forgettable.

It was very bland but the pasta itself was cooked nicely (al dente). My chicken dish was so disappointing. Chicken was rubbery and the spinach was very bland. The whole dish was sitting on this VERY sour lemon sauce. I'd recommend it you enjoy really sour food. I could not eat it at all. The only thing I actually ate was the bread and caesar salad. The service here was a mess. Everyone had different jobs (bread guy, waiter, water guy, pasta guy etc) and it just did not work together. I waited forever to see the menu after being seated. We got our water, bread and olive oil way before the waiter showed up. After ordering, I waited forever for the food. My date got his food way before mine.

2.0,9/2/2017,"I was disappointed with my experience at Becco. Firstly, we were seated in a row of tables such that you were less than a foot away from the next one. There were a lot of tables crammed together despite the area being relatively large. I thought, ""Fine, we're in New York, I'll deal."" We ordered the Sinfonia de Pasta because of how many people were raving about it in the reviews. Unlimited pasta? Sounded good! You have two options for your appetizer course - I recommend the insalata cesare and not the antipasto misto. The latter was rather acidic for my taste. The salad was good- pretty standard Caesar salad. My real disappointment came with the pasta selection. I guess we got unlucky because our options were 1) watery spaghetti with a plain tomato sauce, 2) manicotti with more watery tomato sauce, and 3) a pasta dish with spinach and cheese. I never found out what the third dish was because our waiter was new and had no idea what it was. Service was nice enough, and I understand he was new so I won't hold much against him. However, he was unable to tell us what was in the antipasto misto or in the various pastas - he had to go ask the chef about them. How curious. Overall I was pretty disappointed with the food. Despite it being unlimited, I found myself not really wanting more. Won't be coming back here again.",1,0,0,Angela W.,"Baltimore, MD",26,95,75

3.0,8/28/2017,"Many restaurants in the Theater District attempt to lure tourists inside with average food that is almost always overpriced, but Becco is no trap. Whether you choose to dine here because of Lidia and Joe Bastianich, or because of the numerous positive reviews, a love of pasta is shared among all. And not just any old plate of pasta - a ""Sinfonia di Paste,"" in which unlimited amounts are doled out from giant bowls.Every day, three varieties of pasta are offered. Penne with short rib ragu, mushroom ravioli in a truffle cream sauce, and spaghetti al pomodoro were available during my visit. Grated Grana Padano cheese accompanies the spaghetti al pomodoro, as well as fresh basil and chunks of tomato. It has all the elements of a great pasta, and it's clear that the ingredients are high quality. To call this a basic spaghetti with tomato sauce would be a mistake.I wavered between three and four stars for this review, and while I enjoyed my meal, it didn't knock me off of my feet.

The serving sizes here are large so my friend and I wanted to split the Chicken Parmesan which included a salad and then for $9/person you can add unlimited pasta. My friend ordered the pasta, I did not, which shouldn't be a problem since the pasta charge is per person. The manager then came over to tell us that because we were splitting an entree we could not order the pasta for that price we would instead have to pay $15 extra for a full entree of unlimited pasta. This, to me, made absolutely no sense. Why should we have to pay extra for something that my friend is already having to pay extra for? This was all very frustrating because either my friend couldn't get the pasta she wanted or she would have to pay $15 more! The whole experience ruined our dinner and frustrated us for the rest of the night and the management was completely unsympathetic or understanding of the fact that I would not be eating ANY pasta so they should give it to us for regular price.

1.0,7/26/2017,"Do not go here!! We went here after a wonderful day in the city going to the theater. The day took a bad turn as soon as we sat down. Our waiter, Frank, was so rude. I asked if there was a way that a chicken dish could be prepared boneless, and he acted as if I asked for a McDouble. I ended up getting the chicken parmigana ""special,"" and the only thing that was special was that I paid $24 for one piece of chicken, that's it. No side of pasta, no veggies, nothing. When we inquired about it, the waiter was once again rude and dismissive, bluntly stating that's all I get. My friend ordered the short ribs special, and she said that the sweet potatoes were the driest, most flavorless sweet potatoes that she ever had. My mom ordered the lemon chicken dish, and only ate half of the chicken because it was so dry. This was all after we were given our starter salads, and maybe 7 minutes to wolf them down before the main entrees came out. When we were handed the dessert menu, Frank asked if we wanted anything, but kept looking over his shoulder at other tables. My friend tried to ask him a question about one of the desserts, and he walked away to help another table in the middle of her question!! And, he never returned to let her ask the question. Needless to say, we did not order any dessert. When we asked for the bill and finally got it, he never came back to see if we needed change or to run a credit card, so we ended up having to ask a hostess to run one credit card. On the way out, I let the manager know how dismissive, rude, condescending, and inept Frank was right from the start. I also asked if their ""special"" really just was a slab of chicken with nothing else, and it was. I told her that I would never be back and that I would tell everyone I know to not waste their time, hunger, or money on the place. She asked what she could do to make it better, and I told her she could start by firing the waiter, and then I turned around and walked out.

We both opted for the mixed vegetables, which were cooked al dente and served cold as well as a small side of octopus and onion in a vinegar sauce and small piece of salmon. This, plus the bread basket were probably my favorite things I ate at this meal. The three pastas were a spaghetti pomodoro, a cheese filled ravioli and a rigatoni with meat sauce. Didn't like the ravioli--the edges tasted dried out, like they had been left out on the counter too long before cooking. The rigatoni tasted a bit of vodka, but the sauce was super watery.

1.0,7/7/2017,"This is actually a hard review to write as Becco has been one of the more reliable restaurants in this city for well over a decade , and a long-standing favorite of mine and many friends in the city.  Until Sunday 7/2/2017.  We arrived on time for our 5:15 reservation and were seated in an appropriate amount of time.  We were taken to a 2-top on the second floor that was very cramped.  Fine.  I get it.  It took 20 minutes for our server (not imaginary time, real time...I was clocking it based on a text I had sent).  The server (Will) did pop by once to say he would be with us in a ""minute"".  The minutes ticked by.  Finally, he did return.  Specials were read.  We were hoping the squash blossoms were an app and they weren't read.  When we asked about them, Will immediately replied that they were available and with a unique preparation.  GREAT.  We ordered those and a bottle of wine without batting an eye as we considered entrees.  We ordered our food (the pasta trio and the pork) when he returned with the wine.  Not moments after, the blossoms arrived...lacking the contents promised.  Still delicious, but not what was promised.  We weren't done with those when the salad came.  We were basically looked at to finish up right away as the server with salad was just lingering in front of us waiting.  We ate quicker than we thought we would need to so the salad would land and we weren't being hovered over.  And by hovering, I mean to the point where I felt I had to return the remains of my blossom to the serving dish so they could plop down what was ultimately a lackluster version of their usually flavorful Caesar salad rather than allow me to enjoy my appetizer to completion. My friend finished his salad first and I was about halfway through , and without missing a beat, his entree arrived.  And once again,  the server with the first round of pasta arrived hovering...basically gave me a look forcing me to surrender the rest of my salad in order to get the pasta.  I'm glad I did, because after the first round of the trio came around, it seemed like the pasta was no longer existent.  My friend had finished his meal and his plate was cleared LONG before more pasta came around.   And moreso, I was looked upon with a touch of disdain when I informed the server that I would like to hold onto my plate for some more pasta as I had only had one opportunity to enjoy my ""trio sinfonia.""  No one else around us seemed to be rushed to get out.  We didn't have a show to get to (not like we were even asked as is customary in the area, plus seriously, how many Sunday evening shows exist) and conversation was made with both Will and the manager who checked in on us (with a blase attitude) that we had been to the restaurant many times, lived in the city, and were out to enjoy a leisurely dinner after seeing a matinee.  I finally got another round of the pasta.  Mind you, the first round was tepid, but this one was hot.  The artichoke ravioli was all butter throughout with no taste of artichoke .  My friend looked on as I ate and we ordered a second bottle, as one would expect when having essentially a three-course meal on a leisurely Sunday evening (and as would be good business practice, as both my friend and I have worked in the service industry for a number of years) . It was definitely feeling uncomfortable.  We made it clear we were locals and not tourists and enjoying a nice meal out.  I finally gave up waiting.  While finishing my pastas, we ordered two double espressos.  Not two minutes later, I saw a manager with two espressos emerge.  My plate hadn't been cleared and our flutes were still full with a bit of Prosecco still in the bottle.   I looked at my friend and was like ""if those are ours, I am going to scream"".  I didn't scream, but they arrived. We finished our second bottle and espressos and paid and left.  Will was a good server (despite not really knowing what was in the pork dish when we asked a question when it arrived and we tasted it).  We felt so unwelcome and forced out.  I realize that this place needs to turn tables, but our service was absurd.  I even saw a server getting pasta served to himself in plain view.  In fairness, it might have been for a table, but it sure looked like it might have been for him.  Except for one manager, the rest seemed to be too involved with talking to servers and themselves.  Becco ​seems to have fallen from​ one of the ​most enjoyable restaurants in the Theater District​ of top-notch, solid quality​ to another​ pure tourist trap.​..does Lydia have a son named Carmine no one knows about?​  That...or a table of two was deemed insignificant​, which is even more unforgivable when I can assure you our bill for two was was comparable if not greater than some of the low spending, ""turn and burn"" tourists surrounding us​.  Utter fail.  Perhaps Becco has run its course for New Yorkers and we must turn to the offerings of Ninth Avenue to get treated with a little sincerity and care.",1,0,0,Matt K.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,10,0

3.0,6/23/2017,"My one fancy dinner out on my Broadway Birthday marathon and a local told me this was a good spot. I love the block it is on and the restaurant seemed very pretty upon entering.Then I was sat at a very odd table upstairs jammed up against the wall with a view of the kitchen. (And not a pretty view) The chicken dinner I had was very good. I love their bread basket and the bean dip hummus type of spread. Yummy. The food was good but nothing to die over. My seating was in an awkward spot in the restaurant. Their bathrooms are Onsies with a long line that forms by the kitchen and the table I was sitting at, which made my experience, again, ummmm awkward.  The server was not very friendly nor helpful. I had to ask for everything and he seemed put out by my requests. The huge pans of never ending pasta that were walked by me were crazy large, made my jaw drop, and looked so good. If you have a lot of people to feed this is probably a better choice than just a single diner. Also, very small sodas that refills are charged at full price is odd. The cups should be a bit bigger or the price a tad smaller. Food- 4Service-3- and only because the hostess and greeters made up for the waiters poor service. They were very nice.

3.0,6/21/2017,"Arrived for our 5pm reservation about 20 min early and were seated within 5 minutes upstairs at an extremely small table against the wall.  There is really not enough room in the table for bread basket,olives, plates etc.    also, holding the large menu at this tiny table is annoying as well.  You simply don't have room to move around when you are up against the wall with another table 5 feet on the other side.  The room was also hotter than it should have been.  It was pretty hot outside and you could barely feel the a/c and the temp of the room definitely got warmer as more tables filled up.  The atmosphere is uncomfortable with the right space and hot temp makes it worse. The menu was OK.  We got hot antipasto app for 2.  Shrimp and stuffed mushrooms were great, eggplant rollatini was good, clams casino were not good covered in chopped bell peppers/onions instead of breadcrumbs like usual baked clams.  Next we each got Caesar salad included with entree which was nothing special and not freshest lettuce I've had in a salad.  My sister got the unlimited pasta which was just OK.  She barely touched most of it.  There is no pasta on the menu other than the unlimited option for $25 so if you are not going to eat a lot it's really not worth the price.  They should offer a single pasta dish on menu.  I got the zuppe de pesce which was good.  Had shrimp, scallops, salmon and a piece of white fish on top of polenta in red broth.  The fish was good if a little over cooked but the polenta was bland with no flavoring. Tastes like cream of wheat cereal.  Service was a little slow as the restaurant was full by 5:30 with pre theater diners and had to flag down waiter for refill on wine after empty glass sat for 15 min.  We finished with the sorbetti trio which was very good, coconut, raspberry and white peach prosecco.  Coconut was best but they were all very good.I would not return here based on this visit.  It's not a good value or exceptional enough food to justify the higher price.  Dinner for 2 with 2 wines, 1 drink, 1 app and 1 dessert came to $130 with tip.  Not outrageous but more than what you would normally pay for a good Italian meal.  Nothing was bad but nothing was great enough to make u want to come back or recommend to others. Also, next to us was a family with 3 young children and it seems as though they do not have a children's menu or flexibility to adjust much of regular menu for kids.  They asked for grilled chicken and waiter said they only have chicken parm cutlet they could serve without sauce.  If a restaurant can't prepare a simple grilled chicken breast it seems like maybe a lot of food may be pre-prepared?  Be aware if you have picky eaters.",0,0,0,eileen k.,"Hartsdale, NY",0,16,5

There were slices of garlic in it, but I didn't finish it or the spiral pasta with pesto and green beans. I enjoyed the seafood risotto a lot - definitely my favorite of the three. Our waiter was very nice and pleasant, but he was hustling and sweating. I think he had a lot of tables to manage and was in over his head.

We both got the Sifonia Di Pasta - which is unlimited table side service of the chef's three daily pastas. Several servers walk around with large skillets of the three pastas to refill whenever you wish. That day's was penne in a tomato basil, fettuccine bolognese, and a creamy pesto gnocchi. All three had fresh good pasta, but the star was the gnocchi. We got several helpings of that.

By the time we put our name down, the theater goers had already parted and it was only a few moments before we were seated in the back room past the bar... nice and with much better air flow than in the front.The pasta selection was perfect and each different but worked welltogether. I could not have a second go around, and a few hours later I am still stuffed. No need to go into detail, each night has a different trio listed on their web site and I posted the photo of tonight's... the spaghetti with fried shrimp had some wonderful heat to it. This was a fabulous steal at 24.95 and we look forward to returning soon with a larger group.I can't even remember the last time I was on 46th street... it felt like I was on vacation in a far away land with all of the eclectic restaurants and their enticing signs meant to lure diners in.",5,2,9,Lisa E.,"Westbury, NY",427,555,2159

2.0,5/16/2017,"I had high expectations going to Becco for the first with a large group to try their family style dinner since this restaurant is owned by Lydia Bastianich (I love her cooking shows on PBS!).   However, many in our group were underwhelmed.   The all you can eat pasta isn't left at your table like a normal family-style presentation, but a waiter has to spoon out a portion on your dish and then they leave with the large bowl of pasta.  They will come back if you ask to bring you more, but it takes some time to get them back to your table, and I think the purpose of family style is to pass the food amongst your friends yourself, not have someone serve you.  This defeats the purpose and joy of doing something ""family style.""  Plus the waiter, when serving one of the pasta dishes with a red sauce, splattered the sauce onto a few places of one of our co-worker's shirts.  My colleague was not happy about that.The sauces for each pasta dish additionally all seemed under-seasoned, too watery, and a bit on the blah side.   Perhaps is it because I like Italian restaurants where the sauces are more bold and have more garlic.  I just thought the rest of the food that was part of the family style choices was just average (OK); nothing outstanding or memorable.    I think there are far better choices for Italian when visiting NYC, so I wouldn't recommend going back.",0,0,0,Sushiblues S.,"Raleigh, NC",0,25,0

Granted it was Mother's Day 5.14.17 and there were 11 people in our party. That said - the overall experience was extremely disappointing from start to finish.  Service was extremely slow and awful. We sat for almost 4 hours. Food was sub par and tasteless. Cesar Salad, arancini, Mozzarella en corozza all tasteless. The fried calamari was very good - actually the only enjoyable portion of the meal. Most of the table ordered the 3 pasta tasting menu which was unlimited. Great feature since we had some big eaters with us. Not one person went back for seconds. Pasta and sauces were flavorless and uninspired. Veal cutlet was extremely tough. Salmon over cooked and flavorless. Cannoli's so disappointing. Becco has become a tourist trap with sub par food. I would not waste the time or the $. So many much better choices in NYC.

I expected more of an upscale experience.  Hostesses circling the room shouting out names of parties who were next to be seated.  Literally yelling over the crowd over and over.  The restaurant is conveniently located if you're seeing a show.The prices surprisingly reasonable.  The food was just average at best. The burrata appetizer was good but if you're planning on sharing one won't go far.  It's half of a typical burrata on toast. If you're ever had burrata cutting it open to see the cream inside is part of the experience.  They only serve you half of one so that joy is taken away. The all you can eat pasta special is a good deal I suppose. If you are ok with three different sauces on the same plate running all over each other. We chose to have it as a mid course and each ordered entrees.  Zuppa di pesce was, quite honestly, bland.

Cause the kitchen closes at 10."" I didn't say anything about him this night cause I wanted to give him a chance but his complete disregard and lack of attention got the best of me. While he cared for his off shift co workers at the other end of the bar, he neglected the few paying guests at this end of the bar. I'm sure Joe Bastianich wouldn't not appreciate that lack of care. I was very vocal about it to a manager on duty and while I complained to her he stood at the bar with a smug smile on his face.

A wooden bread basket arrives with thin, crisply seasoned bread sticks, a soft forcaccia loaf, a light crusty Italian bread, and a white bean hummus. Delish. We each ordered the perpetual three pasta offering and added a chicken parm for an additional $9.00. Well worth it!! Within ten minutes, an extremely large, soft, flavorful, lightly breaded Chicken parmigiana was placed in front of us, topped with fresh mozzarella and tomato sauce. It barely fit on the plate. A minute later..out came the pastas. Three chefs with hot pans offering fresh spaghetti with tomato and basil, large thin ravioli with artichoke and cheese filling in a pesto sauce, and a penne bolognese steeped in wine. Their pastas change daily. All very fresh, light, and filling. It was an excellent ""side"" to the chicken. Most entrees have either no side, or a risotto or polenta. I highly recommend the three pastas with your entree, even if you're full after only one serving of each. You're in Lidias Italian restaurant after all! Mi piace! If that wasn't enough, we ended our meal with a flakey, gigantic slice of tart and sweet apple strudel that came with cinnamon ice cream, and one of the best chocolate mouse cakes I've ever had..topped with macerated cherries.

We also ordered 2 unlimited pasta sides for the gentlemen.The service was less than fair.The real issue erupted when we were looking for a refill on one of the pasta dishes and were ignored by the pasta server and also by the waiter after several requests. I ultimately asked for the manager a large human with a soft voice. I said this is ridiculous and would like him to resolve. He took one order off bill without apology. I then asked for him again and said that was an insult of our intelligence. He was beyond rude and dismissive. I said that I expect to be treated with respect. I indicated I will hit social media but first give management an opportunity to address. His only dismissive response was thank you thank you thank you. I eat out 250 evenings a year globally and this was the worst  management handling of a situation ever. We gave a generous 25% tip to waiter despite very weak service. I expect to be treated like a guest at any restaurant I patronize and not be rudely dismissed. The entire staff needs training and to professionally handle any situation. There was no doubt I was pissed offbut I come to dinner for enjoyment not aggravation.This level of service will negatively impact Becco in the long run. There are many good restaurants with solid service in theater district. I will never go back after having patronized many times in past. I will no longer be anambassador for restaurant.

The bolognese was also delicious. It is way better than your average meat sauce. The mushroom ravioli was very creamy. As someone who doesn't like the texture of mushrooms, you can't really tell there were mushrooms in it. Each of these dishes were served fresher.

When he finally told us how the service worked and what were the pastas, he left with no description, even after being asked what was in the pasta primavera.  He took out order a while later. 5 of us got the pasta, one ordered the lamb porterhouse (Never asked if he wanted the pasta to go with his dinner). 5 minutes later our Caesar salad was served to us. Very decent. Before everyone had finished their salad they cleared the salad plates brought out the pasta plates. Pasta was okay, only the ravioli was hand made and the rigatoni was a tad undercooked. I am not sure we ever saw our waiter again except to ask for the dessert menu to which we were told that we could have it after our plates were cleared. Overall, the food was good, not great. The service was poor, not good.  Also, the tables were so packed together that the servers had to reach across the table and we got jostled when they were serving the tables around us.Overall the services was rushed and inattentive.

There is no spaghetti or other types of pasta with it but it is just straight forward delicious.Dessert: I got the Chocolate Moose Cake (which was the first thing on the dessert menu) and it was AMAZING. It comes with cherries, but it's not like the candy cherries from jars they are just normal cherries that taste literally like cherry Jolly Ranchers. I also tried the gelato which comes with chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla. Most people I know thinks that vanilla is boring and all of them taste the same. But THIS vanilla is rad.

Bartenders are attentive and very helpful. Ordered ourselves a bottle of red wine and waited to be seated. Got seated upstairs. Only problem is that the table is rather on the small side and we struggled for space. And don't blame the bottle of wine we had. Ordered our food and quickly got out appetisers. Antipasto is truly amazing. The octopus was soft and tender yet full of flavour. Time for the main course. My girlfriend had the all you can eat pasta. This is how pasta should be. Amazing. I had the ossobuco which was so tender and fell off the bone. Just the way I like it, no rice, no potatoes just some roasted turnips. For dessert we shared an Italian style cheesecake made with ricotta and fresh strawberries. More than enough to share.

3.0,4/6/2017,"Becco is a decent spot for pre-theatre dinner. They are quick and efficient which works well for diners who want a quick bite before their show. They do get busy between 6:00PM-8:00PM so try to make a reservation beforehand if possible. They ask every table if they are heading to a show and what time the show starts so they can ensure that dinner is completed with enough time to spare. However, as non-theatre goers, we were shafted in terms of our service. We were put into a corner with another couple who also wasn't seeing a show and pretty much forgotten about. We saw our server running around checking on his other tables who had shows to catch and leaving us abandoned. It actually took us 20 minutes to get our check and we ended up asking a busboy for help. Becco is a good choice economically as they offer an extensive list of $29 bottle of wines and unlimited pasta for $24 per person. Make sure you come hungry! The food is average but for that price, it is still a good deal.  Overall, Becco is a satisfactory restaurant in terms of location, pricing, and food.

The pastas were a simple spaghetti in a red sauce, penne primavera, and small lasagna in kind of a pinky bechamel sauce. The spaghetti was very good, the penne was unexceptional, and the lasagna was good, but very rich and had an interesting sweet quality, possibly from all-spice or cloves, that wasn't totally to my liking.My favorite things were the bean dip with the olive oil, so lovely. And the zabaglione de sangue de giuda, which was just a zabaglione with some fresh fruit. It was *out of this world.* So good.

1.0,2/17/2017,"A complete FIRETRAP!!  This restaurant should be shut down.  I am a Native New Yorker so I am used to seeing all types of restaurants.  Additionally growing up in an Italian family, I know good food. This restaurant should be closed down immediately by the FDNY.  Multiple rooms with only 1 exit.  100 people herded into a small room.  If you like eating a meal with people literally 6 inches away from your face on the left and right side of you - then this is your type of restaurant. The waiter actually did not have enough room to even clear our table... he rested the dirty plates on my friends shoulder!!  My friend had to tell the waiter to get the plates off of him. Unbelievable!!  This restaurant is in the middle of Broadway - called ""Restaurant Row"".  I thought I would be going to a place with amazing food and a cozy ambience.  Becco has no respect for its patrons.  They sit everyone at 2 tops with not enough room for even the bread.  The dinner plate hangs off of the end of the tables.  Might as well just eat from your lap.  The tables have no more than 10 inches between them.  You will have no ability to have a conversation.  Again, might as well just join tables with your neighbors.  Once you squeeze into your chair, better stay there or you will knock over the 2 tables beside you.  God forbid you like to breathe; there is no ventilation.  The room measured probably 35 feet by 15 feet; 100 people were crammed in like a fishtank.  The management only cares about the bottom line - more money! We had the hot antipasto for 2 - clams were so tough they were inedible. Entrees come with a caesar salad but if you want some pasta with your entree be prepared to fork over an additional $9.00.  And they don't allow you to split sides.  They only had 3 specials on menu. One special was Chicken Parm with no side.  Chicken was pounded so thin and overcooked that a steak knife could not get thru meat.  Horrible!!!!  I was shocked and so disappointed trying to make the best of things. Its a packed restaurant.  Have no idea why.  Again, this restaurant is a fire trap.  God forbid something happens here; no one will get out.  Atmosphere is horrible.  Cant understand the waiters at all.  They will rush you into your order.  Turnover here is everything.  Food is way overpriced and not good at all.  $25.00 for 1 chicken breast - dry, tough and overcooked.  No sides - $10 extra for pasta.  No space, no ventilation.  I was so upset.  A waste of time and money.  The only people who would enjoy this place are tourists who don't know real food.  The Olive Garden in 1000 times better than this pretentious dump.

The whole second floor is cozy and intimate.  Each square footage of the floor is strategically placed with tables and chairs.  In the back of the floor is kind of a patio with glass ceilings and the view of the city. The 3 of us opted for the unlimited pasta which we heard so much about.  Their pasta is supposed to be different every day which is what is a great selling point.  Make sure to check their Facebook page to see what kind of pasta they will be serving for the day. The server was super kind,  never rushed us and is so attentive. Overall we had a great time here and will look to return.",1,0,1,Tiffany Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,36,90

5.0,2/14/2017,"My girlfriend and I went to Becco for Valentine's Day and had a great time.  We had a 6:30pm reservation but arrive early; they were happy to seat and serve us early, which was great as we were both quite hungry.  The restaurant has a classic and simple ambiance that is great for a low key and romantic dinner.Upon being seated, we were quickly given water and an ample box of bread, which was delicious.  It had thin, crunchy, and well seasoned bread sticks, sliced baguette, and focaccia bread.  The bread was also served with an amazing white bean spread drizzled with olive oil.The menus came soon after the bread, and the waiter helpfully told us the specials and described the dishes.  I went with the Bistecca di Manzo, a hanger steak grilled medium rare served on a bed of buckwheat polenta & roasted root vegetables with fried leeks drizzled with a red wine reduction.  It was cooked perfectly and had an amazing taste, one of the best steaks I've had.  My girlfriend had the Zuppa di Pesce Misto, sautéed day-boat seafood in ""lobster brodo"" served on a bed of soft, white polenta.  It had shrimp, scallops, salmon, and swordfish.  All of it was so good, but the salmon was incredibly; my girlfriend kept saying how much she loved it.  Both dishes, as do all the main courses, came with a Caesar salad that had a lighter flavor than most Caesar salads I've tried, which was a nice and refreshing change.The portions were surprisingly large and, therefore, we had no room for dessert, which was unfortunate because the countless desserts that passed our table all looked amazing.  I highly recommend Becco to anyone who wants delicious, high quality Italian food and who loves good service and value.",2,1,2,Joshua S.,"Queens, NY",122,80,353

5.0,2/12/2017,"The $25 pre-fixe is a truly amazing deal. You get to choose either soup or a sampler of appetizers, then get limitless refills of the three pastas of the day. The sampler was a good way to start off the meal - it is an assortment of marinated and grilled veggies, meat and seafood, which was all pretty delicious. The portion was gigantic too! Then you move on to the pastas, which consisted of seafood pasta with olive oil, tomato sauce-based pasta and ravioli with beet. I wasn't crazy about the beet ravioli (I prefer raviolis filled with meat), but the seafood and tomato pasta were amazing. I would have had more than three servings if I hadn't already devoured the sampler. The ambiance is great as well - it is what I imagine what a nice but homey Italian restaurant would look like. It would be a great spot for any occasions, including dates, family dinners and big group gatherings. The service wasn't bad but could be better. Our server was very nice but I wish they came around more often with the pastas. As this is a very popular place, it's hard to get a table unless you place a reservation well in advance.

3.0,2/11/2017,"Italian food is something you will find at every nook and corner in New york. I love Italian food. It is delicious and fattening, but you have to deal with it. Pleasure always comes with some disadvantage. After about an hour of brainstorming and arguing over french vs italian vs Mediterranean cuisine, we finally decided the good old Italian. We narrowed down on Becco for the night's feast. Becco is probably about 10-15 mins walk from Times square. We didn't want to take chances and had table reserved in advance. As you enter the restaurant, you will stumble upon happy go lucky customers enjoying with their family. This is a typical scene at any good italian restaurant. It was crowded and noisy. I was expecting good food and service. We were seated. They have very small size tables and a big size menu. So that proportion was going to lead to minor discomfort. We were a party of 4, but there were about approximately 10 empty glasses on our table!! I wonder why? Hilarious as we didn't have space for anything else. Water was served 15 mins later. No one bothered to notice us. I was atleast hoping someone notice the collection of glasses on our table. But no. Who keeps so many glasses at the table? This was hopelessly funny. Finally we had to get everything cleared to order the food. By this time, I was all set for big surprises ahead. They served some complimentary bread and olive oil comby. Fantastic. We finally ordered their 3 in 1 pasta and noodles special course. This was served within fair amount of time. My friend tried to enquire about more vegetarian options, but he was literally ignored by the server with 'NO' as a default answer. Things go escalated so quick we had to complain this to his manager. Overall the food was good but we couldn't enjoy it to the fullest. I would not want to take away all the points from them, but service plays a big part in the success of any restaurant.",2,0,0,Anup B.,"South Windsor, CT",50,105,357

The wine list is extensive and we went with a recommendation by the server. He recommended a reasonable bottle of red wine for $29. We all ordered the pasta daily specials for $24.95 which included a caesar salad or an anti pasta and three of their unlimited daily pasta specials. We all felt it was a reasonable deal so we went ahead with it. We also had a bread basket for the table but I did't try any because I was more excited about the pasta. The caesar salad was standard and the three pasta came out okay. I enjoyed the spaghetti and meatballs because I thought the pasta sauce was good but the other two pasta dish came out rather watery and a bit bland. Even with the unlimited pasta, I didn't feel that the $24.95 price was a good deal. We ended dessert with some Gelato which was okay too.

Out waiter was very attentive letting us know the daily specials, asking us whether we were watching a show today and if so what time, and most importantly pointing out their $29 wine menu (yes a whole page full of affordable wine!) and letting us know they're known for their sinfonia di pasta. Of course I knew these two tidbits from yelping and doing my own little research~Their bread box was adorable and delicious. Loved that it came with olives and hummus. For entrees two of us did the sinfonia di pasta (unlimited pasta of their daily three pastas) and two of us got regular entrees: Osso Bucco alla Becco and the grilled swordfish. The unlimited pasta comes with a choice of cesare salad or assortment of roasted vegetables with seafood. The regular entrees come with cesare salad. To get a tasting of both we got two orders of the antipasto misto to balance out the two cesare salads. My family likes to eat family style and share food so we appreciated that the waiter immediately asked if we would like it family style! Let me tell you their portions are generous and the cesare salad they served us and the assortment of roasted vegetables and seafood sides were plenty for the four of us! Everything was so delicious!When our entrees came we were already were feeling somewhat full but everything was so delicious I think we overate. The pastas come around quite often so you don't have to worry about ever having an empty plate! The leftovers we got to go!Overall the food from beginning to end was wonderful! The $29 medium body Italian red wine that our waiter recommended paired well with our food.

I was in Manhattan during the holidays on a Thursday to purchase four tickets from TKTS for the Phantom matinee. I decided to go to one of my favorite Italian restaurants for lunch without a reservation. My family of four arrived a little before noon. The restaurant does not start lunch service until 12:00 noon so we waited in the bar area with everyone else until they seat parties with reservations first followed by my party of four.  We were seated at around 12:15 after everyone else with reservations were seated. Our table was on the second floor in the far corner. I ordered my usual $13 margarita. The nice thing about this restaurant is that all of the bottled wines are priced at only $29. Their wine sommelier arrived to our table to personally recommend their 2012 Montepulciano Del Molise for $29, which proved to be an excellent choice for all of our lunches. See my pic of my wine from Vino.I enjoyed my Lasagna alla Bolognese for only $16, which is prepared with their house-made pasta layered with classic Bolognese & Béchamel sauces.

I was impressed that a restaurant that has so many people come through, and with so many of them tourists, still manages to keep a personal touch and convey that they care about their customers. We somehow had assumed our tickets for Hamilton were for 8:00 and sat down to enjoy a leisurely dinner. We were about to order our food when the manager came running up to inform us that Hamilton shows at 7:00 on Thursdays. The man who took my wife and son's coats had overheard them talking about the show and cared enough to get the GM to alert us. Not only did they save us from missing our show, but they rushed out salads for us to scarf down so we wouldn't starve during the show and moved our reservation for a time slot after the show would end. My wife got the beef short ribs, one son got the seasonal steak dish, while I and my other son got the three daily pastas. We pretty much loved it all. My son appreciated that they made him a vegetarian version (pesto) of the one dish that had a meat sauce. Finally, we enjoyed the $29 per bottle wine list. I asked our waiter's suggestion and he recommended one called Duo that I'm going to see if I can find locally. It isn't fancy or rarified, so it may not be the best choice if that is what you are looking for. Instead, it is a wonderful rendition of a busting Italian restaurant. The espresso machine was working overtime, the waiters are weaving about with large platters of pasta and bottles of wine. It was loud enough to be boisterous without being uncomfortable.

5.0,1/11/2017,"I had never ventured to this part of the Theater District in my previous visits to NYC. I later learned the restaurant is located in a street named Restaurant Row. The restaurant  has a great energy about it. One of my favorite selections in their menu was the Sinfonia di Pasta. The concept is brilliant. For $24.95 they offer unlimited pasta served three ways and it's served table side. You could eat as little or as much as you want. One of the reasons this dish is so appealing is that usually you can't sample different pasta dishes because they are so heavy you can only order it as an entree. This selection gives you the opportunity to sample different pasta dishes. Don't think that because the selection is all you could eat they skimp out on quality. The pasta is definitely prepared in house and the dishes being offered that night came with a red sauce and the other two with a white. This selection also comes with a Ceaser Salad included. The other entree we selected was the Veal Chop which was cooked to perfection. For dessert we had their fruit sorbets which ended the meal perfectly. Becco's unique unlimited pasta selection, great preparation, service and great price point is worthy of 5 stars.",6,1,7,Emily H.,"Miami, FL",881,259,17202

The tables by the bar are a little small and cramped,   but was great for the fact that we didn't even have a reservation. Hopefully you are lucky like we were and get seated next to a good group of people. I loved their menu. There were so many options! I like how they also have a menu of wines that were only $29.00's. For dinner, I would up getting their mixed fish dish (scallops, seabass, salmon, shrimp) served in a red sauce with polenta. It was excellent! The dinner also came with a side of Cesar salad which was extremely fresh. I thought the croutons in the salad were absolutely delicious!!!! I think it is extremely great that for $9.00's more (when order a dinner) you can get a ""mid-course"" which is an unlimited serving of three different pastas. Of course I had to my mom and I had to try it. It was absolutely delicious!!!! Next time, I am definitely taking the $22.00 deal which can you just eat the pasta. We ended out night with some coffee and cheesecake. The service was great and I will definitely come back again.

3.0,1/5/2017,"My boyfriend and I were the first ones upstairs but were soon joined by lots of people.  It got very crowded and loud and when the people next to us sat down, we felt like we were on top of each other. They kept looking over at us as if we were going to knock into them, which was awkward. For the food, the bread, bread sticks, hummus type of spread was delicious. We chose the unlimited pasta - Sinfonia di Paste for $24.95 each. My boyfriend chose the Caesar salad and I chose the Antipasto Misto. The Antipasto Misto was great - the sundried tomato was the best I've ever eaten and the Caponata was amazing. The salad was basic. The pasta specials were Spaghetti alla Chitarra with Tomato & Fresh Basil, Orecchiette with Roasted Bacon & Braised Cabbage, and Mushroom Ravioli.  My boyfriend loved the Mushroom Ravioli the best and I loved the Orecchiette.  Our least favorite was the spaghetti.  We also got the salmon add-on for our entree but I did not like it because I hate beets.  He ate about half. Nothing to rave about, we have had better.  If we were to return, we would not order an entree add-on because the pasta is more than enough.  I also was confused because no one brought us over more pasta and I started to think that the menu was deceiving - It was as if it was a 3 pasta tasting, not 3 unlimited pastas. I wound up finishing everything and 15 minutes later then we were asked if we wanted more.  At this point I was done and if I knew anyone was coming back over, I would have asked for more or not finished the spaghetti and saved room. Also, I didn't know we could take home because I've been at places where unlimited food means you can't take home.  I would have liked to have been served more, ate some more and then taken the rest home because I really enjoyed the other two pastas.  We are giving this 3 stars but 3.5 would be more appropriate.",2,0,0,Christina C.,"Far Rockaway, NY",375,36,54
3.0,1/4/2017,"Becco is fun, and it's a good deal. You can pay $20 and get unlimited amounts of 3 day-of pastas. You can also order a regular dish off the menu, but for pasta lovers this is obviously a good deal to get.  The tradeoff is that if you don't enjoy one or two of the 3 dishes, it's no longer a good deal. So it's a bit of a crapshoot. The spinach ravioli was very good and they had really great salad and antipasti (you can choose one to go with your $20 deal-if you so pick this option). Their fettuccini bolognese was okay.. the meat sauce was weirdly sweet to me which I disliked. It's right in the theater district, so depending on how you look at it is, is either the worst or best location. Also don't wear white.

Not so soon.We first got the bread. Cold, chewy bread. My husband did like the cheese spread that came with it, but too bad, he didn't get to eat more of it because our waiter already came and took our plates and utensils away after our first piece of bread, without saying a word. Then salads that came with our dishes. The Caesar salad reminded us of Olive Garden's and the vegetables/grilled seafood plate was mediocre at best. Then came the wait... We waited and waited and waited for our appetizers. Meanwhile we saw that our waiter was bringing food out to the tables next to us, asking them if their meals were OK, etc., all without ever stopping by our table. I noticed he glanced at us occasionally though, but probably decided we weren't worth his time asking. My husband finally caught him just standing in the corner and flagged him down. Guess what? He started telling us that they messed up our ticket and it wasn't put in until a few minutes earlier. All this time? Without giving us any words while we were just sitting there waiting? He disappeared from there. Probably some more wait until we got our food. Salty meat appertizer. Bland, overcooked seafood for me and canned pasta looking plate for my husband...

2.0,12/24/2016,"Totally average Italian spot.Kinda disappointing after being one of the most raved about Italian spots in the city.This place may have gotten its reputation just by being THE Italian restaurant closest to Times Square.Went in for their signature $20 ""Sinfonia di Paste"" bottomless lunch pasta and it was pretty average. One was a plain rotini with watery meat sauce, the other was just spaghetti with tomato sauce, and the last one, which was the only one worth noting, was the very delicious vegetable cannelloni. Now, I'm not even an Italian food snob but I'd say two out of three were some very forgettable pasta, and were something you would have been happy with at the Olive Garden down the streetMy co-workers got the lunch hanger steak and said it was 7.5/10 good, so that might be worth getting.The complimentary breadbasket was great though, and so was the Antipasto Misto.But even during a pretty empty lunch hour, the food still managed to take an awfully long time to come out.I will say though, the best thing about Becco is probably the large list of $30 bottles of wine they have.

There was one that was fusilli with garlic, broccoli, and cream sauce, a classic spaghetti and tomato basil sauce, and then an Italian turkey dumpling.

The food was the blandest, most low-quality Italian I have ever (half) eaten. The menu is HUGE, way too big. It should be cut in half and then the kitchen can focus on making those items much better.- The Caeser sald was wilted and soaked with flavorless dressing - the worst I've ever had. - The Mussels were unedible and were immediately sent back - the broth was sour and bitter - no hint of the garlic that was promised. Mussels themselves were mushy and overcooked.- The $36 Branzino was so bland and depressing, we had to take pictures. Have you ever seen a less appealing dish? White fish on a white plate with soggy pale green leeks and white, unseasoned potatoes. - The desserts had no flavor - I don't even know what flavor the gelato was supposed to be - it literally just tasted like ice.- The wine that was recommended was so cheap tasting - would not be surprised it if was a $4 bottle.

So we booked a reservation online and started the countdown.Our reservations were for 8PM on a busy Sunday evening as theater goers and tourist filled the streets. We arrived 10 minutes before 8 and the place was packed! After checking in we only had to wait 5 minutes and we were seated. FYI -There is a coat check room if you so desire to use it. Now the restaurant may look small from the outside, but it has 2 floors and you may feel a little cramped but there is room to move around a little unless a delegation of sumo wrestlers decided to dine that day, then all bets are off.The waiters and the staff were friendly, knowledgeable of the menu and more importantly efficient as hell! They were like clockwork and seamlessly weaved in and out refilling water, cleaning tables, and bringing out food. After we were seated they brought out a box filled with bread and bread sticks, a plate of olives and a delicious concoction of navy bean puree which had the consistency of hummus but was more smoother in texture which made for a delicious spread. They had an impressive wine list which could vary in price, but we stuck to the $29 a bottle list and decided on a bottle of Prosecco which was sparkling and delicious.Our waitress recited all the specials for the day and was flawless in her description and delivery. We were impress that she could remember all the numerous specials for that night, I heard her say chicken cutlet parmagiana and I decided to try it since it was not a regular item featured on the daily menu. The cutlet was huge, moist, tender and yes Sis, beyond delicious! My Sis was touting the praises of the ""Sinfonia di Paste"" you can either have a caesar salad or Antipasto which was an assortment of veggies and seafood, followed then by 3 different all you can eat pastas for that night. The pastas for that night were the spaghetti with tomato and basil, potato filled ravioli with leeks in marjoram sauce and penne bolognese with peas. If you need to carbo overload, this is definitely the dish to get! he antipasto was delicious and the pastas were filling and cooked Al dente. The servers made sure we had plenty of pasta on our plates. I noticed one common theme the whole night. All the dishes were not too salty which was a big plus. Salt and pepper shakers were at our tables if we needed them.We were stuffed and didn't have room for dessert, but closed out our meal with a cup of cappuccino which was a perfect way to end a most delectable and satisfying meal. Parking in the area is a challenge so use public transportation or if you need to drive, go online and get a coupon for reduced parking in the area. Becco does cater to many tourist and theater goers but their food and service is impeccable and since we are in theater row I am not shy to sing it's praises!!",42,19,35,Tsz-Cheong C.,"Bayside, Queens, NY",891,514,9701

5.0,11/14/2016,"Wandering through the theatre district, looking for a savory meal before an 8 pm certain, this place popped up on Yelp. I passed by a few other places, saw a nearby one that looked quite acceptable....but noticed that while most of the other places were empty, this one was full.So I stepped in and ate at the bar. (It would have been a half-hour wait for a table for one). The menu has a 3-course reasonably priced pasta dinner that I opted for. A vegetarian version at that. Well prepared and presented. Kind of special, really. And I'd say that if you eat from a wider menu than me, you'd be richly rewarded.Noisy and crowded but in a convivial, not irritating, way.",0,0,0,Jack C.,"Columbus, OH",0,2,1

4.0,11/13/2016,"Hellishly crowded, no shock pre theatre. Our greeting was coldly efficient. It needs to warm up. Our server was similarly cold, but he warmed up as the meal went on. The service in general was spot on. Water glasses were kept full, and the pacing was neither tortured nor rushed. As to the food...good quality bread basket with a tasty hummus. First rate house Caesar with, shocker, the actual presence of anchovies. My wife liked, not loved, her zuppa di pesce with Day boat seafood over white polenta. Nothing wrong, just no sparkle. I loved Joe's Veal Chop, tender and cooked accurately, with garlic mashed potatoes and sautéed kale. More than decent house Chianti. We both loved the zabaglione that we split for dessert. So overall? We would try it again. Good food. Good service. Noisy, but that comes with the Restaurant Row scene. I do think that if Lidia puts her name on a restaurant, the ambience needs to be warmer from the start. Otherwise, a really good meal.",0,0,0,Steve C.,"Montclair, NJ",1,43,25

I came here on a Saturday night bc I saw 2k reviews on Yelp and 4 stars, sounds pretty solid if I may say so myself. Unfortunately, I realized it was a major tourist trap-Understandably so, since it's next to Times Square, and most people are looking for food post Broadway show. The food was sub-par to say the least, an Olive Garden in disguise. Got the burrata, tasted like melted mozzarella cheese, the pasta sampling was fun to order but wasn't tasty- you could tell it isn't home made pasta, the ossobucco was just O.K. There are so many great places to eat Italian in the city and this place has a rep based off of tourists who fall for their trap, if you are a tourist please let me know if you are in the area there are way better NYC restaurants, or if you want Italian- so, so, so many restaurants that put this place to shame.",6,1,0,Margo I.,"Brooklyn, NY",176,56,14

We also had a nice prosciutto platter and fried calamari that was average.  We had two pastas and the fresh mushroom ravioli were great!I ordered their porterhouse lamb chops and they were excellent. Tender, flavorful and good size portion. The mashed potatoes were also very good. The meatballs and ravioli alone were worth the price of admission. Some of the best I've had.

I felt like we were the forgotten table since The server rarely came by and we were at an awkward location that was hard to reach. Everything was okay until I received my entree which was overlooked and slightly burnt. I didn't mention it until the end because my boyfriend already received his dish and I find it awkward when you're eating at a table and the other person feels obligated to wait for you. When I mentioned it to the manager at the end he made it seem like it was my fault for not speaking up sooner so they could make me another one. Honestly, I was not a fan of this dish and even if they remade it I wasn't going to eat it. Since I only took a few bites I wanted to them to take half off that dish. However, they ended up charged me full price. It wasn't like I ate the whole dish and then complained. I only had a few bites! They did give me a plate of dessert at the end, which I really appreciate. However, it still isn't enough to make me go back.",0,0,0,T H.,"San Francisco, CA",11,9,0
5.0,11/8/2016,Loved this place - what a rare gem - delicious food at a very reasonable price.  Right on restaurant row on 46th close to 9th.  We had reservations on OpenTable for a Sunday night dinner - and were seated within a few minutes.    Tables for 2 are crunched together but that seems standard for New York.   They have a full page wine list of bottles for $29 dollars - with lots of interesting Italian wines.   It allowed us to try something new without feeling uneasy about spending 60-90 dollars on a bottle of something you aren't sure you'd love.I had the pasta special - a huge plate of Caesar salad (on the spicy side - yum) followed by all-you-can-eat pastas - they bring 3 homemade pastas around in piping hot serving dishes.   My husband had the ribeye - and said it was one of most flavorful he's ever had.  We will definitely go back to this place in NY,1,0,0,Ellen W.,"Fishers, IN",20,56,18

The server chose not to face me, as I asked about the 3 way pasta and went ahead a spoke to my company, until I asked to face me, because I can't read his lips. We were never told of the specials, which sounded fantastic when he did to the table beside me, whom he was very nice to, unlike with us. The food was ok, forgettable. I expected more pasta options in the menu, other than the genetic 3 way options that were massively created and passed over every table. Truly disappointing.",0,0,0,Celeste M.,"Venice, CA",4,50,8

2.0,10/10/2016,"A disappointing recent experience when celebrating my mom's birthday at Becco means that I can't with good faith leave my review at 4 stars. I had previously granted the high rating because of the lackluster surrounding restaurants on Restaurant Row. While I still feel the value is decent considering the neighborhood, I won't be returning. And I strongly recommend that if you're vegan you avoid this restaurant and opt for a restaurant that doesn't pre make their vegetables and pasta in large batches. There is virtually nothing for you here.The good: You can't beat the amount of bottles on the $29 menu. And if you want to gorge on  pasta, well, they've got you covered (IMO, there never should be an ""all you can eat"" pasta option, but that's besides the point).Service is where they really failed for us last night. My mother loves this restaurant and suggested it for a pre-theater dinner. After being seated, we were greeted by an extremely sing-songy waitress who informed us that she'd be ""taking care"" of us this evening. When she recited the specials, my eyes probably glazed over because naturally there's not a single vegan option on there. Then my ears perked up because I heard the magic word, truffle. After she sang the description of 2 truffle dishes, she warned, ""Now, we do these according to market price, so you're looking at 105 dollars... just to avoid the sticker shock."" Sticker. Shock. Really? Here's the thing that made me angry, though: I overheard our effusive waitress going over these truffle dishes several other times to the neighboring tables and not once did she mention the price nor ""sticker shock"" (who says that in a restaurant?) to these folks. It was just us that got schooled in truffle prices. Here's a sincere piece of training advice to your waitstaff: Don't assume your customers are ignorant nor poor due to their lack of Louis Vuitton bags.When I informed the waitress that I was vegan and that I just needed to make sure the vegetable plate I was ordering was not cooked in butter (even though 99% of the restaurants I've been to in Italy cooked their vegetables in olive oil), she gave me a shocked look and stated, ""They are ALL pre-made and cooked in butter!"" I then politely asked if there was anything I could eat in the restaurant. ""That's a good question! I don't think there is ANYTHING you can eat here!"" she sang. I was pretty speechless seeing as I'm pretty sure a Macaroni Grill would be more accommodating. We had just ordered a bottle of wine, so while she went to inquire as to what they could possibly do for me, I told my mom I'd just drink wine and eat elsewhere if worst came to worst, because she wanted to leave right then and there. I sure as hell didn't want to make my mom feel bad or uncomfortable on her birthday and who needs to feel this stressed at all when eating out? Our waitress came back and said that they would be able to prepare my vegetables in olive oil. Now you know that I got my 20 dollar plate of vegetables made to order. It tasted fine, no complaints there.Becco, you need to train your servers better. I eat out a lot. I've worked in service for the better part of a decade. I can't imagine a restaurant owner or manager being OK with a server who expresses shock over a customer's dietary restrictions and then to add insult to injury by expressing that there was likely nothing there she could eat. Especially in a place pretending to be a bit more high end where you'd expect any chef worth their salt to make something to order for that customer. Although I lived in NYC most of my life, I now live in New Orleans, a city that loves its seafood, butter and meat yet when I eat out, chefs & cooks are typically more than cool with making me something even if it's not the most creative thing I've ever had. Whether or not that *could* be true here at Becco, my impression is that the kitchen has no interest in anything other than churning out massive amounts of pedestrian pasta (clearly what most people are ordering here) and the occasional uninspired meat/seafood dishes that you'll see on a menu at Caraba's for 1/2 the price.We had better attention from one of the food runners bringing over the bottomless pasta to my mom when she asked for the pasta without the clamshells. ""Do you have a shellfish allergy?"" he asked, because they would give her specially made garlic and oil linguine instead. I want to give props to those guys because they all were agreeable and readily available to the customers that ordered the endless pasta. This would never be me, but it's nice to see that they deliver what they promise at Becca.Henceforth when I have theater tickets, I'll be sure to eat in a different neighborhood.",16,7,9,Joi B.,"Hudson Valley, NY",3982,1796,1305

Arrived at 6pm before the crowds and was seated right away. We had to catch the show and leave by 7:30 and they accommodated us. We noticed that it got very crowded around 7pm. The bread basket came with an assortment of homemade bread and bread sticks. Instead of butter, it came with a hummus dipping sauce. It was very good. Each entree comes with a fairly large Caesar salad. The salad was delicious. I don't usually like Caesar salad but this was delicious. I ordered the lemon chicken. Sauce was tasty and right on. Chicken was moist and tender. My daughter had the beef short ribs (special for the night). It was also very good but had a big piece of fat on top, which she lopped off. For dessert, we ordered the chocolate mousse cake. Wow! You have to order this. It was soooo good. It wasn't too sweet and had really great texture. I never had a chocolate mousse like this before.

The ""host"" was a YOUNG MAN, in a GOOD THREE PIECE SUITE. He was the nicest he can be, and quite professional. I love businesses that  SUPPORT and EMPLOY young people. The manager was an African American (most true Italian cuisines are handled by ""Italians""). It is GOOD for a business establishment to employ all ethnic groups-somehow it ACCENTS the cuisine itself! The staff is extremely COMPLIMENTARY and are always offering you ""goodies"" and ""treats"" (post dinner).The location of 46th Street between 8th and 9th (Restaurant Row), is excellent for THEATRE and MOVIE buffs (for they're all here!).Although it may seem (looking from the outside in), congested and ""tight"", it is actually very well ORGANIZED and SYNCHRONIZED (there's a certain ""flow"" of order which is strongly felt,  amist the ""seemingly congested space""). The staff is seen periodically walking up and down the restaurant serving seconds and thirds of their famous all you can eat ""trio pasta"" (which people rave about; NOTE: can't share the all you can eat pasta with your ""guests"" if they have ordered other cuisines, apparently, Becco's doesn't endorse this).The cuisines are HOMEMADE and so are their ""SWEETS MENU"". They usually offer 3 or 4 DAY (or night) CUISINE ENTREES (followed by their regular menu).I had the Slow-braised beef rib with mash potatoes and kale. Emory had a ""trout-salamander"" in lime sauce. Both dishes were absolutely delicious-as we had them for LEFT OVERS (the food, always tasting better the next day!)Their WINE and DRINKS Selection (particularly the wine list), is VERY GOOD (and impressive).The OVERALL AMBIANCE of this ESTABLISHMENT is Traditionally, and classically Italian, with a TONE of a ""MEDITERRANEAN FEEL"" (and Greek, to be honest).I came here to CELEBRATE my BIRTH DAY (on recommendation).

The atmosphere was pleasant but certainly not intimate as the tables were close together.We both selected the ""unlimited 3 style pasta table service"" option. I thought the dishes were very good, and not at all like one another so it offered something for everyone. For an everyday meal where pasta at the store is cheap, this is an expensive option. However, since it was for a special occasion and we had a good time I am rating it highly. Had we not been so crowded at our little table I probably would have given it 5 stars. The waiters were certainly attentive, and how they didn't spill pasta on any customer is a skill they have perfected!There was a couple next to us and the guy there was trying to show off to his date. He ordered the 3 pasta special and another main entree and then barely touched the pasta (and, the entree for that matter). It was fun to see how the rich NYC people eat.",0,0,0,Benjamin M.,"Albany, NY",24,516,7

Hummus is really great.  We ordered appetizers; breaded and fried shrimp with a red sauce, rice balls and soup.  Shrimp was a little dry, but sauce was good.  Overall flavor was a little bland.  Rice balls were small, three to an order.  Good flavor, veal reduction sauce was good too.  Rice balls were not  as good as some homemade that I've eaten, wouldn't order again.Tomato soup was flavorful, not too spicy more savory.  Son ordered three pasta course with anti pasta, I ordered  short rib special, husband had fish.  We had nice sized Caesar salads with entree which are served table side.  Pretty good salad.  Son had antipasto which was very flavorful and includes small bits of beans, squash, tomatoes, a bite of cheese and two small bowls one filled with white fish with tomato sauce the other with octopus salad.  All really good.  Entrees:  three pasta course was great, never ending, my son was full and barely ate seconds which he was given.  Pasta served table side, heaping portions.  I had a short rib which was huge!  Price was a bit steep at $40.00, could have fed two easily.  It was cooked perfectly in a red wine reduction, served with puréed sweet potatoes which were out of this world and sautéed greens.  Husband had Fish entree which he said was great.  Second time at this restaurant, would recommend if your in the area.",0,0,0,Joanna O.,"Cornwall-on-Hudson, NY",1,41,3

This is not a place to go for a quiet, romantic dinner but was fun for a large group.  It was one of those horribly hot, humid nights so we were really nervous when they seated us upstairs.  But the room was actually cooler than downstairs.  Added bonus was there is a hidden bathroom upstairs that nobody seemed to know about so it was easy to access.  I had the pasta special which was sort of bland so I wasn't impressed with it - the ravioli was the best option.  But the other dishes people ordered seemed very good.  Double pork chops, seared tuna, swordfish, hanger steaks, etc....  Everyone liked their dishes quite a bit.  I thought the $29 bottle of wines were great since wine can really run up the cost of the meal which is a challenge when you are splitting the check across a whole group.  Service was professional - maybe not as friendly as I would like but I would take professional over friendly any day.  I likely won't go back since there are so many places to choose from in the area but I am happy we went.",0,0,0,Deb R.,"San Mateo, CA",5,90,11

We tried a few appetizers that are not memorable, but the worst of it was the all you can eat pasta. The pasta was bland, bland, bland. If it was homemade pasta, it did not taste like it.

4.0,9/3/2016,"Last night was our third visit to Becco for pre-theater dinner. As we were debating over the menu items, our waiter announced the nights' specials: each sounded better than the next! Our party of 6 sort of split, with 4 choosing specials and 2 choosing the pasta sampler. The pasta sampler, as always, was a treat. Fresh dishes, both standard and with a twist of imagination- very good! The fluke special was light and flavorful; the short ribs were delicious: tender and satisfying. However, with all of these specials, I need to also say that the Caesar salad that preceded the entrees is not to be missed. Crunchy lettuce, generously portioned, with homemade croutons and the perfect, light Caesar dressing- I'd eat it as an entree! We paired our dinner with a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc from the $29 wine menu; it was a nice bottle. There were many solid choices on that wine menu for that price. We did have reservations, which I highly recommend, but not once did we feel pressured or rushed.

We did make reservations and that worked out just fine being seated about 5 minutes after we got there. After we were seated, our server took his time getting to us (which was bit irritating since we had a Broadway show to see and normally they are very good about helping guest quickly). Then, my mother had a question about what kind of wine blends they had, and our server just said all the wines are blends, no help at all, and so my mom ended up picking a wine that she hated. Also, our server's English was mediocre and he spoke fast on top of that so it was a bit hard to understand. And not to toot my own horn, but I have been all over the world and can usually do a pretty good job of comprehending words that someone is speaking to me, so that says something about this server. My husband and I shared the seafood soup and for dessert the frozen espresso, all very delicious. To reiterate, the food is very good. it is the service that is going to take the hit on this one.

The pollo alla Milanese and carpaccio are both Italian standards that Becco executes well.  $29 wine list is REALLY tough to beat.Servers are happy to accommodate tight schedules for theater-goers.  Best of all, the prices are reasonable for a four-star experience -- so you don't need to only try at lunch or wait for Restaurant Week.",3,2,2,Peter N.,"New York, NY",37,129,26

I realize my reservation was at the end of the lunch hour and there seemed to only be one waiter.  However, the poor service was unacceptable and I will probably not return.  The biggest qualm I have is that they offered a wine pairing with the restaurant week menu, as it is a pairing, I expect the wine to be served with the course its paired with.  Our first course was served and after my husband had finished his course, the wine was brought out.  The waiter said it was their fault as they had difficulty with adding the wine to the order, and offered us some options to correct the error.  1. Continue with the wine paring (do nothing)2. Serve the wine with the main course and charge for only that glass3. Remove the wine pairing entirelyWe went with option 2, wine with the main course and charge for that glass only.  When I received the bill, the price of the one glass of wine was the same price as the wine pairing (this came with 3 glasses of wine).  I'm not sure how this is considered good service, or what a patron should expect when a restaurant makes a mistake.  Again, just a disappointing experience.  I was hoping my husband would have a good experience like I did the first time I came, and that this would become a restaurant we regularly frequent.  I guess we will keep looking.",1,1,1,Arika N.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,9,5

Everybody else's food was delicious as well, it was nice to share. We each got different desserts as well, and they were all great.

I could not have been more disappointed . I should have figured something was wrong when I saw they had an all you can eat pasta special for $25. Everything we had was mediocre at best. They decided to serve us the Caesar salad in one large bowl for the table. It was drenched in dressing and soggy. The calamari was not ""lightly fried"", but deep deep fried, probably in oil that has not been changed in awhile. The main courses were all terrible. The swordfish and Bronzino were both overcooked and tasteless. The Veal Pacala was not ""thinly sliced and tender"" but thick and tough. The pasta special was really bad . There was no flavor in any of the pastas. The side of meatballs was not what you would expect from a good Italian restaurant. Finally , even the bread was a a disappointment.   I also thought the service staff was very ""rough"" around the edges.I know this is in the theater district , but there are many better Italian restaurants nearby. I was at Felidia earlier in the week and it was fantastic .  This place should not even be on the same business card with Felidia .

1.0,7/26/2016,"I don't often write reviews, unless the place is a great find, great value or so bad I want you to stay away.  With Becco, I'm torn.  I used to work in the area and have frequented Becco before for lunch.  Food was good then, but the quality and service has gone downhill.  Time has passed, Broadway is alive again, tourists love NYC and Joe Bastianich has become a household name.  Maybe TV stardom requires too much of his time and as such, Joe has let Becco slip out of his grips of control and has let Becco become synonymous with the term Tourist Trap.Some positives:- The pasta dishes were cooked well, meaning they were al dente.  Not necessarily cooked with great flavors nor with quality ingredients.- Bread sticks were nice and crunchy.- Calamari was well breaded and fried.- The bus boys and runners were very quick.And this is where the positives stop.On to the long running list of negatives, from start to end of the meal:- The front of the restaurant is extremely noisy.  Also the aircon vents will drip on you during the summer months.  Try to reserve a table in the back.- Since the aircon was dripping on us, the manager was good to move us to the back once a table opened up. But once the food came, no one ever came back to check on us.Food: Not a good value at all.- With such a big name and many reviews, you would think the food is great, but it's not.- Osso Buco meat was cooked well, but the sauce was overly sweet for no reason.- Sword fish was overcooked and the accompanying corn side was under seasoned.- Seabass was overcooked and could have possibly been halibut.- Seafood pasta was lacking in flavor and scallops tasted frozen.- Beef carpaccio was full of parmesan cheese; you couldn't even really taste the beef.And here's the most disappointing thing...if you saw a menu that listed all-you-can-eat pasta for $25, wouldn't you think it was a promo at Olive Garden?As a native NYer, I'm sad that this restaurant has gone downhill.  There are so many better Italian restaurants in the city, so please go explore those gems.  If you have to eat in the Theatre District, try another restaurant.And please, please, please TOURISTS, stop rating this restaurant so highly.  The food is not that good at all.  You will find better food in this great city!I'm so sad about this experience that I will have to post this review onto another site, as well.Thanks for reading.",5,2,2,Jeffrey N.,"Southlake, TX",7,8,3

2.0,7/17/2016,"for the price I was expecting a lot more to be honest. Since I am only 21, some places treat me as a child, and show much less respect as a customer. I got the 3 pasta which was all you can eat, and they were just average. The shrimp spaghetti was pretty good because the shrimp in it was good, the ravioli was actually very good, but the penne was below average and tasted very watered down. It came with an appetizer of a lot of seafood that was not bad as well. I think the food overall was average, maybe slightly above average, but the service was definitely disappointing. I waited way too long for each serving of pasta, and when I asked for more of the ravioli, they took about 10 minutes before coming back to me when they were walking around the entire restaurant constantly.

When I stepped in, I realized this place is large! It is been divided into various sections so you won't see much people in one area, but summing all up, it is a big restaurant compared to other ones in Hell's Kitchen. They offer a long wine list here. The food is ordinary-nothing creative in the menu. My friend and I ordered salad and mussel to share. Salad was okay but we didn't like the mussel - it tasted bitter. We also chose braised pork and steak. Both were just so-so. To me, it doesn't quite deserve all the famous compliment given to this place. Another friend who checked out this place before told us this is s tourist restaurant.

They brought us the bread, bean dip and olives quickly but gave us time to enjoy them and also to look over the menu. We were very impressed with the extensive list of wine on their $29/bottle menu. Usually, restaurants are trying to get rid of overstocked or old wine by putting them on special but not these. We had a very nice bottle of Savignon Blanc. We all chose the pasta special which included a delicious Caesar salad (with just the right amount of dressing and anchovy flavor) and unlimited amounts of three different types of pastas (spaghetti, ravioli and penne Bolognese).

I am kicking myself for eating near the theatre district after a show, but everyone else seemed to love it on Yelp, and so I went with it. Big mistake.When is the last time you had a ""free"" salad with your entree? in the 80's, right? A free salad is just that. A FREE salad - not good at all. The three pasta dishes as a $9 accompaniment are sub par to say the least. I'm not one for ""all you can eat"" pasta. I would rather have a small plate of something amazing, not poorly seasoned pasta out of a box. The entrees are all meat dishes with a few fish options - one pasta special. I ordered the veal, the special of the evening, which was extremely overcooked. The wait staff never came by to check, but when they were picking up plates and saw that I hadn't had more than a few bites, they opted to bring us a dessert sampler to make up for it. That just made it worse. This is a white table cloth, NYC tourist, ""value"" restaurant.  I would rather eat great Italian food - which is  easy to find in NYC.

The breadbasket had a very nice, fresh selection and the spread on the tablewas really YUMMY.  A gentleman came and told us about the specials of the day, andthe Sinfonia Di Paste- in great detail.

It was a very good sized portion,however, the salad was dripping with dressing and was overly salty.There must have been more than an entire day's worth of sodium inthat salad.My husband ordered the zuppa Di peace misto - sautéed day boatseafood served on bed f soft white polenta. He said it was quite goodand presented beautifully however, he thought that the portion wason the small side.  I thought that all 3 pastas - the spaghetti withthe marinara sauce- the flan type preparation and the spaghettiwith the cauliflower were singularly unspectacular.

When I found out we would be sitting in the upstairs dining room I asked the hostess if it would be possible to wait for a table downstairs. I explained that my Mom is elderly and suffers with leg and C.O.P.D. issues. I was told no and that the good thing is they have a bathroom so Mom doesn't have to climb the stairs more than once. Gee thanks. Needless to say Mom was out of breath and her legs were killing her.The server was equally as bad. Rushed us to order. Yelled at my wife about knife placement. Also would not allow substitutions on dishes and looked at some in my party like they had 3 heads with simple requests. They even brought dinner before we had finished our appetizers. Three people had to hold their plate and eat off of it. The whole dinner seemed so rushed just to turn tables. The space upstairs is ridiculously tight as well.

Love the concept. The snacks and entrees were delicious... But I rate the restaurant 3-stars because the pasta was very common.  I tasted the ""paste"", like I would expect in an Italian style chain restaurant. While the spinach gnocchi were delicate and light... The bolognese barely had flavor without LOTS of grated cheese added. That's not the way I'd expect Lydia to serve or be served. We also had one person who cannot have cheese, but wanted a salad. They couldn't make it happen. We had to say... You have oil and vinegar right?  So they brought a plate of bare, romaine lettuce....

We ordered a veal cop for two priced at $90, it was served RAW, not exaggerating RAW. The manager wanted to send it back and cook it again but anyone who cooks and especially a chef would know that the meat would be ruined. The chef obviously was not capable of cooking this item on the menu. The manager was rude and insulting and this attitude continued. More about the food: The aspagus was not trimmed, boiled and served on a plate sitting in water. The three pastas offered were of poor quality.   When they add the ravioli to the plate,which is swimming in a watery white sauce, all the pastas are mixed together in a mushy mess. The pastas are served on a plate on the table so the waiters reach over your head or shoulder and continually bump into you due to the tight fit of the seating.

2.0,6/19/2016,Had a 6:30 reservation last night at Becco. When I booked the reservation they should have told me that they only have the bar area available because that is where they sat us. I would have declined. The restaurant is very chaotic and very tight. You literally are sitting with the people next to you. You cannot get in and out of your bench seat without moving the table. The food was just so so. You would think for a world-class chef his food would have been prepared and presented much nicer. The three choice pasta sauces were so watered down they were not even edible. The cannelloni stuffed with seafood was horrible. I am 100% Italian and I am also a former catering person. My family are also chefs. So I know good food. I expected so much more. If they took out one table in that bar area and didn't water down their sauces I would have been able to give such a better review but I will definitely will not be going back nor would I recommend this restaurant.

She liked it better than I did. I felt it was  a bit on the drier side. Our meal came with a bread basket and Caesar salad, both which were delicious.

4.0,5/13/2016,"We decided that we would watch a show on Thursday night at the last minute. The show started at 8:15 so I pulled up Yelp to find a great place for a 6:15 dinner and that's how we ended up at Becco in Hells Kitchen.We arrived at 6:15 without a reservation and the place was packed! I think it's a popular spot for pre theatre dinner crowd because they really thinned out when we left around 7:45. The hostess was great and sat us at a table for 2 in the room with the bar. There were no table cloths on these tables, but we didn't really care about that.Immediately upon sitting down a beautiful tray of bread was placed on the table along with olives and I think hummus. They added olive oil to the hummus and I added a little salt and pepper. Yum! I literally said I think that this may be my favorite restaurant of the entire trip thus far! Based solely on service alone.A waitress gave us the low down on the menu and we order a bottle of wine. $29! They have a whole page full of wine selections for $29. We go with her recommendation for a medium bodied wine. It was ok, good with dinner.Not really understanding exactly how much food is served we may have over ordered.First we ordered the carpaccio, perfectly thin delicious slices of raw beef topped with arugula, Parmesan cheese, olive oil salt and pepper. Really excellent Then we ordered the veal piccata special and the stuffed peppers. The entrees come with a Cesar salad and for $9 more we added a sampler of the fresh pasta special as a midi dish.The service is on point. I'm officially thrilled at the find!The table is super small and I was a little worried that there wouldn't be enough room for anything else. Not to worry, they serve you the salad on your plates and they take away the salad plate after. Salad was goodNext the pasta midi dish! We got new plates, one waiter comes by and dishes a few ravioli on our plates (4-5 huge ravioli), then another waiter comes by with the penne with tomato basil sauce and finally another dishes the pappardelle with stewed rabbit. Holy crow it's a meal in and of itself! The penne was good. The pappardelle fresh pasta was on point but the sauce and rabbit were uninspired, not my favorite. I love mushrooms but the ravioli seemed overly mushroom, if that make sense, just ok for me. I did notice that many people ordered the for the special of salad and unlimited pasta but I would skip the midi if I could do it over.The stuffed peppers stewed in tomato was good, probably better if I wasn't stuffed already. It did inspire me to go home and make my own version of this item.Veal piccata was well cooked, good sear on outside and juicy inside but a little too tart.Ambiance 5/5 reminds me of an Italian restaurant in Italy Value 5/5 Food 3.99/5 it pains me but they're just a little offService 5/5 amazingly attentive but not over bearingRestrooms or WC 5/5 very cleanIf you've got plans to see a show or if you're in the area, give this place a try.",1,0,0,Han D.,"Lake Forest, CA",64,281,844

Sorry, as you can see I'm very excited.) and a choice of seafood anti-pesto or Caesar salad. The pastas that night were tomato rigatoni, shrimp fettucine and spinach gnudi (all of which were very delicious, btw. My favs were the rigatoni and gnudi.) Their complimentary bread with hummus, olive oil, and olives was also a very nice touch. Be sure to check out their $29 bottle wine list.

It comes with an antipasto plate with seafood and vegetables which is pretty good but nothing to write home about. The pasta was very mediocre though. The pasta of the day was: - rigatoni with tomato sauce - it was ok. The pasta was made perfect and al dente, but the sauce tasted like something out of a can- ravioli with truffle mushroom - it was good but again, just very mediocre. There wasn't much flavor at all which was surprising for something stuffed with mushroom and cheese with a truffle mushroom sauce- linguine with olive oil and arugula - there was absolutely no taste to this. The pasta itself was great, but the dish had no flavor. It was just some olive oil and half cooked pieces of arugula laying on top. The service was also poor. The dish is unlimited pasta, and they never came around to ask us once whether we wanted more. Not that I wanted more anyway because nothing was that good. Also, halfway through the meal I wanted another glass of wine, and by the time I got their attention and they brought the wine, everyone was done eating and we were paying our check which was annoying.

4.0,4/13/2016,"Another odd thing ... considering I've eaten here so many times that I actually made it through the entire menu and never wrote about this place.But I digress.I often like to recommend this place to people who are looking for a great Italian place in the city.  I like how this place serves great food but offers a warm, cozy and casual atmosphere that fits all types of occasions.  My personal favorites on the menu have consistently been the baked shrimp appetizer, the Osso Bucco and their fish of the day, which is prepared with a subtle hint of olive oil and sea salts.  I am also a big fan of their dessert menu and will always opt for the panna cotta or zabaglioni whenever possible.But keep in mind the portions here are GENEROUS.  If you order a meat dish .. such as the ribeye or the veal parm, YOU WILL BE STUFFED.  Unless you have a huge appetite (like me, and even I've been consistently taken down by the sheer volume of the meat dishes, barring the Osso Bucco) you might want to keep the big helpings of food in mind. The pasta special is another great part of the menu.  There's always a big variety of offerings each day .. but personally I like it whenever they offer the shrimp arribiata or squid ink pastas.  But you can't go wrong with their ravioli options as well, or the penne .. or the clam linguni.  If that's what you're looking for it might be good to call and just check to see what the special is ahead of time just to make sure.  But the price you pay for that can't be beat.  They also have a good selection of reasonably priced wines.The atmosphere here is very lively.  It can get crazy loud, especially if you're upstairs or in one of the side rooms by the bar where the seats are pretty close to each other.  However, there is no doubt this is a popular place for pre and after theater meals.  The service here is friendly as well.  Personally I like lively places but sometimes it can feel a bit too crazy for me, so usually I'll only come here with friends as opposed to meals when I actually have to hear myself or the other person talk.  Overall this place is one of the best Italian joints in the Theater District in terms of overall value, food quality, service and if you like a place that's boisterous and high energy.",9,4,4,Kevin W.,"Manhattan, NY",1288,747,1078

I strongly recommend getting a reservation on Open Table before making your way down Restaurant Row - they tend to fill up nightly. I don't think I've ever gotten anything other than their pasta special: Sinfonia Di Paste (unlimited table side service of Executive Chef William Gallagher's Three Daily Pasta Preparations). You start with either an assortment of marinated & grilled vegetables with assorted seafood (Antipasto Misto) or a classic Caesar Salad. Both are excellent choices depending on your taste. There's also excellent bread and spicy olives aplenty. Then sit back and devour more pasta than your body should consume, served until you say ""no thank you."" Three choices often include an option with meat, some sort of spaghetti and a gnocchi. All subject to change at any moment. I've only had the same pasta a few times in my many visits, so there's a lot of variety. Be sure to check out their $29 bottle list in the main menu (not the wine menu).

1.0,4/3/2016,"Ok, it's time to cut through the hype and BS of a restaurant that draws a tourist crowd mostly because of the celebrity name that is attached to it. Before I go on, just to set the tone, I want to point out that I lived in Sicily and Italy for 25 years and I learned culinary arts from a few of the finest teaching chefs in Italy. I do not, however, make my living as a chef. I am in the entertainment industry.My first visit to Becco was after I saw a Broadway show. I was told that the kitchen was closing in about 30 minutes and that pasta was the only thing I could order. I was starving so I agreed but I told the waiter I wanted it VERY al dente. When the pasta arrived, not only was it not al dente, it looked as though it had been cooked an hour before. It was so overcooked that if I threw it against the wall, it would stick. If we were in Italy and this was presented to an Italian, it WOULD be tossed against a wall! But for tourist masses that do the ""Oooohs and Ahhhhs"" because the place is owned by a celebrity chef, they accept whatever is placed in front of them and they think it is wonderful. Anyway, I told the waiter that I was displeased and wouldn't eat it. I told him that it only takes about ten minutes to cook spaghetti, sauté' a little garlic and throw on some freshly chopped parsley, and boom, a fresh pasta dish. They said no, I said no, and left.I went to Becco a second time because a visiting non-Italian friend from California watched Lydia's shows a few times and wanted to eat in her restaurant. He ordered the ""Sinfonia di Paste"" (three pasta assortment). I was smart; I ordered an overpriced organic chicken. He loved it and I didn't burst his bubble, but I could see it was the same overcooked pasta they served me the first time.Fast forward two years. My girlfriend and I went to matinee and decided to give Becco one more chance. We ordered the ""Sinfonia"" like my friend had two years earlier. The three pasta dishes were: Lasagna with béchamel, penne with green pesto and homemade spaghetti-like noodles with tomato sauce. They were deliciously appealing to the eye, but the taste is another story.First of all, the lasagna had no consistency; the layers fell apart and I detected no seasoning at all, not even the nutmeg. Second, the lasagna noodles were SWIMMING in a thin béchamel sauce. Béchamel is supposed to be THICK, not watery! The penne were ""al pesto"" but they, too, were swimming in liquid and were overcooked. Did I mention that I loathe overcooked pasta? Another thing, I had no idea what the origin of the ""green"" vegetable matter was in the pesto, but it sure as hell didn't taste like basil. The homemade noodles were served in a tomato sauce that was devoid of any discernible seasoning. Tomato sauce for pasta should contain onion and/or garlic and basil. Maybe even a little salt and black pepper just to wake up the flavor of the tomatoes, don't you think?As I mentioned before, I lived in Italy a long time. Ten years were in Northern Italy where recipes and cooking are quite different than what is typically considered Italian food. Herbs like basil, parsley and oregano which are common in Neapolitan and Sicilian recipes are not necessarily in the Northern Regions of Italy. Maybe that's why I felt that Becco's pasta dishes lacked seasoning. But that doesn't excuse overcooked pasta. That is a ""peccato mortale"" (mortal sin). And Becco should know better. When I order pasta, I want it cooked fresh, al dente and not overcooked to the point that it can be used as base before applying wallpaper. My suggestion to people who want to eat Italian food, look for restaurants that offer Neapolitan or Sicilian cuisine. And forget all about the celebrity name attached to it.",1,0,0,Lenny G.,"Monroe Township, NJ",60,3,0

3.0,3/25/2016,"Came here for dinner on a Wednesday night. When I saw a huge bread basket.. I was thrilled. My kinda place. The bread was a little disappointing though. Maybe it was so big that they spread themselves a bit thin. The focaccia was the best.For my entree I got the salmon. The entrees all come with a ceaser salad appetizer as well. The salad was your generic basic ceaser - a little soggy, heavy on croutons, but you'll eat it anyways because it's there. Ordering salmon at an Italian restaurant instead of pasta? Weird, I know. But it looked so good in other Yelpers picture.. And mhm it was. It was pan seared to almost perfect. A crisp top, delicate salmon pieces falling apart when my fork dove into it. Sure it could have been a little more moist, but I'll let that slide. The salmon also came with brussel sprouts... They were certainly nothing to write home about. Even though the menu doesn't have chicken parm on it, the waiter was happy to accommodate my boyfriend's parm request. The parm was huge, but size doesn't always equate with taste. It was a bit soggy, but tbh I find that most parms are b/c of the sauce. I'm still looking for that perfect parm. The pasta that came with it was dece, could have been more al dente. Overall the service was good and the meal was fine. I mean yes I really enjoyed the salmon, but the experience as a whole wasn't wow worthy.",0,0,0,Olivia R.,"New York, NY",337,147,182

2.0,3/5/2016,"It kills me to give Becco only two stars. I've been coming here for years. The food is always flawless - creative and perfectly prepared- the best pasta I've had outside of Italy; Angelo, the sommelier, is extremely knowledgable about wine and never steers me wrong; every waiter I've had there manages the process with welcome and humor; but in my last few visits the treatment by the host staff is making me reconsider my allegiance.The quality of host staff has gotten considerably poorer over the last couple years. In NO WAY does it equal the rest of the experience in the restaurant. Not feeling valued or welcomed by them is one thing, but feeling like my guests and I are being herded and manipulated is quite another. Let's face it- there is not enough room to give a reasonable waiting space after check in, but the lack of professionalism in general customer service is challenging. I ate there last night. Upon arrival one of my guests was fumbling with the door- not sure which one to open first, while the two employees standing inside managing the inside door and coat check just watched. It took us about 30 seconds of fumbling to figure it out. Why didn't either employee standing within arms reach help? They just watched my friend struggle. Then when we checked in to confirm our reservation we were shuttled to the bar where we couldn't move, let alone get access to the bar. Then once assembled we were herded back into the restaurant by a gruff woman at the host stand to wait longer. Then after losing the race to the table upstairs we guessed at which table we were being seated because our escort dodged away before making sure we were seated, let alone comfortable.I felt like I'd just been playing bumper cars for 30 minutes before being seated. This is consistent with my last several visits. More like being in a cheap establishment in Atlantic City than the respected restaurant I've come to enjoy.Luckily the rest of the experience was excellent. The hassle of getting passed the guard dogs at the front will definitely make me think twice when I get another craving for Becco. Too bad.",7,1,2,Douglas K.,"Albany, NY",34,128,46
3.0,2/29/2016,"I think the mixed reviews of this restaurant are very interesting and I sympathize with them.  I went with a large group visiting from out of town so I was able to see, taste, and feel a few things.I'd say I had a relatively good experience but when restaurants are a little on the pricier side I expect to be catapulted out of this world in terms of flavor.  I got the skate wing fish special for the night with a caesar salad and both were fantastic.  I typically don't enjoy Caesar salads because of how basic they are, but this one was pretty good.  The lettuce was fresh and there was just the right amount of cheese, dressing and fresh croutons.  The skate wing I ordered was served with mashed potatoes, green beans, and some sort of amazing lemon caper dressing.  I enjoyed every last bite.  The cook of my fish was also on point.  The skate wing is a really thin piece of fish, so I can imagine that it's pretty easy to screw up.  Mine was perfect.  Fried golden on the outside but tender and flaky through out.  How they pulled that off is a magical mystery.The downer here is that the unlimited pasta special is a joke.  It's pretty much what your friend orders when they really don't want to come to the restaurant but have to order because everyone else is.  The pasta was really basic and unimpressive at best.  It probably shouldn't be on the menu.  However, my boyfriend did to enjoy the fresh mozzarella.  Probably the best he's had.  So really this whole pasta deal that everyone gets to me is a mystery of other sorts.",1,1,1,Natisha C.,"Brooklyn, NY",207,234,111

Also, the hosts were not very friendly. They were extremely busy, as it's located in midtown and it's a popular choice for dinner pre/post Broadway shows.

4.0,2/6/2016,"Okay, I come here way too often for my own good (by good I really mean waistline). It's always packed with the theatre-going crowd, and service is harried with people weaving through the tight tables everywhere. Reservations are a must during dinnertimeI'll be honest, the food here is mediocre and the service is hard to flag down (but always great once you get them to notice you amongst the sea of people). So why the 4 stars? Because this place is basically a fancy version of Olive Garden, and my love for pasta will never die. Nowhere else in town can I stuff my face with pasta for $25. The Sinfonia de Paste nets you an appetizer (Caesar salad or an antipasto plate - doesn't matter which one you get, you're here for the noodles) and then UNLIMITED servings of the 3 pastas they have that day.  They usually have one with cream sauce and two with red, and I've also had linguine vongole in a white wine sauce. And they can make them vegetarian for you if you ask! The pastas themselves are usually al dente, though one time I did get overdone, watery farfalle. I usually fill up on whatever version they have of spaghetti-marinara-basil that day, with extra cheese on top.The focaccia and white bean spread to start are also good (but focus on the pasta! Eye on the prize, my friend).Add in $29 bottles of wine, and you have one of my standbys for Italian for when I don't want to break the bank.",0,0,0,Yuting Z.,"Manhattan, NY",435,332,543

3.0,2/5/2016,"Last night was my first time at Becco. I went with my mother and her good friend. I was very excited considering I am italian. I dont want to ramble so i am going to get straight to the review.As appetizers to share we ordered Sunday's Meatballs, Sausage and Brocolli Rabe. Absolutely delicious, the sausage and brocolli rabe were to die for and the meatballs were amazing as well.We then got salads, Caesar salads and antipasts to split, that was also absolutely delicious and fresh.For dinner I ordered the veal chop with escarole and mashed potatoes; was just ok, the escarole lacked flavor and the menu item was misrepresented on the menu its self. There was no prosciutto like detaid. My mom ordered the same thing; and my mothers friend ordered the pasta tasting. The ravioli with wild mushrooms was delicious, but her bolognese was very strange; having a strong hint of cinnamon or nutmeg. I couldn't quite place it. Not good.First of all the reason I gave this place three stars and not two was cause of the food, ""GET RID OF THE RUDE BUS BOYS"" my god!!! By far the rudest bus boys I have ever in my life had at a restaurant; one in particular coughing and sucking on his mucus all over everyones food every time he passed by. Foul. Anyway our waiter was magnificent, wine was delicious, If i return I will be ordering appetizers only and giving the manger strict instructions that I do not want that bus boy anywhere near my food or table or I will storm out.

3.0,2/3/2016,"Becco is a solid place on Restaurant Row and a very good post-theater option if you're looking to stay close. I think its reviews here benefit some from its location -- it stands out among many of the tourist traps -- and I was somewhat torn between going with 3 or 4, but I think if you put this place somewhere further downtown, it wouldn't get quite the same relative benefit. That said, the food is good -- you get your money's worth with the pasta sampler, and it's better than it should be, given that the waiters carry around enormous plates of it and carry it around table-to-table. The apps are good too (especially anything mozzarella-based), and the desserts are legitimately excellent (especially the chocolate mousse cake).I like this place, and I would definitely recommend if you're in the area, but I don't think it's worth a special trip.",2,1,1,Shawn H.,"New York, NY",90,533,3087

Becco features a unique pasta trio and it's all you can handle (eat).  We all started with a very well prepared Caesar salad.  My wife and daughter chose the pasta trio while I went with the grilled swordfish with spaghetti squash.  Of course I had and did have every intention on mooching off of my wife and daughter's plate.  The pasta trio comprised of traditional spaghetti with marinara, penne with a veal Bolognese, and a mushroom ravioli.  All three were delicious but the ravioli stood out.  My swordfish was prepared simply but still flavorful and the spaghetti squash was interesting.  Wine was nice as well.  No room for dessert! The service was prompt and available but not overly friendly.  It was obvious that there is high turnover and they want you in and out.  But, that didn't take away from an overall excellent Theater district dining experience.  Lidia's influence is clearly evident in the cuisine.

2.0,1/16/2016,"I recently had a rather unpleasant dining experience at Becco. I came up from Philadelphia to take my best friend out for her birthday to our favorite restaurant - Becco. We have gone several times before, I had taken my family there on numerous occasions when I lived in Manhattan and since, as well as recommended Becco to many New Yorkers and tourists alike. In fact, I make it a point to dine there every time I visit New York.It has always been perfection. With the exception of Friday, Jan. 8.My friend and I did not have a dinner reservation, but we did not mind waiting at the bar. We were actually excited that we could get a table that night. Our bartender was pleasant and courteous and we were looking forward to a nice meal.The restaurant was bustling and we were happy to see that, as we enjoy being in a lively environment and being a ""part of the action.""However, when we were finally escorted to our table, it was in the very back room away against a dull wall, save for some kind of odd deer head on it.I immediately noticed a puddle on the floor next to my seat. But it took a moment before I realized that there were still broken shards of glass on the floor on either side of the chair, as well as ON my seat. Fortunately, I noticed it in time and did not sit on it. I told the waiter about the glass who hastily brushed it aside with no apology or anything.When I finally got situated, I discovered that my napkin was soaked from whatever had spilled. When I asked for a dry one, the waited looked annoyed.Because the place was so busy, service was slow. At least that's what I am chalking it up to. However, it seemed that our server was much more attentive to everyone around us but us.There were a few other folks also celebrating birthdays that evening and we were happy to join in singing each time a group of servers came out with desserts and serenaded the tables. Of course I told our waiter that it was my friend's birthday, expecting the same response. But when her dessert came, he practically dropped it in front of her and walked away.I was appalled and embarrassed for her. I asked the waiter, ""What? No song? No singing?""The surrounding tables saw what had happened and began compensating by singing ""Happy Birthday"" immediately to her.The food, which by now is an afterthought after the broken glass that I almost sat on and the birthday disaster, was only OK. Whether my palate had been affected by the other activities of the evening, I can't be sure. But I know that nothing tasted as good as it had been in the past.Will I return? It's doubtful. There are way too many other wonderful restaurants in New York City.So I now look forward to new dining experiences in Manhattan and having a new response to the question, ""What's your favorite restaurant in New York?""",1,0,0,J F.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,5,0

We walked in and the first thing we noticed was the copper pots on the brick walls and the servers waking around serving pasta from these big family style platters. We also noticed the amazing smells from the food. We sat down and they immediately brought us breads and olives and then our waiter came over to explain the platters. Turns out you can do a pasta tasting menu for $29 and it's all you can eat. The pastas are different nightly. Pretty good deal if that's your thing. They also have a wine list that has all bottles of wine for $29 and they must have had 20 or so listed. Great selection. For an appetizer, I went with the pastas (which you can get with an entree for $9) and my husband had a huge pile of mussels. Mine was excellent (though I am not a huge fan of mixed sauces on a plate). He loved the mussels and he is pretty picky where that's concerned. Then we both had Cesar salads which come with the entrees. Those were delicious. The entrees were lamb chops for him (porterhouse - who knew they even had those) and stuffed peppers for me.

We got the pasta trio special made by the chef. I would recommend trying something else. The only one we enjoyed was the linguini with clams. The ravioli was overwhelming with mushroom and the other basil and tomato pasta was thick and chewy. I have never had that kind of pasta. Fortunately they let us continue to have the linguini so that was a plus! It's very small behind the bar if you get stuck at one of the half benches. Everyone was enjoying themselves and I liked the atmosphere. We were told a 15 minute wait and it was less than that. All the employees were very nice.

2.0,12/8/2015,"Very disappointed this weekend after huge expectations from a very pleasant experience years ago. My husband and I dined here and I have to say from the hostess having a chip on her shoulder and being rushed most of the meal, would never go back. Overall food was below average at best. To start, I had the antipasto. It was placed in front of me without even being described what was what. Needless to say, I landed up eating the fish which happened to be swordfish. Being pregnant, had I known what was in front of me, I wouldn't have eaten it. Most of the rest of the plate went uneaten.  For my main course, I ordered the 3 course pasta and from my experience before, thought it was going to be amazing. Not so much. My husband had the veal chop and said the first 3 bites were the best part of it. As he cut more into it, it was very rubbery. We didn't even attempt dessert.",0,0,0,Keri F.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,5,0

Delivered baked inside bread like those frozen peanut butter n jelly things that kids eat. Didn't like their take on a staple. Breadsticks were flavored very well, but olive oil was a well protected condiment. Luv'd the parm chz they utilized. All other dishes presented well and compliments came across the table   Service- our waiter was nice and accommodating. I would recommend looking At steps of service as drinks came after salads, food orders taken before drink orders,  many staff members stood around us- but only some took a action on mutiple requests for things. Dirty app plates left on table for pasta to be dished on for table side service of pasta and guests had to request fresh plates. Price - very fair and accommodating based upon location.

Negatives- My co-worker and I both had the pasta special which comes with ceasar salad and three different types of pasta, in an ""all you can eat"" format. I should've realized when I saw waiters walking around with giant pans of the pasta that quality would be sacrificed for quantity. To save time, I would equate the different pastas to high school cafeteria level quality- rigatoni with broccoli couldn't have been more plain and generic and the spaghetti with tomato sauce was not bad, simply o.k. Where was the tasty red sauce that came with the meatballs?? If you are going here do not get the pasta special- pushed by the waiter and highlighted in a big section in the menu- and instead get a regular dish.",0,0,0,jordan s.,"Manhattan, NY",4,37,5
4.0,11/29/2015,"Best food I've had outside Italy but space and ambiance a problem.After reading how cramped and crowded Becco gets on a weekend, we decided to go for a late lunch/early dinner. Our reservation was for 3:30. We were promptly seated at a very small table which was almost touching the table behind us. More on that and the ambiance later (cue Darth Vader music).While I don't consider myself a ""foodie"", I grew up in Brooklyn, and I am, therefore, a food snob. We had the best of every type of cuisine there. Most of the time when I go out for dinner, I end up saying ""I can make this better at home"". Overall, this restaurant was the exception. As soon as we were seated, water and bread were served. Bread basket had two types of bread and breadsticks that were almost too hard to eat, but if you managed to grind through one, they had a nice olive oil aftertaste. Bread was accompanied by a small dish of olives, and a chick pea spread. A really nice change up from the usual butter or olive oil to flavor the bread. Every day Becco offers a fixed price trio of pastas called the Sinfonia Di Paste. The selection changes daily and it is all you care to eat. Today it was Penne alla Vodka with Sautéed Shrimp, Tagliolini with Broccoli, Green Pepperoncini, Garlic & Extra Virgin olive oil, and Potato & Leek Cardoon Ravioli with fresh Marjoram Sauce. You get a choice of caesar salad or antipasti. I chose the salad. Generally I'm not a huge caesar salad fan. This, however, was outstanding. Not too much dressing, just the right balance of spices and the lettuce was fresh. One point for that.Pastas: Tagliolini was excellent and my favorite of the three. Tons of fresh, thinly sliced garlic and broccoli. I was like the cartoon dog who gets a bone and floats up in the air in ecstasy. My tastebuds were doing the tarantella. Second was the ravioli - very mild with a lovely flavor and cooked perfectly. The penne was a huge disappointment. (wah wah wah). Sauce was watery with very little flavor and the shrimp were put through the flavor extractor. There is no reason a restaurant owned by the Bastianich family should serve pasta that's anything less than New Years Eve for your mouth. DH had Galletto 'al Forno' which is Bell & Evans organic chicken with roasted garlic, vegetable risotto & Romano beans. The risotto was superb. Chicken was juicy with a nice crispy skin. I thought it was ok but not outstanding but he was really pleased with it - and isn't that all that matters? On to service and ambiance. Service was very attentive. Our water glasses were frequently refilled. The wait staff and bus boys were constantly checking on tables to offer more pasta, clear dishes etc. Ambiance: (another wah, wah, wah). We weren't there during peak hours and it was still loud. Being a city girl, I'm ok with noise. But this was excessive. Small tables with large amounts of large people crammed in together like human sardines, drinking way too many $29 bottles of wine (an excellent price for NYC), and getting louder with each glass. That paired with screaming, crying little ones who are restless and tired of sitting in a tiny space in a room that seemed like an echo chamber really detracted from the experience. I had a wobbly chair at our tiny table for two which was shoved so close to another table that we felt intimately connected with the other diners. Before the haters start hating, I get the ""it's Manhattan and space is at a premium"" thing. I grew up in the city. I've sat elbow to elbow with people who were strangers until we were squeezed in together like a herd of cattle. But this was ridiculous. Bathroom was adjacent to the wait station so you had to ask the waitstaff to move to get in and out. I was mortified to see tables shoved into the tiniest of spaces including just at the top of the stairs, obstructing the path of staff and diners. But what takes the cake was the table for 4 set up in the entry vestibule. You walk in the door and there's a tiny entry way, then you walk through another door to get into the building. There was a table set up in this entry way! In my wildest dreams I can't imagine who would want to eat here so badly that they would sit right next to the front door on any night, let alone a rainy, chilly late fall evening. Is it a greed factor that causes such a good restaurant to impose this type of seating upon diners who are most likely going to drop $40+ each and not be able to exhale? I say shame on Becco for that. Now that I've completed my rant, I would return, but only during off-off-off hours when the shows are all seated. I would not ever under any circumstance (unless it was life or death, or to save the world) eat here during peak hours. EVER!

How could this happen when only prix-fixe's were served that day?  I had to bring this to the attention of the waiter.  I've read some positive reviews of this restaurant and the restaurant described by the reviewers was not the one I was at.  I will not go back.  Lidia and Joe should be ashamed of themselves.",0,0,0,James B.,"New York, NY",37,3,0

The service was friendly and although they obviously were crowded we werent rushed or felt like we were forgotten. To start We Ordered the mozzarella in corozza and Caesar salads. Both were good not overly big to spoil your appetite .We ordered the chicken parm which you have to ask for its not on the dinner menu and the rib eye. The chicken was a generous portion and had just the right amount of sauce and cheese. The steak was also overly generous in portion size and not overly seasoned so you actually tasted the meat. It didn't need steak sauce or salt. the taste was perfect alone. The steak came with a side of broccoli cooked perfectly and Tuscan fries. We were both very happy with the meal. We ended with dessert the gelato trio. I would say it was the only real disappointment it was too Icey and not creamy enough.

It's got a cosy ambiance but is like a tardis with way more seating than it looks like when you first walk past on the street. Even without a reservation the hostess quickly found us a table in amongst the native New Yorkers that seem to fill the place up. We had the grilled shrimp to start with - marinara sauce was excellent, not too salty like you often get in Italian restaurants. Caesar salad was just awesome, the dressing had a nice kick to it, and the bread served was fresh and warm. Our mains were equally delicious - I had the stuffed peppers and my husband had the braised short rib which just fell off the bone. Their $29 wine menu is a brilliant idea, makes it so simple to choose, and the selection is pretty solid.

Carrabba's, a chain restaurants will accommodate a request, but this overpriced excuse for a star chefs restaurant makes you eat what's on their lacking menu. I had greasy pasta that was stuck together in clumps with some over cooked broccoli. That's the vegetarian option in a TV chefs restaurant? I make better food and I'm not a famous chef. There is nothing organic or whole grain. If you want artery clogging, over cooked, overpriced, greasy slop...enjoy. There is too many good restaurants in the city to eat there!

After last week we are not so sure. The food was up to the usual best so no worries from the quality of cuisine standpoint. But the service was dreadful beyond belief.We had a waiter/server (a woman that's been working there 4 1/2 years) who was the worst waiter we have had in NYC - ever. We had our (very well mannered) grandkids with us a pre-show dinner to experience the fine dining as part of the big night for them. It was there first Broadway play after all and why not do it right with a great dinner. Our waiter had the worst personality known to man and having her do anything beyond taking the order (gruffly) and getting the food out seemed to be a bother. She was curt, depressed and rude. Perhaps she just broke up with her significant other or something. It was really bad. There also seemed to be other staff pacing back and forth and hovering over the tables looking to push people along. I have never been to Becco before where it seemed like they were driving a production line. Again, in all my years I haven't seen anything like this and it ruined a great night for the grandkids. We couldn't wait to leave as it seemed like having customers was a pain for this waiter!They need to make a change here as I certainly won't be back soon.

Here is the sentence that sums up my experience: ""waiting and waiting and waiting for the mediocre pasta to arrive while feeling claustrophobic at the tiny table"". The service is suuuuuper slow. So don't get fooled by the 'unlimited' pasta, because you may have to sit there for hours to get the second refill of the pasta. Not that you would want any. Because they taste very VERY mediocre. Just your regular tomato basil spaghetti and shell pasta that has stuck together and feels like you're eating dough.

They brought the third pasta when we were nearly finished with the meal.

1.0,9/6/2015,"Okay, I'm not one to EVER write Yelp reviews BUT...Let me start off by saying, I work in the service industry. I'm very aware of what it's like to be at work and to get SLAMMED with a billion guests at once and trying to juggle it all by giving each guest enough attention. And in the past, I have seen servers try their best to accommodate, and if they're not capable, have another server pick up the table. With that said... I've been to Becco several times, last night our experience there was SO BAD. First, our table wasn't ready so we went to the bar. Packed. Nowhere to stand without feeling in the way. Finally our name is called and we're seated. A server comes over, pours us water and then disappears for 20 minutes. It was so awkward! We order cocktails and discover that the bar is EXTREMELY limited. Only 3 types of vodka, hardly any whiskey. Terrible. He comes back with our cocktails, we order. My dad (who is PRO on wine typically, especially French/California) asks for help with the wine list. A gentleman smugly comes over and says ""what are you looking for?"" My dad gives him a general idea, a Barolo, etc and the somm or manager, whatever goes ""so under $1000?"". Ummmmmm yes. Under $1000, are you kidding? So rude. He gives him a recommendation, a $500 bottle. Too high still. Final gives him a reasonable recommendation. How awkward and embarrassing. The food comes out, our wine which is being slightly chilled is nowhere to be found. Finally after we start eating someone comes over and pours the wine. The food was good. But not amazing enough to surpass the ridiculousness that was our service thus far. We finish eating, looking around considering all of our wine glasses are empty. But we can see our decanter on the bar. I almost jumped up and grabbed it myself. Our server points to it and says ""this is your wine, right?"" Are you KIDDING me! What if it wasn't? What if it were one of their pretentious $1000 bottle customers? What a joke. We paid our check and bounced. Couldn't even stay to order the cheesecake which I LOVE. My dad and I were so embarrassed that we took friends/colleagues from out of town there. After saying bye to our friends, I considered going back in and asking for a manager, but based off of how awful our experience was, I'm sure the managers would be dismissive. They clearly don't train their employees to treat customers correctly. I've gotten better service at Olive Garden. Oh cherry on top!

Soooo not worth eating let alone taking home.Also, bathrooms are 3 doors all on their service hallway where waiters/staff need to walk. Staff are NOT service-respectful when dealing with you in that hallway, where in a restaurant of this level / pricing, that is unacceptable. Let's just say if you charge me $46 for a plate of veal it had better be fucking amazing and your staff better be phenomenal from the hostess to the ones I pass in the hallway to the table (where it took FOREVER, btw, to place our order, and we were sitting in the corner under a vent blasting us with A/C it was ridiculously cold and uncomfortable in that spot -- they should have a thing up top on the vent to direct the air away from the table below it and out into the room!).Not worth your time.",3,3,0,Miriam W.,"Sunnyvale, CA",318,311,58

3.0,7/23/2015,"I really enjoyed the atmosphere here and it would probably be a great stop for a relatively quick and reasonably priced dinner before a show. The house specialty is an ""all you can eat"" dinner featuring a rotating selection of house pastas and salad or antipasto plate. The antipasto was quite nice. Of the pastas, I liked the spaghetti with basil best - gnocchi was just ok and third pasta was thick noodles with meat sauce that had good flavor but was served at room temperature - meh.  Overall the experience was just ok.",1,0,0,Jenn S.,"Merion Village, Columbus, OH",22,57,7
4.0,7/22/2015,"A small doorway (not physically, but at a glance it feels small because of the tables they setup in front of the restaurant) and a narrow building gives off the impression that you'll be packed elbow to elbow inside, but the reality was surprisingly different.  Upon entering, you can see that Becco is larger inside than it looks on the outside.  I took my fiance here for an evening of fine food and unlimited pastas.  The interior is nicely adorned with pots and pans upon a red brick wall by the front dining bar area, while in the back you have paintings of countrysides and a skylight window above your head.  A romantic place to eat and watch the sky above you slowly dim into the evening light.  I originally considered the unlimited pasta but sought to have their entree because you can add on the pastas as a mid course meal.  So I ordered their Porterhouse d'Agnello and my fiance had their Zuppa di Pesce Misto.  Anyone who enjoys seafood will like the Zuppa di Pesce Misto as it consists a bevy of fish and shellfish such as salmon, tuna, shrimp, and scallops.  The savory lobster brodo was very good.  The salmon was a bit overcooked for my taste, but it wasn't too dry on the inside to make it bad.  The Porterhouse d'Agnello smelled great, looked nice but once you cut into the lamb you find that it is mostly fat upon fat.  It took a lot of work and after trimming a good portion of the lamb, I found the meat and not congealing fat.  Maybe it was just the lamb I had that night which was super fatty, but it was by far the last thing I expected to be served.  I've never seen so much fat on a lamb before.  Come hungry as the unlimited pasta will surely fill you up.  We skipped appetizers as we both had the mid course pastas.  2 of them were fairly standard but the third, a linguini with lamb ragout was very memorable as a good balanced pasta with a slight gaminess to the lamb and the oils in the linguini gave a satisfying combination of flavors.  There wasn't any fat in the lamb ragout.  Service was a bit slow, my server was missing for a good part of the meal, but when he was around he was friendly and attentive.  At times it was hard to get any server's attention.  I don't know if I would come here for meals before a show as it may be rushed and I would hate to rush unlimited pasta.  Becco gets a 4.5 star rating.",2,0,0,Louis N.,"New York, NY",375,218,459
5.0,7/20/2015,"I only recently discovered Becco after a year of moving to the city - why hadn't I discovered this restaurant soon? If you love pasta like I do, this place is HEAVEN! Becco quickly became of my favorite restaurants in NYC.Their $22 Sinfonia pasta special is amazing. You get your choice of caesar salad or antipasto followed by unlimited amounts of the 3 different pasta specials of the day. The pastas are all hand-made, and you get unlimited of the chef's pasta. Three different waiters come around and serve the 3 pastas of the day onto your plate, right out of a huge hand-held pasta bowl one after the other. It's such an exciting experience. The quality of food for the price is unbeatable. I have been to Becco 3 times so far and ordered the chef's special each time. I tried a total of 9 different types of pasta and they have all been absolutely delicious. The pasta was some of the best Italian food I have ever eaten.You are also served with complimentary fresh olives and a bread basket containing bread sticks and rustic Italian breads, with a white bean hummus - which is absolutely amazing! Be careful to not get too full from the delicious bread!The only complaint was that the tables are too closed together. We were seated at a table for two in the middle of the restaurant and there wasn't much room between the tables.Service is phenomenal each time. The staffs are all personable, enthusiastic and extremely attentive.It's hard to beat the quality of food and service at Becco and I can't wait to go back again.

Caesar salad was garlicky and overpowering with anchovy and they sprinkle pecorino cheese on it - nobody knows how to make a real Caesar salad. I had the swordfish... Bland. My husband had steak... It was good. The side was broccoli stalks!! And don't get it wrong, it wasn't broccoli rabe. I've never had octopus salad with chopped onions. Nothing authentic about this place.

We got seated uptairs a few minutes after we arrived, and got complimentary bread and breadsticks - which were bland and with the spread they had, I didn't think it gave a rich enough flavor for us to grad anymore bread. Our salad was massive, but it was tasty. I didn't finish mine so I could finish my main course. I had the duck, which was cooked medium rare - but I really should have had it medium well. It was really red and the fat was just too much so I didn't really enjoy it. My Moscato was sweet, just the way I liked since they didn't have any Riesling in stock. My boyfriend had the hanger steak, which we know it is suppose to be charred, but it overpowered the steak, which we didn't like either.

Everything came out together which was annoying. Salad was decent nothing extraordinary. Mozzarella appetizer had pine nuts garnished on top which was nice. My husband ordered the duck which was too rare and he had to send back. Waiter didn't even come over to see why or offer any apologies. I got the stuffed peppers which were very bland, no flavor. Had to ask for grated cheese to give it some flavor. For dessert we shared ""warm"" Apple strudel and cinnamon gelato, both were allegedly made in house but were horrible, tasteless.

On the night we were there, the 3 pasta selections were farfalle with a tomato sauce, spinach pasta with some kind of white creamy sauce (that I could have licked off the plate!) and linguine with a garlic olive oil (which we got without the clams) All of them were delicous and the waiters will keep filling your plate if you let them. This is a great deal for the price and it includes a salad.  Oh and don't forget the wine! We got a bottle of Montepulciano from the $29 bottle list and it was very good. They have an extensive wine list with much more expensive wines but the $29 list was decent. We shared the dessert sampler which was also very good.

4.0,5/21/2015,I was in New York for business and we had a large group of 20 for dinner. A friend had recommended Becco so we gave it a try. It was a short walk from our hotel in Times Square. Despite reservations we had to wait a half hour before being seated. The place was packed.  The menu was good with half our group ordering the pasta special with the other half ordering other items from the menu. All wines on their list were priced at $29 which is very reasonable for a bottle of wine in a restaurant especially in New York.   Becco was good but not great. I'd like to give it a try with a smaller group next time.,0,0,0,John W.,"Edina, MN",0,67,8

3.0,5/19/2015,"I had high expectations for Becco and am a fan of some of the other Bastianich restaurants, but overall the food was mediocre.  We sat upstairs and I was a bit turned off by how crowded the tables felt next to one another, though I quickly cheered up after a very solid fried calamari appetizer that was well-seasoned, light and crispy. We gave the unlimited pasta + antipasto for $22.95 option a try (what a deal if you're hungry enough!) and ordered one of the affordable $29 bottles of wine, but the calamari ended up being the favorite dish. The antipasto wasn't anything special, and sadly neither were any of the pastas. Nothing was bad, but none of the fusilli with pesto, seafood risotto, or spaghetti with tomato sauce stood out as winners.That being said, the meal was inexpensive and the staff was great. They took the ""unlimited"" piece of the meal seriously, coming back around to offer seconds and thirds to whoever was still hungry, which was appreciated. Ultimately, I wouldn't go to Becco for a special occasion, but if you just want a bunch of pasta and wine for cheap this would fit the bill. Perhaps I would have enjoyed the meal more if I had had more appropriate expectations.",3,0,0,Alex S.,"New York, NY",20,91,54

5.0,5/12/2015,"I LOVE Becco. My family and I have come here multiple times for a pre-show meal.  The staff as Becco are accustomed to the theater crowd and their service reflects that. They are able to provide your food in a timely, enjoyable, manner, while not making you feel rushed to leave. They have typical Italian pasta, meat, and fish dishes, and an extensive collection of alcohol. The complimentary bread basket has a variety of corn bread, bread sticks, and pieces from a regular loaf with delicious hummus dips and olive oil sauces.  There is also a pasta sampler option that I believe costs $19.95.  There are three pasta options, which vary depending on the day, and you can order a Caesar salad or seafood antipasti appetizer with it.  The waitstaff come around with large pans of the different pastas and will serve you however much of it you want. Everything is very fresh and it's convenient to have an all you can eat option because you can continue eating more of one pasta you like, and avoid the others if you don't care for them. My favorite pasta dishes there have been mushroom ravioli, meat lasagna, pastas with a pomodoro sauce and one with a garlic and oil sauce with broccoli.  Like I said, the pastas change every day, but there are plenty of other options on the menu if you're not interested in the sampler.  It has been convenient for my family and I in the past, and would be a great spot to go to on a date.",1,0,0,Katherine D.,"New York, NY",532,255,131
4.0,5/11/2015,I was hesitant at first as it seemed touristy but the food was good. It wasn't fancy and portions generous.

3.0,5/11/2015,"This place is bumpinnnn, no joke. Be prepared to possibly be squished in a little corner and wait on a long line for the bathroom....but hey, its a good sign right? This place is kind of touristy too, fair warning. A lot of people come here  before or after a Broadway show. What I really like about Becco is their pasta feature. If you order an entree, for an additional 9 bucks you can take part in the all you can eat pastas option. They have three different types of pastas (which differ daily) and waiters come around and plop it on your plate (you can have as much as you want). On this day they had a spinach/ricotta ravioli, penne vodka with shrimp and a vegetable pasta in light oil sauce. My favorite was the vegetable pasta, it had generous chucks of all fresh veggies and it was very good. The penne vodka was decent, the sauce was kind of runny which turned me off but the shrimp were cooked just right. The ravioli was average to me, to be honest, my costco ravioli tastes the same if not a little better but it wasn't bad by any means. For my entree I went with one of their specials, braised beef short ribs with mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes kind of sucked, no taste really. The braised beed short ribs were marinated in a wine sauce and were very tender. The meat was pretty much falling off the bone but they were fatty which I don't like. Another great thing Becco offers is an entire page of bottled wines for only $29. That's almost of unheard of for NYC and the selection is pretty big too. There's definitely a lot of pros of Becco, I would come back just for the three pasta sampling's alone.

2.0,5/10/2015,"Dinner after a play was a total disappointment.  First, the restaurant was overly crowded.  Tables were jammed into every possible space.  We were shoulder to shoulder with the adjacent party.  And it was noisy and hot.  If you want a pleasant and somewhat relaxing dinner, this is not the place. The food was nothing more than average.  I had the peperoni ripieno.  Frankly, it was indistinguishable from Stoufer's frozen stuffed peppers.  My wife had a chicken dish which was equally uninspiring.  It seems they push the three pasta deal and the other dishes are an after thought.  A Caesar salad is included with entrees. What I received was well below par. The lettuce had brown edges and the dressing was no better than a grocery store bottle of dressing. I have to think that if Joe Bastianich had tasted my entree, he would have thrown it in the trash ala Master Chef.This was not our fist visit to Becco's and it seems that is it getting worse and over commercialized. The one thing I will say is that the wait staff was very good, attentive and efficient.  They did the best they could with the circumstances given.Avoid dining at Becco's when there are so many other better alternatives unless you want a crowded, noisy, hot environment with food that makes Olive Garden look like Michelin star cuisine.",1,0,0,Bill D.,"Trenton, NJ",0,22,0
1.0,5/9/2015,"TOURIST TRAP - Never Again. I almost always avoid this area of restaurants in NYC and after tonight I remember why. My brother and I were getting the family together for Mother's Day - typical show and pre theater dinner situation. Being this place was associated with Lidia how bad could it be? Wrong!First off the place was mobbed which I guess for a Saturday should be expected but they literally pack people in here like a sardine can. The table they gave us for five people and the way it was shoved into a corner at best should of seated maybe three people. The floor manager when I questioned the size of the table basically laughed at me - I could see the service here was gonna be great (sarcasm). Major issue we all had was the waiter refused any of our requests to add or change any of the sides that came with our dish. Any restaurant I have ever been to has NEVER had this issue so why this place did really made me suspicious in how ""freshly"" they prepared their plates. His reasoning was because the kitchen only had enough risotto or mashed potatoes to go with each dish it was paired with - what does that mean ????Ok run down of the food ...Fried Calamari - Actually pretty good a bit salty but good. The sauce was also good.Burrata - Terrible. It was like melted - Not plump at all where you could cut into it. Caesar Salad - Terrible. The lettuce was clearly not fresh some of my pieces were browned. Wilted, under dressed and scraps of dry croutons. Zuppa di Pesce Misto - All the shrimp and fillets were overly fishy and even though I was wary of how fresh it was I was so hungry I ate the shrimp and left the fillets. The scallops were good. The polenta was bland. Veal Piccata - My husband had this mind you the most expensive of the meals at the table. The smallest veal pieces ever with nothing but a butter dish size side of watery spinach. Short Ribs - This my mom had and the portion was a decent size and the beef was actually very tender but she didn't care of the sides - this is the case where she had asked if the sweet potato mash could be swapped out for the risotto and they said no.Galletto al Forno - My dad said the chicken was dry but the risotto was a winner. I tried some myself and agreed that spoonful of risotto was the best thing I ate that whole meal. Wish they served that as a main dish with scallops. Peperoni Ripieni - My brother had this and seemed to enjoy it. The portion was a decent size and it looked pretty interesting.Desert was not great - the apple streusel was terrible the apple filling tasted artificial - my parents cookies were dry and hard and the Gelato my brother and I both had was a weird texture and the flavors were not strong. Personally I think Lidia should be ashamed to have her name associated with this restaurant - her cooking show and cookbooks evoke such wonderful flavors and a sense of hospitality. Both things that cannot be found at Becco.The customer service and the kitchen need to be reviewed here unless it wants to continue just being a machine that pumps out generic food to people who don't know any better for their hard earned dollars.",15,7,2,Anna C.,"Islip, NY",99,99,529

The garlic sticks were crunchy and had a perfect roasted garlic taste.- The potato gnocchi: The gnocchi was some of the best I've had.

And then, it came the selection of pasta, penne with bolognese sauce, ravioli with mushrooms and spaghetti with tomato. Ravioli with mushrooms were dry, spaghetti had more garlic than tomato, penne were decent although shouldn't have had any green pea.

2.0,4/30/2015,"Always a pleasant surprise when restaurants meet or exceed the expected bar you have walking in.  Sad when they don't.  This was one of those times.  Seating and service were not a problem.  The food, to me, was.  We started with the meatball and arancini appetizers.  Meatballs was baseball sized and very meaty.  Good stuff.  Arancini were not quite golf ball sized, tasteless with no meat or vegetables inside.  Just cheese.  Not worth ordering at any price let alone 3 dollars a piece.  I totally agree with other posters that say stay away from the pasta special.  While I did order an entree I added the pasta specials for the additional 9 dollars.  First was the stuffed shells.  I love those ricotta filled pastas but sadly not tonight.  The shells were dry and a little chewy on the edges as in overcooked and the cheese filling had a citrus flavor to it that threw it completely off.  If you like that flavor then you would definitely enjoy the amount of cheese filling they put in each shell.  Stuffed!  I would say we are traditional Italian eaters and no one at our table of 3 asked for more stuffed shells.  The pasta prima vera was the tastiest of the pastas for me but also overdone in oil or butter with not enough vegetables.  The pasta itself was perfectly al dente so I did ask for more with more of the vegetables which was not a problem for the server.  The third pasta was a hand made fettucini in a veal bolognese sauce.  Again the pasta was perfectly cooked with a scrumptious texture.  However, the bolognese had nutmeg in it.  Ugh.  Definitely not for me.  Lastly was my entree of sausage and peppers.  The two links of sausage were delicious with the peppers and onions cooked nicely.  You just never know when you are going to bite into one of the hot peppers versus the standard peppers.  I thought it was a good dish overall and would order it again.  Yet, I can get good sausage and peppers elsewhere in the city and would probably check out other restaurants the next time I come up for a show. I thought I would give it 3 stars however the 2 star description of ""I've experienced better"" is definitely the case.",0,0,0,John R.,"Annapolis, MD",1,32,1

3.0,4/17/2015,We planned a pre-show dinner at Becco and I suspect that most patrons dining were headed to a show afterwards. To say that the restaurant was packed full would be an understatement. We sat upstairs and the dining room was so full we saw a couple tables that were halfway situated in the dining room and halfway situated in the walkway to the kitchen. I'd be pretty peeved if that was my table but clearly it's quantity over quality that becco is aiming for. The issue with having the tables squished so close to each other is that the servers have to strategically maneuver their way around. Kudos to the waitstaff there. They seemed to work their butts off. Rushing around turning tables over quickly. It's a well oiled machine. We ordered the 3 pasta special that comes with antipasto. The antipasto was nothing to write home about. I imagine that the kitchen has these prepped and ready to go somewhat like a banquet hall. The pasta was much better than the first course. The pasta with clams was particularly good as was the farfalle tomato sauce.  The servers come around offering seconds so you won't be leaving hungry.

3.0,4/5/2015,"I ate here on Saturday night after a strong recommendation from a friend who eats here every time they visit NYC. We had an 8pm reservation and we were seated right away when we arrived. First of all, the tables are tiny! They have to slide the table over so that the person sitting near the wall can squeeze in. The bread box, olives, and oil they bring out is tasty, but it takes up most of the table space. Logistically, it's just a little bit challenging. Our waiter seemed uninterested and bored. He was present in the beginning but then disappeared for longer and longer stretches at the night went out. I looked at the menu online before our reservation and had an idea of what I wanted. However, when we listened to all the specials and the pasta trio for the evening, I decided to have the pasta trio mainly for the seafood risotto part of it. The food was good and very tasty. Once our food was brought out, we did not see our waiter for nearly an hour! The pasta is supposed to be unlimited, so I figured I would focus on the risotto and just taste the others. One was a spaghetti in marinara sauce, which was fine but not anything special, the second was rigatoni with broccoli, which was tastier than the spaghetti, the seafood risotto was very good. I highly recommend it. I didn't eat much of the others and kept my eye out for the server walking around with the risotto dish and serving patrons the risotto. He did not come back for OVER 40 MINUTES. When one of the employees came and refilled my water, he asked if I would like any more of the pasta and which one. I had to wait over FIFTEEN MINUTES after, and another person asking me if I wanted anything more, before I finally got more risotto. At that point, I was not very pleased.  The waiter acted annoyed that I asked for more of what was supposed to be an unlimited dish with table service. Overall, it is a cute restaurant with very good food. If you don't like to eat in very close proximity to others, it's probably not for you.

4.0,3/27/2015,"My wife and I came to NYC for the first time to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary. After checking several restaurants near our hotel and the Broadway show we were seeing. We settled on Becco. We made reservations, got dressed up, arrived early, and we're ready for a special night on the town. We were greeted very nicely and were asked to wait in the very crowded bar area. We waited for around 15-20 minutes (not too bad considering how busy it was.) The service was very good and the food was amazing. I had the shrimp, scallops, sea-bass with polenta. My wife had a chicken meal. After I finished my delicious plate, my wife had me try a bite of her chicken and I was sorely disappointed. Yes, sorely disappointed that I didn't order the same thing - it was simply the best chicken I've ever eaten! The skin was crisp and so full of flavor, I was amazed that, that could be done with chicken. The only complaint I had was that we were sat in the corner of the bar at the smallest table in the place. It was so small we had to remove the salt and pepper shaker, as well as the bread box just to have room for our drinks. I felt like I had been a bad boy and I was being put in time out. The table shouldn't even be an option except for the customer that they hate the most. Sitting there really did not make it a pleasant experience and their dining room looked so lovely too. :( Overall the food was great but I do not recommend eating in the bar area unless you are in a time crunch.   We would go back and ask not to sit in the bar.",1,2,0,Aaron S.,"Mobile, AL",5,12,21

4.0,3/21/2015,"Great restaurant recommended to us before our matinee show. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because you couldn't share the pasta special. I get it, but I'd rather have the freedom to order 1 pasta dish and share dishes. There weren't too many pasta choices without going the special route. If they'd had a choice for 1 serving but you could do what you wanted with it... Besides that food and service was excellent!",0,0,0,Shanna G.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",1,26,16

He was rude and wasnt friendly ! So after 50 minutes we got a table , and the waiter took forever to bring us the menus, forever to take our order , and guess what? FOREVER TO BRING US OUR FOOD !

5.0,3/16/2015,"There's two places in the vicinity of Times Square that offer unlimited pasta while you're there. One is Becco. The other doesn't deserve to have its name mentioned, and I apologize for even referencing it in my review. I've been to Becco several times in my life. However, I had no been in quite a few years. Thus I was excited to head back. It didn't disappoint. Becco always has a high volume of people inside, and manages everything smoothly. We were seated right away and our server took care of us immediately. They have a wide arrange of wines, beers and cocktails which will satisfy everyone. As I mentioned they have an unlimited pasta special which comes with a seafood appetizer or a Caesar salad. Three different pastas. They know how to fill people up, with the amount of delicious bread they supply you with as well. Come hungry if you plan to get the pasta. My girlfriend ordered the swordfish and squash pasta entree. She gave me a huge chunk of the swordfish on my already enormous plate of food. It was excellent and very well prepared. After two rounds of the three delicious pastas, a bread basket and a half, and a big ole piece of swordfish, I called it quits. My girlfriend hadn't finished her swordfish and I left some bread behind. My girlfriend never heard me say ""No Mas"", but I guess there's a first time for everything. You win this time Becco.

4.0,3/13/2015,"Years ago, we were looking for a place to meet friends prior to taking in a Broadway show. Some careful research (thanks Yelpers) showed that this was a good spot - reasonable prices, good quality and the ability to get you in an out in time to make curtain time. We all met in the slightly cramped second floor dining area and for efficiency sake everyone ordered the three pasta deal. Honestly, I'm not a fan of ""all you can eat"" meals but I was hungry and I went along with the program. However, if every restaurant's all you can eat offerings were this good, I would be willing to be converted. I tried a small taste of all three but focused on the amazing Risotto with Porcini and Shiitake mushrooms - ta die for! My friends also enjoyed their pastas - equally split among the three with the classic Bolognese with Peas getting high praise.With a salad and some vino (not too much, can't fall asleep during act 2) our bill was a modest $36 / person with appropriate tip. We also went back a few times on Sunday for lunch and ordered ala carte items (wife chicken, me shrimp) and they were well prepared and full of flavor. Priced right too. I am torn between a 4 and 5 star review because my expectations were high going in (celebrity chef status can do that) but I have just dined at another name-brand NYC eatery and it was clearly 5 stars - slightly better, for sure, but better so I'll stick with 4 stars with a strong positive recommendation for this mid-town Italian gem.",1,0,1,Dom M.,"Denville, NJ",182,375,597

It wasn't much of a wait before being seated and our server is helpful.  we were assured that all the dishes can be served for our schedule, and they actually did. We started with their complimentary artisan bread with olives and humus spread. We  shared antipasto Misto and grilled calf liver with polenta and caramelized onion. It was great! Calf liver is juicy and tender, and the rest were tasty too. We had more than enough time to walk back to our theatre. I am amazed with their service at that hour because it was quiet busy. I noticed that they have two pieces of glass on their roof, so the lighting was great during brunch, feeling quiet delightful during a gloomy winter. Restaurant looks nice, have a coat check and private dining for bigger parties.I couldn't asked for more!

My dinner was a pesto pasta, a spaghetti with marinara and a shrimp and lobster risotto.

We start to give orders (to the limited menu) and they don't do anything to accompany dietary restrictions, not even oil and vinegar on a salad because I can't have Cesar dressing. The menu was so limited that it took me forever to decide. The flavor mixes on the menu are horrible, once ordered I got the burrata and the toast it came with was burnt to a crisp! We ordered the Unlimited pasta, we wanted penne no shrimp, the first time they came we all got about 4 noodles, when we asked for more of that specific pasta it was NOT penne vodka, it was penne with marinara sauce we talked to the server and he wouldn't take care of it he was very rude, then come back and it was the same watery sauce with a dash of cream. It was not the penne alla vodka I ordered, what a waste of money! When me and several others entrees arrived the risotto was not even cooked it was raw! Like it never saw any heat! Asked for more, it came back still Raw!!! My water was not filled once during the meal! The restaurant was 110 degrees and water would be nice, the first round of water was like warm and that was all I received the whole 2 hours of this horrible experience! The place is cramped to the point where we couldn't sit comfortable because people were on our backs! I work and go to school for the hospitality industry. This place was a disgrace and I would never come back even if you paid me, horrible service, horrible menu, horrible food!

2.0,3/5/2015,"Maybe I just came on an off night given all the rave reviews here, but I was NOT impressed by Becco.The concept of the Sinfonia di Paste is great - for $22.95, you get all you can eat of a selection of 3 daily changing pastas with your choice of antipasto misto or caesar salad. However, the execution is just poor. We started with a huge complimentary bread basket filled with foccacia, crusty white bread, and thin crunchy cheese breadsticks. While the breadsticks were pretty tasty and the white bread was standard, the foccacia tasted stale and the bean spread that came with the basket was unappetizing. The side of olives was a nice touch tough although they would've been better if they were marinated in some spice blend.It got worse with the antipasto misto that I chose - the 2 biter skate fish piece was served dead COLD and the small octopus pieces were rubbery. The rest of the stuff on my plate - a slice of zucchini, a small ball of mozzarella, eggplant tapenade, etc. - tasted like they had been sitting in cold oil and was just gross.The three pasta dishes on deck for the night were orecchiette with bacon and cabbage, gnocchi with cream sauce, and spaghetti with tomato and basil, ranked from worst to best of the worst. They do offer a substitution of a vegetarian pasta for those with dietary restrictions, which is what I got for the orecchiette since I can't eat bacon.Unfortunately, the orecchiette was too chewy and the cabbage mix was just bland and tasteless. The ""gnocchi"" wasn't really gnocchi as I know it - small pillowy clouds of goodness. Instead, the gnocchi was biscuit shaped with a crispy top. An interesting take for sure, but not what I was expecting and lacking on the flavor front here as well. The spaghetti was the best of the bunch, but I definitely did not get a homemade taste and was hoping for some stronger basil notes.Service was all over the place. Sometimes, we would have waiters coming over to us very frequently when we weren't ready, and at other times, when we really wanted to get someone's attention, nobody was in sight. We also had multiple waiters, which I guess is a necessity if they are carrying different pasta dishes to serve from, but it was a bit confusing.Overall, I would say check it out if you're really curious and willing to spend $30 to take the risk, but don't expect high quality just because it carries the Bastianich name.",5,1,0,Nameeta K.,"New York, NY",237,188,10

We were a table for 12, received two plates of extremely small appetizers that would be enough for literally two people. Pasta, was amazing! (fill up on it), and for dinner, I do not think there was enough food for the price. Of course, the steak plate was probably one decent size steak cut up into tiny pieces, and the bottom of the plate was filled with risotto (or something similar)..we asked for another and there was a lot less steak on the plate. Dessert was not enough to fill 12 spoons of diners, they gave small pieces of different desserts (maybe about 5 on a plate, two plates).

2.0,2/17/2015,"So many mixed feelings. **we were seated once when we arrived and did not like the table located directly under an air duct. we quickly asked if we could switch tables after the reluctant response from the server about having the air shut off so I wasn't shaking the whole meal. We then went downstairs and waited by the bar. I had a blood orange martini - delicious. The fella had some type of minty drink that he enjoyed as well** Now, on to the meal. The bread came out and our favorite was the bread sticks. Crunchy and flavorful. I also took a liking to the white bean dip they bring out with it. For starters my boyfriend ordered the bresaola and I the calamari. He liked his bresoala and the calamari was delicious, except the sauce. Usually this type of sauce is spicy but not hot enough for me to have to take a water break with each bite, too much. We both also had a Caesar as it came with our main dish. Tasted fresh but bland, I had to give it a swish of salt and pepper. Now came the main dishes, A veal parm for him and the pasta special for me. The veal parm was good but I don't remember him mentioning anything special. The pasta for the day was a lasagna, pappardelle with broccoli and a penne with parmesan (they called it something fancier but i don't remember, it was penne with parmesian..nothing more or less.) I was not satisfied. I had a huge tooth for pasta that day and even after I left I still wanted pasta. Each of them were bland and lacked any type of flavor.The décor in here is lacking. Its such a tight space with everyone cramped on top of each other. The servers and patrons were literally rubbing elbows while dinning and serving. The service was also sub par. There was what looked like 1000 people working here yet nothing came without request, and anyone who ordered a bottle of wine poured it themselves. I observed a few employees literally cutting people off in the narrow hallways (because they aren't wide enough for two people to walk through). My boyfriend informed me after we left that in our reservation notes he specifically asked for a nicely placed table and for desert with a candle to be brought out at the end of our meal. Neither request was fulfilled. As stated earlier in my review we had to switch tables and were asked if we wanted to order dessert.

The waitress was able to help us pick a bottle of wine.  We wanted pasta and that is what we all had. We got the unlimited pasta option where there is three different pasta served to you. That night we had penne in red sauce,  veal bolognaise sauce,  yoki. The only one I was not a big fan of was the veal bolognaise.  It was under seasoned.  We had to add salt and my friends are not pick on salt. We also had desserts cheese cake,  chocolate moose cake and chocolate cotta. Overall it was a great night.  Took a star away for the one pasta dish that needed salt.",2,0,1,Jen S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,41,48
1.0,1/27/2015,"If you are expecting an exceptional dining experience just because this restaurant is owned by Lidia, then you will be sorely disappointed. The decor is dated, the plates used are those that you'd find in a diner. Speaking of diners, I've had better pasta at a diner. Shame on you Lidia - no doubt their 3 daily pasta special is their big moneymaker as it is simply mushy, lacking in any taste, and watery. It's no wonder why the staff pushes it. None of these seem to be of made-to-order quality but more along the lines of what you'd get at an all-you-can-eat buffet table. Then there's the service. While for the most part adequate - watching the management staff hang around the bar, helping themselves to various wines and adding shots to their espressos, having the wait staff bring them various dishes of antipasto while they chit-chat was simply unbelievable - it was clear the place was poorly run. I don't mind dropping over $100 for a good meal but I have never before felt cheated by a celebrity chef until I ate here. Tourists will probably like this place but that's probably because that's exactly what this place is - just another overpriced restaurant that doles out mediocre food to the masses.

It was our first time in New York and first Broadway theater experience, so when I was given the duty of making a reservation for our pre-theater dinner, I was clueless. I think I ran across Becco on a couple blogs and such after simply googling ""pre theater dinner"". Glad I made this choice because it was incredible! Don't go expecting a menu full of pastas (if you want that, there's always Olive Garden). This is authentic and quite a well thought-out menu. I had the chicken with vegetable risotto - delish!

A lot of the red meat items on the menu had a medium rare requirement. After lots of help from the waiter, he recommended something that could be cooked medium but still holding the flavor.

My bar was pretty low by now).Service: the waiters are clearly under pressure to move the diners as quickly as possible.  They were dressed rather slovenly which I can accept at a fast food joint -not one where the average entrees price is $30.This place is the the restaurant equivalent of a puppy mill.This place used to be good (I last ate there in the early 90s).  Its time has past (just like the seafood in my risotto).  Lidia Bastiianich should be embarrassed to be the owner of this place.",1,0,0,mei n.,"Westchester County, NY",0,17,0

2.0,1/10/2015,"The good: we all ordered the unlimited pasta and it was really good. There was a nice variety, the pasta was fresh, and it offered favors you wouldn't find at any other Italian restaurant. There was also a $25 wine list which was pretty incredible. There were tons of options and, despite the fact that everyone in our party of 7 had different tastes in wine, everyone was happy.The bad: the staff and service were laughably terrible. We had a 6:30 reservation. We were there a little early so we checked in and the woman at the front told us to come back closer to 6:30. We went across the street to a bar, came back at 6:30 and our table wasn't ready. There really isn't enough room for all the people waiting around and the coat check girl and door girl were trying to herd people around. Of course, neither of them were pleasant or appropriate. The staffs pleasantness got progressively worse the further you went. The woman checking people in was nasty. I get that she was overwhelmed, but you can be busy and still manage to talk to people like human beings.  Just as we were about to leave and go somewhere else, we were called. We talked back to our table, I was shoved by a bus boy (you know, instead if saying excuse me), and we sat down. Our waiter was good and they acknowledged we should have been sat sooner.The excuse we kept getting was that they were trying to seat people with theater tickets first. Look, you're a restaurant in the theater district. You're not new at this game. People going to the theater is not an excuse for your inability to stay organized. There is no point in taking reservations if you're not going to honor them and I hardly thing last night was the only time they were in that situation.My final conclusion is that the food was good, but the attitude and disorganization from the staff wasn't worth it.

The we had a bottle of wine for $25! It was good wine too, and when we were finished we got another bottle and stayed for an extra hour, because the ambiance was so warm and not too loud.

This would have been fine, if it wasn't so crowded that you could barely move. The whole place was so crammed with people that it was truly unbearable. I felt sorry for those who were having dinner in this area, because there was no way they could eat their dinner without being bumped and knocked into constantly. There was only one lane to enter and leave this small, narrow area, and you had to wait until it cleared before you could venture a go down the path.. this true for clientele and wait staff alike. A member of our party had to use the restroom and the line to use it was so long, it was like being at Madison Square Garden. Additionally, the restrooms are unisex and she commented that they were absolutely filthy, and if we wanted to maintain our appetite, avoid using them, which is exactly what I did. We arrived at our table, which was ok, but again, the dining room was so crammed full of people, it greatly lessened the experience. The food was good, but Becco needs to rethink the design of their space, and try to make the dining experience pleasurable for diners, and manageable for those who work there. I will only return with a reservation after 8PM, as it had greatly calmed down at this time, and you could actually walk through the restaurant without feeling like you were in a crowded bar.  It was such a hectic and chaotic environment at 6:30 that all I wanted to do was leave. If I had another place to go, we would have left. Not a pleasant way to dine. More stressful than anything. I know it's all about making money, but really, do they need to be so obvious about it?

On an extremely busy holiday evening there was never a moment our table was unattended, and more importantly we never felt rushed. If rating on service alone this review would still be five stars.The $25 wine list is exceptional and is in itself a reason to visit the restaurant. There is a notable assortment of wines to choose from, and it is nice to be able to try them without paying a standard markup. The list is not filled with $7 bottles. For example the La Mozza I Perazzi is available for $25 and retails for about $17 locally. We had decided to try a (new to us) Barbera d'Alba, which was fantastic. The list invites you to explore new wines you may not have ordered if they had been priced traditionally.All three of us ordered the pasta special. The three pastas were all excellent, but the star was a pumpkin ravioli wrapped in cocoa pasta. The refills came fast and fresh. A very nice touch was that when offered a penne with grilled shrimp my brother politely declined, as he doesn't eat shellfish. The server immediately came back with a pan of the same pasta but without the shrimp. It is this type of care that makes one want to become a repeat customer.The desserts were as delicious as the rest of the meal.

It took another 15 minutes to actually get the pasta and by then they actually ran out of clams for the spaghetti and clams.  No one apologized to us or made any effort to make it right.  It seems they are so busy that they really don't care about customer service.",0,1,0,Alex G.,"Diamond Bar, CA",0,12,2

3.0,12/26/2014,"We had great expectations for Becco as a pre-theater dinner.  They were very charming when we arrived and were gracious to us when one couple of our foursome was 20 minutes late.  No issues, they were very friendly.  As we waited for the other couple, we ordered a bottle of wine from their $25 wine list (great idea) and an order of mussels with green beans and garlic.  Wow, that was a hit, small mussels, perfectly prepared.  They were not overcooked, but rather a perfect combination of plump, juicy, texture and flavor.  We then ordered their Sinfonia di Pasta.  It comes with a starter of either a Caesar salad or Antipasta Misto and three types of pasta prepared as chef's choice.  We got both starters, and the Caesar was average at best.  However, the Antipasta Misto was excellent, hands down the best I have had in many years.  It was an interesting assortment of marinated & grilled vegetables, cheese, and assorted seafood.  Then it was down hill from there.  The pastas were below average.  There was a butternut squash ravioli with brown butter, sage sauce.  The filling was like a very airy mousse, so it had no bite to it.  It didn't do it for me.  We also had a penne in a red sauce with shrimp.  A bit over cooked and a very average red sauce, but this was the best of the three.  The final was a fettuccine with garlic and broccoli.  It was like eating pasta with no sauce at all, was very dry and uninspiring.  My partner had Zuppa di Pesce Misto, which featured a perfectly cooked sea scallop, slightly overcooked shrimp, nice rare tuna, salmon and white polenta in a tomato lobster broth.  It was nicely flavored and was a good choice.  We also ordered a side of Scafata.  It was like a lump of green oatmeal...need I say more. We were time crunched to get to the theater, and the restaurant also wanted us out for another seating, but they were very slow to clear our table, bring our check and help us on our way.  That said, the service was friendly and good.   I might return to try this restaurant again, because there was some excellent parts of this meal, but I can't give it more than 3 stars because several things were below average.",3,0,0,Steve S.,"Cazenovia, NY",1,10,2
5.0,12/24/2014,"Becco gets five stars as a pre-theatre restaurant option.  I've been probably 10 times and only once was it not before a show.  If you're just looking for a place for dinner I would say the food is 3.5 stars maybe pushed up to 4 by the service and huge list of $25 bottles of wine.  You do need to book a few weeks in advance for the pre-theatre 5:30-6:30 window.We always opt for the unlimited 3-pasta special.  It comes with a salad or antipasti for around $26.  Servers walk around with huge saute pans of the pasta and serve you Rodizio style until you've had enough.  It allows you get in and out quickly and, most importantly, the pastas are always fresh and delicious.  It should also be noted how accommodating they are.  There is typically one pasta with meat and they are happy to specially make a small dish of it vegetarian.In addition to the army of servers and waiters, there is always a couple of managers walking around (the restaurant is has several rooms and is deceptively huge).  The one time I can actually recall having an issue with service, one of the managers took care of it immediately and painlessly.The most important indicator for me is that we keep going back.  As soon as I book theatre tickets I immediately make a reservation here.  To me there is no better option in the theatre district.",1,0,0,Michael L.,"Brooklyn, NY",27,38,23
4.0,12/23/2014,"Date of service: Oct 27, 2014Meal: Dinner, dine inAll Ratings out of 10:Quality of food: 8Food to Spend Value: 7Quality of Service: 8Overall Rating: 8If you have read any of my reviews, you already know that I am a bit snobbish when it comes to eating Italian food out (something about being half Italian and making better food at home than I can typically eat out). When in New York City, though, I expect to find good Italian food, though I don't always agree with others on what classifies as good Italian and have been disappointed frequently. Becco came highly recommended, so my coworker and decided to head over for dinner and see what they were made of.Becco is famous for their unlimited table side service of the 3 fresh pastas of the day. I have only been this one time, but evidently the pastas rotate on a daily basis. One of the more popular dinner options is a meal that includes either a salad or antipasto and all you can eat pasta, which is ultimately what my coworker ordered. What I discovered, though, is that you can order one of the main entrees and still get all you can eat pasta on the side, albeit with a smaller plate. While thinking through the options we ordered a smoked mozzarella appetizer that was a special that night. Holy cow was it tasty, and along with the complimentary bread, was a wonderful way to start the meal. The table next to me had a veal parmesan that covered the entire plate, and since I love a good veal parm, I decided to order it as my entrée and have the unlimited pasta on the side. On this particular night the pastas were spaghetti, rigatoni with a veal Bolognese sauce, and ravioli. The veal was outstanding and had a wonderful flavor with the right balance of meat, sauce, and cheese, and the pastas were also quite delicious, in particular the rigatoni. I was quite full when I was done and very satisfied.During the meal, we did have one instance where some pasta that my coworker was served was cold, and he mentioned it to our waiter. The pasta was immediately replaced, and because they felt bad, they offered us a complimentary dessert sampler at the end of our meal. We would not have ordered dessert because we were so full, but since it was a free surprise and looked utterly amazing, we of course had to eat it, and all 4 items were utterly delicious.For NYC, I felt like the prices here were reasonable, though some menu items were definitely more expensive (my veal parm was definitely on the higher end). The unlimited pasta is a tremendous deal, and the value per spend is quite good. I left absolutely stuffed. The wait staff was attentive, knowledgeable, and quickly addressed the only issue we had, so overall I was extremely happy with the service. For a Monday night the place was absolutely packed, so I am obviously not the only person who thinks Becco is a great value.

4.0,12/7/2014,"I had heard many great things about Becco, and I wasn't disappointed. I came to the restaurant with my cousins as a birthday dinner. They have a whole selection of wines for $25 a bottle- I haven't found a deal like that in many other places around the city. This, along with the pasta special, and the attentive service, were what pushed the rating up to a 4.The white bean spread that comes with the bread is straight up heavenly. Between the 3 of us, we went through 3 or 4 of the spreads... couldn't help ourselves.We ordered the calamari appetizer. The red sauce is fresh with a kick of spice, and the calamari are not too heavily breaded- just right. I will say, it was HUGE- more than enough for the 3 of us... enough to serve a party of 4 or 5 for sure.One of my cousins got the pasta special, and looking back on it, I wish I had, too. They give you the choice of a caesar salad (very good) or antipasto mixto, and then unlimited pasta from a choice of 3 different ones they have on special that night. Among the special pastas was linguine with clams- the clams were huge (and delicious, I snuck one and immediately envied my cousin's choice), and the pasta was in a nice, light sauce. My other cousin and I shared the rib eye. While I have to say, it was quite large (more than enough for the two of us to share), I found it a bit dry. I'd say it was definitely lacking in  some sort of sauce or something. I wasn't too impressed with it and I would say its not worth the price.The other downside is the cramped space. We were in the tavern side and kept getting bumped into by passers by and people standing at the bar. Multiple times. Great for them that they're so busy, but it was frustrating.

When I eat there all diets are off, its all about the food. Somehow everything is cooked to perfection, not over cooked or under cooked just perfect. Same with the sauce not to much or to little perfect. Even the olives are gently swimming in olive oil and herbs with just a touch of pepper enough for a bite. Who would think? It an experience to eat here I wish it were easier to get a table I would be there more often, its my first go to pre theater. The fish is excellent as well I usually try the special of the day unless its shellfish (allergy) never disappointed.

The hustle and bustle might distract at first, but you'll settle in after a glass of wine when you find yourself keeping up with the chatter. My friend and I shared a few dishes. I really enjoyed the fried mozzarella and pesto, and would describe both as meaty. Rich, filling and flavorful. I wanted to try a new wine while I was there, and asked our server for a suggestion. He asked me a few questions and then said ""I'll bring you something to try."" I expected him to bring me a sample, but he brought me a whole glass. I liked it enough, but felt obligated to choose it. I saw him sample other tables, so felt like I was disregarded in a way. Overall it's a good experience, quality food, but a little pricey.

After you try the pastas you are invited to grab more of your favorite pasta from the three. It was a very filling meal, thepastas were delicious. Every meal also came with Cesar salad and vegetables.The only thing I thought that was weird was that the pasta dishes it came with a plate of vegetables which were hard to tell what they were, I think there was potatoes, green beans, carrots, roasted tomatoes, beans and a few other others that I was unsure of what they were.

The restaurant doesn't look that big but it actually has 3-4 separate rooms in the back. The tables are sort of close to each other that at one point our neighbor had butt in to our conversation--which was fine considering the topic we were talking about. I was delighted to discover that this restaurant is owned by Lidia! I've always been a huge fan of her restaurant in Pittsburgh because of the unlimited pasta and was overly joyed to find out she has a restaurant in NYC too. That being said, the restaurant had the unlimited trio pasta + insalata/antipasto for $22.95. You get the to try an unlimited amount of the 3 daily pastas of the day. I always get stuffed on the 2-3 round. I don't remember the exact names of the 3 daily pastas I tried but I was sold when the server told me one of them was Pumpkin Seed & Coco Ravioli. I believe the second one was some sort of Tomato Basil Rigatoni. Overall, great experience, great company, great food! I can't wait to come back.

The restaurant is massive, rooms off of rooms off of rooms.

Pro tip: go for the thin bread sticks and don't get filled up on bread! These things are also covered in Parmesan mmmmhmmm. You are given the option of a) caesar salad or b) Antipasto for your appetizer. Since we had a big group they made an exception and let us do both, though this is not common practice. I recommend springing for the AntiPasta. Don't be lame... I know you've had a Caesar before. The antipasta came with a handful of items including: spaghetti squash, squid, skate, olives, fava beans, sundried tomatoes, mushrooms, pickled carrots, beans, and HONEYED RICOTTA. Ohmygod, this. I have no shame, so I'll freely admit that I licked our bowls clean. How had I never had honeyed ricotta?Now for pasta time. Classic Spaghetti. Tomato sauce with chunks of tomatoes. Delicious.Some shells with bacon. Average of the 3 but still amazinnnng.SOME BIG GNOCCHI THINGS. Had never come across these and was under the impression that gnocchi meant little potato balls. Nope. It can also mean huge spears of cheese filled goodness. Kinda OD'ed on these.Overall great meal. As my friend pointed out, it is a very tony soprano establishment.

I assumed that because this place was in the theater district it would be just another tourist trap with average food, lousy service, and just bad vibes all around BUT IT WAS SOOO GOOD. The caesar salad was FANTASTIC (which I know sounds silly, but it really was) and the pasta was the bomb and bottomless. I could be wrong, but I think how it works is that there are three different pastas served on any given night and then you get all three and the servers keep coming around offering more until you say no. We got spaghetti, gnocchi, and some other kind of pasta I don't know how best to describe but it had bacon in it. Thoroughly enjoyed all three.Other notes: This place is great for large groups (bring cash if splitting), not very expensive, and a whole lot of fun.

2.0,11/3/2014,"Came here to celebrate my grandmother's birthday. This restaurant is on 'Restaurant Row,' where tourists and people leaving shows to flock to for a meal. From the outside, the place looks nice.. but once you go inside it is quite a small and cramped space. The amount of people they were allowing to be inside is definitely a fire hazard. Picture a sardine can and that is exactly what it is like once you enter the establishment. Our reservations were for 6:15, which we were on-time for, yet the hostess asks us to wait in the bar area.. which is even MORE crowded, for our party to be called. We waited 30-40 minutes before we were actually seated. There were too many people and it was impossible to walk and move around. I understand we dined at prime dinner time, but it should not be crowded to the point where if you fall you feel as if you would have gotten stepped on by at least 5 people. Finally our party was called and we were seated at a table of 5 and we were too close for comfort to fellow diners. The staff is constantly moving and I do not know how they deal with that because there is literally no space to move around yet they manage. The sound level is incredibly high as well which makes it virtually impossible to have a nice conversation. As for the food, I ordered the steak rubbed in porcini mushrooms with tuscan fries and steamed broccoli. My steak was cooked very well and it was full of flavor. I skipped the fries because they lacked flavor and steamed broccoli, is, well.... steamed broccoli. After the main entree I ordered the original panna cotta, and it was divine. Perfect consistency and flavor. When dining out you hope that the food and atmosphere are nice and enjoyable, but while dining at Becco the only nice thing was my piece of steak. The prices are too high for the experience you will have and while my steak was good.. the other entrees my family members had ordered did not live up to their expectations. This restaurant definitely is a 'touristy' one, and the feeling of being a sardine in a can was not enjoyable whatsoever.

Finally we were seated in a table for 5 , my chair was so close to the next table that every time I moved, I elbowed my neighbor in the ribs...after apologizing several times he opted for moving his chair just to find himself in the same predicament with another patron.

While I genuinely love to research, sometimes the situation calls for a game-time decision, and that's when I turn to my trusty little red icon on my Galaxy.I know I wanted Italian for lunch and we had about 2 hours before we needed to make our way to the airport. Our hotel was fortunately centrally located, and not too far to Broadway...there were some options nearby, but nothing truly outstanding.... so off we went to 46th street, about 4 blocks from the hotel, at a fast walking pace! Whilst we walked, I pulled up my handy-dandy app and searched for awesome Italian, quickly zeroing in on Becco. After fighting our way through the human rush hour traffic that is Times Square, the bf and I got to 46th street... it was lined with a bunch of cute, innocuous spots... seafood, Brazilian.... Italian! We went in and luckily, since it was after lunch and before dinner, we were able to get seated right away. The place is lovely and romantic.... nice lighting (but not too dark), elegant without being snooty... loved the atmosphere. The bread basket was very interesting though they followed the traditional Italian way and served it cold (give me hot bread with butter any day!!). There was an interesting mustardy dip, though, and a small plate of olives. :)Service was very friendly and did not make us feel out of place, though the other patrons certainly seemed fancy. We ordered wine and soda, and placed our food order: minestrone soup and lasagna. I gotta delve a little on the wine - I am by no means a wine person (give me hef any day), but it was a nice Italian place and I've been trying to drink more wine, cuz it gives me an excuse to drink and pretend to be healthy and fancy. I got the Nero D'Avolo and I think it's the best red wine I've ever tasted. Not too dry, but not so sweet that I'd think I was adding unneeded extra calories. Really enjoyed it.Minestrone soup: was served straight from the pot! The cook came out with the pot and ladled the steaming soup onto our plates. The veggies were flavorful and fresh, the broth pretty good. I'd say a strong 3.5 of 5... a teeny little bland.Lasagna: probably best lasagna I've had. While the bf was prolly a little disappointed with the lack of melty cheese, I was happy. It was very meaty and I think we were able to truly appreciate the flavors. He did admit it was pretty good, and I loved it. 4.5 of 5.While the service is attentive, the food is a bit slow to come out. I was starting to get a little nervous, tbh, and we had to hurry back to the hotel afterwards.

The all you can eat pasta is the way to go; $23 for three types of pasta (all you can eat) is probably the best value meal in the city. The service is excellent; my water glass was always fullOne thing to note is that it's pretty loud in this place; much more than I was expecting for a Sunday night.

Ok, let's rewind. I called the night before to get a reservation as I noticed they were booked full on OpenTable. They had some openings left via phone, so be sure to call if you're unable to book a table online! The hostess on the phone made sure to ask if we were coming for dinner before a Broadway show (and yes we were, Mamma Mia!) which I thought was extremely courteous. When our waiter came to the table to introduce himself and read the specials, I was so impressed with his knowledge to recite all 5 specials and their components and sides without looking at his book once! On top of that, he was so helpful and assisted us in choosing a wine from the $25 bottle wine list that resembled Pinot Noir as we had never heard of any of the Italian wines on the extensive list. See my uploaded photo for his recommendation that did not disappoint! How can $25 bottles be beat in this expensive city?!For dinner, we had osso bucco and grilled hangar steak with polenta. My lord did both of these melt in your mouth! We paid $9 extra to upgrade to the popular table side pasta trio. That night they served linguine with clams, beet and goat cheese ravioli, and farfalle with red sauce. Ugh, this pasta would have been enough and worth the trip! To finish, we had the dessert trio and the best tasting cappuccino I've ever had. We did not feel rushed one bit even though the place was packed full of Broadway show-goers.

We were greeted by the maitre de and shunted into the noisy bar to wait. The table was near the bar and in the clogged path for the waitstaff. The menu touted a three item all you can eat pasta. The offerings were colorful...red green and black...but not worthy of all u can eat. The fish special was not special. Ordinary tuna piled on greens and potatoes.

We were seated immediately despite arriving a few minutes early. The atmosphere was nice despite the small tightly packed space and the noise level.The extensive list of $25 bottles of wine was a nice touch, and there were many selections I was familiar and happy with.Service began with a selection of olives, breads, and a white bean spread that were all very nice.We ordered the calamari fritti for an appetizer. It came out a very large portion, but was inedibly tough and rubbery. After a few tries we sent it back. We were offered a replacement but declined (we had large heavy meals still to come), and the item was removed from the bill without asking and without hassle.  I am willing to assume the poor quality of this dish was a fluke, but I find it very hard to believe a restaurant with this level of ownership and management would let a dish this obviously inedible slip through... For entrees we had the Veal Chop alla Joe, and the braised short ribs special.The short ribs were amazing. Tender, juicy, full of flavor.The sweet potato mash that accompanied it was completely bland, no seasoning to speak of. The veal chop was entirely unimpressive. for a $42 veal chop, I do not expect it to be barely distinguishable from a pork chop. It was cooked properly, but was also lacking seasoning. For half the price, I would have been happy with this chop, but at $42, it was inexcusably mediocre.The mashed potatoes that accompanied it were delicious - well seasoned, perfect texture, etc.We saw the serving of several rounds of the pasta tasting around us, and had wished we had gone with that instead, as all three of those dishes looked fantastic.There are definitely good things going on at this restaurant, but for the price - and given the reputation - I expected a lot more from this experience.",2,1,0,Jamie B.,"Colchester, CT",6,40,8

It was a very busy Saturday evening and had we not made reservations in advance, we'd probably have waited over an hour for a table. We were seated immediately upon our arrival. We were seated upstairs, which I have to admit is very cluttered when it's a full house. That didn't really bother me though. I'm not an up and down in my seat type of person. Our server was very friendly and extremely knowledgable when it came time to recommend a wine from their list. They do offer 25 dollar wines, but I believe we ordered champagne. It was a clean and organized atmosphere. We ordered their unlimited three pasta dinner, which the servers were right on point when it came time to replenish our food. The food was good...not amazing, but very good. I see a lot of people suggesting that it's an upscale Olive Garden. Hmmm....perhaps, but listen, if you simply want to save money and go eat at Olive Garden, by all means, do. If you want a beautiful dining experience with attentive staff and good food, eat at Becco. One final note. Our server made it a point to ask if we had theater tickets in case we were on a time constraint. We had, and we appreciated him being sensitive to that fact. I would definitely return to Becco.",0,0,0,Rob W.,"Boston, MA",23,122,133
4.0,10/15/2014,"Not top top quality, but you really can't beat the all-you-can-eat antipasti and pasta deal.  I mean $20ish...not bad at all.  Also, it's a huge and very busy place, so can usually snag a table here even when other places are booked.  And unless you're going to the theater, they really don't rush you along, so also a good venue for a reunion or birthday party, etc.The antipasti had a fair number of grilled vegetables, a tiny piece of mozzarella and a very generous portion of octopus salad and some type of (tasty) fish.Of the 3 pastas on offer, one was a stand-out: house-made fettuccine with veal ragu and fresh peas.  It was also clearly the highest cost one for the house, because they came around with it with far less frequency than the others: gnudi (which was OK, but the sauce was too soupy,) and rigatoni with tomato sauce (which was too similar too something I could've made easily at home.)  They also never changed the plates (I guess we could've asked) so by the end everything became kind of a soupy mess.  Still, that one pasta was excellent, so we stuck with it, asked for it when we didn't see it for a while, and definitely felt we got our money's worth.I was less enthused about the huge $25 wine list, which is a nice concept, but contained a lot of very cheap wines (some decent ones too.)  But you really have to know how to navigate to get value.One other thing to watch out for: as soon as you sit down they suggest an order of (wildly overpriced) fried calamari for the table.  Don't fall for this!  It'll blow your budget-mindedness to bits!Other than that, the service is really good.  Staff seemed well-trained, attentive and professional.And one last hint: if you're getting the all-you-can-eat pasta, get a side order of meatballs with it.  I think it adds like $10-12 bucks but it's HUGE and you can share one order among 3 people...adds only like $3-4 bucks a head and is well-worth it IMHO.",2,0,0,Mike B.,"New York, NY",15,402,20

1.0,10/13/2014,"Short: THIS PLACE MAY HAVE BEEN GOOD, BUT IT'S CHANGED! Don't bother, save your money, go to somewhere new. Go here if you want to essentially be disrespected. So, I took a family member here for a birthday dinner. It was marked as a birthday reservation and it was to be a really important dinner because of the fact that said family member was passing a milestone, and of course the family member is from Italy and had been to the place years previous and REALLY wanted to eat here.We had an 8:30 reservation because the weekend was jam-packed for us (like many others I'm sure). When we walked in, the place was so crowded there was nowhere to walk or sit whatsoever and we had a disabled person in our party and no arrangements were ever made to accommodate them - or attempt to. Which, is illegal as far as I'm aware - there was no disabled bathroom we were told by our rude waiter curtly once we were finally seated. The seating person didn't wait patiently at all for us to get to our table, which was all the way at the back of the place in some shady corner. My neck was literally glued to the wall the entire time. I ordered 2 bottles of champagne and although I was the one ordering (and paying, though maybe due to my age that wasn't so obvious) I was jipped out of refills in my glass by our waiter which is whatever - it wasn't my birthday. Fine. Just so you know, I've worked as waitstaff before so I know the importance of paying attention and I'm not arrogant or pompous and expecting everything to be perfect at every moment especially when the place is packed. However, there were numerous huge errors where we had to literally have strangers flag down our waiter, management explain the specials to us (because our waiter couldn't be assed to do a well enough job or take the time to ask if we understood). Our appetizers came when people around us were getting their main course, and in some cases leaving. My friend and I were never given our salads until we asked for them a second time. We were beyond annoyed at this point, but OK whatever. We figured the main course would probably be good and save face. Mine was definitely straight out of the freezer (the salmon) and almost inedible. They were also out of several of their dishes. HOW?!?!! If you know a dish is popular, BE PREPARED ON THE WEEKEND! Everyone in the party was unhappy with their plate, except for one. I was asked *once* if I thought everything was ok and I honestly shook my head because at that point, I was completely uninterested in even communicating with this rude waiter we had. Desserts were not traditional, nor was the food - my dessert was the only part I liked but again it was not traditional. I asked for the check, which was was falling almost $100 per person in the party. My friend and I debated over the tip because I know what it's like to be a waiter, I know how it can be. We didn't leave a big tip but paid for the dinner despite how unhappy we all were, and we did tip. We closed the book and decided to just get the hell out of there, and as we're leaving with no help for our disabled person in our party yet again - she was having her walker retrieved and I was tapped on my shoulder. I was asked ""Was everything alright?!"" And it was our waiter, obviously expecting more, demanding to know why he had such a low tip after he took my money and realized I was the one paying. Too little, too late. I said ""it was alright"" and promptly focused on helping the person in our party who needed help get a taxi safely since not even the hostess seemed to care about holding the door open at the very least. I would say this is probably the worst dining experience I've ever had, and it is not italian. Maybe it once was, but not anymore.",2,0,0,Sabrina H.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,47,14

This place is fairly simple and what you would expect from a place like Becco. Setting was old fashion and nothing felt out of place which is good.The lunch special that we had came with antipasta & caesar salad. The three rotating dish were a Veal Bolognese, Mushroom stuff ravolis, and a penne with a basil and tomato sauce. The food was exquisite as the housemade pasta let me speechless and frankly....craving for more. I did not know when to stop asking for more as rotating all three dishes left me refreshed due to each of them tasting different and thus renewing my appetite.

Although only 3 orders for 4 people, it was plenty and there were no issues with sharing.

While the pastas were edible and I ate a lot, I was not overwhelmed by any of them. Someone else reviewed that it was an ""upscale Olive Garden"" and I think that is a great description. The linguine primavera was bland. The ravioli was just okay. The penne a la vodka had the most flavor. Maybe I should have ordered something different?For dessert we ordered the gelato which was probably the highlight of this dinner.I was pretty surprised by this place. I expected top notch quality since Lidia is the mother of Joe Bastianich, the self-proclaimed ""Restaurant Man"".

The pasta was soft, sauce was fair at best.  It was so overly bad that I got up and left in the middle of the meal.  I mentioned this to the hostess on the way out and she did not even react to what i told her.",0,0,0,Seth S.,"Miami, FL",0,4,0

3.0,7/28/2014,"""An upscale Olive Garden"" is a pretty apt description. We were a party of 10 and ate family style, I'd recommend this if you can do it. We got caesar salad and appetizers to start which were a little different than usual (honey ricotta and peas, anti-pasta), they were good, not great. Pastas came next, ravioli were good, linguine with clams was ok and pasta with tomato basil was something I could make better at home. If I had gotten those with the all-you-can-eat pasta, this would be a two star review. The meats were all good, steak with corn stuffing was very good, salmon and potatoes were very good, the chicken parm was good/ok. Desserts were also ok/good. Service was quality (my picky grandpa had no complaints, which is rare) and I enjoyed the experience, though having to deal with Times Square crowds wasn't great. You likely won't be upset about going to Becco, but with all the 4+ star reviews, you may be a little underwhelmed, especially if you're used to good Italian food.

2.0,7/17/2014,"I was going to give Becco a three. If this place was just another local Italian place, maybe a three would be correct.  But this is a destination restaurant, a famous place, so it needs to be held to a higher standard.  So call it a two.The place has been successful for many years and is relatively affordable. It's a big place but separated into several smaller rooms on the first level.  So it seems more intimate. Skylights in the back dining area add a nice touch.  I did not see the second floor.  White tablecloth place.  But no background music at lunch today.  That's a bummer in my book.  Our server was OK but did not impress.  In a nice place, I expect that silverware will be swapped out during the meal.  So I left my knife on the appetizer plate.  The busboy put the knife back down on the table.  I expected it - sadly.  My guest was aghast.They start you off with some decent bread and some breadsticks along with some type of dip and some good olives.  There was an extra small plate which I thought was for olive oil.  But the waiter poured olive oil in the same plate as the dip.  Not sure if that was correct. I should have asked.Since almost every reviewer talks about the three pasta special, I gave it a try.  The mixed appetizer plate looked like a jumble and was just OK.  The three pastas today were mushroom ravioli (very nice), a papadella with a simple tomato basil sauce (good) and a rigatoni with Bolognese sauce (didn't like it). The Bolognese had a distinct cinnamon flavor - new to me.  Spices aside, I expected a meatier sauce.My guest had the Caesar salad (dressing was thin, not tasty) and followed with  veal with tuna sauce (veal was cut too thin, tuna sauce was bland). In my book, it's inexcusable to mess up a simple Caesar salad.We had one of the $25 bottles of wine - a Bastianich Adriatico Sauvignon. It was just OK   I told my wife that if I had purchased the bottle at a local shop for $8.00, I would not buy it again. If this restaurant was out in the suburbs it might be a decent choice.  But in NYC, with so many other options, I would give it a pass.",7,3,1,Jim B.,"Somerset, NJ",351,1521,175

I would highly recommend getting that meal as it gave us lots of options and we got to eat as little or as much as we wanted. All bottles of wine were also $25, which is a shockingly incredible deal in NYC.

Also had the roasted chicken that had nice crisp on the skin but was also dry and over cooked.As mentioned before it was our anniversary so they brought as a gelato with a candle for this.

3.0,7/10/2014,"I enjoyed my visit before seeing a show and glad I made a reservation through Yelp before going since I was on a tight schedule. I was seated almost right away even though I was about 10 minutes late. Not only was the restaurant packed, but the bar and waiting area were filled as well and barely found a seat to wait until our table was called. The wait staff was so-so. Took a long time to order but once I did, everything arrived as expected.  The poor patrons seated next to our section waited at least 20-25 minutes before they got water or menus.  It made me feel uncomfortable because I couldn't really enjoy my meal sitting so close to those poor souls and I felt like waving down the wait staff for them.  I'm not sure what was up except for maybe disorganization of the wait staff. At least they were offered a free app for their trouble.Bottomless pasta  (choice of ravioli, pesto penne, spaghetti) after a long day of traveling was great but I should have passed on the Caesar salad starter. My daughter's antipasto appetizer was a lot better and wish I hard ordered that instead. Enjoyed the ambiance somewhat but it is quite loud and a bit claustrophobic but I was warned by other Yelp reviews. I'm really glad they asked if I needed to get to a show before ordering, so I will say my order arrived just in time to enjoy it before rushing out the door.

Becco has an option for $22.95 where you get either a Caesar salad or a plate of grilled vegetables and then an unlimited amount of three different types of pasta. The pastas were okay--one potato gnocchi, one linguine with tomato sauce and basil and one with bacon. I do not like cheese and asked one of the waiters if the bacon pasta had cheese and he rudely said ""All pasta has cheese."" That is just not true--in fact, one of the pastas they were serving did not have cheese!The restaurant is shockingly huge-they have indoor and outdoor seating, as well as upstairs and downstairs seating.

And I love that I got experience three kinds of pasta -- a basic tomato and basil, which was fresh and delicious; a ravioli with a butter and marjoram sauce that was light but flavorful, and a bolognese made with veal that was truly excellent.We had food issues at our table -- one person didn't want the veal so got a vegetarian option; I'm allergic to seafood and they were very cognizant of that. I read in a review below that someone asked how pasta can be fresh if it's sitting around in pots -- you basically sit at your table and the servers come around with the pasta -- and the answer is, ""I don't know but they do it."" I was pretty full so didn't get dessert, but tried my friend's chocolate mousse cake, which was to die for. Someone else got the cheesecake and really enjoyed it as well.

By the time we left, there was a full on theater crowd and it was quite loud. **TL;DR version**This is a great ""fancy"" restaurant to go to when you have a group of widely ranging tastes and eaters. Some people who want simple, traditional flavors (aka non-adventurous eaters like my Mom) and others who are willing to play with less familiar flavors and textures (like me!)**Extended version**The bread plate was interesting. White bean paste and olives were both deliciously savory ways to whet the appetite. The crostini sticks had good bite, but the actual bread (two kinds) was a bit hard for my taste. (The better to spread with white bean paste, said my Mom). Ceasar salad was pretty damn good. Leaves were nicely coated with dressing (not drowned or dry) and fresh, crunchy croutons. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE that they have a simplified wine list. A page full of $25 bottles. Reds, whites, roses and sparkling included. We picked a prosecco. It was crisp and fruity, without being terribly sweet. Mom had the lemon chicken breast. Succulent and fragrant. I had the try it all pasta special. It did not disappoint. Penne with short rib ragu (NOMLICIOUS), spaghetti with red sauce and the standout winner (which I wasn't expecting) was the vegetable canneloni with bechamel sauce. Decadent. Rich. And perfectly seasoned. Not mushy vegetables. Pasta with bite. So. Freaking. Good. Service was nice, too.

4.0,6/13/2014,"Becco, (355 W. 46th Street, between 8th and 9th Ave.) is a very good Italian restaurant in the theater district. It's one of Lidia Bastianich and Mario Batali's restaurants. The sauces are all excellent, (the standard by which I judge Italian restaurants). Some of the dishes are authentic to certain regions of Italy, and all made with fresh produce and home made pastas. The specialty of the house is a 3 pasta lunch or dinner including a salad or antipasto for about $23. You can't beat that price, becasue they come around with the pasta and refill your plate as many times as you'd like. Having a 16 year old pasta loving son, I can tell you, it's a real bargain. The a la carte menu is pretty extensive and the prices are average for NYC. The atmosphere is comfortable and the service is attentive.",2,0,0,Cindy M.,"Eastchester, NY",0,12,1

We were seated upsrairs. Nice, cute, charming and intimate are the words that come to mind. U can tell that this place is rustic and authentic as soon as u enter in. So me and my friend ordered their all u can eat pasta menu for 23 bucks. Great deal given that they were giving and appetizer and unlimited 3 kinds of pastas. For appetizer they served grilled veggies which were the best grilled vegetAbles we have ever had. So flavorful and perfectly cooked. For pastas they had raviolli, spaghetti and a fusilli. They even substituted one of the unlimited pastas to suit me as I am a vegetarian. In all we were more than full at the end and totally worth the money. I dnt remember what we ordered for the dessert but i remember there was none left so u cn tell that i was super tasty.

2.0,6/10/2014,"Ugh. Where to start. Wait - I do have a COUPLE good things to say, so I'll start there. We were seated right away, as we had a reservation (and it was at 10:00 PM after a show). Upon arrival, they bring a white bean dip and some mixed marinated olives to snack on. They also place a rustic wooden box filled with very thin and crispy bread sticks (grissini), focaccia with a few olives inside and a hearty traditional Italian type bread. The breadsticks are my favorite. I agree with Danielle S -  the best part of my meal was the mozzarella en carrozza my son and I shared. First, the mozzarella is wonderfully fresh and gooey. The bread was light and airy, more of a delicate pastry than a bread. It was served with a bit of sundried tomato pesto and traditional basil pesto. LOVED IT.Then my son and I made the mistake of ordering the all you can eat pasta. The 3 kinds were linguine with pesto sauce, penne with shrimp in a pink sauce, and some sort of ravioli. All of these were ok. Just ok. I had a bite or two of each, and then made another mistake. I asked the waiter if I could just have a plain linguine with whatever red sauce they had. That's when things went WAY downhill. He looked at me with a straight face and said ""We don't have any other pasta."" Now, thinking he was totally kidding, I laughed. He didn't. I said, ""Oh, you're not joking. Ok, well, can I just get some linguine before they mix it with the pesto?"" and he said ""You can, but that will take a while. I can bring it with butter and parmesan cheese if you want."" HUH?? So, I asked again, ""Do you have ANY red sauce back there?"" and he finally succumbed to my ""special"" order, and said ""Yes, but this is going to take a while"" he reminded me. And it did. The rest of the night, we were pariahs. He wouldn't stop by, we had to ask the host if we could have more water when he sat people near us. He finally came back when we finished to see if we wanted dessert. Nope, we wanted out. He gave us the bill with a bit of a sneer, and left. He got a $10 tip (about 12%) - which I NEVER do. I was in the restaurant industry, and know how important tips are - and even with mediocre service I tip 20%. But I could not let him think that his actions were worthy of a good tip. I'm sure I was just another ""stupid tourist"" from the sticks in his eyes, but maybe this review will get back to him, so he knows how it felt from the customer's eyes. (PS - Becco management - it was this past Saturday night, he has dark curly hair and was wearing a bow tie). Bleck. We won't be back.

Reservations were timed great because the place is very small and the tables are too close, very cramped (typical NYC restaurant). I have never been to a Italian restaurant where you need to add salt to your food so you can eat it. First we ordered the hot antipasto, eggplant rolatini had no flavor couldn't even finish it and eggplant rolatini is a fav of mine, the rest platter was just as bland.

2.0,5/23/2014,"Bottom line: All the food was disappointing and the waitstaff was disinterested.  I had gone to this block of Manhattan's West 46th St. looking for a restaurant recommended in a 2012  tourist guide, and it was no longer in business. Looked on Yelp for ratings of other restaurants on the same block (there are many). Quite a few had 4 stars. I settled on Becco because I was right outside its doors. I was seated immediately, even though they were busy, and was approached for my drink order very promptly. So far, so good.But I wish I had taken the time to read beyond the 4 stars and actually check some reviews. I didn't read further until I had ordered the same $22 Sinfonia Di Paste that David D.'s group (5/19/2014) had been disappointed in. I settled on that after seeing a warning about ""$18 minimum food order per customer"" on the menu. Otherwise, I had been aiming for a light supper of antipasto or salad. I was served the very same trio of ravioli, farfalle and clam linguine David D mentions, and it was all nearly tasteless. There was no spoon offered to assist in winding the slippery linguine around my fork. Except for bringing food, the servers -- a different one for every item -- paid no attention, never once asked if I needed anything, never asked if the food was all right, never checked on anything. The caesar salad that preceded the pasta trio was the most tasteless I've ever eaten. There were a few delightful details. They stock a German non-alcoholic beer that I've seldom seen offered (Einbecker), and the thin, crunchy breadsticks with a basil-y white bean spread were delicious.But the breadsticks and a $7 beer could not salvage a disappointing meal that set me back $36.

3.0,5/23/2014,"The reasons for 3 stars and not 4 stars are as follows:1. PACKED! Servers bumped my chair all night trying to get to other tables and this happened to many guests. I should not have to move my chair every time to allow someone to pass my chair. 2. Wine pricing - do not order single glasses of wine. They are extremely overpriced, including a $20 glass of chianti. A friend asked our waiter for a glass of chianti and he brought it. I had no idea until I saw the bill that it was $20. The waiter SHOULD HAVE said ""the glass is $20 but for just $5 more we have our $25 a bottle wine list and I'd recommend you have the.....""3. NOISY - see #1 for the reason why.That's the bad...now here's the good:1. Two-course for $22.95 is a nice deal. Your choice of a salad or very nice antipasti plate with veggies and two little seafood offerings. Then you get endless, yummy pastas, choice of three, to fill you up for the rest of the night. 2.

However, the three pastas were a mixed blessing. The ravioli was the high point, delicate little works of art that we all greatly enjoyed. The farfalle had a delicious tomato sauce but were somewhat too firm for our liking. However, the linguine and clams were a disappointment. Served in the shell, the clams were very chewy and rubbery.

4.0,5/17/2014,"Stopped in here today with my mom. It is a small, cramped and busy little restaurant. A little too cramped. They reeeeeallllly squeeze you in there. The service was quick, kind and attentive. Once seated you are given a white bean dip and some mixed marinated olives to snack on. They also place a wonderfully rustic wooden box filled with very thin and crispy bread sticks (grissini), focaccia with a few olives inside and a hearty traditional Italian type bread. The breadsticks are my favorite. They are light, crispy and salty little sticks of satisfaction. If they sold them, I'd buy them. The touristy or very hungry thing to do is get the all you can eat pasta trio which includes either a Cesar salad or an antipasti misto. As a vegetarian my choices here are limited. You either get the trio of pasta, spaghetti with pomodoro sauce or a sampling of all the vegetarian sides. I opted for the pasta trio and antipasti misto. Today's pasta selection included a ravioli with oregano sauce which was very light and tasty, although it was not served very hot. Spaghetti pomodoro which was great with fresh basil and grated cheese on top. The other pasta was a penne bolognese. Since I am a vegetarian they brought out a special pasta which was penne with broccoli. It was very good. While I enjoyed the pasta, I feel like the best part of my meal was the antipasti misto and the mozzarella en carrozza my mom and I shared. First, the mozzarella is wonderfully fresh and gooey. The bread was light and airy, more of a delicate pastry than a bread. It was served with a bit of sundried tomato pesto and traditional basil pesto. It is the best basil pesto I have ever, ever tried. So fresh and well seasoned!The real star was the antipasti misto. Typically is comes with a bit of seafood, but since I am a vegetarian I was offered the most wonderfully creamy ricotta drizzled with honey and flecked with fresh cracked black pepper. It was heavenly. This came with fresh peas simply dressed in some olive oil. The plate had offerings of a variety of tasty morsels. A small chunk of pickled carrot, eggplant and zucchini in a tomato sauce (caponata?), string beans with a spicy horseradish sauce, marinated mushrooms, ball of mozzarella, slice of the most delicious sundried tomato, a slice of grilled zucchini and a salad of beans.  I would come back for the antipasti misto alone.Definitely give Becco a try if you haven't. If you're not a vegetarian, I'd suggest staying away from the trio of pasta and ordering something else.

The service was amazing, and all our guests loved the food and wine. I've been going to Becco for over 10 years, and having our reception at Becco was a no brainer. They did a fantastic job, and their special events Coordinators, Marica & Joe, are a dream to work with. Whether it's a casual dinner for 2, or an event of over 60 people, Becco delivers each time with a careful eye for detail. You won't be disappointed.

4.0,5/4/2014,"Becco is at the mercy of its success.Walking across Restaurant Row on 46th Street toward your 12PM lunch reservation you immediately notice that there's only one restaurant with a line - Becco. Quickly seated among tables for 2 - which are tightly lined up sidebyside - things begin to move fast. Here comes the bread with spread, the olives, the menus. Waiters fly by as water spills (on my shirt) and glasses fall. All this is somewhat understandable as these table's occupants have shows to see. Don't expect too relaxed a meal - it's not happening.The Food:Appetizers (Fried Mozzarella w/Bread & An assortment of marinated & grilled  vegetables with seafood) were acceptable but not standouts.For Mains we selected and shared the ""Three Daily Pasta Preparations"". 1-Pene w/tomato sauce, Nothing special here as we kept adding parmigiana cheese.2-Artichoke Ravioli - Very good and thoroughly enjoyed.3-Pasta w/Veal Bolognese - The best of the three - extremely tasteful - a gem.What's also wonderful about this choice - waiters refill your pastas when done.Hey - Keep it coming...Also selected and shared - Beef tenderloin grilled rare & sliced over arugula with freshly shaved Grana Padano. Excellent as the Beef was perfect and the arugula w/cheese couldn't have worked better with the dish. What was surprisingly special. An extensive wine list with all bottles $25. How often do you come across this option at a fine restaurant? Price wise for quality dining you simply can't beat Becco (our bill $115 including tip).

2.0,5/1/2014,"As an Italian, it has the flare of a Ferrari, but really doesn't deliver. For a start, I don't like eating in the face of the person on the other table, is it Italian theater to stick tables so close to each other that you have an accidental conversation with the person next to you! As for the food, it's bland, Italian food has flair, the Ceasar Salad is bland, limp and soggy, the main courses are OK, but I can cook better at home and the $25 bottles of wine are barely $10 down my off-license. Each time the (so called busy) staff walked by their was so little room that they kicked my chair every time! The owners should wake up!

1.0,4/29/2014,"Attitude and a couple of errors made for an interesting time.  Considering this is celebrity chef restaurant I expected more.  Before I changed careers I opened, owned, and operated several restaurants.  Although things change in my view the one of three-pasta trio that I selected as a side dish and that they claim to fame was not a star.  The spaghetti primavera was weak flavored and finding the spring vegetables was almost impossible, mine had none.  The penne regate was in a red simple table sauce that had flavor and was a reasonable option.  The lasagna and third version of the endless trio contained the food cost and was really very good and yet was such a small portion that I wanted more, however, neither the waiter nor the lasagna plate came back to get second serving of this almost one inch square very small piece.I had a curious pulled pork dish with rhubarb and strawberries and didn't know what to expect, but even if a new flavor i expected a flavor, it was bland and boring and set on top of mashed potatoes.  A few more spices and perhaps a polenta might have been more interesting.  Oh well chef's choice, but not a very good one perhaps Lidia should  eat more often in her signature restaurant?My greatest frustration was the waiter.  At the start I asked for two separate checks.   Every high end restaurant we went to in NYC had no problem with this.  I didn't drink and our friends did, a lot and I didn't want to split the check later I just wanted too pay for what my wife and I ate and not the other couples multiple drinks with no embarrassment.  It is not hard for a waiter to enter two separate checks into a system.  This waiter said he could not, I challenged him and he said he would ask the manager.  He never returned with the manager.  Later when her brought one bill I asked where the second check was?  He said if we just checked what we ate he would then now create a separate one.  So now spending over $100 each for dinner this waiter actually could split them but only if we did the work.  So with embarrassment and frustration we did adding frustration to a pleasant yet mediocre meal.  When he came back to run the totals the other couple told him they had two drinks at the bar as well.  When he added these on he put them on our check and not theirs probably assumed we were trying to cheat them out of a drink bill.  We didn't he assumed wrong and his multiple errors cost him and the place as he now handed us the now separate checks with an extra $30 dollars in drinks we never had on our check.  The other couple paid for their drinks and as a result and in frustration and now embarrassed I tipped the waiter 10% and I know I should have tipped him nothing.   Let me be clear, I respect the hard work in food service and can tolerate a lot of errors but I won't tolerate being frustrated by a waiter who has a chip on his shoulder and who could have made our experience exceptional  and did not because of his personal attitude.  I am a food service pro and almost always a 20% tipper and it bothers me when I can't.  this waiter has an attitude that does not belong in food service and he hurts the other staff that depends on him for their income and his tips.",0,0,0,hallie e.,"Grayslake, IL",14,20,0

A great pre-theater spot and the waitstaff is very accommodating when you let them know.The bread service before the meal even starts is amazing! 3 different kinds of bread/breadsticks with a sort of spiced chickpea spread. So yummy!By far the best deal is the daily special, their ""sinfonia di pasta,"" which is all-you-can-eat of three pasta dishes, which change every day! Usually one tomato-based sauce, one more creamy, and one more pesto-ey. One dish has meat, one has a plain pasta, and one has a stuff pasta. All are delicious! What really impressed me one time I took a vegetarian friend here and she ordered the trio and declined the one with meat, saying she was vegetarian. The waiter came back with a specially prepared veggie version for her! I thought that was just fantastic and super classy, above and beyond my expectations. I would recommend getting a reservation here ahead of time--very easy to do online and then you can get seated more quickly.

5.0,4/21/2014,"We had been relatively frequent diners at Becco for quite a while. Then the Rack of Lamb disappeared from the menu and dining at Becco became so hectic that we gave up and found couple of other suitable places. Just recently on a Friday night we went back to Becco.  Had to take a 5 o'clock reservation as nothing else was available and we made that reservation at least two weeks prior to our dining date. So...still no rack of lamb but that said...the excellent bread, olives, $25 bottle of wine [great selection with good recommendation from waiter] remain in place. Entering at 5 PM made the meal somewhat less rushed and hectic. Both of us had Caesar's Salad; super - as usual. Main dishes. My wife described her Veal Picatta as superb. I had the Osso Bucco, which was as sensational as I remembered it being (but was priced about $8 more than I remember (still worth it, though). Quite large portions of each too. Service was excellent with frequent ""checkbacks"" by waiter and manager(s). On the negative side, a tad noisy, tables too small and too close together but it was always thus at Becco. Still, quality prevails. We'll return.Nightly pasta specials are still on the menu; favorable price, unlimited amount, and interesting dishes are offered. We don't typically do pasta, but the folks next to us did and the linguine and clams in white sauce looked super.

5.0,4/19/2014,"How have I not reviewed this yet?! We have been here countless times. I have been to Italy and this is some of the best Italian food I have had in America with some of the nicest servers. ESPECIALLY for the amount of food you get for the price. I'm sure the food on the regular menu is wonderful, but we never even look at it. We always without a doubt order the ""pasta special."" All for only $22.95!!! You get the choice of a cesare salad or their mixed antipasto. I'm sure the salad is great...but get the antipasto!!! You get an assortment of grilled veggies and some seafood...DELICIOUS. Now at this point if you haven't filled up on the appetizer and enormous bread basket they bring you, get ready for some fun. With the pasta special, you get an UNLIMITED amount of three different kinds of pasta. They bring it around in big pans and serve it directly on your plate. It's rare that I even ask for seconds because of how much they pile on for your first helping--but it's perfect for when I just want one or two more ravioli...you know the feeling.  Once you're done with your pasta, if you're not ready to explode, they have wonderful deserts. Desert isn't included in the $22.95 but I find that a good thing because I would motivated to eat it when I am 99% of the time way too full to even think about desert! But not only do they offer a great deal on delicious food, but also on wine. They have a normal wine list but they also offer a rather large $25 per bottle wine list with very lovely wines on it. All in all, this place gets 5 stars for food, service, decor and the amazing price for all you receive. Just one tip: MAKE A RESERVATION!!!

Being in a rush, I ordered their special, which was unlimited house pastas that came with a soup or salad as well.  The night I went, the pastas were fettuccine shrimp in a garlic sauce, penne pasta is a red sauce, and mushroom ravioli.   First, you get the soup or salad you ordered, I had the caesar salad which was pretty good.  And then the bring over a full cup of Parmesan cheese that sits at your table.  Your first plate will consist of all the three pastas. They serve each one table side so you start with an empty plate and servers come around and put as much or little of each pasta on your plate.  I pretty much only enjoyed the ravioli so I probably had 4 services of that.  The other pastas just sat on my plate.  I think if I wasn't so rushed, i may have given the other pastas more of a chance, but since I only really wanted to eat what I really like, I stuck with the raviolis. I do have to mention that they had a great $25 bottle wine list!  I went with my mother who doesn't drink so I didn't order a bottle but if I had more time and was with friends, I would've have hesitated to order a bottle or maybe even two!All in all, I would like to go back here and give the restaurant a fair chance.  I enjoyed my experience but nobody likes to rush through dinner (which was the fault of my own)",0,0,0,Jane W.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,64,54

5.0,3/23/2014,"We originally were going try to get a ""light bite"" for lunch as we had dinner reservations at six before the show we were seeing, but after sitting for a bit and watching the food that was being served around us, that strategy died a quick death. The paste trio is a key component to enjoying the entire experience. It is different daily but the ravioli, spaghetti with calamari, and penne with pesto were amazing.   My salmon ""lunch size"" fillet was in danger of being the biggest fish I've ever eaten. Often times, however, restaurants will serve large salmon but over or under cooked but not at Becco. Spot on and delicious. Since we had thrown ""eating another meal later out the window we slit a fantastic piece of cheesecake that was not super sweet like it can so often be. So good it almost turned into a fork fight for share! Service was pristine. Never hovering but seemingly always right there when ever it was right. almost spooky! Celebrity chef's eateries are up and down Times Square and the theater district but Becco holds their own and then some with all of the more ""well known"" names.Becco is a truly a NYC Italian experience that is not to be missed, but don't wear skinny jeans!",1,1,1,Tim E.,"Round Lake, IL",73,92,1
5.0,3/23/2014,We have been here many times and I never wrote a review don't know why I guess because we have been coming here for a long time as a regular and always seem to write about new places. My mistake as I just made reservations to go again next week I thought to write a review. Well I keep going back so is that enough said and we will keep going it is my wife's and my favorite restaurant in NYC and when ever we go to a show or are in mid town we always make it a point to eat at Becco.

5.0,3/14/2014,"One of the best restaurants I've ever eaten at. My family went here after a Broadway show to celebrate my grandparents' 50th wedding anniversary and we had one of the best meals ever. It's a small place but they managed to accommodate our large Italian family of about 14 people. And, completely by surprise, Lidia was there to dine at her own restaurant! She was so nice, and was pleasant whenever someone came up to her to pay complements. She also wished my grandparents a happy anniversary, which made my Nana's day.The food is delicious. The unlimited pasta is the way to go - for about $20 bucks, you get unlimited portions of the three pastas they serve that day. The pumpkin ravioli were the best I've ever had. The wine list has selections for $25, so even though it's a top-notch restaurant, you can enjoy one of the best Italian meals you'll ever have at a very reasonable price.The atmosphere is fancy but relaxed, with white table cloth linens and soft warm lighting making the place feel nice and romantic, but the wait staff wear dress shirts and jeans so the place feels comfortable and not stuffy.I have nothing but praise for Becco and I give it the highest recommendation.",3,0,1,Chris C.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",7,39,3
3.0,3/13/2014,I would give this restaurant 5 stars except I felt ignored by the front staff - she barely greeted me at the door and when she did finally say something it was with disdain that she pointed at the table for one.  I almost left but glad I didn't - food was excellent - lovely presentation and a great mix of flavours!,0,0,0,P J.,"Vancouver, Canada",0,4,1
4.0,3/13/2014,"I'm a huge fan of Lidia's Italy in the Strip District of Pittsburgh, and when I found out that it was modeled from Becco and had the same AYCE pasta special, I knew I had to come. The special always makes me feel like I'm getting my money's worth. It's only slightly more expensive than in Pittsburgh, which says something because the cost of food in Pittsburgh is much, much lower. Also, it's very much a touristy restaurant, but it doesn't really change the mood or vibe of the restaurant, so it doesn't really make a huge difference.Pasta is always fresh, and even if one of the dishes isn't to your liking, there's two other types of pasta dishes, so you're bound to have a pasta you like. The most memorable dish was a mushroom ravioli that was just outstanding. The mushrooms were just perfectly earthy and the cheese was just sharp enough to create a pretty unique flavor profile. That's what it's all about. Again, fresh pasta definitely has a better chew and that difference goes a long way here at becco. Even though they'll likely serve a pretty basic spaghetti, linguini, or cavatappi, it's always somehow better than any pasta dish that I've ever made. Beyond the pasta special, the choices are definitely authentic and delicious. The polenta with crispy speck is unreal and the calamari is just your standard crispy, fried, and delicious. I actually don't know how authentic that really is, but regardless, the ingredients are high quality and you can tell.Service is great here, and the waiters are very knowledgeable and attentive. I've never had a bad time, and even though they automatically charge gratuity for large groups, it's never been undeserved.I don't know if I'll go out of my way to come back here anymore now that I don't live nearby, unless I'm seeing a show or something, but definitely worth a try if you've never been before. The value here just cannot be beat, and it's likely the best pre/post-show dinner option on restaurant row, in my opinion.",4,1,2,Eric J.,"New York, NY",490,923,1792
3.0,3/13/2014,"It's difficult to love Italian food (especially pasta) and not know of this restaurant or the family behind it. Lydia Bastianich has made her dent in the world of Italian food, and over 20 years ago, opened Becco with the help of her son, Joe. Since then, it's happily served tourists, theater-goers, native New Yorkers, and Italian food lovers alike.A few friends and I met up at Becco during a weekday evening and made our way inside just a few minutes earlier than our reservation. What greeted us was a bright, clamorous dining room; two rows of tables were lined against the side of the room and each and every seat appeared to be filled. Even the bar area was completely packed, with some patrons opting to have their dinner there instead of waiting for a table. We waited for about 10 or 15 minutes until our table was ready and were led past the kitchen to the second dining room, which thankfully had a slightly less chaotic ambiance.There was pretty much no need to look at the menu, as we'd already decided beforehand on our orders. Becco's known for their unlimited tableside pasta service, an option that allows diners to choose between a salad or antipasto misto appetizer, followed by a hypothetically unlimited amount of three different pastas. I opted for the Insalata Cesare, the Caesar Salad, while my friend got the second option. The salad is pretty typical - crisp romaine lettuce, crunchy blocks of croutons, a sprinkling of grated Grana Padano (a cheese that falls in the same family as Parmigiano-Reggiano), and lightly mixed with a dressing that was not timid with its use of anchovies and garlic. For the more adventurous, the antipasto misto offers more variety, including a selection of cheeses, marinated and grilled vegetables, and seafood.The pastas are brought out in huge pots intermittently by servers who will stop by tables and ladle out a serving (or two) of the desired pasta onto plates. On the evening we went, we able to try a  spaghetti pomodoro, a mushroom ravioli topped with a cream sauce, and a fusilli alla bolognese. The least favorite of the night turned out to the ravioli; the pasta was served at a lukewarm temperature and the liberal amount of cheese in the filling completely overwhelmed any mushroom flavor. Surprisingly, the simplest pasta of the night was the standout; the pasta had a good chew to each bite, and the pomodoro sauce was fresh and well-balanced, with a generous helping of oregano and basil to compliment the acidity. The servings are fairly generous, and we were stuffed by our second plates; you will not leave here hungry.The overall quality of restaurants on Restaurant Row isn't particularly worth noting, but amongst this selection, Becco clearly has its strengths. While it may not be worth a separate trip out, it's a solid option for a pre or post-theater meal, especially when there are few other options on the horizon.",12,4,6,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

When we got there we handed our coats to the German? Attendant he was very nice. We walked into the actual restaurant and got seated promptly by the host. Our waiter who's name I forgot sadly came ask what we wanted to drink. We ordered a martini that was amazing wish I could recall the name but it was really good. As he went on to explain the specials and the unlimited pasta he gave us a few mins to decide.When he came back my gf had decided to order the unlimited pasta with the anti-pasta and I ordered the porterhouse lamb this is where the problem started.We received our salad and our anti-pasta as we finished up we waited for our entry and after a good 5-10mins our waited came to our table to inform us that the kitchen was closed due to the health inspector coming in to take a look at what was going on.Now here where i was a little bewildered, working in the restaurant industry for a good 5 years during my lifetime and my father being a manager of a restaurant for the latter part of 25 years I found this odd. Usually how it works is that the health inspector checks if everything is good while the kitchen is in OPERATION!I had never heard of closing down the whole place to check everything out! How ridiculous is this? Luckily we had no where to go and lots of patients to hope that the food at the end would be worth it after 30-40min wait for this health inspector to be done our food came out. The pasta was good, delicious and my lamb was tasty to say the least but waiting almost 1 hour for our food was a bit to much even for good tasting food. That why I knocked it one star instead of four. If you are in the area try it out, just hope the health inspector doesn't show up and ruin your night!

3.0,2/4/2014,"I stopped by on a Friday night on a whim at about 8pm for a table of two.  We were put on a waitlist for 30 minutes and were led back to a table after waiting only 10.  The place was packed and the tables are close very close to each other.  If you are bigger than a size 4, you'll find it difficult to squeeze into the booth side without ass swiping someones bottle of wine or bread off the table.I went with the pasta special that offers three unlimited pastas for $22.  The night I arrived there was a marinara bow tie pasta, a beet and goat cheese ravioli, and a clam linguine.  I thought the pasta was good as it is handmade and quite enjoyed the perfect al dente cook.  I defin thought the sauces were weak and on the bland side.  I believe the beet and goat cheese was the strongest of the three.I felt the bread in the basket seemed old and service was rushed.  I understand it is busy, but I don't think the waiter looked me in the eye once and generally was walking away before he was even finished talking.  I also asked for a bottle of red but was brought a bottle of white.  Fortunately, I'm wine versatile and hunkered down with the white even though I was in the mood for red.  I do think the entire page of wine bottles for $25 was cool.  The page had at least a dozen and a half bottle selections... Overall, I think it was pretty awesome we were able to get a table so quickly on a Friday night.  I thought the food was decent enough and very affordable although nothing in particular really stood out to me.",6,1,1,Sylvie S.,"Washington, DC",168,197,224

5.0,2/1/2014,"Came here for my birthday right before watching Once. I'll be the first to admit before this place I hated Italian food and was actually hesitant to go to Becco- Italian food was way out of my comfort zone.Upon initial arrival I immediately assumed it would be the type of restaurant that served ridiculously small portions that left you starving- I was very WRONG!We were seated immediately and our waiter was really nice- not stuck up at all. He mentioned all of these specials- so many that I actually stopped listening after some time. They bring out this bread basket with two types of bread, cheesy bread sticks (yummy), olives (wish I tried them) and this yellow bean dip. To start we got the fresh mozzarella and roasted peppers (mozzarella Lavorata)- mouth watering! It had golden raisins which gave it such a subtle sweetness.I ordered the stuffed cabbage with veal, pork and meat. I tried to find it on the menu that's posted online, but couldn't find it now. Anyhow, it came with spinach spetzle (YUMMY- I need to learn how to make this) which I'm currently craving. It was crispy, but soft all in one bite. It was one of the best things I've had in a while. It changed my view of Italian food- guess I didn't hate it after all.He got some type of pork chop and all I can remember was that it was a very large portion- like I didn't think they came in that size kind of large! While I may have been stuffed to the brim, we did get dessert. The tiramisu was very delicious, but I thought it was a tad strong for my liking. The panna cotta was better for me as it was smooth and creamy without an overabundance of sweetness. I normally cringe at the thought of an Italian restaurant, but I am so glad we came here. I would definitely want to go back at some point.",2,2,3,Jennifer G.,"Bronx, NY",310,143,128

5.0,1/30/2014,"This winter, I have revisited and rekindled my love for becco. My goodness, do they make a mean trio of special pasta. To start, I have to say that the staff is always friendly and willing to chat if you are, so if you're sitting at the bar on a snowy winter night you've got a friend in the bartender. We have a system when coming here. We come in to check our coats, sit at the bar and order our first bottle of $25 wine, usually prosecco. We already know that we will be having the pasta special no matter the choices so we sit back, care free, and enjoy that bottle of bubbly to the end. The second bottle, usually a medium bodied red begins our journey into the first course: bread, bean dip and olives. There are three types of bread served. The small crisp breadsticks, a rustic crusty bread and a focaccia. All three are delicious but don't fill up (and when you finish, be sure to ask for more when your pasta service begins). Next you can get either antipasta or a heavenly Caesar salad. I've always opted for the salad, with home made croutons and dressing. Once this has been cleared, tuck in and prepare. Three very kind and generous men bring full serving dishes of fresh, hand made pasta right to your table or counter. The first serving is a mix of all three. Try them all, even if you believe you won't like them. There is usually a vegetarian option with simple tomatoes and basil. The next pasta usually is fish or cream based. The third is well likely be the most delectable ravioli you will ever eat. The last two times, I only got refills of them. The most recent time, they had an oxtail ravioli. The gods must have been smiling down on us because I don't think I've ever stuffed myself with so much pasta. The time before that was a truffle pumpkin ravioli. Same happy gods, same filling scenario. I left the restaurant with tighter pants. We usually finish it all off with a cup of coffee to help us digest. The espresso is strong and delicious. I can't attest for dessert because I don't think I've ever left room. Maybe one day!",2,1,1,Erin P.,"Brooklyn, NY",340,314,1082

Start out with prosciutto, it will make you think about what is possible with ham, and you may never think about it the same way again. All the bottles of wine on the dinner menu are 25$ (amazing), and carefully picked to complement the freshly made (like hand made this morning) pasta.Oh that pasta. I can honestly say it is some of the best I've ever had. It's Sicilian grandma hand spun good- because it is (minus grandma). Touristy, yes no doubt about it.

5.0,1/20/2014,"Becco is heaven on earth, smack in the middle of restaurant row. I have been here countless times, and am constantly introducing people to this diamond in the rough. Restaurant row is known for its price fix menus and speedy service, which usually sucks. Becco, however, has amazing food and great service to add to their resume.The bread box, white bean spread, and fresh olives in oil they start you off are a perfect beginning to your meal. The sea salt on the focaccia tastes amazing with the cool white bean hummus. Oh and did I mention they have an entire $25 wine list? Yeah, and they are great bottles for $25, the flor prosecco is one of my favorites- I go to eataly to buy bottles to have at home.  I have probably had all the pasta they rotate between for the pastas of the day- spaghetti with marinara sauce, oxtail ravioli, cocoa pumpkin ravioli, 4 cheese gnocchi, rigatoni with veal bolognese, the list goes on for days.  And they are constantly coming back to fill your plate! Most of the time I can barely finish one. All always cooked perfectly al dente, and all always overwhelmingly fresh and delicious. The braised short rib special tends to fall off the bone, and melt in your mouth. The meatballs are the size of baseballs, and taste like grandma made them with love. Spicy shrimp app is another great choice to start.The desert sampler is really the best way to go for desert, especially when dining with friends.

4.0,1/13/2014,"I don't happen to be a big fan of Italian cuisine. If I ever happen to be in the mood for Italian, Carmine's is the place to go. But since everything at Carmine's is meant to feed a family, it's not the best place to go with just one other person.So I checked out Becco for an early dinner last night, made reservations about an hour in advance over the phone. It's small, but it does have 2 levels for dining. My waitress was very accomodating, and able to answer any questions we had concerning the menu.I ordered the Sinfonia di Paste, table side service of 3 different pastas.  It came with Antipasto Misto as an appetizer. The grilled vegetables and seafood were tasty and well presented. A waiter soon arrived with the pasta and served me. The first was rigatoni in a tomato basil sauce. The main reason I don't love Italian food is because I don't love tomato sauce. This was good though. It was not too sweet, the basil was very noticeable, and the rigatoni was cooked perfectly al dente. Fettuccine in a veal based sauced came next. Once again, the pasta was al dente. I liked it a lot. The third serving was ravioli, but I can't remember what the sauce was. Also good. Forgot to mention this was limitless pasta, you can eat as much as you'd like. I was full after the first plate though so making it limitless wasn't really necessary.

We had a reservation and within 10 minutes of our reservation time were seated at a very nice table. We immediately received water and a lovely bread/cracker basket with delicious green olives.  Our waiter was friendly and explained the menu and answered our questions. We chose to have their unlimited 3 pasta dinner with a cesear salad which was $22.00 . We also shared the $25.00 bottle of wine.(they had a wine list of several bottles at that price) Both the dinner and the wine were great. I loved that the waiters walked around with the three different pastas that were prepared that night  (they change daily) looking to see if your plate was empty and if you wanted any or all of the choices.

They said management would not approve because I had a few bites of her pasta and you were not aloud to share.  We were not sharing, I had my own dinner. She hardly ate anything, certainly not $22.95 worth of pasta.   I asked to see the manager who looked like he was out of a 1970 ""Senoir Prom"" movie.  He absolutely   refused her another scoop of pasta.  could not believe what I was hearing.  I have been the best restaurants in NY and some that are not the best, but most try to please their customers.  Here, they were adamant about sticking to some silly policy.  The bartender felt so bad for her, he offered her a free drink which she didn't want.  The manager told me if I had a complaint to go onto their website, but there is not place on their website to complain.  It is really the point of it all.  I have not seen anything like this ever in NYC.  I would not advise going to this restaurant.  i will never step a foot in there again.",0,0,0,nicki b.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,2

4.0,1/5/2014,"I was in search of a highly rated Italian restaurant for a pre-Broadway show dinner on Friday night and stumbled upon Becco while searching on Yelp. I made reservations via Open Table approximately one week before, and reservation times were already very limited. Only 5:00 and earlier and 7:30 and later were still available so make sure to book reservations relatively far in advance if you want to dine here!We were quickly greeted, had our coats checked, and seated. The restaurant looks very small from the front but really keeps going and going back. We were seated in the very back corner, which was nice to not have couples crowded on both sides of us. Yes, as a Pittsburgh resident, I do enjoy my space!Our waiter was fabulous! Though the food was very tasty, he was the best part of our experience at Becco. I wish I could remember his name to give him credit here on Yelp.Becco has an extensive list of $25 wines, which is absolutely genius. I'm sure most people order at least one bottle. However, I was already quite tired and was concerned about falling asleep during our Broadway show, so I sadly turned down the tempting offer.A little box of bread was quickly delivered to our table along with olives and some sort of delectable spread. It was a great way to start the meal.The hubby and I both started with the Insalata Cesare, which was good but not mind blowing. I ordered the Sinfonia di Paste, a trio of pastas that changes daily, and my husband ordered the Costolette di Maiale etc., or the double cut pork chop for those of us non-Italian speakers. The pork chop was cooked very well. The pastas were tasty. Two of the three were OK - a linguine with clams and a simple pasta with a marinara sauce. However, what made the trio for me (and why I ordered it in the first place), was a goat cheese and beet ravioli. Mmm... very good!Overall, I enjoyed Becco and thought that the cost for what was delivered was very fair.

I'm not claustrophobic but I started to feel some come on by the end of the meal.

2.0,1/2/2014,"So I will again preface this review and state that I am only writing it as a gluten-free diner.  I went to Becco with a large group pre-show and had called ahead to ask about gluten-free options.  The hostess indicated that I would have to talk to the server about options, which I did upon arrival.  I was disappointed to learn Becco does not offer gluten free pasta (ok, how hard is it to boil another pot of water for gf pasta?!), and when I asked the server if their entrees could be modified, he only gave me 2 options to choose from (they had a huge menu, and only 2 things could be modified!).  He said that almost everything had flour in it and they couldn't change the dishes.  So I went with the chicken option, which came with olives.  I don't like olives, and the server smugly told me ""that's what gives the dish its flavor.""  Um..well..what if I don't like the flavor of olives?!  Once the food arrived (it still had olives in it), it actually wasn't that awful, but I was overall unimpressed with their ability to bring me something I WANTED to eat.I was disappointed in this restaurant's lack of options for gluten-free diners, and their response to my request to modify their menu choices to accommodate my dietary needs.  Eating gluten-free is not that uncommon anymore, and this place needs to catch up with the times.  (Gluten-free issue aside, the place is also tiny and crammed, and the water closets are next to the kitchen, so you have to fight with waiters to get through).There are so many awesome restaurants in NYC that do gluten-free well and will go out of their way to make allergy-prone diners more comfortable. Becco is not one of those places.*EDIT post publication: the restaurant's manager reached out to me after reading my review and apologized for my experience and offered a voucher.  I appreciated the gesture and offered ways to improve the dining experience there for gluten-free diners.  Thus I am updating my review to 2 stars.",3,0,0,Meg D.,"Hartford, CT",0,48,0

In a corner upstairs in the NOISIEST restaurant I have ever been to. We couldn't even hear ourselves talk. Our waiter kept looking past us while speaking to us, like we were completely a waste of his time. Once he took our order, he was a no-show until we flagged down other waiters for help. Two of our guests ordered the 3 pasta plate specials and it seemed we just kept getting overlooked. We never even saw the 3rd pasta waiter walking around after our first initial serving. We were really disappointed in our experience. We left one person at the table to pay while we moved on to our show... no waiter to check on us for desserts, coffee, or how we were enjoying our dinner.  I'd say the food was good but it was completely overshadowed by the poor experience we had. Days after leaving NYC, we still think about how disappointed we are and how many other amazing restaurants we could have chosen to spend such our money at. We visit every year and this won't be on our list to revisit. :(",1,0,0,LRB L.,"Georgetown, TX",191,42,1

4.0,12/29/2013,"Becco is well known in this Theater District area to tourists and locals alike for the most beloved thing on their menu, that changes seasonally - their three pastas option for approximately less than $25!  THAT is amazing to anyone's ears and wallet!We held our annual friend's Christmas dinner here; everyone unanimously agreed that Becco would not only be able to accommodate the six of us, but we could enjoy ourselves without feeling rushed in the heart of the holiday season.  I would highly recommend the upstairs seating; it feels more intimate, and the noise level is much less then the overall chaotic ground level.  We were tucked away in a little corner, to the left of the stair case; it couldn't have been more perfect.We started the night with a glass of wine in hand, as Lidia would have intended it, and waited the arrival of the three pastas.  First to arrive was the beet ravioli in a light mint sauce; this turned out to be the fan favorite of the night.  Me, personally, their pumpkin ravioli in the autumn months is beyond addicting; keep that mentally in the back of your mind for 2014.  Next pasta was the linguini with Long Island clams in a very simply perfect garlic and oil sauce.  This was absolutely divine!  Lastly, as always, was Lidia's house tomato sauce in a paperdella pasta.  Make sure you don't have the waiter take your plate before you've had your fill!  A waiter tried to take my plate away after one round, and I nearly bit his head off; true story.The decor was a tasteful explosion of Christmas; garlands and wreaths to be seen throughout.  One star was removed because we felt that service was not 100% based on the fact that we were not nearly as liquored up as the table of twelve next to us.  But hey, we did get what we wanted, and the night was memorable.  See you in the warmer months Becco to see your menu changes!",1,1,1,Jaclyn C.,"Brooklyn, NY",1216,896,1227

The first came with shrimp and as a non-seafood eater, I was promised a serving of that sans shrimp which never came. The other two, I found to be very bland with watery, runny sauces.

3.0,12/27/2013,"UPDATE: I am raising this rating to 3 Stars after Becco's manager read the review below, contacted me and asked me to return to the restaurant to give them another chance. I give them high praise for wanting to hear about their shortcomings and for reaching out when I complained. The food was indeed better. Still, after our last experience we weren't eager to trust the kitchen with more than the pasta special, and a dessert of sorbets. Our conclusion: the service is still great, and the ""trio of pastas"" special remains a fine value worthy of a pre-theater meal in New York. I can't say anything about the menu beyond that. On this visit, the hostess and waiters no doubt we're told to fawn over us, delivering complimentary prosecco, biscotti, and muscato, in addition to a nice credit. Can't complain about the service. And the food? Once again, the bread basket and olives are nice and generous, and once again the best thing we had was the spaghetti. It's fresh and properly cooked, though on this visit the special spaghetti with julienne vegetables was under-seasoned. Thank goodness a server was right behind with penne in vodka sauce. The dish featured small, vapid gulf shrimp (I wouldn't expect more for this price), but a sauce that managed to rescue the spaghetti that shared the plate. Mushroom ravioli were the 3rd pasta and better than last time -- tender, rich and flavorful, though the sauces were all watery.  When piled together on one plate, everything runs into everything else. Those photos on Yelp showing three distinct little mounds of pasta on one big plate? I haven't seen that at Becco. The watery sauces all form more of a soupy mess. My solution: you can just tell the waiters to slow it down and tackle one or two pastas at a time. Bottom line: I appreciate good service and responsive management. I'm no longer in the ""never again"" camp. If you do go to Becco and aren't happy, you should let them know before you leave. ORIGINAL REVIEW IN ITS ENTIRETY:Never Again.Perhaps it was a bad night for the kitchen. Perhaps my standards have gone up. Or more likely this place has just gone downhill fast. We've been to Becco as a pre-theater restaurant 3 or 4 times in the past, but will never go back. At this point, the only good thing I can say is they do get you out in time for your show. Veal: Overcooked, dry, and chewyMeatballs: Baseball sized, dry, and flavorlessBurrata: Tiny portion disguised by a huge greasy slab of bread with chopped, bitter, under seasoned rapiniPulled pork entree: Underseasoned and cooked until it was bone dryCaesar salad: Respectable, not over-dressed, a fine way to start the mealOrecchiette with pancetta and cabbage: Watery and flavorlessMushroom ravioli in butter: OK if you trim the edges (90% pasta, 10% filling)The best thing on the menu was the spaghetti in a simple fresh tomato sauce. At least the pasta was al dente and the Parmesan on the table gave it flavor. The Sangiovese wine we selected was barely drinkable, but at least it was cheap. The same can't be said for our meal overall. $320 for 7 people and nothing memorable. If you are on a budget but want a sit down dinner experience with reservations, and you are satisfied with just pasta for dinner and aren't too discriminating, I would still say you might want to consider Becco for the $23 unlimited pasta.

Right below the skylight. That warm light coming down almost gives you that sense of being outside. They welcome us with a lovely array of breads in a wooden box, a sort of bean puree and a mixture of olives. It's always the loveliest way to start our meal. My husband always gets the lunch pasta special. Which is the all you can eat, in house made delectable pastas. I can never stay away from the salmon. Being from the Northwest I always so impressed by how perfectly cooked and flavorful the salmon at Becco is. They sometimes give the lemon in the yellow mesh to squeeze over my fish. The edges of the salmon are cooked to a mouth watering crispness. Yum! It makes me drool a little just writing about it. This is an amazing Italian restaurant.

5.0,12/22/2013,"Ate here on Saturday before seeing a show on Broadway... So I debated on giving this restaurant a 4 or 5 stars for quite a while... I ultimately chose to give it 5 stars and here's why... Our server took a while to greet us but when he did he was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. He even let us try different bottles of wine until we were satisfied with our option. Speaking of which, this joint has a whole list of Italian/French wines for $25 per bottle, which was a very nice deal. Now on to the food... Everything was outstanding. I ordered the mixed seafood ""Zuppa"" with ""lobster brodo"" on top of a bed of farfella pasta.  The broth was thick and rich but not too creamy or oily. It almost reminded me of reduced shrimp stock with a touch of cream. Truly one of the best sauces to ever line my ever-expanding belly. The seafood was perfectly cooked and the portion size was just right. About 4 scallops, 4 shrimp, a piece of swordfish, and two pieces of salmon for about $25. For New York, this was very reasonable. My lady ordered the Chicken with olives and spinach, which was equally delicious. The sauces are what really made both these dishes stand out from other meals I've had. Sure anyone can make seafood and chicken, but I've realized over the years that the true key to a great meal is always the sauces. If you can make a fantastic sauce, the meat itself isn't that important as long as its cooked and seasoned properly. The complimentary breadsticks and ceasar salads at Becco were equally impressive. With every meal, you get a fresh heaping of ceasar salad that tasted like it was tossed right before it hit your plate. Very fresh lettuce and an unbelievably tasty dressing with super crunchy croutons. Between the bread basket and salad I was already full. Finally, there's the unique fresh pasta option. For an additional $9 you can get all you can eat pasta with your entree. Every day Becco offers 3 unique pasta dishes as part of this deal. That night they were offering a linguine with clams in garlic sauce, beet and goat cheese ravioi and a simple bow tie pasta with tomato/basil sauce. Despite being fresh pasta I think I was only a fan of the linguine. The other two were kind of bland.  Either way, all you can eat fresh pasta for $9 is just as good as sex.The only issue I had with Becco was the setup of the restaurant. It's loud, its cramped and it's incredibly crowded. I could literally smell the cologne on the guy next to me as there was about a foot of space between our tables. At one point I was considering extending my fork over onto his plate so I could try his Osso Bucco. So if your claustrophobic, obese, or can't stand crowds in general, I suggest you not eat here. Besides that and the fact that our waiter kind of disappeared on us halfway through our meal,  I loved my experience at Becco. For a NYC restaurant it was very well priced, classy and unique. Sure, I felt like a sardine the whole night but at least I was shoveling great food down by mouth for a few hours.",1,0,0,Jarrod F.,"Westminster, MD",135,299,172
3.0,12/22/2013,"The brothership's eyes lit up when I first mentioned an AYCE pasta offering years ago, so it was a no-brainer for his welcome-home meal. I'll concede that both Midtown and Lidia rub me the wrong way, so Becco had that going against it even made the turn onto 46th, and our arrival didn't reassure of anything positive*.Fortunately we received our menus, water, and bread very shortly after being seated, and the service remained the bright spot throughout our meal. The bread was pretty good (some rectangles of focaccia, nubs of a rustic country loaf, and a couple handfuls of breadsticks); an expected tactic to passively hinder maximizing your bang for the buck when the real stuff arrives, especially since they were accompanied by an addictive white bean paste and some olives. We went for the aforementioned $22.95 Sinfonia di Paste, which starts with a Caesar salad or an assorted antipasti plate and is followed by bottomless, table-side servings of the three*** daily pasta specials. The vegetables of the antipasti misto were a solid start, but the octopus was rubbery and the fried skate(fish) COLD. We then received our empty pasta-plates-to-be, which we were informed could be filled with mushroom* ravioli (easily the best, but with MULTIPLE empty ravioli), orechiette with bacon&cabbage (with a horrendous meat-free alternative to one that they should not bother with because it was insulting rather than appreciated by this non-carnivore), and/or spaghetti with tomato&basil (as pedestrian as it sounds - wasn't expecting Scarpetta, but SHEESH, at least be consistent with the basil). Delivery of said pasta started off shakily, with tiny portions and no sign of other pastas, then it came out in seemingly unstoppable waves where they overfill your plate...all told, I ate 9 plates full. The logistics of the operation are still unclear to me, as we seemed to only ever receive the first portions from the pans as they arrived in the dining room, and they immediately returned to the kitchen after allocating portions to our table. It's a shame they couldn't elevate the middle-America-esque, mainstream Italian-American concept**. The service here cannot be denied, as everyone with whom we interacted (once we were seated****) was genuinely pleasant. Multiple folks checked on our table, and not just because we had 'potential regulars' targets on our backs as 6'3""+ and polishing off massive portions of food.Food here was a 2.5, the service was a 4.5, the space to sit and policy near the entrance/exit led to a 1, and the portions+price point warranted a 4, so a 3 is more than fair. For kinglike portions for less than $60 before heading to a game at the Garden (or a show, as they ask you if you need to be somewhere when confirming your reservation AND once you are seated), we weren't mad, but won't be back.*The front door policy at this place is really atrocious and brings efficiency to a level that completely neglects hospitality. They almost tackle you at the door with a confrontational 'Do you have a reservation?'. Utter the magic word and your affirmative is thanked with an awkward dance with two men inside the tiny entry vestibule as they make unreasonable demands of everyone unlucky enough to be trapped in the Bermuda triangle simultaneously. (If the coat rack has already filled up, you're out of luck.) Sidle your way up to the maitre'd and offer your name and things get less awkward once you get to your tight, against-the-wall table with the back of your chair against another EMPTY chair, anxious for things to only exacerbate when someone arrives to fill it.**Italians would be appalled by the mere thought of any amount of improperly cooked pasta, let alone this much.  Sure, you can deny at any point and are you own maker here, but the mass production model clearly did not lend well to preparing pasta appropriately. I'll admit the a la carte prices weren't too offputting and the dishes circulating to other tables indicated that might've been a better route. ***As you can see, they are down to 3 (4 if you count the dogshow) options from the five mentioned in previous reviews.****The three up front were, quite frankly, cold human beings hardened by enforcing a foolish but financially-important-to-patrol policy.^What kind of room has no windows or doors? a mushroom. nailed it.As of this listing there still exists a knockoff splinter listing yelp.com/biz/becco-resta…",0,0,0,George C.,"New York, NY",0,7747,14304

Once you're inside you're whisked away to a different, cozy, dark Italian world. No really, it seems like your in an intimate cafe in Italy. The guys working there had thick accents. We were greeted with a really cool variety of breads and two dipping sauces.... yummmmmm!Anyway, I really wanted to try the pasta special (thanks again NY yelpers)- all you can eat of their three chosen pastas that night. It also came with a choice of caesar salad or antipasto misto (a variety of grilled and marinated vegetables and seafood).The antipasto misto was really interesting. I liked what they had done to them, and their seafood was unique and totally not what I was expecting. The pastas were really different as well. One was a wheat, long flat pasta with tomato sauce,another was curly pasta and sausage,and the third was a gnocchi made from cornmeal. Odd... different... but quite delightful! The one with sausage was my favorite and most ""normal"". The cornmeal gnocchi was cheesy and almost reminded me of potatoes au gratin, and the wheat pasta was almost a little ""healthy""... if you know what I mean. But I really liked the variety. Boyfriend ordered the Galleto al Forno- a chicken dish with roasted garlic, vegetables, and risotto. It was a yummy chicken dish, but nothing insane.

The original game-plan was Carmine's but they were booked solid on Wednesday, November 27, 2013. Yelp helped me to find this gem in the Hell's Kitchen section of Manhattan. We liked it so much we actually went back a second night, the last night of our trip, November, 29, 2013. The first time we were upstairs, the second time downstairs. The main level is very loud, although we were there during prime time and seems a bit more contemporary. The upstairs is darker, and a bit more quiet although we were there for a very early dinner. The second floor has a private unisex single bathroom which is rundown and has wires for the register tacked to the wall. Not great but at least the bathroom seemed well stocked and clean.Without a doubt, their best value on the menu is the Sinfonia di Paste, $23 for dinner.

On the next trip around I asked for more clams and they gave me 6 of them. They were fantastic. The first night my daughter loved her bowl of pasta which was reasonable for $12.00. Night #1 was gemelli and night #2 it was linguine. Both nights they were willing to stain the sauce so she didn't have ""chunks"" in it. She ate the entire bowl both nights.

If one of the pasta selections is Linguini with Clams in the shell, I don't even look at the menu because it's THAT good. When I feel like splurging, their Osso Buco is consistently one of the best I've ever had. A huge piece of veal shank over a bed of farro, Grana Padano and zucchini. I only know Grana Padano is the king of cheese because of Joe Bastianich on MasterChef LOL. The meal is so savory and flavorful!Becco is a noisy, crowded restaurant, but the ambience is comfortable and dinner pace is nice. The service is efficient, humorous and knowledgeable. Plus, their wine binder has a whole page of $25 bottles. It's a great deal and smart of the restaurant to offer it.",5,2,3,Jerry C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",515,538,1321

(though the croutons were almost too large to eat) and the $25 wine selections are great. But: one server, who was challenged by our corner table, repeatedly spillied salad on the guests, and the server who served the pasta medley put one preparation of pasta on top of another prepartion of pasta. not ok. the breads were just ok,  and the bean? dip was just ok",0,0,0,Pam G.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,15,0

However, there was really no place to sit down to wait before seating. The bar area was extremely crowded, mostly with people eating. There was a high noise level both upstairs and downstairs. I would say there about 20 % too many tables for the space.Service was generally quick and attentive.  My only issue was that there too many specials that were not printed, and with the background noise I couldn't absorb any of the 8 to 10  specials except one or two that the the waiter rattled off. I wished they had just printed out the specials. They did do a good job getting us through in time to see a show,  which was only an hour and half after we were seated.I had the 3 pasta preparations. The pumpkin ravioli was  a real standout, but the other two were  not distinct at all. The antipasti misto was a pleasant combination of vegetable favors and seafood morsels.

Two of us had the massive, bone in Veal Parmesan. I think it was the Best Veal Parm I've had and I've been eating Veal Parm since I was 14.The breading was just the right thickness, the mozzarella enhanced the dish and didn't overwhelm the veal or make the breading mushy. And, the Veal was the right consistency not chewy, but flavorful and delicious.We were served an excellent Ceasar's salad to start. Nice crunchy croutons, dressed well and fresh romaine.And, right before we left they maitre 'd gave us a card which said we could come back for dessert after the show for no additional charge!

For entrees, we ordered a flounder and a salmon. Both were simple and exceptional. My salmon was panfried crispy on the surface and tender inside. Their service made me feel pampered. I don't know how the manager does that but even the restaurant was packed, they never kept us waiting at the table. Once we finished the last bite of Caesar Salad, our plates were immediately taken away and entrees served.

4.0,11/17/2013,"The restaurant is a pre-theatre on NYC's Restaurant Row, but attracts as many locals as tourists. For a 7pm reservation on a Saturday night, we only had to wait until 7:30pm for our table for two, when the theatre crowd left.  The bar area is a little tight while waiting to be seated but you should be willing to eat a meal here anywhere they will seat you.  The wait staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu but you need to flag them down if you want a water refill.  The food is unforgettable. They begin with thin crispy Parmesan bread-sticks and thick crusty bread with a white bean and olive oil spread and a handful of olives. The wine list is a steal for NYC at $25 per bottle - any one will do since I don't think Lidia would serve a bad bottle of wine, so be adventurous.  We passed on appetizers and the all-you-can-eat pasta special, and went right to the entrees which include a Caesar Salad, with a mild anchovy dressing.  I ordered the double cut pork chop, which was a triple chop that was seared and finished perfectly with a pink center. DO NOT order the pork well done - that is a thing of the past.  Let the chef cook it right for you.  I ordered a side of spinach with extra garlic. There was no need to add S & P because everything was seasoned perfectly.  The second entree was a Fra Diavlo with a whole lobster, clams, mussels, shrimp, calamari, and octopus swimming in a mildly spicy sauce over - here was the surprise the waiter kept from us - homemade black squid ink linguini.  We passed on dessert and coffee and walked it off to central park and back.  I'm going back with a large group and the maitre de said there are several rooms with no guarantee which one we will be seated in but they can accommodate.

I got the unlimited 3 pasta dishes though 1 of them had a meat sauce I wouldn't eat so they instead gave me a pesto sauce. The mushroom raviolis were my favorite, penne w/ tomato sauce #2 and the pesto #3. The tomato sauce had a nice subtle kick at the end of each bite. I was just not a fan of the pesto and did not finish that portion. The caesar salad and bread were very good. I typically hate unlimited dishes because I never eat enough to make it worthwhile but this was the only option for me. I had 1 small serving of each dish and only ate 2 of them.

3.0,9/12/2013,"Becco is a solid Italian spot, but by no means impressive or unique. I came here with my mom and my girlfriend and we all got the unlimited pasta deal. It came with 3 different pastas (Polenta Gnocchi, Pappardelle with Tomato and Basil and Linguine with White Clam Sauce) and a choice of a Caesar Salad or an Antipasto Misto. In addition, we ordered an heirloom tomato and fresh mozzarella platter to start. I got the Caesar, while my girlfriend and mom opted for the Antipasto Misto.The Fresh Mozzarella and Heirloom Tomatoes was a mixed bag. The pieces of Fresh Mozzarella were very thinly sliced and had almost a grilled consistency (which seemed a little bit strange). The heirloom tomatoes, though, were delicious! Fresh and perfectly ripe, the sweet flavor of the tomatoes matched well with the oil and vinegar that was drizzled on top. I just wish the quantity and quality of the mozzarella matched. It would have made this dish really memorable.Next came the Antipasto Misto - it came with lots of different food! There were two big pieces of portobello mushrooms, some bluefish, some octopus, olives, ricotta cheese and a wide variety of vegetables. This was probably my favorite course of the night (and I had to scavenge from my mom and girlfriend because I ordered the salad!) I definitely would recommend this option.The Caesar Salad was good, but a little too much dressing. The lettuce was crisp as were the croutons, but the dressing wasn't the best I've ever had and there was a lot of it. It didn't taste freshly made - I would have preferred a better dressing and a smaller salad (especially before diving into unlimited pasta). This wasn't the focus of my meal, though, so I still left an open mind because the pasta being delivered to each plate looked delicious!Onto the three pastas! First the Polenta Gnocchi, very interesting, I've never quite had Gnocchi like this before. Each piece was approximately the size of a large scallop. It had polenta inside and was tender on the outside. If you're a fan of polenta, you'll really enjoy this! Next was the Pappardelle with Tomato and Basil. The pasta tasted fresh and was cooked perfectly. The sauce was simple, as it sounds, and matched well. Finally, the Linguine with White Clam Sauce was good as well! The clams came in-the-shell and the linguine was cooked well. Individually, I enjoyed each of the pastas. But there were no surprises: I can't blame any of the pastas individually as, for instance, the Pappardelle with Tomato and Basil is MEANT to be simple. But I wish they would have chosen a pasta that wasn't. If just one of the dishes was compex or unique, it would have made me far more interested in the other pastas. The complexity of this hypothetical pasta would be balanced out by the simpler pastas. All in all, Becco is... decent. The food is fresh, but it's very predictable. No surprise flavors - which also means nothing offensive - but it also meant no adventure. Their wine is fairly inexpensive, though, all bottles are $25. The best scenario I can think of where I would return to Becco would be if I was going to a show that night and had a serious craving for Italian food.",4,0,2,Calvin D.,Hong Kong,103,72,0

4.0,9/7/2013,"We went here before a show.  having a 5:00 reservation we were one of the first ones in the restaurant, but the place was absolutely full by 6:00.  the wait staff was attentive and extremely knowledgeable about the menu including wines and specials.  After reading other Yelp reviews prior to going, neither of us decided to get the 3 pasta special.  I will say that the pasta special does seem to be what many diners come for, with approximately 50% or more of those within viewing distance chowing down on this special.  It did look good and the people looked satisfied.  Another Yelper had mentioned that it was strange how it took so long for the (more expensive) clam pasta to come out.  Sitting in this restaurant for 2.5 hours I can say that the pasta I saw the most was the clam dish followed by the ravioli then the penne with red sauce.We ordered a motz appetizer over bread with broccoli rabe.  Very tasty.  Based on another Yelper's review we also ordered the meatballs.  Oh-my were these HUGE!  Raquetball size and 3 total, there were not too many spices but these all-meat balls were super filling and definitely a value at $12.  Then I got the chicken soup with noodles.  A very simple soup, but flavorful broth.For dinner we got the veal picatta which was a special and the pork chop - based on another Yelp review.  The veal was flavorful, but quite a small portion for $36.  The pork chop for $29 was a big value!  Very well cooked and served with a variety of peppers including 2 hot peppers which was excellent.  I would definitely recommend the pork chop, but it is somewhat spicy.  For dessert we ordered the cheese plate and the Italian custard.  The cheese plate was huge with generous serving of the 4 different cheeses.  The Italian custard with fresh fruit wasn't really like a custard I expected.  Served in a glass, this was more like a mousse.  The fresh fruit was plentiful and consisted of raspberries, strawberries, blackberries and blueberries.  To drink we ordered one $25 bottle of wine which I did not like.  So I ordered a gin rocket, a specialty drink of theirs.  For $12 it was served in a small glass.  It was slightly spicy, pretty good, but not something I would order again.The bathrooms here are plentiful.  There is one at the top of the stairs, two in one hallway and three in another hallway, all unisex.  Despite this there were lines at every one and people were not just going in to go to the bathroom, they would spend like 5 minutes is there doing their hair, make-up or whatever else.  Advice is to not wait until you have to go to try to go, I waited well over 10 minutes.Other mentioned ants or other things in this restaurant.  I saw absolutely nothing of the sort.  The place was very clean.  Noise levels did get quite high once the place filled up which would make it hard for intimate conversation or people with hearing aids or hearing issues.Overall I thought this was a nice experience, fairly affordable, attentive and friendly staff and a menu that provided many options and specials that added even more variety.  Given it's location in Hell's Kitchen I don't think I would go back here.  The food was not unique enough or flavorful enough to compete with the other fabulous sounding restaurants we walked past on the way here.... honestly we almost cancelled our reservation to go elsewhere.  Part of me wishes we had, but at the same time I am glad we went I just won't return.",1,0,0,Kelley S.,"Chicago, IL",108,590,169

2.0,9/2/2013,"bf and i both ordered the all you can eat pasta special. he got the caesar salad as an appetizer and i got the mixed veggies/seafood. i actually like the appetizer a decent amount. however, the pasta was AWFUL. we had three kinds: fettuccine with shiitake mushrooms and some kind of ham/bacon meat, penne with tomato sauce, and artichoke ravioli. of the three, the fettuccine was probably the best one, and even then it was mediocre.the penne with tomato sauce came around next, and i was seriously disappointed. i literally could have cooked way better pasta at home - they had just boiled penne, put in some bland tomato sauce (with no ground meat, or onions, or ANYTHING), and maybe sprinkled in a tiny bit of basil and called it a pasta. the bf said he felt insulted that they could serve a dish like this and that it was more than apparent that the restaurant was just trying to save money and be cheap. the artichoke ravioli came around last so we were hoping that it would be redeeming, but instead it was also bland, with large circles of dough with minimal ""artichoke"" filling inside. this was the second time i've been to becco, but i don't think that we will ever be back.  the pasta they served was seriously mediocre, if not bad, and certainly not worth going out to dinner for. it was so bad that we didn't even eat till we were full, which is what the all you can eat part was for. in my opinion, anyone can make a simple pasta at home by just boiling noodles and pouring ragu over it - you can say it's not ""real"" pasta, BUT the point of going out to an italian restaurant would be so that you can experience delicious real pasta...notthis cheap, bland stuff that becco served. also, they charged $3 for each time they refilled the bf's coke glass - for a restaurant charging $20-30/entree, you should not be getting charged each time you get a refill on your fountain drink. to be fair, i saw other tables around us getting meat dishes and other entrees that actually looked delicious, so maybe it's my fault for going for the all you can eat special. -_-",1,1,0,Susan L.,"Chicago, IL",359,161,136

3.0,8/31/2013,"I guess the all you can eat pasta special is a decent deal considering price but the food was far from spectacular. The pastas we had were gemelli with pesto, spaghetti arrabbiata with breaded and fried shrimp, and gnocchi in a cream sauce. The gnocchi was different than I've ever had it and I lived in Italy for a year and used to eat gnocchi many times per week. Instead of soft, fluffy clouds, they were shaped like thick silver dollars. In addition, they were seemingly seared and hard on the outside but soft in the middle. I prefer traditional gnocchi and the best I've had in the city is at Nica Trattoria. I guess I should also mention that the pasta is served from kitchen staff walking around with large pots and giving helpings of pastas to anyone who ordered the special. Clearly not trying to be a fine dining establishment.The pasta special also comes with a Caesar salad or cold antipasti. We got both. I'd stick with the Caesar salad. It was fine. The antipasti was just random grilled vegetables, and a deep fried baccala with onions (served cold / room temp).We also had the osso bucco which is $36. It definitely wasn't worth the price and I wouldn't order it again even if it were $15. We found it dry and the gravy was just average.They also have a large wine list where every wine costs $25.My favorite Italian restaurant in the city is Lupa and I'd say Becco is about 1/10th as good.Considering price, it's 3 stars (just ok) if you stick with the pasta special.

Seeing as everything on the menu seemed ordinary for their price, I went for the (unlimited) pasta trio: cavatappi bolongese, gnocchi with a cream sauce and spaghetti with a plain tomato sauce.  The pastas were all just okay, but the gnocchi confused me a bit- it was actually an overcooked polenta cake, which would have been absolutely delicious had it been properly cooked. My cousin ordered a chicken dish which was served over polenta, and I wish she were the kind of woman to pull an ""ol' switcheroo"" because it was freaking amazing. The chicken was succulent, beautifully presented and cooked to perfection. A personal suggestion: don't get the pasta unless you've studied the menu and see nothing else more appealing.

The antipasto also included seafood. I asked the waiter if I could get both without fish and he happily said yes. The antipasto was excellent (as was the bread basket!). The first two pastas came first: ravioli with swiss chard and penne with tomato sauce, a little spicy. Both were excellent and filled me up. The waiter came over to see how the linguini without clams was - it never made its way over to us and he apologized for it and quickly ran to find out what happened. Moments later, a specially made linguini without clams came over to the table. It was delicious. Though stuffed, dessert had to be had: the eggless panna cotta. An excellent way to finish off the meal - it was light enough and felt like a good digestive (or at least I'm telling my belly fat that). The bottle of wine we ordered was excellent as well - La Calonica Rosso di Montepuliano, 2011. Must find it and stock up on it! Everything, from the service to the general staff and food went above my expectations. The only thing I wish they did differently was set up the tables. They are on top of each other and it can be a bit difficult to move in/out of them and in general, you don't feel like you have much privacy to freely talk.

We had the all you can eat three pastas and found them rather good. The antipasto appetizer that it came with was terrible (we should have choose the other option which was a caesar salad). The server said the chilled seafood on the antipasto was swordfish and it turned out to be not fresh tuna. The antipasto portion was tiny and seemed to be pre-plated and straight from a jar or can. Service was decent and far from great.",1,2,1,Daniel K.,"Westport, CT",0,21,0
4.0,8/3/2013,"Absolutely love this place.  Been here several times and the experience had always been one of great food and service.Their 3 pasta all you can eat is the best deal in town. Their food is fresh, served promptly by an attentive staff and everyone seems concerned that you are enjoying yourself.Whether as a party of one or a group of 8 the experience was the same! It is best to make a reservation, especially if you are a larger party, but I dropped in once as a single during the dinner rush and was seated promptly.This is a very popular Italian restaurant in the Theater District and they have lots of pre-theatre patrons, so if you are going during the week getting there after the theater rush will make it more enjoyable.They don't rush you either, particularly for the 3-pasta all you can eat, they just keep coming back asking if you want more...Great all around and my first place to recommend to friends and out of town guests.",0,0,0,Jim V.,"Manhattan, NY",50,20,0

Now I might be slightly biased to all things Italian but there is nothing more comforting nor delicious than freshly made pasta covered in a homemade sauce. That's exactly what you get at Becco's but instead of one dish you get three, over and over and over again! If you ever need an excuse to eat pasta (and really, who doesn't have one?), you should definitely haul ass and come here.I need to come back to Becco Restaurant the week before the Marathon in November to start carbing up; the idea of eating pasta until I can't button my pants seems appropriate and beneficial for my glycogen reserves.

2.0,7/28/2013,"A less than stellar dining experience. I really wanted to like this place, but was disappointed repeatedly. I think the initial tone for the dinner was set by the sight of two ants scurrying across my plate before service began. Our waiter was pleasant enough and read through the many dinner specials offered that night on top of the regular menu. Seating was very tight with adjacent tables squeezed way too close together to allow for an intimate atmosphere. We began with two of the appetizers specials. The grilled squid arugula salad was OK, though the squid was bitter from bring over charred on the grill. The saffron rice/mozzarella arrancini (fried rice balls) were bland and too heavy on the saffron.On to the main event. I ordered the Synfonia de pasta ($22.95) which started with a decent antipasto misto. The trio of all you can eat pastas were disappointing. I thought it curious that the waiters served the two cheaper pastas (farfalle in marinara and rainbow chard ravioli) first and then took their time before serving the more expensive linguini with clams. The farfalle was OK, but nothing special. Same goes for the ravioli. The linguini was unpalatable salty and the briny clams didn't help matters. Overall, the pasta trio were empty calories and underwhelming.My wife chose more wisely and got the Ossi buco, which although overpriced at $36, was fairly tasty. Her meal came with the Caesar salad, which was probably the best part of both our dinners. The dressing was well balanced and the lettuce wasn't soggy. We looked through the dessert menu, but nothing popped out as appetizing, and we didn't want to risk another disappointment, so we skipped dessert. For a restaurant that touts itself as down home Italian, this restaurant leaves much to be desired. Oh, and a word about the bathrooms. They are tucked away in the isle that all the kitchen staff is standing/working in. The space is tight and waiting for an open bathroom is an uncomfortable experience.

4.0,7/13/2013,"Becco may have some age, and a miserably touristy location on Restaurant Row in the heart of the Theater District, but it actually puts out good food at more than reasonable prices. It's probably one of the better old school red sauce, family style Italian places I've been to in the city.First off, the restaurant is surprisingly spacious with multiple dining rooms and a more casual bar area. The back dining room has an open atrium on the high ceiling, which I'm always a sucker for, that lets in natural light and almost makes it feel like you're dining in a back garden. Their specialty is the chef's daily preparation of three pastas, which includes a pre-course salad of your choice. Everything is served family style, which makes the dining experience very social and communal, and all the servers actually seem eager to refill your pasta plate as they dance around the dining room with those giant pans of freshly made pastas. Most of my dining companions on the evening I visited ordered the pasta, and all seemed to like each preparation. I ordered the pan seared salmon, with a fava bean puree and fresh fava beans. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the kitchen actually seared my salmon to a medium as requested, and the fava puree had a nice creamy consistency with some texture from the whole fava beans. Never would I have thought that the food here would be prepared with such fresh ingredients and attention to detail. Now I really feel like I've been missing out for over four years, with Becco just a stone's throw away from my apartment. P.S. They have a pretty extensive list of wines for just $25, including mostly Italian whites and reds. Bottles, not by the glass! The 2010 Syrah from Sicily I had was actually quite nice and earthy. Want something a little more epicurean? They offer a reserve wine list as well. The Bastianich family do own a vineyard, after all.",2,0,1,Cecilia Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",762,644,43

As for the food, this fussy restaurant goer loved the pepperoni ripiene and my friends raved about the chicken finished in broth and the pollo limone. What a happy surprise after such a let down at the theater. Prices were reasonable for Restaurant Row and to get a very good bottle of  wine for $25 seemed almost a miracle above 34th St. I will return to this restaurant gladly.

5.0,7/9/2013,"ALL-TIME FAVORITE ITALIAN RESTAURANT. The first time I came here was on a night I had tickets to see Jersey Boys.  They prioritize your table if you're catching a show after dinner, which was a bonus for us that night.  The wait can be a bit long if you don't make reservations since you'll be competing with all the people who are eating before their shows, so I highly recommend getting a reservation here.  The hostess and servers are always a pleasure and more than accommodating.  Although it says that the ambiance is casual, it often doesn't feel so casual as many people are slightly more dressed up to catch a broadway show.  Even so, you won't be ridiculed or looked at funny if you come in with jeans and a t-shirt.  The atmosphere this place sets is quite calming, but yet sets the mood to have 3 hour long conversations with friends and family.If I had to pick one thing to get here, I'd choose the Osso Buco, HANDS DOWN.  The meat is so tender and juicy, that it just falls off the bone as soon as your fork touches it.  It's braised in a sauce that's just so rich in flavor, you'll want to just drink the sauce by itself.  This entree does fall slightly on the expensive spectrum of the menu, but I guarantee that you will not regret it.Another entree I'd highly suggest getting is the pasta deal that they have.  Every night, they feature 3 different pastas and for a fixed price of $23, you get to have as much pasta as your heart and stomach desire!",0,0,0,Diana C.,"Queens, NY",36,102,36

4.0,7/8/2013,"I am Italian and I know good homemade pasta. Lidia did not disappoint. I came here last week before seeing a Broadway show and it seemed that most of the diners were also theatre-goers as well. From the outside it is hard to imagine how big the restaurant is inside. My friend and I were sat at the back of the restaurant. Overhead, there was a huge glass skylight and the natural sunlight was shining down on us during dinner. To start, we received a bread basket with marinated olives and a hummus-like spread. I couldn't figure out what it was..but it was good so I kept eating it. I ordered the Pasta Trio (unlimited daily pasta) and it also came with either a Caesar Salad or a Seafood Antipasto for $23. The Seafood Antipasto was so delicious - a small chunk of swordfish, octopus and different grilled veggies. The pasta offered was gnocchi (which to me was not gnocchi, but more like a polenta disk - delicious none the less), fusilli pasta with pesto (basil tasted so fresh!) and spaghetti arrabiata with fried shrimp (a little spicy kick!). They were all fantastic but my personal favorite was the fusilli with pesto. This particular pasta trio is an unlimited dish. The servers are walking around the restaurant constantly asking you if you would like some more. I could only eat one plate, although my eyes wanted to eat about 10. Even though I did not really take advantage of the unlimited pasta and get ""my money's worth"", I still thought it was a great, affordable deal for being in the heart of NYC. Unfortunately I was too full for dessert, but did get an espresso to cap off my amazing Italian meal. My only complaint - I felt a little rushed during the entire meal.

The food experience: taste, smell, presentation, etc. was magnificent. Our waters were always filled and the appetizers, entrees, and dessert arrived in a timely fashion. The only reason I can't give Becco 5 stars is the temperature. I understand that it's located in Hell's Kitchen and it was a hot and humid summer evening but for the price we paid, we should have felt a little more comfortable instead of sweating nonstop.

The service is reasonably attentive and the food was alright.I liked the white bean spread in the beginning that came with the hard breadsticks and olives.The insalata cesare was pretty good but overly dowsed with dressing. My bistecca alla becco was good but nothing special. The sauteed chicken was tender and nicely done.Decently good food but not worth the price.

4.0,6/24/2013,"Very great restaurant. I would recommend it to anyone in the area. The trio pasta special was very good.

All in all it was really good food and that's why I gave it four stars but the service was not very personable. I would recommend you go here though!",0,0,0,Amanda T.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,1,0
2.0,6/22/2013,"Went early with a reservation @ 4pm on a saturday evening before going to see Once on Broadway. It was pretty empty. They sat  us upstairs. A little warm on a hot summer day up there. Wait staff was attentive and knowledgable, although a little slow on the water refills. Ok , about the food. Three apps, all very small portions. Mine, polentina with melted cheese and Speck prosciutto,  very good. Other app was a seasonal special,  rice ball with cheese and saffron,  very little saffron flavor. Last was mozzarella en carozza. Again small and quite bland. It was not your normal fried mozzarella ,but although it was different it wasn't better. Saving grace was the ceaser salad served table side. A little over dressed but tasty.Dinner was as under seasoned as the apps. I had the peperoni ripieni stuffed peppers , it had the beef, pork, veal meat combo, it was somewhat tasty yet once again, you guessed it, under seasoned. Not worth $22. They put salt and pepper on the table because you are going to need them. The wife had the short rib special, which looked great but again was lacking big flavor, the wine reduction sauce helped a little. Last main course was the Maiale Arista, the pulled pork, $28 for a tiny portion of the blandest pulled pork on the planet. We skipped dessert and headed over to Schmackery around the corner for some kick ass cookies.All in all a very disappointing meal from a restaurant owned by one of my cooking idols.

4.0,5/27/2013,"We went to Becco after a Broadway play. We arrived earlier than our reservation time, and had to wait, but that was okay. A lot of other people were waiting on the street as well and kept saying Becco was ""worth the wait.""I would agree. We were seated in the back of the restaurant under a large sky light. The tables are very close together, which is the one downside. After being seated, olives and bread immediately were delivered to our table. We both decided to get the pasta special, which is about $22/person and included a vegetable and seafood antipasti or a Caesar salad, as well as three house pastas served table side. The pasta portions are unlimited. We both chose to get the vegetable and seafood antipasti, which was a real steal all things considered. There was a wide variety of vegetables---eggplant, zucchini, sun dried tomato, several types of beans, carrot, green beans and cabbage---which had various sauces or were dressed simply with olive oil and vinegar. On a separate plate, we each got a white fish with a dollop of marinara sauce and octopus in an onion vinaigrette. It was a very large portion, all things considered. The pastas available on that day were an arugula filled ravioli (by far the best of the bunch), Fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp and penne in marinara. The shrimp pasta dish was the most bland of the bunch, but the other two were bursting with flavor.Service was a tad slow overall, but fairly attentive. I don't think you can get a better deal for two courses, particularly with an unlimited entree. All the dishes that came out from the regular menu also were tastefully plated and looked delicious.

They asked if we were seeing a show - to speed things up so we wouldn't be late.We weren't - so we were reassured to take our time. My party was 30 mins late but they still let us sit at our table and eat bread while waiting. The food itself is decent. I would give it 3/5 on taste. I got the unlimited pasta. The three that day were pasta bolognese, mushroom ravioli and a regular tomato sauce and pasta. The mushroom ravioli was so good. I wouldn't have minded only getting that dish. The pasta bolognese was decent. It was much better the 2nd time around when it out fresh & piping hot. The regular pasta sauce one was nothing special. We ended up staying an extra 30-40 minutes catching up and never did they once hint at rushing us out.",1,0,1,Carol H.,"Brooklyn, NY",257,257,63

They had a lobster (yes, a whole one) seafood medly linguine special with spicy tomato sauce that was simply to die for.

I was very appreciative of the fact that she asked if I had a show to catch (I did, and the food came noticeably faster).The food itself was fantastic. I had a Pollo al Limone, which came with a very solid Caesar Salad. The chicken was incredibly tender, and the sauce was just the right amount of flavourful.

What the heck!! Lucklily, this place was only across the street. And boy, was I glad I went here. From the time that we sat down, we were greeted generously. The waiter was really knowledgeable about the menu, except for the specials for the day, in which he had to read off a cheat sheet and explain it to us. It was kinda funny when he told me and my friend, ""It's our little secret. Don't tell anyone."" On top of that, the waiter was also knows what goes on in the neigborhood. So he asked us whether we're are eating there for a pre-theater dinner. We didn't have to catch a show that night, but it's always a great sign that the waiters show ways to cater to the customers.We ended up ordering some wine, which blended in very well with the food. One thing about certain restaurants is that under a certain item on the menu, it is classified either as original or house special. Once I saw that, my eyes bulged and I knew that dish was the dish I had to get. It was the Osso buco. The great thing about this dish is that it is seasoned really well and on top of that, the meat is so tender it falls right off the bone. It's almost like lamb shank at a Moroccan restaurant. I'm glad that this restaurant prepared the food right because it made the experience that much better.The food is a little on the pricey side, but definitely worth going to.",1,0,1,Francis T.,"Rego Park, NY",81,36,0

You can add the unlimited pasta special for $9 to any entree. So for the two of us we did one special, one osso buco (which was very good btw) and one add on pasta and bottle of inexpensive wine.

1.0,4/1/2013,"We went here after a play. We have lived in NY for 13 years and I think this is the grossest and most underwhelming Italian restaurant we have ever been to. Had high expectations because we like Lidia, but this place is totally abandoned and the crew running it is rude, the restaurant feels unclean (and the bathrooms are absolutely disgusting). This would have all been tolerable had the food been good. All three of us got the 'all you can eat' pasta for 20-some dollars which is the only way you can eat any past dishes in this restaurant. All we could eat was three bites total, and I'm going to guess this is how they make their money because I cannot imagine anyone eating more than one serving of the junk that came out of that kitchen. It was as bad as pasta that a first time cook makes in college. With so many thousands of Italian restaurants in NYC I would suggest you SKIP this tourist trap. To the Becco crew- shame on you. Just because you are catering to mostly out of towers doesn't mean you can lower all NYC standards and serve garbage. Also, train your staff. When I asked for wine suggestions your waiter literally handed me the menu violently and said ""page two, YOU figure it out.""

The all-you-can-eat option, which is what I'd remembered so fondly, was such a disappointment.  Three relatively uninteresting pastas (especially the spaghetti with tomato and basil). Lackluster Caesar salad and antipasti. It all just left me feeling overly full and kind of embarrassed at my choice for entertaining.  It's hard to believe this is the place it once was.  (Service was friendly, by the way, but felt like  suburbia.)

2.0,3/18/2013,"I was sadly unimpressed with my meal at Becco.   Three of us went for pre-theater lunch.   We were ushered back to the busy back room where they pack patrons in like sardines.  After sitting for a while with no one tending to us, we had to ask for menus.  After another length of time, we realized we had to hunt a waiter down just to order drinks.  So, needless to say, the meal did not get off on a good foot.  I had high hopes for the rest of our experience, especially the food, but unfortunately things didn't get betterWe order Ceasar salads and shrimp for our appetizers.  Ceasar salad was ok..nothing to write home about.  For our entrees, we each had a different pasta dish.  I had the mushroom ravioli which was bland, overcooked, and with too much sauce. They are making the pasta to basically be served as ""family style"", and in doing so, take away any hope for ""fine italian fare"".  The pasta is slapped in your plate, and when it hits your tastebuds, you get to experience bland, uneventful pasta.  There are so many wonderful Italian options nearby, that I will not try Becco again.  I am really confused by all the high star reviews.  Maybe we experienced a very off day at Becco, but for me and restaurants in NYC, you get one shot, baby.",3,1,0,Kathleen M.,"Allentown, PA",3,55,1

4.0,3/14/2013,"For an Italian place owned by someone with a big name like Lidia Bastianich, this place is totally unpretentious and very well done. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the beautiful dining room, spacious and well lit, and then a backroom which was darker and more intimate. The tables for couples were actually desks, which I thought was a nice touch. The second thing that caught my attention was the large wine list they had for $25! What a great deal- so of course we had to order a bottle, as good wine lovers should. We ordered the stuffed cabbage over spaetzel and the pork chop with mashed potatoes and greens. Both were HUGE and we ended up having to take most of both dishes home. Nonetheless, they were delicious and I was happy to eat them the second time around. To begin, they serve you the house ceaser, which was a little overdressed for my taste, but had delicious croutons. I was a very happy camper after this meal.

4.0,3/13/2013,"I really enjoyed my meal here. Everyone in our decent-sized group had something different and not a single one of us left disappointed. I had the Trancio di Salmone, and although the salmon was nice, it was the roasted brussel sprouts that really stood out. My daughter had the Galletto al Forno (chicken over green beans and cous cous in a broth), and because she's only five I was lucky enough to be able to nibble off her plate as well. I thought the chicken was great and I perhaps enjoyed it even more than my salmon. The meat was juicy and the skin was nice and crisp, just the way I like it. Others at our table went with the Peperoni Ripieni (meat-stuffed peppers), the Porterhouse (served medium-rare and cooked to perfection), Sable fish (a daily special), and the Sinfonia di Paste (three daily pasta preparations). And as I mentioned before, I didn't hear a negative thing about a single dish. Perhaps the lone improvement could have been with the free items served when you initially sit - namely the bread. Both types could have been better, although the dipping sauce was very enjoyable and the assortment of olives that they served were all quite good.

5.0,3/10/2013,"I have been here twice now, once with my boyfriend and then (after it was SO delicious) back with a large group of friends, one who was visiting the city. The first time my boyfriend and I were floored by the affordable, tasty fare so close to the theater district. Most of the restaurants in this area are hilariously overpriced and mediocre, (just good enough to impress the tourists.) Becco is the exception, with it's ""Sinfonia di Pasta"" for 22.95 you get a quality ""all you can eat pasta."" You leave MORE than satisfied and with money to spare in your wallet for that $40.00 glass of wine during intermission at Newsies. The pasta is so tasty and I have to give a special props to the Mushroom Ravioli, this is my boyfriends favorite and (though I DESPISE mushrooms) it is also mine. I can't explain it, and other tries at consuming mushrooms have failed but this pasta is PERFECTION. The sauce is tangy and creamy without being too thick, which is impressive seeing as all of these pastas in the Sinfonia are brought to your table by waiters offering you a portion right from the pan. You get three selections and as much as you'd like not to mention a wonderful salad and olive pre-course. My boyfriend and I loved our first time but we really found success the second time with a large group. This place is PERFECT for large groups. If you all get the Sinfonia (and split one or more of their great options on the 25.00 bottle wine menu) you don't break the bank, have a lovely dinner and a no brainer check to split, it was the ultimate win.

4.0,2/24/2013,"Becco is a very good, simple Italian restaurant. It isn't the best Lidia establishment, but it is very solid and reasonable. We enjoyed a Sunday brunch, and they get points for actually serving Sunday brunch as a lot of restaurants do not.3 at our table opted for the all you can eat pasta for 17.95 at lunch which is really a steal. The three pastas of the day were mushroom ravioli with porcini truffle cream sauce, a simple yet very well executed penne with tomato basil sauce, and a fettuccine bolognese with veal and peas. Of the three, the mushroom ravioli probably edged out the veal bolognese by a hair because the sauce was delicious. The waiters do come around very often and after awhile you kind of lose track of how much you have eaten which can be dangerous. They did seem to come over a lot more with the ravioli for some reason, and we had to ask them for the fettucinne with veal a few times.I chose the veal osso buco and my dad got the lasagna. Both were delicious. Hard to mess up osso buco and it is one of their signature dishes. It came with some tasty squash farroto and I loved that they gave you a little fork to scoop out the best part.. the marrow. Yes. The lasagna was a nice, thick block layered with a delicious meat sauce that my pops liked very much.They aren't serving avant garde cuisine but what they do they do well. You will leave full as portions are large. Yes it is cramped and loud so keep that in mind.

I ordered the ""renowned, unlimited table side service of Executive Chef William Gallagher's Three Daily pasta preparations."" Table side? Really? WHY?? First and I've made this point in previous posts - why are restaurants trying  to distinguish themselves with these unnecessary and even annoying tactics. Just plate the food in the kitchen and serve it to me. This way you garnish the food and present it in an edible manner. Even more absurd, the three pastas were served to me by three waiters using two spoons (they trapped the pasta with the spoons). WHY?? How about you use one large serving spoon? Maybe cause that would be too easy and we need to make things harder to make it seem more refined. But it wasn't. Based on the expressions on two of the waiter's faces, they were not comfortable handling the pasta. This was especially true as they served from behind me and held the pasta over my shoulder and lap. The pasta was then haphazardly put on the plate, including on top of each other creating an amalgam of pasta and pasta sauces. This probably would not have happened it was properly plated in the back by the chef and not by a waiter using two spoons. The pasta was good. As some of the other posts indicate, a touch salty but overall good. The bread sticks were incredible.

The real ""experience"" was our inattentive, dismissive, inept waiter that really blew the night.

Not sure if it's because people only go to Italian places when happy or if it's cause of proximity to the theater district, but given the pretty decent amount of spacing between tables you otherwise wouldn't expect this level of loudness.Service was not bad but the place was obviously really busy, so they were a bit slow in getting to us.",0,0,0,Amy G.,"San Francisco, CA",451,340,14

4.0,1/25/2013,"This place is really more of a 3.5 but I'm rounding up because I would definitely come back if I was in the area.Pros:-Bread basket: LOVE- foccacia, hearty italian bread, BREADSTICKS.  I kept going back for those crispy little things and the bread was perfect for getting the last of the pasta sauces.-All you can eat pasta: It's not the best pasta I've ever had in my life but it's a fun concept, and I really enjoyed my plate.  The night we went there was a spaghetti with arrabiata (spicy) sauce and shrimp, mushroom ravioli in a truffle butter, and pasta primavera (sounded boring at first but this might have actually been my favorite).  The ravioli didn't have as much flavor as I expected but the other two pastas were cooked perfectly al dente and I really enjoyed them.-Pretty good service; they definitely know how to handle people trying to get to shows on time so it was a well timed meal.Cons:-With the all you can eat pasta, you get a choice of either a caesar salad or an antipasto plate with a mix of cooked vegetables and seafood.  Honestly, it wasn't that good and sort of unappetizing.  There was a lot of food but I left most of it untouched.-It was so crowded at the front!  Definitely a place to make a reservation.  I was shocked they had no waiting area other than squishing people into the bar.  If I had been seated in the bar area to eat, I would've been so uncomfortable and annoyed with people bumping into me and standing over my table the whole time.  -An italian restaurant with no tiramisu? Come onnnnn.  The one time my tiramisu-ambivalent boyfriend suggests we order tiramisu (a day I've been waiting for for a long time), they don't have it on the menu.  We got the apple tart instead but it had a  weird texture.  I wouldn't suggest getting it.Good spot and a reliable bet if you need a meal in the theater district before a show.",0,0,0,Mel B.,"Manhattan, NY",24,75,50

The $25 bottles of wine are a great deal. I've discovered some great wines that I otherwise wouldn't have ordered. The all you can eat pasta is a real crowd-pleaser. They always have three different types of pasta and the servers come around with pans of each one every few minutes offering you more. It also comes with either a great Cesar salad or antipasti appetizer. Only issue is that it attracts some loud out-of-towners, but that's to be expected in this neck of the woods.

The dip they served with bread and breadsticks was delicious - olive oil and some sort of tomato puree. My friend ordered the slow cooked pull pork with mash potatoes which tasted meaty if you're into that but good. I ordered the pasta symphony which was yummy. You don't get to chose which pastas (in fact, after reading other reviews, I wasn't even given the option of vegetarian or not - so make sure you voice your preference if you go), but it was so good I didn't care. Pasta noodles were cooked perfectly. Not a fan of the pasta shells though. It was unlimited pasta but I was too full for seconds.

Thankfully, our waitress was peppy and outgoing and saved the service aspect of this place. My friend and I both had the unlimited pasta because it was mentioned in so many reviews. The three pastas of the night were spaghetti, orecchiette with bacon and cabbage, and gnocchi. The gnocchi arrived first and omg they were HUGE. I honestly thought they were scallops. They tasted as unusual as they looked. I couldn't really put my finger on what was wrong but it wasn't good. The spaghetti and orecchiette were mediocre. Thankfully, we had our $25 bottle of wine so that made things seem a little better... as we drank more.I wouldn't recommend coming here if you're not going to see a show in the Theatre District; it's definitely not the most authentic Italian food.

3.0,1/21/2013,"Manhattan is teeming with dining options, brought to you by folks like celebrity chef Lidia Bastianich. With so many choices, and so much quality dining to discover throughout the city, I'd rename her restaurant Becco as just, ""Meh-co."" Becco (Italian for ""peck, nibble, savor"") is located in the heart of the Theater District and is just steps away from Times Square. For this reason, there is no shortage of customers--and the restaurant's seating is arranged to accommodate the influx. Just try to leave without having to physically move your table, to avoid taking out your neighbor's entire meal with your backside.  Speaking of expanding backsides, the portions at Becco are pretty astounding. They offer a ""Sinfonia di Pasta"" that consists of three never-ending courses of pasta: literally, as much as you'd like. I made the fateful mistake of ordering this on one of my visits, and regretted it almost as soon as I walked out the door. It's simply too much pasta; but it's easy to get lured in by the admittedly, super reasonable price. The lesson I learned: no one needs that many carbs, unless they're about to run three back to back marathons. The wine is all priced at $25/bottle and there are some nice choices on the menu, especially for red wine lovers. A crowded restaurant, affordable wine and ten-ton plates of food are not reliable indicators of quality, though. The veal parmesan, for example, is nowhere near as tasty or satisfying as those that I can get back home in Providence, RI. The desserts are...sweet. But I expect more from a dessert than that simple, baseline requirement. And while I haven't had a bad service experience here, I wouldn't say that it's service par excellence; it's too crowded and touristy a place to expect to be treated like a true individual. Becco is a good option if you're in town with the kids and want to go somewhere other than even scarier tourist traps in Times Square, or if you're truly new to the city and are scared to spread your wings into lesser-known neighborhoods. But if you've gotten to know NYC, and can navigate the subway system, get the heck out of midtown. You'll find plenty of Italian food to ""peck, nibble and savor"" that you can truly write home about if you step away from the flashing lights of Broadway.",4,0,0,Rebecca H.,"Providence, RI",203,187,35
5.0,1/19/2013,"I have to tell you...Probably the greatest, ""Tell"" of how great this restaurant is, is the location.  It is this part of Manhattan where after matinee performances on Broadway or just before evening ones, diners flock given the proximity to the theatres.  If I tell you there must be 75-100 restaurants within a 3 block radius, I'm sure I'm not off by that much.  Most restaurants have people outside trying to recruit diners and as you walk by, most are empty.  And then, you get to Becco.  You go down 2 steps, through the first door and WHAM, traffic jam.  After walking several blocks where you could hear a pin drop, all of a sudden, my friends and I couldn't even move because of how busy it is there.The all-you-can-eat pasta was amazing (I do think they should warn diners if any of them are spicy) and the Veal Parm was brilliant.  I had never seen it served on the bone before.Any restaurant with Lidia associated with it makes me want to go but this happens to be one of the more affordable.Tourists visiting NYC, please take my advice...GO HERE!  The service, the food...But make a reservation!  I also got to meet the Executive Chef which was cool but Lidia's son (from Masterchef) was there and we JUST missed him.  I'd give anything to meet him.  Here's brilliant.Absolutely amazing!",0,0,0,B R.,"Mahwah, NJ",37,79,0

The antipasta wasn't great and the Cesar salad was bare and small. The pasta's were ok but there was something I wanted to fix with each of them, but it's hard to complain when it's unlimited.

4.0,1/18/2013,"Located among a cluster of Thia restaurants on restaurant row Becco is easy to spot. Its hard to imagine how large this place is from the outside but once you step in and walk towards the back its easy to realize this place has close to 100 tables. The atmosphere is busy but it doesn't make you fell rushed to eat and leave. we spent close to two hours. Our waiter must have never made eye contact as he read off the specials from memory. He did however recommend some good wine.On to the food:3 out of the 4 people in our party ordered the pasta symphony. I choose the antipasto while the other choose the salad. The other person in our party ordered the sword fish.  The antipasto was good, cold grilled zucchini, eggplant, tomatoes, and a sample of fish and octopus. The others liked their salads. We hurried with the salads and antipasto to get to the pasta, which for the that night was, mushroom ravioli, Fusilli in maranera, and linguine with long island clams. The best was the ravioli (creamy and rich), and a close second was the linguini (had fresh whole clams still in the shell in  a light butter sauce). The fusilli was just alright. I got 3 more servings of the ravioli and the linguini. They only add three clams per each refill which sucked since they were so good. We ordered the Strudel di Mele and the Panna Cotta. both were very good. If its your birthday they also sing a little song for you.

3.0,1/17/2013,"3.5 stars. Very touristy and good for pre theater. I'm not a huge fan Italian American, and also not a huge fan of Lidia B. But I've been wanting to try Becco for a while. You can just walk in, but i think you'll be sitting at the bar. There is a big dining room but its really cramped and service is somewhat inconsistent and slow, actually it was kind of bad.  I came here with a girlfriend on Thurs night at 7. The house was already packed. Bread basket was good, yummy focaccia, white bread, breadsticks with some kind of tomato purée. I went for the pasta special: 3 house made pastas (unlimited for $22.95- I could only have the first round)  which they can make vegetarian (one of them was a oxtail ravioli, I got mushroom instead- it was sort of al dente, not really flavorful, kinda frozen tasting).  There was a pesto fusili which i liked from a texture standpoint- pesto was a bit strong on the cilantro and could have used more cheese (the table side Parmesan is kind of eh- not strong).There was also a spaghetti pomodoro with basil, which was pretty good. The tomato sauce was sweet and the basil gave it enough kick. Not the best I've ever had. But not bad. My friend got the sea bass which was a medium sized portion. I didn't eat it at all, so I don't know about the taste but I think she liked it. The entrees come with soup or caesar salad and she got the Caesar (which I ate) because she got a specialty salad- the pear Gorgonzola. I think she liked it. My pasta special came with a choice of Caesar or antipasti and though I ordered the latter, they initially made a mistake and brought the Caesar. When they finally brought the antipasti, I could not even eat two bites, it was downed in vinegar, unfresh and the seafood ( such as squid) was hard as a rock. Appreciate the pasta concept, as I love pasta but def not a place for people who really know good Italian.  We didn't stay for desert.

There wasn't much of a kid's menu if my memory serves correctly. They just had plain pasta. I had the grilled swordfish with spaghetti squash. It was sooo good.

5.0,1/3/2013,"""Tutti a tavola a mangiare"" is the only thing that kept running through my head when I walked into Becco lol. If you know Lydia or have ever watched ""Lydia's Italian table"" then you know why. As cold as it was yesterday, I happened to be in the neighborhood of Becco and being that it was bookmarked, there was no doubt I was going to try it. Delightfully prancing into the heated doorways of Becco from the frigid temperatures outside, I was greeted by a pretty and very sweet girl who offered to take our coats. She gave us our coat check ticket and we then walked through a set of second doors where the hostess asked if we had reservations or not. We did not, and were then escorted to the back of the reaturant that was filled with patrons dining for the lunch hour. Lucky for us, we were seated under a beautiful skylight that's in the restaurant. Lots of natural light came in and I felt like I was in the spotlight lol. We were immediately served a basket of yummy breads that held crispy thin breadsticks, a crusty Italian bread, and olive and sea salt foccacia. The basket was accompanied by a little dish of mixed Mediterranean olives and I believe a pepper hummus. The waiter then came over and gave us our menu and a wine menu and explained the wine menu. He was very polite with an authentic Italian accent to make the experience all the better!. We already knew what we were ordering since we did research before hand. We came across this fantastic lunch special that they offer which gives you three unlimited pastas. Set on our option, we sat and ate our appetizer while waiting for the waiter to return. The bread, olives and hummus I would have been happy with alone! The olive and sea salt foccacia! Wow! I'm a bread kind of girl and this bread was amazing! The pepper hummus was pretty good too, very different. The waiter came over and we told him we were going to order the lunch special. He told us the pastas for today would be a rigatoni with house marinara sauce and fresh basil, a mushroom ravioli with a butter and truffle sauce, and a linguini with scallops and white sauce. He also told us we had an appetizer to choose from as well. There was a ceasar salad and antipasto to choose from. He suggested we get an antipasto and share the ceasar salad. Sold! Becco was bustling with waiters all around, coming and going. The lunch hour was extremely busy. The waiter came over with our salad and antipasto quickly. He split the salad between us and served the antipasto. Ceasar salad is rather hard to mess up, but this was a really good one. The croutons was fresh and big. Now the antipasto salad had all sorts of things and flavors. There were even some things I could not identify! I know there was fresh mozzarella, roasted peppers, mushrooms, green beans with horseradish sauce, a small mixed bean salad, and zucchini. Everything was really good on this plate, even though they were all together each one had its own distinct flavor. When we had finished our antipasto and salad, I was ready for the main course! The waiter came over and gave us clean new plates, not even 2 minutes later, the busboys were coming out with the pastas. They were being served right from the pan! The first they served was the rigatoni, then the linguini, and the one I was waiting for, the ravioli!! I decided on tasting them in the order that they came. Rigitoni- delicious! Aldente pasta with a fantastic marinara sauce. I truly loved it! It was tangy and tomato-y. The fresh basil on top added the perfect finish.Linguine- the linguine was very good. I believe it was whole wheat pasta also Aldente. It tasted as if were in a clam cream sauce with pieces of scallops. Yum!Ravioli- yum yum yum! I loved these raviolis! Of course made fresh, thin and light, not thick and doughy. The mushrooms inside were perfect and the truffle butter sauce was amazing! It had a slight tartness to it. Definetly my fav.I think I had two rounds and I was stuffed! I was hoping to go more, but the pasta was filling. However, I was not stuffed enough for a dessert, thanks to fellow diners ordering desserts, they looked so good, I had to try! We ordered the pannacotta. It came with pickled raisins and figs which were super tart and tangy! The pannacotta itself was delicious. Delicate and creamy, loved it.Overall, I adored Becco and give it 5 stars because everything from the coat check girl to servers and busboys, food, decor, waiter, everything was perfect!

3.0,12/30/2012,"I really wanted to love this place. Instead, I find myself saying - it was good.  As others have said, trying to find a decent place to eat in the theater district isn't easy.Yet, why would they pack 7 of us into a table clearly built for 4-5? And squeeze us in so that another couple couldn't even leave? Its this type of sardine effect that can really make a meal feel uncomfortable.  And how is our table at 6p not ready? Were you seating people at 4:30??? And for a place that has kids that come in with families for theater (and there were bunches), how about an option other than ""pasta with butter""? Not looking for a lot -- just SOMETHING.  Service was a little frenetic.  On the plus side, the prix-fixe of 3 types of pastas (all you can eat) is an excellent deal and you can see why so many people order it.  22.95 is a very good deal, though they skimp on the shrimp pieces at that price (unless you say: hey, I want more than just the pasta).  I had the double pork chop that had been brined.  It was WAY too tough.  Very chewy and hard to cut in the first place.  I should've gone with the Osso Bucco as one of my other dinnermates had.So, overall, an ok meal.  But in a city with so many other restaurants, I'm not sure I'll be back.",2,0,0,Dan S.,"Hartford, CT",309,1076,259

Service was mostly attentive minus one significant oversight in the food service (more on that later). The prosciutto appetizer was excellent. The caesar salad however was a bit wet from the lettuce rinsing which watered-down the flavor of the dressing. One of the entrees - the stuffed peppers with spaetzel - was very good. The other entree was a tasting of 3 pastas served table-side onto the same plate. The menu billed the item as ""unlimited"" meaning one could choose to have more of one or all of the pastas after the initial tasting.  The unlimited arrangement seemed unusual for this type of restaurant, as we were certainly were not there for mass quantities of food. It was a good thing because the server hardly ever reappeared to offer additional pasta. After 10 minutes staring at an empty plate i managed to track down a waiter who then - 10 minutes later - came back with an additional portion. The pastas themselves were good, but not great, so be forewarned that if you choose this dish you should be prepared to either be aggressive with the servers or leave disappointed (and a little hungry).",0,0,0,Joanna J.,"Newton, MA",0,19,0

The restaurant was packed when we arrived but we were seated in 10 minutes. We made a reservation a week in advance. The only down side was we were seated in the back by the waiters station. We ordered the fish and all you can eat pasta, both reasonably priced. The pasta includes three different kinds and changes every night. I had spaghetti with clams, ravioli, and i cant remember the last one. The tuna was amazing and tasted very fresh. The pasta would have been fantastic but it was swimming in butter. I guess that's what you get when you are making pasta for the masses.   The best part about this restaurant is their wine list. They have a bunch of wines under $50. They didn't taste cheap either.

3.0,11/25/2012,"If you are looking for a spot for big Italian dinners, Becco's definitely it.Before we ordered, we got two items off the antipasti: Prosciutto San Danielle and the Tonnato di Vitello.  For the prosciutto, you can either choose di Parma or San Danielle, and since we're all fans of San Danielle, that's what we went with.  Can't go wrong with either!  I didn't like the Tonnato di Vitello at all.  It is roasted veal loin sliced paper thin & topped with diced plum tomato, capers, scallions & tuna aioli.  The veal loin was great, with a nice red hue in the middle, but that tuna aioli was really weird.  It was like eating a can of tuna, in a cream form.  Too strong and fishy.My friend went for the Sinfonia di Paste, which is the unlimited pasta course and comes with Caesar salad.  After looking through the menu, I opted for veal chop, with the pasta as add on.The pastas of the night were Gnocchi Gorgonzola, Penne Bolognese, and Spaghetti Marinara.  To be honest, they were all kind of meh, although I do like the bolognese the most since the meat sauce is nice.  However, all the pastas were definitely overcooked.  They cook up huge batches in these pans and they either just reheat it or the large volume mess up the cooking time.  Gnocchi was like eating really soft dough.  Flavors were good, but just too soft for the pastas.  Sorta disappointing since we were really looking forward to it.For my veal chop, the Costoletta di Vitello alla Joe, it was a perfectly grilled piece of veal.  It is also served with garlic mashed potatoes, caramelized shallots & escarole with prosciutto.  Not a bad combo at all.  Huge huge cut for the veal chop, and the garlic mashed was really garlicky, which was awesome.  Tried a bit of my friend's Osso Buco alla Becco, and wow that thing is fall off the bone tender.  They give you a small spoon too for the marrow.  For the lamb lover's, Porterhouse d'Agnello is a nice choice, although my other friend's order was a little overcooked.Service was sorta spotty.  Our main waiter was hard to find.  A few times we wanted more pasta, but you have to wait until they come around.Price is not bad, but with all the add-ons, it can get up there, but man, the portions here is big.  Definitely won't leave hungry.  It's also deceptively big so they can fit large parties.  They also have a lot of wine for a really reasonable price.Just too bad the pastas were way overcooked and the Tonnato di Vitello wasn't really for us.",3,0,1,Duke C.,"Torrance, CA",1032,1202,46

4.0,11/13/2012,"In short, making delicious italian affordable in an area where everything is over priced and lacking quality.We went on a Monday, and it was busy.  Reservations would be wise.  We got a small table in the back against the wine wall.  And like many other places, very tight and intimate with the table next to you.  So don't think you'll be able to have a conversation with your date without the input of your neighbor, because they will hear all that is said and you will have no secrets.  The beauty of this place is the prices.  Yes, the entrees are about $25+ a person. But the VALUE of the food makes it worth it.  In many places in the Theatre District you can expect those prices, but the value and quality of the food is hit or miss.  Here, expect greatness.  The specials for the night were never ending... as a server myself, I couldnt believe how long our server went on and on and on and on about things that were new, and in addition to what we saw.  We really didn't remember half of them.  But what did catch our attention was the pasta dinner special.  For $24 a person, you get a salad or the antipasto as a starter, and then three different pastas that are never ending. Yes... never... ending... as much as you want.  The selections for our night were penne bolognese, wild mushroom ravioli, and spaghetti marinara with fresh basil.  I don't eat meat, my boyfriend asked if it was possible to get any combination and avoid the meat pasta, to which the server said yes, absolutely, they could make a no meat dish.  I wasn't expecting that, I was just thinking, I'll skip that meat pasta.  Water was served when we sat down, and bread basket and olives as well.  Since it was my boyfriends birthday, and we had a connection in getting our reservation, glasses of prosecco were brought over.  It was a really nice touch.  We both got the salad, and with my boyfriend being picky about his salad dressing, he was really impressed.  He loves his salad dressing...but its gotta be flavorful, and plentiful. This was both.  When it came time for the dinner, the new plates were warm (nice touch), and the pasta served in great portions.  I skipped the penne bolognese, and got the wild mushroom ravioli, and the spaghetti with marinara, and then, to my surprise, they brought out a pasta made ""special for me'! A penne dish with fresh vegetables and olive oil. Amazing.  I was so happy.  The thought for them to do that was great.. it wasnt on the menu that night as part of the pasta special, so I was very grateful.  With dinner we got a bottle of one their $25 wines. Theres a whole page of wines available for just $25! Categorized in light, medium and full bodied reds, whites, and sparking.  Makes it easy to pick something new.  Dinner was cleared and dessert with a candle was brought out.  Again, such a nice touch.  We felt very special and well taken care of.  We had to rush out because of a show at 8pm, so getting the check in time was a bit stressful.  We watched the clock tick and we didn't get the check. Then when we did, the prosecco was included.  I felt REALLY bad saying something, as it was complimentary and a nice gesture... but I didn't order it... and the comp was not reflected on the bill.  When the bill came back, the dessert and prosecco were on the bill, but properly reflected as a comp at the bottom.  The service was great, the food was delicious and the atmosphere was cozy and warm.  We left cash for the bill and ran to the theatre.  For the wine and two pasta specials, our bill was $77. We left $100 in cash to compensate for the extra effort and complimentary items we received.

I fall in love with ambiance first and foremost, so I was already swooning.At our table they had a basket of breads waiting with a plate of assorted olives and this seasoned bean puree spread. Since I'm won over by first impressions, this was heaven to me. We ordered a bottle of red off of the $25 wine list and started scanning the menu.The menu isn't too expansive and there are a lot of meat options, but I went with the all you can eat pasta meal. Homemade pasta in a marinara basil transformed my hatred of pasta and red sauce that I've been shunning for years. Delicious, but my favorite was a linguini with clams and cilantro in a white wine sauce that really was endless. I mean... it's quality. The server had memorized a laundry list of specials and delivered them with perfection. The details that the waitstaff presented were timely and appropriate. Outstanding Italian food.

The pastas usually include one standby, one made with seasonal ingredients and another that is a creative (and tasty) combination of ingredients.

We were wandering around looking for dinner (we were positively famished to be honest) and ended up walking into Becco, guided only by the great Yelp rating I saw on my phone. As we entered the restaurant, I spotted a cookbook propped up on a table ahead and let out a gasp. Could this be? Could we have just accidentally walked into the restaurant of one our most beloved chefs? Indeed, we were standing in Lidia Bastianich's restaurant without having any prior clue. As the host took us to our table, my parents and I grinned knowingly at each other: we knew this would be a meal to remember.The meal was spectacular. There was a brilliant assortment of olives, crackers, breads and olive oil to start. The most incredible stuffed peppers I have ever tasted. Broccoli rabe, pumpkin ravioli, melt in your mouth mozzarella and tomato salad. Even the balsamic was incredible.Truth be told it was one of the best meals I have had in my life, and we had strolled in completely and utterly by chance.

It has seem to keep the charm, service and quality of food even with dealing with the throngs of  tourists this area. The hostess has always been cordial and friendly at the entrance and despite the seemingly crowded restaurant never had a problem getting a table.I would say as far as Italian restaurants go, the quality off the food and the $25 bottle wine is a good deal. The pre-fixe unlimited pasta is always tempting but I can never eat that much pasta and carbs in one sitting to make it worth it. I rather stick to the individual courses.  The wait staff here all seem to be composed of good looking and charming  Broadway actors in their off days, where it is the old saying is true: actors actually do work as waiters apply here. We tried the special grilled calamari with arugula/fennel with peas was delicious. The fennel was bright and the pea tender but not mushy. The Osso Bucco nicely seasoned but the squash risotto was a bit on the bland/flavorless. My friend had the pork chop, was cooked just right with caramelization on the outside and perfectly moist/juicy on the inside.  I haven't had a disappointed meal here yet and everyone comes out satisfied.

I try and go to Becco at least once a year around my birthday because I find it to be a great birthday present to myself. I have taken family members, dates and friends to Becco and it turns them into instant Becco lovers. The #1 choice I tell everyone to get is the Sinfonia di Pasta. The lunch price is the best at $17.95 and the dinner price is $22.95, which is not bad at all when you see how much food you get. The Sinfonia di Pasta contains a Caesar Salad or antipasto misto (amazing) and unlimited 3 style pasta table service. The pasta comes out to your table in 3 separate giant bowls and they scoop whichever one you want as many times as you want.

I knew it was a Bastianich restaurant, but I don't place too much importance on names as I've had so-so experiences in famous-name places and wonderful meals in no-name hole in the walls. Anyway, we took a late-night (10:30 pm) reservation on a Friday night and headed on over. We had a brief wait in the bar and I could tell that space was extremely limited. Chairs, tables, and the space between them is some of the tightest I've seen in the city. Ambiance was pretty nice, nothing really notable.We were seated in the back, at a table so tiny I was basically showed on in and then the table was moved into place, so I didn't have much of an option to get back out. Eek.My date and I each got an entree, and added on the pasta tastings for $9 apiece, with a salad included. I had the chicken and couscous, he got the calf's liver. The bread basket on the table had 3 tasty options, but I'm sad that I nibbled so much as I had no idea how much food was headed my way. The salads were good; he had Caesar, I subbed mine for the pear/gorgonzola. The entrees showed pretty quickly after, and they were very generously portioned. Then we were given plates for the pasta tasting- I must have misunderstood, because for the $9 addition, I was *not* expecting unlimited pasta sides. I was pleasantly surprised. The three daily pastas we were offered were farfalle with tomato sauce, linguine with shrimp and arugula, and pumpkin ravioli. The pumpkin ravioli was out of this world good. Absolutely wonderful. The other two were plenty tasty, but not as wickedly good. Waiters exit the kitchen with large pans of freshly-made pasta and offer servings to all of those with pasta plates throughout the night, so you always have access to more, if you can fit it.Our actual entrees were very good; chicken was crispy-skinned and had great flavor, calf's liver was rich and had a nice sear on it. I couldn't believe the value and quality of the food for the price paid, honestly. When I'm here next, I'm going to skip lunch so I can have more than one serving of each daily pasta.

This really describes this place- very basic, bland cheeses, nothing of interest and nothing extra- no fruits, figs, nuts, etc.- wine- there is a $25 menu, which I am sure has some finds and is decent value. We went reserve list, which was still very reasonable. Our selection was very underwhelming. Although compliments for decanting the 05 vintage and bringing decent stemware.Entrees- Ok, so I am not a big pasta fan, so I went with a protein selection- salmon and brussel sprouts- it was executed well, but again had nothing to make it stand out. It was just ok.Wife ordered the pulled pork- this was border line gross. Very fatty and completely flavorless. A big dissappointment.No time for dessert as we were off to a play.One note- serive was surprisingly good and attentive. We were there for theater rush.

I've had better; even in my own kitchen boiling up pasta bought at BJ's.The Lasagna Bolognese that I ordered was burnt on top. The entire layer of cheese was brown, if not black. Since it was a business lunch, I decided not to say anything until I took a few bites and could take it no more. I mentioned it to the waiter who then immediately brought the Manager over to my table. The kind Manager apologized profusely, explained that they customarily burn the top of the dish. Why? No one likes burnt food unless they're roasting marshmallows. As a consolation, they brought us a nice dessert plate on the house. My guest seemed to enjoy her all you can eat pasta ensemble and her Chicken dish. (yes, she had 2 entrees and an appetizer. God bless her for being able to order that much food in one sitting.The ambiance is casual and comfy.

We were seated upstairs- which seemed pretty nice and bright, but a little stuffy due to the warm weather outside.  When my husband saw that a table had opened up out on the small balcony overlooking the street, he inquired w/ the hostess and we were able to be reseated.  This was fantastic because it was cooler and breezier outside and made it quite pleasant. I ordered the pasta du jour- and can't believe that you could go wrong w/ that option.   Came w/ plate of antipasto and bread or a Cesar salad.  We sampled both and they were equally delicious.  My husband ordered veal osso buco and we also got an order of squash blossoms.   We also had zabaglione and cheesecake for dessert.  Out of all the dishes, the only one I could have skipped were the squash blossoms- they tasted good, but nothing special. All in all, we were amazed at the quality of the food and service for the prices and the volume of customers they were handling.   This is a well run place and we'd definitely go back for another memorable evening.",0,0,0,Charlene G.,"Cary, NC",86,165,61

That day it came with octopus... So yummy! The service was good. We had to wait a while after eating our salad/antipasto to get the pasta, but it was because they were making fresh batches. The pasta came out warm and delicious. The only mistake was that a server forgot to give me a serving of one of the pastas, which our waiter quickly fixed.

If this is where I can sit my ass and satisfy my belly with every single bite, then I don't give a damn. Starting with the crisp caesar salad, I'm already in my comfort zone. No pasta involved that night, but the lemon chicken and branzino were the winners from the menu. Soon as the entrees were served, It became a real challenge to put my fork down. I just thought that at that moment, there was nowhere else I'd rather be. And it was not a even battle between the chicken and the fish.

There are 100 wines priced at $25 a bottle, which made it very easy to order for a large group. We ordered several appetizers, with the calamari being my favorite. The meatball apps were a bit disappointing. I had the Sinfonia di Pasto - I really liked one of the pastas (a mushroom ravioli), a pesto option was also very good, and the third pasta was only so-so, but at unlimited portions, I was happy. The antipasto that came with it was also quite good. Some of our party had meat entrees. My fiance said the Osso Bucco was pretty good, not great, but good. His brother loved the Bisteca and the two members of our party who had the Porterhouse also enjoyed it (huge portions of meat!). But one person in our group ordered a lemon chicken entree, which she found to be so acidic, it was practically inedible.I didn't ordered dessert, but my fiancee had the vanilla Panna Cotta and really liked it.

4.0,9/10/2012,"The first time I came to Becco was many years ago to celebrate my graduation from college.  I was brought here by two co-workers, turned dear friends and I hadn't been back until this past weekend.  And what I've noticed is that during a 5+ year time span, this restaurant has been impressively consistent in quality, taste and service.  I actually consider Becco to be one of my more favored Lidia Bastianich's restaurants in the city (I prefer it over Felidia).  The first experience I had here those many years ago, was absolutely wonderful.  It was a warm summer night, and we dined al fresco and I had a massive plate of the most tender, fall-of-the-bone, Ossco Bucco you could possibly imagine.  I definitely recall having to doggy-bag at least half of that meal.  Fast forward to a few nights ago, and my second Becco experience was equally fantastic.  Our party of eight, was seated inside, a surprisingly mid-sized yet cozy back room.  From the outside, and even based on the bar area inside, it seemed as though the dining room would be fairly narrow and cramped, but they've managed to make the dining area quite comfortable.  We lucked out that night for two reasons, 1) our waiter looked painfully similar to James Franco, the actor.  He was tall, dark, and had really dope thick-framed spectacles on, which matched perfectly with an equally attractive houndstooth bowtie!  Didn't catch his name, but we knew were in very stylish hands.  More importantly than the uncanny James Franco look-a-like waiter (yeah, I'm sure he loves that constant comparison), was the incredible UNLIMITED tableside pasta special (""Sinfonia di Paste"") where for $22.95, we were served a choice between a classic caesar salad or a seafood  antipasto dish, PLUS all three daily pasta preparations.  That night we had spaghetti and lightly battered and deep fried shrimp (spicy and zesty, the pasta was al dente), a spinach ravioli (everyone's favorite selection, perfectly salty and savory yet light), and a fusilli and broccoli dish (everyone's least favorite.  It was a bit bland).  Overall, the flavors were varied, yet all extremely delicious.  Some at the table ordered other entrees, there was a swordfish steak which I had a piece of, and can vouch for its tastiness.  And someone else had stuffed peppers that looked amazing.  All in all, we had a really great time because of the endless pasta, the wonderful service, and of course James Franco.  Wait, no, I mean.......... our fabulous table of Yelp friends, yes.  Thanks for a great night, 4.5 stars for Becco!",4,3,6,Jennifer C.,"Elmhurst, NY",559,645,1350

4.0,9/1/2012,"This is my go-to semi-fancy Italian restaurant in midtown. It's not my favorite or the best Italian restaurant I've ever been. Nor would I say it's chef Lidia Bastianich's best restaurants. I recently visited Lidia's in Pittsburgh and thought the pasta there was much better - more fresh. Also, I can't attest to this but apparently her other restaurants in NY are better, although pricier.  Becco is supposed to be the affordable alternative.In any case, it satisfies any pasta cravings I may have and it really is reasonably priced. If someone wanted a suggestion in theater district, I would most likely suggest Becco. It's certainly one of the best restaurants in the area. I've been here multiple times. Despite telling myself I should try something new every time, I always ended up getting the unlimited three pastas special. It's the best deal! Lunch, $17.95; Dinner, $22.95...Even though on most occasions I've been here for work. It just makes the decision making process easier. (Technically, the pasta is different each time so I am really always trying something different by ordering the special.)The pastas are generally a ravioli (usually no meat), a pasta with meat sauce, and some other pasta with seafood. Based on my experiences, that is typically what the specials are. The ravioli is usually my favorite of the three. However, the pastas are inconsistent. I remember them being fresh the first few times I was here but not so much recently. Regardless, I still like this restaurant.

I got the antipasta misto--grilled veggies, assorted seafood--it was tasty but mostly just interesting.  Like, it was an experience, trying all the different vegetables in their tasty marinades and whatot, but it's not like I was left craving more or like I'm dying to recommend it to others.  The pastas were actually underwhelming, at least the ones they served this evening.  The mushroom ravioli was my favorite, though my friend thought it was too doughy.  The sauce wasn't very flavorful or outstanding. The shrimp penne with marinara sauce was pretty decent, but not memorable or different in any way.  And the third pasta had a green bean sauce, which I appreciated for its uniqueness.  But it fell short because by the time it reached our plate, it was cold.Maybe it's just the pastas they had on this particular night, but we just weren't very impressed.  Maybe the entrees are different; they looked delicious on other diner's plates.  One thing I didn't realize is that if you want pasta, you HAVE to pick the three daily pasta deal.  Even if you want pasta along with an entree, it's the daily pasta pasta.  I would have liked more pasta variety, and more importantly, for it to be hot (or at least warm) on my plate.",0,0,0,Esinam B.,"Manhattan, NY",5,25,0

5.0,7/30/2012,"One of the true measures of a great restaurant is how they handle a group.  I suggested Becco for our high school reunion due to its relative proximity to exits to and from New York and the fact that I've tried the restaurant and thought the food will not embarrass me. Becoo met all expectations and the service was even beyond expectations.  Please note that a gathering of about a dozen women, some of who drove from Virginia is not easy.  So, among the requests made to the restaurants were: downstairs seating, preferably against a wall and hanging a small banner.  All the requests were graciously accommodated by the staff!  Then, one of the ladies whipped out a home-made dessert for the birthday celebrant and even before I died of embarrassment, the staff again, graciously allowed it and did not charge a plating fee. It took the group way more than two (2) hours to complete the meal, amidst talking, taking photos, drinking wine etc. but the staff never wavered and just remained gracious.  When that excellent service is matched by excellent food in an excellent atmosphere, then I'm more than a believer.  We ordered the following: ~~Grilled Calamari with Arugula salad - the best dish of the lot.  The squid was soft, not chewy, tasted fresh and contrasted excellently with the peppery arugula. ~~Pan-seared tuna - Perfectly done! ~~Scallps, Shrimps, Salmon Medley -  Everything tasted fresh but I would have wanted a little more spice to it. ~~Osso Buco - it was a show-stopper.  The size of it was jaw-dropping. It was tender and reflected the hours of cooking it involved.~~Pollo Al Limone - I wasn't a big fan of it but it tasted delicate and light and the chicken lovers loved  it. ~~Chef Gallagher's Three (3) Daily  Pasta preparation - I wish I had more of this.  The pastas were served from table side fresh from the oven and the riccotta just oozed out of those pasta pillows of deliciousness.  ~~Dessert sampler - everything was heavenly and not too sweet.  They didn't have riesling which will match the summer day when we dined there so we settled for some bottles of moscato, a bit sweet but hey, it put everyone in a great mood!!  Becco, I don't care if you're in the tourist pit of Manhattan and I wish you had wi-fi,  but  I love you.",5,5,4,Lara G.,"Astoria, NY",308,424,252

And it's sooooooo loud you don't have a chance to even get your thoughts together.  Took a client here for lunch and was just embarrassed by how loud it was and how tight it was.  Took my mother here and they were rude to her and that is just a no no in my book so I left and will not go back.  I am a fan of Lydia inspired restaurants but this place is a practical nervous breakdown in terms of the sound and the space.  The food is fine but seriously...the spacing and the sound are NOT worth it.,1,0,0,Rich R.,"Manhattan, NY",4,12,0

5.0,7/20/2012,"After 3 visits, Becco has left me happier every time.First off, I recommened making a reservation and if it is more than 2 people you will probably not want to sit in the bar area. There are basically 4 completely different dining rooms at Becco. First time, it was just me and my boyfriend and we sat in the bar area which was fine for two people. Second time, party of 4 in the skylight room, really pretty especially if you are there when it is still light out. Third time, upstairs, which may have been my favorite.The food here is delicious. The prices are reasonable, and they make sure that you get a great experience. The $25 wine list is wonderful! I think it is awesome that they offer this..had the one of the Dolcetto's. Amazing. They usually have a long list of specials going on, so listen carefully when they tell you because there are a lot, and you'll probably want them all.Must do the pasta, it can be added to your entree for $9 and shared with the table if someone does not want to get it as their actual meal.Top Picks:*The mussels...I don't know what is in that broth but it is addicting and delicious, and just thinking about it makes my mouth water. Possibly the best mussels I have ever had.*Unlimited pasta...self explanatory. Served table-side, unlimited. My favorite ever was the mushroom truffle ravioli!*Cheesecake...Overall, a great place to come with the family. There is something for everyone.",4,0,0,Lauren T.,"New York, NY",339,146,271

3.0,7/16/2012,We recently ate at this restaurant and had mixed feelings about it. Our entres were very good. My husband had the sarme and I had the osso buco. Both were very good. The service was very good. The negatives: tables so small there isnt enough room to put everything and you are very cramped. You feel like you are sitting with the people next to you. The second disappointment was the pasta. We ordered their three pasta serving and it was very mediocre. Spaghetti was raw and the penne with peas had no flavor. Very surprising since they are famous for pasta.Would not go back when we vist New York again.,0,0,0,Kay F.,"Hemet, CA",0,4,0

We had no reservation or any handle of how long of a wait would be but it was only 30 minutes. Not bad! They seated us in the back dining room which was pretty nice. We ordered our respective dishes and none of us were too impressed. The chicken was overcooked and dry, which is a big no no in the restaurant world. Many of us ordered to trio of pasta sampler and only the ravioli was impressive. The seafood appetizer which came with it included octopus (which was surprising) but the seafood seemed a bit on the old side, like it was from the day before or sitting out from that morning. Some of my other fellow diners had the veal or steak and also weren't blown away. I thought it could have been a lot better considering the location, competition nearby on Restaurant Row, and prices.

4.0,6/26/2012,"Anytime you have ""all you can eat pasta with Cesar Salad or assorted grilled vegetables"" I am there. I am a big fan of Becco and it has plenty of options besides the pastas. The deal of 3 pastas at $23 for dinner and $18 for lunch is awesome. They usually have a long pasta (spaghetti, linguine, fettuccine), a short pasta (penne, rigatoni, bowtie) and a filled pasta (ravioli, tortellini, shells). The sauces vary from marinara to alfredo to meat sauce to other traditional Italian Sauces. The filled pastas are usually filled with cheese or a blend.I been to Becco both at lunch and dinner and found service to be efficient and friendly. The location of Becco is not my usual spot for restaurant of choice, since it is located at tourist central, but I never had an issue with this.The wine list is somewhat of a novelty with 100 or so bottles at $25. Great for the consumer. The wines are all good table wines with tons of Italian wines.This is not a fine dining restaurant, but a family style restaurant with friendly service in a comfortable ambiance. Pasta are always good, Cesar salad tasty and easy to enjoy wines. I usually call to see what pastas are being served that day or you can try Facebook. I highly recommend Becco for large groups or before going to a show.Day 26/30 - ""June Challenge: A-B-C!""",2,1,2,Billy V.,"Austin, TX",615,551,792
2.0,6/26/2012,"I really really wanted to give this place an excellent review, cuz I really really looked forward to dining here, but really really was super disappointed . Ok I'm done with my ""really really""s. Food: I ordered Sinfonia di Paste, which is basically a combo with unlimited table side service of three daily pastas and you have a choice of a caesar salad and antipaso as appetizer. I chose the antipaso and was not impressed with the assortment of veggies; presentation was nice, but everything tasted similarly bland. The blow fish and octopus were interesting, but again, nothing impressive. They do, however, use very good olive oil but I guess that's just a basic requirement for any decent Italian restaurant. As for the three daily pasta, two of them were vegetarian: mushroom ravioli and spaghetti with tomatoes and fresh basil. The other one was veal penne I believe.  Anyway, my favorite was the mushroom ravioli cuz it was the most flavorful one out of the three; the other two were literally ""A-OK."" Service: I would give a 1-star rating if the review was entirely based on this. My friend and I felt rushed throughout our whole meal. First, they took our plates away right after ordering. Mind you, that's when we haven't even had a chance to try some of the complimentary bread sticks/bread. Strike One. Then, after my pasta came, my friend and I were having a good conversation catching up with each other's lives while (semi) enjoying the food. And what kind of annoyed us was that the waiter kept coming around asking how we were doing with our food. It's fine, just like when we told you the first couple of times when you came by. Strike Two. Finally, when servers came by asking if I wanted refill on pastas and I said yes to the mushroom ravioli. Then, my friend told me that our waiter and even the hostess came behind me and looked at our table a couple of times. The next thing you know, they took my friend's empty plate away while I was still eating. And also came by a couple of times asking if I was done with my food when I just put down my fork to rest while having a conversation. We felt very rushed and that is definitely a Strike Out. We are never coming back. After getting the check, we made our way to the exit and that's when we realized that they had a huge line of people waiting to be seated. Well, excusez moi, but that doesn't mean you should rush people to finish their meals so that you can have more business.

4.0,6/23/2012,"My friend and I were seated very quickly. The table for two was extremely small and a bit cramp but the meal made up for it. I loved the bread basket, especially the long, crunch bread sticks and the flavorful spread. We both got the Sinfonia di Pasta, which is unlimited servings of that day's 3 specialty pastas. I didn't much care for the antipasto that came with it, as the octopus was tough and odd flavored. The pastas I was served were great! One was a fried calamari and shrimp in buckwheat pasta and spicy marinara sauce (I believe), which was my absolute favorite. The pieces of calamari and shrimp were excellent! Another was spinach and ricotta ravioli, which was wonderful. The last was a vegetable pesto that I wasn't too fond of but was definitely interesting and very flavorful. Servers were constantly circling the restaurant offering more servings of pasta. I would definitely come back again, especially since the pastas of the day are constantly changing.

I noticed that bigger parties had a bit more room.Apart from the seating arrangements, the menu was rather intriguing. You do have your typical Italian dishes, but there are others that will definitely catch your eye.As an appetizer we ordered the meatballs. These meatballs were the size of softballs and if I recall correctly, the dish came with three or four. I am not exaggerating. Not only were they huge, but they were hot throughout and tasty. Nothing is worse than biting into a meatball and discovering that the inside is luke warm. Not the case at Becco. Only downside, My dad and I were already full. I just kept thinking how on earth am I going to finish my main course?The main dish included a salad. It was ceasar. Nothing out of this world, just your average ceasar salad. I ordered the lemon chicken dish and my dad ordered the pork chop. My dish came with THREE chicken breasts and the pork chop was about the size of my forearm. Believe me when I say I am not exaggerating.These portions are huge. I suggest sharing if you can. Otherwise, I was pleased with the service.

The amount of food is the same- as much as you can handle! I have been to Becco twice rather recently and had the special. Each time I had the special, which includes the choice of an antipasto or a Ceasar.  I chose the antipasto both times, which is a combo of a grilled vegie plate and a little of this or that, and then the pasta parade begins. I am not a pasta lover, but it is apparent by the flavor, and the moist and chewy texture, that the pasta  is made on the premises. THAT I like! Whether it was the Veal Bolognese over fusilli, the Swiss Chard Ravioli with brown butter, or a simple Rigatoni with tomato and basil, it was hot, fresh, and delicious.

5.0,6/7/2012,"Dependable, fresh, quality food served with panache and style at one of the best value eateries in all of NYC. Chef Gallagher and his crew produce amazingly consistent, delicious food in this bustling fast-paced eatery. Yet, somehow one never feels rushed. There are two floor levels and several rooms - I like the first floor, front room myself, this is where all the 'action' is! But the upstairs and back rooms are somewhat quieter and more spacious. The bar room is, as one might guess - noisy and cramped especially when the pre-theatre crowd arrives. The bar tenders are fabulous and fun. They're also very good at wine recommendations for those uninitiated or timid about wines. Reservations - usually 30 days in advance of your visit - are a MUST. You have almost no chance of being seated in the restaurant proper without one - especially in the evening. Reservations are less important at lunch time. BTW - one may always eat at the bar without benefit of reservations, but it's hard-to-get seating, especially on theater nights. Wines are the best value at Becco and there is a robust selection of excellent, good quality wines at a - yes, I'm serious --- a $25 price point --- Yes, I said $25.00 ---- in NYC! It's a great pre-theatre place and wonderful for a post-performance drink and perhaps a late snack. I've been many times and, of all the restaurants in the city, this is by far my favorite.

5.0,6/7/2012,"My girlfriends and I went to Becco's for the very first time last night.  Now if you are looking for a quiet evening do not go there from 4-8 pm as it is the height of all pre-theater folks.  You are eating a place that is in the heart of the theater district owned by one of the best Italian chefs in the world.  You can easily go to any of the other 20 other restaurants on the block if you don't like crowds -- but I can guarantee you the food or the service will extremely sub par . With that being said, we still braved it and I decided to sit at the bar until our table was ready!  Well we never left the bar!  The bartender, Andrea, was absolutely amazing.  It was our first time there last night and he made the experience wonderful.  He efficiently broke down the menu to us as well as the specials.  It is refreshing to find a bar tender who is not only well versed in all types of alcohol but can explicitly give you details of the menu that any chef of the restaurant can.  We dined on specials the whole night.  For appetizers, we had stuffed zucchini flowers and burrata over toasted bread...YUM!!  The bottle of Sauvingon B complimented it wonderfully which was attentively refilled all night and ONLY $25 a bottle --- STEAL!!.  We then were served the house Caesar Salad, delicious as well.  One girlfriend and I had the seafood medley which consisted of grilled skate, scallops and shrimp over a bed of polenta in a red sauce...AMAZING!  My other girlfriend ordered the whole Orata fish that was presented to her in whole form before they whisked it away to be fileted.  In addition to all this wonderful food we opted to pay an extra $9 for a taste of their endless pasta....and what a great choice it was.  The shells and spaghetti were great, HOWEVER, the polenta cakes in an alfredoesque sauce was to die for!! and the best part it was endless!!!! For desert we were presented The Dessert Sampler, a collection of sinfully delicious selections.  Raspberry sorbet, panna cotta, Ricottina, Torte di Zabaglione e Cioccolato and we topped it off with an after dinner desert wine.Now with my 2 cents thrown in -- I agree with some of the reviewers about how crowded it was and the wait for a table, but like I said, its a famous spot for a reason so its not going to be quiet and empty.  They do not take reservation during their ""theater hours"" so be prepared to wait.  We personally felt that the bar was the best choice because of the service we received.  Yes, it was crowded and loud and we occasionally got our bar stools bumped, but it was bar far one of the best dining experiences seated at bar one could ask for -- so in short, if you go there sit at the bar and hope Andrea is on shift.",1,0,0,Maritza F.,"Bentonville, AR",24,29,48
3.0,6/6/2012,"A perfectly serviceable after-theater Italian emporium by Lidia Bastianich. The gripes first: I was annoyed to have to wait 10-15 minutes for a table to open up even though I made a reservation. And if you're looking for a quiet table, this ain't the place--my family was placed smack dab in the middle of a room holding about 20 tables, one of about four such rooms in Becco's gargantuan space.However. There are many very good bottles of wine, all available for $25. And there is that never-ending pasta plate (including appetizer) for $22.95. And the pastas are well above average for the neighborhood: fresh pasta prepared al dente in three delicious sauces. My mother-in-law is a vegetarian, and someone even came by with an additional, off-menu pasta so she wouldn't have to bear having less than three pasta varieties on her plate. The service, too, was kind and generous--when my in-laws requested that anchovies be left out of their caesar salads, my husband and I requested that an extra plate of anchovies be served for us on the side. Both requests were honored with a smile and no extra charge.While Becco is a far cry from the kind of Italian restaurant I'd venture to on my own, it is the perfect restaurant to dine with your family.

HUGE restaurant - EXCELLENT service - from the hosts to our servers to the assistants to everyone - everyone smiles and is pleasant without being disney esque phony - LOVED the atmosphere - there is really no lounge/hang out spot but that's ok there are plenty of places to hang, eh?So needless to say we ATE EVERYTHING! So much too choose from and contrary to some reviewers who went to an Italian restaurant for pasta, because that's what you get - um no NO Italians eat a wide variety of food - so welcome to BECCO - where you can stuffed cabbage YUMM an excellent fishy ceasar (my favorite when you can taste the sardines) and the bread omg no no no too much! And then I had chicken parmigiana (the special) YUMMMseriously why bore you with what we ate - everything was perfect - the portions were HUGE -= H U G E seriously one entree can feed two people - ridiculously generous portions.Did I mention this restaurant is in Manhattan, has a celebrity affiliation, and is in a ""tourist"" area, AND IS SO SUPER AFFORDABLE IT IS INSANE! Love the Italian wine list! LOVED IT we had a red and white - hello GLUTTONYOh yes and I ordered the pasta - they serve it to you ""all you can eat"" HA!

5.0,5/29/2012,"Went to Becco with husband and a couple for dinner on a Saturday evening. The place was full and very noisy when we walked in- so definitely get a reservation in advance. We ordered a deep fried soft shell crab, prosciutto, meatballs and Caesar salad as starters for share. The prosciutto and meatballs were very delicious. Meatballs were huge and very flavorful in a sea of tomato sauce. The soft shell crab was good but not the best I had (I like them very deep fried - like what you'd have at a Japanese restaurant). For mains I had the calf's liver which was delicious if you like eating liver. My husband had the lamp chop which was omg sooo good but the sides was just a-ok. He also had a taste of our friend's double cut pork chop and he said it was even better than his lamp chop, and the sides was also very good. Our other friend ordered the pulled pork - not sure how it was. For dessert we ordered the sampler for 4, having convinced our friend who wanted to order a gelato- since the sampler also includes a gelato and a sorbet. The pudding was very yummy but the chocolate mousse was my favorite. My husband liked the bread pudding which I thought was just ok. The cheesecake was average - I wouldn't recommend it. The gelato was very very good as was the sorbet. We all left Becco as fans of the place - the food was delicious, service pretty good, an impressive wine list plus a smaller list (though still a whole page) of cheaper wines, and very reasonable price. We had all that food plus 2 bottles of wine and it was 280$ plus tips for 4 people.

4.0,5/27/2012,"You'd be forgiven for assuming there are more restaurants than there are people when walking up to this place since you pass a minimum of 37 million dining establishments just on this one block alone. And this one might be easy to just pass on by since it kind of is just ""there"" and doesn't try to beat you over the head with an enticing entrance demanding you part with your money right this minute. And at the end of the day, it is worth parting with your money to dine here provided you don't suffer from claustrophobia or a recurring dream where you suffocate in a phone booth that smells like Italian food.Right off the street you walk down a couple of steps and pass a couple of tables to get inside a fairly large dining room. Another room breaks off to the left and back behind the bar in dining room one is a stairway presumably leading to more places to sit or a self-contained black hole, since I'm pretty sure I never saw anyone go up there come back down. A duo of hostesses greeted us Saturday morning and we were promptly whisked off to a table in the main dining room along the wall. My eyes are not what they used to be but I believe an extensive box of a variety of breads instantaneously materialized on our table since no server could possibly move that fast. Just as quickly, the selection of bread sticks vanished into my gaping maw as I resembled someone who had never seen food before and journeyed into this dining room by sheer will power.The menu has your Italian staples but the wine list (or should I say ""wine phonebook"") could very well crush a small animal if it fell off of your table. Wine was too overwhelming for our group but you know what is much easier to navigate? Beer. A trio of uncommon selections are on tap and a few more bottled options are yours for the taking.Our server returned after we had time to peruse the menu and for the life of me, I could not understand why someone in our group was going with the stuffed cabbage. Surely nothing good could possibly come of that, right? In what would amount to one of the very few instances in life when I am wrong, that stuffed cabbage turned out to be either divine or disastrous and needed to be eaten as fast as possible. I'm going with the first choice, personally. I opted for the lasagna and I'm not sure what they did to it, but it was unlike any lasagna I've ever had. In a good way. I gave it a good run and tried to finish the whole thing but by this time the beer and bread were waging war inside of me and the battleground would not make room for the entire contents of my plate.Great food, good service, what else do you need? Perhaps a crowbar to wrench yourself out of your seat when all is said and done. Previous Yelpers have made note of the tables being literally right next to each other and you better believe they are not exaggerating. On one hand, if you're feeling especially brave, you could easily reach over to two other tables in your immediate area and grab food off of their plate and see if they notice. On the other hand, when this many people are in one confined place at the same time on a Saturday morning with the only air being what blows in from the open patio doors, well, it can get warm and almost unbearable. But not enough to run from the dining room, mind you. If you're in the mood for pretty stellar Italian food, more wine than you would know what to do with and have a date that doesn't mind literally ""getting close"" at the dinner table because there really is no other spacial alternative, give it a shot.",0,2,1,Alex S.,"Frisco, TX",367,332,0

If I have my choice, I would pick a table on the main floor in the back. The tables are fairly close together and we usually have a conversation with very nice folks and yesterday was no exception. It really adds to the ambiance of Becco.The food is always incredible and fairly priced. And they have a good selection of Italian bottles of wine for $25. Not bad for NYC. I always wanted to have their short ribs and yesterday I went with them. Phenominal dish. They were in a wonderful gravy and the meat fell off the bone. The dish came with roasted potato's which were crunchy and oh so delicious and fresh spinach with garlic. The meal also came with a cesar salad. My better half had something she hardly eats because it is a dish I cannot eat. She ordered liver with onions and she had this great big smile on her face as she consumed one of her favorite meals. She said it was awesome.We have been Lidia Bastianich fans for many years so when we go to her restaurants, we know it's going to be good. This is a great restaurant to go to prior to a play.

And finally, small side dish with about 4 bite size pieces of octopus in an oil and vinegar dressing with thinly sliced red onions.  Outstanding and incredible for the price of the meal.  More food than it might sound.My favorite pasta was the linguini with peas, pork (more favor than volume), and mushrooms.  Especially good with a liberal amount of grated Parmesan.  (They gave us a cup of Parmesan for the two of us.  You can use as much as you want with a waiter thinking you are over indulgent.)My second favorite was the round ravioli with cheese and Swiss chard.  I think it had a nut oil dressing.My husband's favorite was a good penne in very good fresh tasting tomato and fresh basil sauce.All of this was for $17.95 on the lunch menu.  What a bargain even if you only eat one serving of each.  At dinner it's still a great deal at $22.95.For dessert we shared a panna cotta with seasonal fruit.  I don't really remember the fruit - maybe a few blueberries.  The custard had a bit of vanilla and the texture was creamy, cool and refreshing and not heavy - which is what we wanted to avoid.The previous time we had the first reservation of the day at noon on a Sunday.  People arrive early and there is a crowd in the bar before they start serving.  I think we were about the middle of those seated and it took only about four minutes.This is an extremely well run restaurant.  Each of our three visits has had great food.  The service is quite good.  One area is a bit less noisy than the others and I had requested that with the reservation both of the past times.  Out 2:30 p.m. reservation is the last one before they change from the lunch to the dinner menu.  There was a bit of a lull in the number of people in the restaurant.",0,0,0,Allen R.,"Washington, DC",0,32,0

1.0,4/12/2012,"Its so sad if a vegetarian has to write a review for an Italian restaurant and say, STAY AWAY because this ""joint"" is not vegetarian friendly. In fact, having gone there with 2 other friends who are not vegetarian, all of us unanimously felt what the heck is the fuss about? Then we realized that it must be the tourists who are unaware of the amazing food scene in New York that must fancy this tourist trap. For the same $$$ there is much better Italian to be found in the same neighborhood, you dont even have to look far. The chef must be living in dark ages not to acknowledge there are plenty of vegetarians who dont even eat fish or seafood, therefore to not list a single vegetarian-friendly main or not be creative off-menu is so passe. That relegates one to their pre-fixe choice of 3 unlimited pastas. A single dish of good pasta with fresh ingredients at most other restaurants with an effort to please the vegetarian taste buds stands much better on its spine than their 3 options combined because it seems their options are really meant to sreve as a side for the carnivores rather than center piece of a meal. Rest of the food was meh... Arancini was so so. The fried Mozarella breaded sandwich is best avoided, it lacked flavor. My friends had the steak, salmon, which they did not finish, let alone attack with finger lickin gusto. And yeah, those $25 bottles of wine are quite a scandal too. Similar types of wine bottles can be purchased by the bottle at lower prices in the hood, the mark up is quite attrocious. If you have even the slightest ability to research and find a better Italian in the area, do yourself a favor and go there. Dont fall for this tourist trap.

Every restaurant on Restaurant Row is jammed packed and noisy especially pre and post theatre. Regarding the comments about the rude staff, I have never once been talked to rudely or in a condescending manner. Conversely, we are always treated with respect,seated promptly, and service is always smart, polite, and efficient without being obtrusive. Now to the food and drink. I have eaten a majority of their featured entrees, and have never had a ""bad"" meal. Ample portions of authentic Italian food, mostly featuring flavors and styles of Northern Italy. Try the Osso Bucco or Joes Veal Chop.....Heaven!  The Simphonie de Pasta special is a pasta lover's delight and a great bargain by NY standards. An all you can eat 3 specialty pastas served with you choice of Caesar salad or an Antipasto Misto(grilled sesonal vegetables with seafood samples ).At times, I can understand that some of the pasta can be a bit eclectic, but despite this minor occasional drawback ,all pastas are of high quality ,and freshly prepared. It's like a Sunday afternoon Dinner at My Nona's,really ! There's something for everyone on the dessert menu and I highly recommend you try the sampler your first time there.Small tastes of all desserts featured and the best sorbets I've had anywhere ! I agree with some reviewers that mixed drinks are a bit pricey, but once again you are in New York and I defy you to find a better bargain than their list of $25.00 bottles of imported wines anywhere in a NYC restaurant. As frequent diners here, my wife and I have developed a great relationship with the wait staff and managers, and when we apprise them of our plans to dine at Becco with friends or on a special occasion,( b'days, anniversaries, etc.) they always provide us with a generous comp, be it a bottle of Sparkling  Perseco or an appetizer or dessert course. A Class move that always makes us always feel welcome and special.To those of you who may have had a bad experience at Becco, I strongly suggest you give it another try. Everyone has a bad day now and then and should be given at least two visits before coming to any conclusions......and there are those people who are just miserable  and will never be satisfied.

3.0,2/9/2012,"Finding a decent Italian restaurant in midtown is a challenge. After hearing positive things about Becco from many different people, but always shrugging it off (because I don't go to restaurants on 46th Street), I finally visited.While Becco has a sort of lame decor, it's the perfect ambiance for a casual dinner with out of town friends who may not want to venture far from midtown. The pasta special was decent, I'm not dying to go back, but it was acceptable. The mushroom ravioli with truffle oil was a tad on the salty side and the spaghetti with marinara sauce and basil was a little too al dente for my tastes. My out-of-town companions seemed to enjoy their dinners enough. The portions are generous, the wine selection was fairly priced, and the ingredients were not too adventurous. The service was good, although our 6 foot (plus) tall waiter could have used a longer tie. We were able to walk-in off the street on a Monday evening around 7:45 without having to wait. The crowd was a tad loud, but not so much that you couldn't have a conversation at the table.Bottom line, I wouldn't go here with foodie friends (or even a group with several vegetarians or pescatarians), but would definitely recommend to out of town friends or for pre/post theater dinners. I might even want to go back for a girls night.",1,0,0,Tia T.,"Hicksville, NY",30,209,15
1.0,2/4/2012,"This has got to be one of the most overhyped restaurants I've ever been to. The hostess was absolutely lovely and we were seated promptly, but that was about the only positive thing I have to say about Becco's. The wait staff looked absolutely bored and came to our table once to take our order, once to clear the table and one last time to settle the check. I ordered the pasta special. The gnocchi was doughy and had no substance. The veal rigatoni was alright, but had little bolognase on it and the sauce was watery. The spaghetti was covered in red looking water that pooled on my plate--I assume that was supposed to be marinara. My boyfriend had the steak with polenta. The steak was beautifully cooked, but utterly flavorless. The polenta was good, but a side dish does not a meal make. Our friend had some meat dish that was also bland, lackluster and utterly forgettable. I avoided this place for a long time thinking it was just some mediocre, theatre crowd trap. I was proved 100% correct. Too bad.",1,0,0,Lex L.,"Dallas, TX",0,18,0
3.0,2/1/2012,"Becco is a bit of a shit show.After the matinees get out on a Saturday, the (very, very small) foyer fills up, the crowd spills over into the bar area, and everyone gets jostled. The hostess (at least the one who helped me and my friends) was incredibly rude and rushed, but I can't really blame her since dozens of people were basically breaking down the door.Cocktails are pricy and they only have top shelf booze (which is fine, but do I really need Grey Goose in my screwdriver? no, I don't). Wine, on the other hand, is nicely priced -- there's a whole page of decent bottles for $25. (Incidentally, the price of 2 of those cocktails.)Once we finally got seated (right at the top of the stairs on the second floor, in the middle of a traffic pattern, at a table for four even though we were 5 people -- one of us sat on a little plastic stool), our waiter was very helpful and professional. Everything came out quickly. And the food was good -- we got four pasta symphonies (HA!) and a steak and a couple of different desserts.I would probably never go back here again, simply because it's too hectic, too touristy, too rushed.

Since then have been back numerous times and always recommend it to friends who visit NYC. While the location is a little out of the way, its perfect for a pre-theater meal or for carbo loading before a big race! I rarely order off the regular menu and usually always opt for the all-you-can-eat pasta and Caesar salad. The three pastas are usually simple, but prepared really well (ravioli, meat ragu, linguini with clams, etc). They tend to have the same three pastas the same night each week, so if you go back, make sure to go on a different day so you get to try something new.

Just a couple hiccups on the way.Really the best deal here is the $25 family style meal. You get your choice of salad or antipasto followed by an unlimited amount of whatever the three house pastas are for that day. They also have a $25 per bottle wine menu.The salad was a classic Caesar and it just had way way too much dressing on it. That's a pet peeve of mine with Caesar salads. It was drowning in dressing.The pastas were all delicious. We had a pappardelle pasta with a spicy marinara sauce, a linguine with mussels, and a ricotta and kale ravioli. Each one was delicious. My only complaint was that the one meat option was seafood which I'm not a fan of. Just a touch of sausage or pork meatballs would have been preferable for me.It was our friend's birthday so we had a little chocolate mousse cake to finish the meal. It was good not spectacular. I may take guests here next time I have them - especially if they want an inexpensive meal that will still fill them up - but I do agree with the other Yelpers that there were a little too many tourists here.

The all-you-can-eat three-pasta prix fixe is a foodie's concept of a buffet. Waiters gracefully offer to replenish your plate with variable pastas of the day. Wines are extensive and much of them are distinguished without breaking the bank. Most notable is the restaurant's service. Many of the waitstaff seem native to Italy and serve in a manner that is elegant but warm, all the while retaining an effortless presence that does not interrupt your dining experience. The mashed white bean appetizer, more or less an Italian hummus, is roused with a hauntingly nutty olive oil. The Antipasto Misto offering is a smorgasbord with delicious little bites of prepared vegetables, cheese and seafood.

1.0,12/28/2011,"TOURIST TRAP and that's coming from a real New Yorker, DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT, THEY HAVE NO RESPECT FOR THE CUSTOMERS!  We came home for the holidays, went to a Broadway show and were trying to avoid the Time Square/Theatre District tourist trap hustles that infest the area.  Becco was recommended to us by folks who follow Lidia's Kitchen on TV (Becco is her restaurant). First of all we were told it was a 5 minute wait for a table and we waited about 25. That didn't seem so bad, after we were seated ordered and received the first 2 of 6 (3 rounds) $12 DRINKS, we proceeded to look at the menu, when they made a big push for us to order the pasta special. Since it was after theater we weren't starving and didn't want to order a a lot of food and figured we'd share. So we tried to order the famous meatballs and he told us they were all out, so we ordered something else and the pasta special. At this point the waiter and manager felt the need to come over to our table and tell us WE COULD NOT SHARE OUR FOOD! In the mangers words, ""it's like the buffet at the Hilton, each person has to pay for unlimited amount of food."" We told him we weren't interested in an unlimited amount of food, just a plate of pasta and an appetizer. He again said WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO SHARE! Getting more agitated that we weren't going along with their program. As the 2nd round of $12 DRINKS arrived, I asked the manager who wouldn't leave our table if he wanted us to order something else for dinner? He said no, but we couldn't share and said my wife could only taste my food. I told him we ordered the food we wanted and will eat it any way we want to, or else we can leave. He walked away in a huff the TOURIST TRAP HUSTLE was not working. When we got the pasta it was a giant tourist size portion that 1 person could not possible finish, and I did share it with my wife, and they allowed it, but not without a fight. So basically they wanted us to both pay the $22 for the pasta and get 2 giant plates of food that we couldn't finish, so they could keep on their tourist trap mentality of squeezing every penny out of every person that walks in. And for the record 2 out of the 3 pastas were terrible, one was pretty good. Ultimately there was no need for all of this conversation that they felt the need to tell us the rules of the restaurant and how to eat the food we ordered and were frustrated when we didn't agree. They got their money on our $78 bar tab! So what was this all about? $$$, We broke their philosophy of getting every dime possible out of each person that Lydia has programed into them. I would never go back or recommend this restaurant to anyone. THE FOOD WAS MEDIOCRE, THE SERVICE WAS BAD, AND THEY HAVE NO RESPECT FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS. Every person has a dollar sign on their back, that's all they care about. DO NOT GO THERE, WITH SO MANY GOOD RESTAURANTS IN NYC. BECCO STINKS! Not worth the high price, just another TIMES SQUARE HUSTLE!",7,1,0,Claire R.,"Los Angeles, CA",1373,4,0

We had a post-show reservation at a restaurant down the street, but when we arrived there, the host cooly refused to seat us, saying that we had arrived 10 minutes late and the kitchen was closed. Fortunately, we came across Becco a short walk away. As soon as we saw the $25 wine menu, I knew that fate had smiled upon us. I've since been back with a large group of friends, and the food and service was just as good as it had been my first time. Definitely order the all-you-can-eat pasta trio your first visit.

3.0,12/22/2011,"Lidia Bastianich's Becco is a Theater District favorite for tourists and locals alike. Backed by the star power of a celebrity chef and offering great deals for a hearty pre/post theater meal, it's no wonder that Becco is always busy. I highly recommend making a reservation at least a week in advance for peak dining hours.Most of our group of eight went with the SINFONIA DI PASTA, which is Becco's AYCE pasta dinner. For $23 you get your choice of Caesar salad or assorted veggie & seafood platter as an appetizer and unlimited table side service of the three daily pasta preparations. And as if that wasn't enough to entice you, Becco also features a $25/bottle wine list.For us the pastas of the day were:- veal fettuccine - penne with tomatoes and fresh basil- cardoon and ricotta ravioli - pesto fettuccine (vegetarian substitute for the veal fettuccine)Sinfonia Pros:1. It's vegetarian friendly. Only one out of the three pastas contained meat, and there was a fourth option as a substitute.2. The serving system works well. The service is efficient and the pastas are brought out in small batches as soon as they're ready so that you're always served fresh, hot pasta.3. If you don't like one of the pastas, there are still two others to focus your attention on.Sinfonia Cons:1. If you're hoping for a lot of meat, you will not get it.2. If you don't get all the ingredients in your serving, the pasta can taste a little bland. For example, I didn't get any of the fresh basil in my first serving of the penne and it tasted like a basic pasta with tomato sauce. The second time the server came around I made sure to ask for a portion with fresh basil and it made all the difference.3. Your entire experience is dependent on three daily pastas that you cannot choose for yourself. If none of the pastas impress you, the deal is tough to justify. For us, the ravioli was a dud; the cardoon was much too bitter. The penne was OK, nothing special. The veal fettuccine was good but not amazing. In hindsight, I would rather have paid $23 for one dish of my own choice.",12,6,8,Amy S.,"Astoria, NY",272,308,2490

As other reviewers stated, the $25 wine menu is a great value and it's worth trying this place out just for that! The pasta trio included fetticini with veal sauce, ravioli with artichoke filling and penne pasta with tomato basil sauce. Because I don't really eat meat, I was able to substitute pesto sauce for the veal in the fettincini dish. All three pasta dishes were very bland and I had to put a lot of cheese and pepper on them to give them some flavor. The food here is just OK. I'd give a 5 star review to our waitress. She noticed that I was only eating two of the three pastas and she asked if I wanted the pesto dish as a substitute for the meat dish.

I was afraid it might be a tourist trap, but it certainly wasn't.The place was very very packed but they managed to be attentive to our group.I had two appetizers because they were too tempting: the mozzarella in carrozza and the polentina con speck. They were both delightful.The polenta was lusciously covered in Montasio cheese and slightly crisped speck. It was appetizer sized but I was pleasantly surprised at the speck & cheese to polenta ratio. Very yummy.The mozzarella in carrozza was slightly different than what you eat in Italy but just as delightful. In fact it was less ""heavy"" in fried oil than you would usually eat there. Very very tasty.I tried a bite of the 5 cheese pasta that one of my friends was having from the trio of pasta special and it was excellent.

Despite making reservations 3 weeks in advance, we were seated at a small two top against the wall, crammed behind  a 4 top and 6 top.  The four top was so lcose to our table there was no room for the waiter to stand in front of our table to serve us.  I could see if we walked in without reservations and were offered that table as the only option. However, the fact that they actually have a table crammed in a corner tells me these owners are pretty greedy to cram diners in every inch of the place.    Now to the food.. We ordered the beef meatballs as an appetizer, the plate arrived with three almost baseball size meatballs in marinara. They were ok, but I think a mix of veal and/or pork makes a much tastier meatball. My husband had the veal Parm. Nice tender veal, on the bone pounded nice and thin. However the sauce although fresh tomato, was just blah with no flavor.I ordered the three pastas of the day  Tortellini in brodo, rigatoni with pesto and spaghetti with basil & tomato sauce. I can't say any of the three were worthy of any positive feedback.  Pasta was overcooked and just all around mediocre. I cannot understand why this place gets rave reviews.

Totally unacceptable, and completely without apology.  After a long day of shopping, with the expectation of a relaxing meal, we were freezing, some of us left starving, and incredibly disappointed.  Leaving the restaurant, we were again trapped in the foyer by aforementioned snarky person, due to door issues.  Never again.",0,0,0,Paula H.,"Hallandale, FL",0,1,0

We had to do sort of a quick lunch because we had just purchased tickets to Chinglish and it started in an hour. The wait for a table was probably about 20 minutes on a Saturday, so we opted for a bar instead. Our table was called after 10, but by that time we were settled at the bar. The bartender was cute and charming and we all decided to go with the pasta sampler. AMAZING deal! $19 for an appetizer and unlimited pasta? We started with an amazing bread basket of focaccia, breadsticks, and another multigrain bread served with a white bean hummus and olives. It was beautiful and delicous.The choice of appetizer was the caesar salad, which was pretty standard, but the star was the antipasto. I didn't get it because I thought the seafood would be mixed in (I'm vegetarian), but instead, it was a platter of grilled veggies with a side of seafood. The restaurant is very veggie friendly and I'm sure they could have accommodated me had I asked. Fail on my part because it looked amazing and I would suggest that over the salad.Then the trio of pastas: a vegetarian ravioli of leeks (and some other stuff), spaghetti pomodoro, and fusilli bolognese. The ravioli, surprisingly, was my least favorite. It had a bitter quality that my palate didn't really like and I'm not sure what it was. The spaghetti on the other hand, was off the charts. Homemade spaghetti with such a pleasant, chewy bite, drenched in a beautiful tomato sauce. Each bite was pure heaven!! I am still thinking about how perfect that pasta was - I've never had anything like it. And who EVER cares about spaghetti and tomato sauce? But no, I would definitely go just to get this dish again. It was such simplicity and exquisite flavor. I mean, if you do simple right, it's bomb. This dish certainly exhibited that sentiment.I refused the bolognese, and the wait staff came around with a garlic and broccoli fusilli. That totally surprised me - but the restaurant wants you to have three pastas. I was already set on giving up one (as a vegetarian, you just let things go); besides, this was all you can eat, so I wasn't at a disadvantage. This fusilli didn't look all that interesting, but it was also extremely good. the broccoli was perfectly cooked, and the garlic flavor permeated everything. It was a much soupier type of pasta. The bartender apologized for not knowing that I was vegetarian, which just spoke to the impeccable service. Like I said, I just figured I would refuse and that would be that. Oh well. But no. I am very impressed by their willingness to accommodate vegetarians.This place was amazing. I can't say it enough. I will definitely be back to have more of that spaghetti pomodoro the next time I'm in town. What a delightful place and a delicious lunch. I ate sooooo much!

We ended up getting a Sicilian wine ~ Scurati by Nero D'Avola. Thanks to our waiter's advice which went great with our meal. It was reminiscent of a Cabernet sauvignon.

2.0,10/31/2011,"After the theater my partner and I decided to dine at Becco. I must say that my very first impression was tainted as we were ushered from the (warm and inviting) front room and the bar room into what I would term an atrium of sorts. After being seated the waiter shared the daily specials. We were then left to the menu. Our choice (the same) was the Angus Steak.  As part of the dinner, a Caesar salad was served as the first course. The lettuce was wilted, the dressing trite with a somewhat bottled taste and the croutons soggy. There was no offer of freshly ground pepper and the plating was done at the table (tacky). When the main course was served I was surprised to see a delicious cut of steak, however the sides (some sort of green soggy mixture and mashed potatoes) seemed as if they were conjured from a cafeteria line. Absolutely not edible.  The saving grace of the meal was a divine Pear Martini that I enjoyed immensely. The service was absolutely not up to par, the room in which we dined was somewhat tasteless and the bill a bit too high for what was delivered. And, money is usually no object when it comes to fine food. Ah but I must say that I did enjoy the olives and fresh white bean hummus that was served prior to the meal.

Other times, not so good.I recently went here to have dinner with two girlfriends for a catch up session. I forgot how loud this place gets and it's also VERY cramped. Seat spacing is not optimal, definitely wouldn't go here for a date.Food wise, we all opted for their pasta deal. You get a first course, either caesar salad or traditional anti-pasta, then you get their unlimited 3 pastas-of-the-day. During my last visit, two of the three pastas were pretty terrible, but maybe my expectations were too high for ""unlimited pasta"". They had a regular penne in tomato sauce, a linguine with veggies, and a lamb and mint ravioli in a light brown sauce. The first two dishes were simply awful. I'm someone who's pretty merciless about having al dente pasta, but this stuff was incredibly undercooked and the pasta was unfresh, hardened and everything was stuck together. The dishes were also very bland. The ravioli was pretty delicious though, I have to admit. The lamb meat were plentiful and there was just the right amount of punch from the mint to balance out the meatiness. This one was also the freshest - it didn't seem pre-cooked.With the plethora of other dining spots on this block alone, I'd probably opt for somewhere else next time. Their other menu items are good, but not mouthwatering or particularly memorable. The veal chop is yummy however.Staff is nice and very attentive, and this place is always packed. They also have a wine list for $25 bottles which is supposed to be a deal, but I'm a wine enthusiast and I've never been thrilled about any of their offerings (although we always order a bottle anyway). For $25, definitely not a bargain in my opinion. You can get a superb bottle of wine from the shop for that much...but we all know what the city is notorious for - marking up crappy wine a time and a half!The pasta special (2 course) plus a bottle of wine between the three of us came out to ~$40 all in.

Those who ordered the salad received their own portion on their plate. However, those of us who ordered the antipasto received one large plate that we all had to share. It was a bit uncomfortable trying to share a dish that didn't have an equal amount of the various items. I wouldn't have ordered the antipasto if I knew it was served family style.As to the pasta dishes, I enjoyed the mushroom stuffed ravioli, but I didn't like the fusilli with a meat sauce. It had no flavor at all. In addition, one person at the table ordered the fried mozzarella appetizer which looked very small, dry and unappealing.

4.0,8/27/2011,"Having had a great meal at Eataly's rooftop bar/restaurant Birreria, we figured we'd give this more traditional, sit-down restaurant (of the Bastianich variety) a shot. We were seated earlier than our 8pm reservation, which worked out nicely, because the back room became very crowded after 8:30 pm .. as in, you are sitting RIGHTNEXT to someone else. Not a huge bother, though.You get a bread box of yummy breads and bread sticks, as well as olives and a spread with olive oil. We ordered one of the $25 bottles of wine that was recommended by the waiter. The list of specials is endless ... almost too endless. We both opted to not go for the seemingly popular all-you-can-eat pasta table service. I had ""Joe's Veal Chop"" - he had the steak. I found my veal chop (with artichoke, garlic mashed and caramelized shallots) to be very delicious. The veal was a little fatty here and there, and the portion of mashed was just a bit too small. I'd have to say I enjoyed my meal at Birerria more than here, but that isn't to say this wasn't good. It was.For dessert, we split the chocolate mousse cake. It was light and rich - but the chocolate quickly became a one-note flavor, and I reached my saturation point for it rather quickly. I might have fared better with the Italian cheesecake, but I'll never know.Quick, efficient service - didn't feel rushed - and the waiter seemed to know his stuff.

3.0,8/25/2011,"Being Italian (Italian American) from New Jersey and coming from a family that knows what good food is and knows how to cook, I was impressed. You never know what to expect from a ""celebrity"" chef restaurant. I have been to a few and can honestly say this was the best one so far. After a night in the city seeing a play celebrating my Mom's 75th birthday we wanted to have a GOOD meal. Becco did not disappoint ! Lidia's restaurant was nicely decorated in a very casual chic style, not gaudy but very neutral colors and tastefully decorated. The service was very attentative and our waiter was a very nice Mexican guy who could pass for authentic Italian if his accent was a little different. The appetizers of stuffed zucchini flowers were excellent and something you don't see every day. The sauteed broccoli rabe was PERFECT ! ! Just the right amount of thinnly sliced garlic in EVO made it melt in your mouth. Yes, a simple dish, yet not always done right. The bread was crusty and a little chewy, the way I like it. We enjoyed a $25 bottle of wine off their extensive selection and it was very nice. My sister had the homemade sausage with broccoli rabe and it was very, very good. A lean and tasty Italian sausage indeed. Most of us ordered the 3 pasta ""unlimited"" selection which was excellent as well and a good value. The naked Gnudi (imagine the inside of a ravioli) in pesto sauce was absolutely tremendous and light. A fresh penne in a simple fresh marina was outstanding. The third was a fettucine (more like a pappardelle) in a vodka sauce with crumbled sausage and peas was pretty damn good as well. I have had that particular dish better elsewhere but it was still very good. At the table was a bowl of freshly grated Parmesan Reggianno (the best) that melted on your tounge. Overall I was very happy with this place and would highly recommend it. Just make sure you get a table not directly next to the wait staff area. We had that table and my sister kept getting bumped into by the wait staff. She's such a complainer.

4.0,8/24/2011,"We enjoyed a ladies lunch here last Thursday afternoon. The restaurant has a warm and welcoming feel on the inside. Since it was a nice sunny day I asked if we could sit outside; the space was a bit noisy as we sat street level but it was a great spot to people watch. The waiter brought over this wooden bread box filled with foccica, bread-sticks and bread with a tasty spread and some mixed olives. We enjoyed the contents of the breadbox while looking over the menu. We decided to split a bottle of wine and had the waiter recommend a light white. The table split fried mozzarella which I thought was just ok, nothing great and a warm burrata cheese over broccoli rabe which was delicious. For the main meal, I went with the whole roasted branzio which was full of flavor and tasty and served with olives and tomatoes; the others went with the unlimited pasta special; they had mushroom ravioli with brown butter, gemelli pesto and spicy spaghetti with shrimp. I did taste the pasta and I thought it was just ok. Maybe my expectations were high since this was Lidia's restaurant but I was happy that I chose the fish. No dessert we were all stuffed. Everyone was friendly, we did not feel rushed. The menu has a variety of choices, the prices are reasonable and how great is the $25 bottle wine list.

By this time our waiter already took our order, and we asked him for water - which he said ""yeah someone is bringing that over"". 8:50pm, still no water.

After the THIRD time we asked, finally water -- 30 minutes later.Fast forward through the pastas -- everything is going well ... until our waiter somehow knocks the fork out of my hand as I'm eating and pesto splatters all over my shirt and into my hair. Super embarrassing. He apologized and gave me 3 napkins and a glass of water (HA!) to clean up.To their credit, the manager did offer a dry cleaning reimbursement and complimentary dessert & dessert wine.There was a shift change shortly before we left, and we paid with a different waiter than the original guy.

The biggest surprise for us was, when we tried to get in to this restaurant, encountered a lady holding the door from the inside trying not to let us in. We all tried to pull the door, but the lady working here was pulling hard from inside to try not to let us in. What???? After a while she opened the door, saying ""the inside was full, now you can come in!! OK, I understand that they control the crowd in the restaurant, and they need to limit the number of people inside(even though I saw plenty of room inside from the glass window of the door).But, who in the world hold the door!!?? She should have simply come out to explain the situation instead of holding the door. The service inside can pretty much be explained by her attitude. Simple, and straight forward.

It was a small... very small... under-fried glorified cheese sandwich for $12 served with bland cold sauces.For our main course, my husband and i shared the lamb chops with scaffata (approximately $30) and the vitello alla Parmigiana ($35). I'll start with the lamb. You get 2... that's right...2 lamb chops and a side of overcooked baby food (otherwise know as scaffata... a sautee of peas, fava beans, and zucchini... i think). It was a mushy flavorless mess that i ate one bite of and that was it for me! The chops were cooked to a nice med. rare, but were not that great... especially for the price!The vitello... oh how they messed up a beautiful piece of veal. Veal should be tender and delicious... This was a tough, rubbery and flavorless piece of meat covered with a bland marinara and cheese. It was large... but tastelessThe total came to just over $100( including tax and tip)... what a waste of money!To sum it up, if you have taste buds and are looking for a tasty place to eat some good italian food...

3.0,6/11/2011,"As you can see, my tender Yelping morsels, I'm chopping an awful lotta wood these days.  After all, there's not much surf IN NYC so what's a brutha supposed to do with all his free time?Get my grind on.So, we met a couple of the homies here last night for dinner - they were kind and cool enough to roll in from Jersey and set us up at this spot.  It's located on restaurant row right off Broadway.  We'd been asked three times if we were in a hurry to see a show (we replied ""no"" each time we were asked but that didn't stop everyone from asking us)...this lead me to believe that they are of the churn-n-burn mentality to roll people in-n-out right quick.  Smart formula given the proximity to where people see shows.It's actually a really cool set up - several different dining spaces and a really lopey little bar.  Very tight quarters but I reckon that would be standard for the area and NYC in general.  Service was decent enough.  For the amount of food one receives, the menu prices are extremely reasonable - in fact, I'd argue it's cheap.  Most entrees come with a salad.  One can add the three pastas (mid-course) they serve (which change daily) to the entree for an additional fee.  There're two wine lists - one more exhaustive (and expensive), the other less expensive (and cheaper)...if one knows his wines, the latter provide provides a nice arbitrage opportunity.Here's a quick breakdown of what we ordered:-Osso Buco - my boy was pretty happy with his selection (I didn't taste it) - my other boy scooped up the bone marrow so it was kinda like a 2-fer-Salmone - grilled and served with roasted cauliflower - this is what I ordered...it was a tad bit dry but generally okay-Ribeye steak - this thing was huge...like Shaq-sized foot huge...my girl couldn't put a dent in this thing, even after sharing much of it with the tableI added the pasta mid-course to my meal.  The daily pastas from yesterday were swiss chard ravioli (kind of bland), farfalle in a tomato based sauce (the pasta was overcooked and the sauce tasted like it came from a can) and seafood (shrimp) linguini (this was actually pretty decent though the pasta was overcooked here as well).For desert, we ordered apple strudel served with vanilla ice cream topped with carmel sauce.  Interestingly, the strudel was a long, thin slice and had golden raisins in it...it added a little bite to the desert.  There was also a desert special - strawberries with whipped cream and some sort of balsamic vinaigrette...the berries were good.  Pretty tough to mess up whip cream...I didn't really care for the vinaigrette.In short, I would go there again ONLY if I were strapped for cash, starving or in a hurry to catch a show nearby.Not my favorite Italian but sometimes, it's about the company more than the food.  Luckily, the homies were solid so it took the focus off of and away from the mediocre offerings here.But, as always, decide for yourself...Great eating to you!",1,1,0,Matty D.,"Los Angeles, CA",39,112,0

3.0,6/7/2011,"I had a big bone to pick at Becco - though not necessarily a bone to pick with Becco if you know what I mean. The big bone I was picking at was part of the osso bucco I ordered as my entree there. As far as having a bone to pick with Becco, let me just say it ain't Babbo, and it ain't Bacco (probably my favorite Italian ristorante in San Francisco). It's Becco, plain and simple, which can credit its popularity on Restaurant Row (46th Street between 8th and 9th Avenues) to Lidia Bastianich, the queen of the PBS cooking shows, the lovably earthy, follically-challenged chef with the Mama Celeste vibe and the untelegenic grown children (which includes Joe, the overly slimmed-down vintner who is Mario Batali's constant business partner).On my first night in NYC on this trip, I decided to give it a try since my friend Carlos and I were not able to dine there the last time I was in the neighborhood. With no expectations, we went to Tramonti across the street and really liked it (see my review - yelp.com/biz/tramonti-ne…). This time, I was alone and able to score a small table within half an hour. Although I was given a hard push for their $22.95 All-You-Can-Eat Three-Pasta Prix-Fixe Dinner, I realized that was way too many carbs even for me. Instead, I started my dinner with a robust bread box accompanied by a variety of marinated olives and a tomato-based chickpea spread swimming in a pool of olive oil (see photos). Good stuff and no complaints so far.This was followed by the Insalata Cesare, which the menu made appear to be quite unique in Becco's treatment. It wasn't. Just a regular Caesar salad that frankly tasted like it was sitting in a mixing bowl far too long since all the romaine lettuce leaves were limp and wet (see photo). This was followed by the entree, the premium-priced $30 Osso Buco alla Becco, a braised veal shank, which as I stated above, was served with its large bone intact and filled with marrow that had been encrusted with bread crumbs on top. It was certainly fall-off-the-bone tender with a smallish side of farro risotto mixed with fava beans and spring peas (see photo). It was hearty eating, no doubt, but the execution came across as rather impersonal.One of the odd ironies is how Lidia's cooking style seems so homey on the small screen, yet up close and personal, this dish had a touch of assembly-line about it. The dinner ended with an unexceptional dessert, an $8 pair of Cannolis filled with cream and pistachios (see photo), a selection only made since they were out of two of the more interesting desserts on the menu by 10PM. To the staff's credit, I never felt crowded in or rushed despite the number of large parties upstairs. Prevalent were tables of middle-aged women who obviously feel an affinity for Lidia and probably were hoping for an appearance. No such luck that evening. Just loud tourists and loud families from Jersey or the other boroughs (my guess).FOOD - 3 stars...the osso bucco was hearty eating heavy on the sauce, but the rest just tasted subpar given Lidia's reputationAMBIANCE - 3 stars...boisterous would be the most generous wordSERVICE - 4 stars...no complaints in this areaTOTAL - 3 stars...sorry Lidia, I guess I'm left to buy your cookbook and try these dishes at home...wish me luck!",11,5,6,Ed U.,"San Francisco, CA",4521,4629,37977

My business associate and I went there for dinner on Friday evening. I ordered the mixed grill and my associate ordered the special of three pastas. We told the waiter we wanted to share. When the meal came we exchanged portions of our meal. The maitre d' arrived and scolded us for sharing, telling us that she had to up charge us $9 for sharing. Evidently the pasta dish was all you can eat and I guess they thought we were going to ruin a profitable night. We told her we did not want more food, we just wanted to share what we ordered. I said go ahead add $9.00 to our tab. Nine bucks. Big deal. My associate objected on principle. A scene ensued. At one point in this ridiculous fiasco I suggested she call the police. What a great episode of Lidia's Kitchen that would have been. The maitre d' left. We finished our meal in peace. If I remove this pathetic display of inhospitable behavior toward patrons and attempt to objectively rate the meal, I would give the food two stars. Both dishes were acceptable, but unremarkable. The temperature of the food was warm, not hot. For the price one can do much better at Cellini, Tony Di'Napoli, Carmines or La Masseria.

We went in with high expectations and left feeling disappointed.At 10pm on a Tuesday the place was packed and bustling. We were seated upstairs at a tiny table for 2 despite there being other larger tables. Every time the waiter brought food or water he had to rearrange. After looking over the menu my husband and I chose the chef special which included a antipasto platter or a Cesar salad and the tastings of 3 different pastas. After tasting you could then choose what you wanted to have more of... an all you can eat style. The 3 pastas were a rigatoni with basil, a spinach noodle stuffed with ricotta and addtional spinach, and a fettuccine with veal. All 3 pastas were just 'ok' with no significant flavor. The pastas were a different texture and tasted either overdone or underdone (depending on the dish).We were very much looking forward to our meal here and ended up feeling underwhelmed by the small table, limited water refills, and flavorless pasta.

The service was great - the waiters were very friendly and although extremely busy, all the waiters helped out so you always had service. Now to the food. They started you off with the absolute best Caesar Salad I've ever had. It was really, really good. For my entree I ordered the Day-boat Seafood with Polenta in a Lobster Brodo. It was to die for. It had 3 large scallops, 2 small pieces of salmon, a small piece of white fish, and 3 shrimp. I think that's alot of seafood and was happy with the variety. The sauce was soooo good and the polenta was delicious. It was a fantastic dish that I would probably get any time I go back. We split a bottle of wine - they had a huge list of $25 bottles. Nice! We also split a slice of cheese cake. I am not really a cheesecake fan because usually I think it's too heavy. This was soooooo good. The crust was amazing and the cake was light and fluffy.

4.0,4/26/2011,"I had nearly forgotten that I had been here, but a conversation with my dad reminded me. See, he and I went here when he came to visit in August 2010. I wanted to pick a place within walking distance from his hotel and I was clueless, since I'm never in the Theater District (Sooo far north! Soooo far west!). I'm happy to say that overall, Yelp steered me correctly on this. Initially, though, when Daddy and I (yes, I still call him that, don't judge) arrived on time for our reservation, we were told to just wait a few minutes. Those few minutes turned into half an hour, and after a full day of work and angry feet that had been stuffed into heels all day, I became what one might consider pissed. On the 800th time one of the maitre'd's approached us as we languished in leather ottomans, asking us if he could get us anything, I put my achy foot down and said, ""Look, what you can get us is the table we reserved nearly 45 minutes ago.""   Presto! We were seated in the cozy, if not slightly cramped upstairs area. Our waitress made up for the lousy maitre'd treatment; she was very attentive and gave suggestions. The breadsticks, olives and hummus antipasti was a surprise and a delight. I could have sat there and munched on the breadsticks all night long. Alas, I was compelled to order. My daddy got the Osso Bucco, while I ordered the salmon with brussels sprouts--hey, it sounds ick, but it was really well-prepared, and as a brussels sprouts fan, I was in heaven. My father thought his Osso Bucco here was the best he'd ever had. Oh, and a word about the Caesar salads--yum. Fresh, crisp, and with dressing that made me want to lick my plate.Not that we needed to eat more, but we knew we would regret it if we didn't try the chocolate mousse cake. Well worth the extra calories. I was tempted to walk home as punishment. However, that evening, Daddy reminded me that I'm much better at punishing others. During dinner, he said, ""You're one tough chick. I wouldn't mess with you."" I'm pretty sure that meant that he was proud of me. At least, that's the story I'm sticking with.",3,2,3,Shana S.,"New York, NY",128,59,11
1.0,4/26/2011,"WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!!  just thought i would get that out there. It's been a while since the night of horror occurred and i haven't had the chance to write this review. Went here for valentine's day i think. I wish i could remember the name of the manager on duty that treated me like a piece of garbage. Hopefully a short description of him will suffice in helping people recognize him and avoid him like the plague. very tall and lanky. light skinned african-american possibly. was wearing a sweater vest  with dress-shirt underneath and khakis. I guess ill leave the incident that capped off a pretty terrible evening for the end.The service (in the beginning) - went on a wednesday just as everyone was getting ready to go to their evening broadway shows. My girlfriend and I were seated right away upstairs which wasnt crowded. seemed pretty laid back. so far so good.The food: on the table is stale bread. strike one. (there would be many strikes, so lets assume we live in an alternate universe where you dont strike out after three but just keep accumulating strikes until your head explodes). I ordered salmon, which was very good. I feel terrible about it because my girlfriend was very disappointed with her meal.  She ordered the three-course pasta special. Now. at this point after we receive our food the place is filling up very quickly. The service (during the meal):  our waiter is clueless. We didn't really ask him anything pertaining to the menu but i got the impression that if i asked for a list of ingredients or method of preparation he would stare at me like i have some horrible deformity and simply walk away. So the pasta special consisted of three barely distinguishable pastas in three incomprehensibly bland sauces. LIDIA! GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER! YOU ARE OVEREXTENDING YOURSELF TRYING TO OPERATE EVERY ITALIAN RESTAURANT ON THE ISLAND OF MANHATTAN.  I think youre a great chef but if you cant manage to bring your skills to the table in a restaurant what the hell is the point. So being that the special is all you can eat we naturally wanted to get our money's worth and save ourselves a trip to McDonald's lest we leave the place hungry. We had to ask four different waiters/busboys/small hispanic men in jeans and a dress shirt? for another serving of pasta. Four times...four incomprehensible responses...four times we had an empty plate.  Thus commenced our first encounter with aforementioned manager. He said they would be out shortly and as soon as we saw the steaming pan of pasta about five minutes later we were finally served. At this point I made a bold decision. We had ordered wine and appetizers so our bill was not small by any means. I neglected to leave a tip. *gasp*  I know i should be stoned to death. Well, seeing as i had never done that in a restaurant i figured, well there's a first time for everything and they certainly didn't deserve it. I understand it's hard out there and these guys dont make much money but by God if the guys at the Olive Garden can manage to smile at you and ask you how the food is then these guys can do it too. and that's all i really wanted in the end. Instead we arrive at the incident. The conversation that i still to this day cannot believe took place.  We are leaving the restaurant, at this point just glad to get out of there. We are in the coat check area putting on our coats when the manager catches up with us and asks us if the meal was ok because he was informed that we did not leave a tip. I proceeded to explain very clearly why the experience was unsatisfactory. (See above). To this explanation he took offense. First he claimed that he was going to comp our dessert because we had to wait so long for the pasta. Thanks guy, that's nice to know after we already have our coats on. What am i supposed to do now sit down and have dessert and forget about the terrible service? So then he tries every excuse in the book:1) ""We were busy"": yes you were busy, but you also had an abundance of waiters walking around not doing a damn thing. 2)""I've worked in since i'm thirteen years old this is just the way it is"": I have been eating at restaurants since the womb, and although i cant remember that far back i distinctly remember a few instances where i've had wonderful service, believe it or not. 3) (this is the best) ""This isn't Applebee's. We dont all have headsets to communicate with each other"" At this point I'm in shock. We're both in our early twenties and my girlfriend and I do look young. But suggesting that our culinary experiences are limited to Applebee's is one of the most insulting things anyone has ever said to me. He must have realized his extraordinary faux pas at this point because he gave us a business card on which he wrote his email address and name and that if we came back we would get that free dessert. WOOO!!!...not.  needless to say, i hope you've hung in there with me and felt my pain along the way. Thanks.",8,6,2,Peter C.,"Ridgewood, NY",13,23,0

All in all though, the best dish we've had at Becco's is the liver with polenta.  Amazing.  If you like liver at all this is the place to have it!I'd skip the lasagna, but then I don't tend to like anyone else's as much as my own.I think next time I will get a double order of the antipasto and maybe another appetizer and call it quits.  The antipasto misto is just wonderful.  This Wednesday it included: a few string beans with a fantastic hollandaise drizzled on,  a great sundried tomato with a little fresh mozzarella,  a couple of slices of grilled zucchini, a pinch or two of a spaghetti squash salad with fresh herbs, a couple of chunks of very lightly pickled carrot,  a tablespoon or so of  a marinated bean combination,  plus four separate little dishes containing ricotta with honey,  octupus salad, a little piece of fish, and something which is now slipping my mind.  Lots of fabulous little tastes.Another con...It can be very crowded, and yes, very noisy.  We went late and by the time we were starting on our main course it was more civilized.  I'd especially avoid the seating in the bar area...it's just too crowded for my taste.  Once we went for lunch, which was very nice.",0,0,0,Denise S.,"Stony Brook, NY",0,6,0

They were fun to eat. I liked onions the best. Yes, onions. The unappetizing so unnecessary two small plates on the side had smelly sliced fried fish (dry and no flavor but left me worry for later...) and another one, Insalata di Polipi, hard and chewy octopus was not acceptable especially coming from one of  well-acclaimed Lidia Bastianich's restaurants.Penne with brocolli (with spinach and olive oil with garlic sauce) - bland and boring vegetarian. A hint of heat (peperoncino) and salty anchovies would enhanced the flavors definitely and for protein and texture, adding Garbanzo Beans would help this dish to me liking.

I couldn't accept how the pasta servers served I thought listening from the waiter that was overwhelmingly memorised the specials and with an attitude and accent didn't helped and it made us uncomfortable.Pappardelle with Lamb Ragout - chewy homemade pasta with a hearty meat sauce and refreshing green peas - the best of three pasta of the night but didn't crave for more although I wasn't full and the server were walking around and asking for a second serving.Ricotta Conchiglie - ricotta cheese stuffed with seashells shape pasta topped off with marinara sauce. It's a comfort meal but it wasn't. It was bland and soulless (no love) pasta.

No one, not even our cheesy waiter with the italian-esque accent and fake (almost sarcastic) sincerity, took a moment to explain the menu, which to some may have appeared a bit confusing. The only way you can get a dish of pasta in this place is to pay $22.95 for an ""all you can eat"" trio of pasta, which cannot be shared. This price includes a Caesar salad or grilled antipasto. Wine list looked decent, but nothing on the $25 bottle list was worth it, however, if you're willing to pay more ($50++), there are some good ""values."" We ordered meatballs for an appetizer to share- you get three big meatballs for $11. Three big dry, crusty balls of pure disappointment, in a loose under seasoned marinara sauce. Horrible. For entrees, we then ordered two ""all you can eat pasta"" trios (since no sharing is allowed), and a hangar steak. We ordered antipasto with the pastas, which was okay-- served family style. Cheeses were fresh, and vegetables were grilled nicely. The steak came with a Cesar, which was also okay. When our entrees arrived, the hangar steak was cooked to order (a true medium rare), well seasoned, and the polenta and vegetables were tasty. The pasta, however, was HORRIBLE. The first of three was a penne with olive oil and garlic with broccoli. Over cooked, greasy, and mushy. The fettuccine bolognese with peas-- overcooked, tasteless, and the meat was dry. The stuffed shells-- overcooked, even burnt on the outside, watery, and soggy on the inside. We have all worked in the restaurant business at some point in our lives, and are not usually the crowd that complains, but this was just beyond. We essentially were paying $45 for two ""all you can eat"" rounds of disgusting pasta. We sent it back after taking just a few bites off each plate.

I now know what it feels like to be a Sardine jammed in a pull top can. With it being so overly packed the noise was a bit over bearing, and these factors took away from the food, and why it was rated a three. Osso Buco  was was delicious and the little bit of marrow from the bone was dressed with some breadcrumbs when combined with the sauce was delightful. The Veal Chop parm, was very good and was a real nice treat three hours later. I was able to add the pasta trio for a $9 up charge to my entree, and it was worth it. The linguine with clams was the perfect mix of garlic and oil, but could have had more clams. The Spinach ravioli w/ butter was good, but the bow ties with tomato basil was ok. The Italian cheesecake was very good, someone ordered the dessert sampler and I wished I ordered that because it looked phenomenal and would have made the difficult decision much easier.

Neither one of us ordered pasta since we were going to be sitting for several hours at the show. Hubby ordered the seafood plate, and I ordered the white stripped bass. Both were specials of the day.

3.0,3/12/2011,"I am not a fan of formula restaurants. With that finding a good choice of restaurant in the theater district is difficult. Why is that? Isn't Manhattan meant to the greatest place on earth? If so, why you have so many areas that are difficult to find a great choice? Penn station area? Theater district, hell's kitchen, there are many forgotten corners of the island. Why? In any case, Becco has a strict twin door policy. The vestibule between the two doors is the coat check too. If you mistakenly, or foolishly try to open the second door when the first one is still open, your hand will physically be stopped by a hostess, who rather sounds like a NYPD employee that a restaurant hostess. ""DON'T""T OPEN THE DOOR!' - ""are you for real? did you actually just speak to me like that?'So once we are in, the place is full, full. We are taken to the second or third floor, endless dining rooms later we get seated. There is no pasta menu, rather a three choice of pasta, all you can eat. I felt like pasta so we ordered. My wife chooses the steak. Pasta: waiters walking around with huge pasta serving dishes, swimming in sauce. All ok, nothing wrong with them. Call them american pasta, or pasta soup, if you are into that kind of thing then you'd call it great to amazing.Steak: large slab of meat like an island on a white plate. Did taste good.Cannoli - very good.Wine. Ample $25 selection. That is fair. We chose a $70 and it did taste great, but got lost in the formula menu which gave the overriding feeling of seating in a canteen, not conducive to fine wines.Probably better than most other italian in the area.

The pasta are served right out of the pan onto your dish and they come and give you second helpings if you would like more. Great concept and great deal. The wine selection is both good and very good selection of good well priced bottles. I would highly recoomend this place.

The price didn't seem worth it.My swordfish was pretty good, though it was a bit underwhelming and a bit too dry. The spaghetti squash that came with it, though, was more interesting to me, as it was densely flavored with stewed tomatoes. My friend's 24 hour pork was very tender though a bit fatty.

Before I go any further in my review, Becco's is not much for the Michelin star discerning crowd but rather for groups of budget-conscious friends or families who would like to have a decent Italian meal in midtown at a great value. As said before, it's a favorite for some of my friends because it's a casual place that we can go back to on a regular basis during the week and never worry about going hungry here. The atmosphere is generally cozy and friendly, though it can get a little loud like the way Carmine's does some times, but still an inviting environment. Staff there do their best to keep up with the request of the ""all-you-can-eat-pasta trio"" special and considering that, I think they do a pretty good job.  Now, if you haven't looked at their website yet or heard from a friend, the biggest hype about this place is what I just mentioned a second ago. The (currently) $22.95 pre fix dinner menu that features a classic italian antipasti plate to share and unlimited servings of their three daily pastas. That, in itself is why this place is a favorite amongst my friends and gets the 4th star in my rating.

The food came out a bit slow, but the service was professional with a bit of waiter/actor indifference.My complaint is mostly with the atmosphere. The main room is small, you might say intimate, but there are twenty of so managers, servers and helpers milling about constantly doing God know what. In the center of the room is a large metal door that leads to the storage downstairs. Now imagine that heavy metal door being opened and slamming shut about 5 times a minute. I honestly thought it was a circus act, because I can't imagine why they would need to go to the basement that often and not realize that the slamming door was that loud. Then imagine the strongest smell of pine cleaner emanating from the basement. If you go to Becco, do NOT sit in that front room or you will go deaf from the door slam and get nauseous from pine cleaner.",2,0,1,Tom K.,"New York, NY",2,41,0

They were so close they had to move the table over just so I could squeeze in. I hate this setup because  it seems so awkward for the duration of the dinner. You can't have a conversation with your partner without the table beside you hearing or chiming in. It's way too close for comfort. The couple beside us were very uncomfortable and were complaining about the same thing. The service was alright, nothing to complain about or compliment. I had the 3 pasta special which I didn't think was anything ""special"" and my husband had the bone-in pork chop which he thought was awful and hardly ate a bite.

I'm not a huge fish-eater, and even I had to admit it was tasty.  For dessert we shared a chocolate bread pudding which was the right size and not as heavy as it looked.The most impressive thing to me was the wine list.  There's a huge list of wines for only $25 a bottle, and these weren't wines of the 'Yellow Tail' variety.  I recognized several bottles that I had bought myself in stores, and the markup was very slim, compared to the norm.  That being said, they also had a separate list of more expensive wines, and that wasn't small either.  Cool.Some small gripes:  the space where you wait for your table to get ready is small and people are constantly saying ""excuse me, excuse me"", often from two directions at once.  I guess the answer is to wait outside.  The noise level at the beginning of the evening was also pretty clangy and dinny, louder than it needed to be.  I guess most of the blame for this goes on the clientele, not the restaurant.  The service was fine, but a tad clumsy, neither spectacular nor terrible.I would happily go back.",3,0,0,Mark H.,"Manhattan, NY",46,506,6

Everything was just extremely flavorful and if I could, I would have asked for the anitpasti misto to be all-you-can-eat as well!The 3 different pastas were really good too. There weren't extravagant by any standard, but seriously good comfort food pasta. There was your standard spaghetti w/ marinara, gnocchi with pork (I think) and gemelli w/ pesto sauce. I think my favorite was the gemelli w/ pesto. The breadsticks and the sauce it comes out with was also pretty darn awesome. I pretty much overloaded on carbs that night.

2.0,10/18/2010,"Given the great acclaim here on Yelp and the pedigree of the owners, I was expecting a lot more out of Becco. The concept here is actually pretty strong: all the wines are $25 so you don't have to worry about price, and a prix fixe pasta menu that's relatively affordable.  Becco started strong with a nice bread basket and relatively friendly service. The $25 wine list had lots of good selections and we grabbed a very nice Primitivo. The antipasti misto was actually quite good. The vegetables were marinated perfectly, and the seafood selections were prepared very nicely. Wonderful flavors all taken together. If I had only had the antipasti and then gone home, it would have left a much better picture in my mind. If the pasta had lived up to the hype, or even come close, Becco would have gotten 4 or 5 stars for sure. Unfortunately, it didn't. If only the pasta had been as good as the antipasti! Unfortunately, what came out was three rather uninspired pastas. Fortunately the pasta itself was cooked fairly well  (although the fusili could have used a minute or so less time in the water, I think) but the sauce that came with each was very weak. Not much more to say on the matter - any one of them could have been straight out of a jar (although I think had that been the case there might have been a little more flavor). Now, I'm all for simple preparation. When done right, it's truly magical. So my complaint is not that the sauces were simple - it's that they weren't done very well. There's a big difference. Such a shame because had it been as delicious as all the reviewers suggest, this would certainly be an amazing venue that I'd have come back to over and over again. As it is, this will likely be my only visit and I'd advise others to steer clear of the sirens' call of unlimited pasta and head someplace else.",6,2,2,Bryan C.,"New York, NY",227,149,1

At the core of it all, is the whole bottomless/made for the masses feel of Becco. I realize that that's the nature of the beast. This is, after all Restaurant Row - adjacent to the Theater District. It's to be expected. But, that's the rub for me too because this wasn't the approach I was brought up with. I recognize that I'm not the last word on Italian Food. Italian food is, in fact made for a mass of people. But, this takes it a step too far for me. Becco becomes a little too show-bizzy for my taste. I like a quieter atmosphere. If you have theater tickets, want pasta and have a reservation (recommended) this is your place. By all means go and enjoy to your heart's content. But, if dinner is what's for dinner, then there are other places that aren't so populated with tourists, aren't quite so commercial.",3,0,0,Chris C.,"New York, NY",218,367,17

4.0,9/20/2010,"Really enjoyed this place for the price.  We stayed in Times Square and went here twice.  For starters, they have an extensive $25 bottle wine list.  For seconds, you get hummus, breads, and olives for the free appetizer. On to the food.  The entrees are pricey, but hey, it's Times Square!  My wife really enjoyed the lamb.  It was perfect.  Herby, moist, cooked exactly as requested.  Came with a great veggie side.  I had a fisherman's bowl type plate.  Lots of good flavors.  The scallops were excellent.  The canoli was superb.  The good kind with chocolate chips and pistachios.A few days later we went with friends from Jersey and we really hit the menu hard, trying lots of wines, the pasta specials, etc.  These meals were good, not great, like the 1st night, or I would have given 5 stars.  I would actually not recommend the 3 pasta special unless you are REALLY hungry.  Otherwise, go for quality over quantity.It's very crowded, so I highly recommend a reservation, even for pre-theater dinner.  The great thing about crowded however is that it's New York, you end up talking to all the tables around you and comparing notes.",1,0,0,Kevin M.,"Houston, TX",1,23,0

Being a MasterChef fan, I noticed that Bastiniach's name showed up on the restaurant, so I figured it was going to be good. Wow, was I amazed. Italian is not one of my favorite cuisines b/c it tends to be heavier in most restaurants.The food here, however, was so full of flavor, joy, creativity.I opted for the Sinfonia di Pasta lunch special - Antipasto + 3 pastas served tableside fresh from the pan. The day's options were spaghetti, fusilli with bolognese, and mushroom ravioli with browned butter sauce. OH My Lord!!  The fusilli may be the best pasta I've ever had. The flavor was so surprising. just a touch of sweet in the bolognese, with some nutmeg. The the bright fresh peas against all that flavor. Everything was perfect! The antipasto plate is definitely worth writing about as well. A colorful array of all sorts of little bites. Home made mozzerella, marinated shitake, oven roasted tomatoes, the best olives i've ever had. So many delightlful little gifts to your mouth.My friends' dishes were also fantastic.

3.0,8/28/2010,"Becco is a good spot and fairly reasonable on the wallet. However, I would actually advice people not to get the unlimited pasta dinner. It's not a bad deal, but just know you have to throw down a lot of pasta to make it worth it. And it's good pasta, everything they throw at you, but nothing out of the ordinary that couldn't be made at any other regular Italian restaurant anywhere. Their extensive menu likely has much better, tastier choices and you won't feel pressured to stuff yourself with tons and tons of pasta. I ate two oversized plates full and left feeling like I didn't carry the load.Also, there is either no AC or it doesn't work very well and so it's easy to get very hot.

3.0,8/26/2010,"Two of my friends rave about this place and visit every time they are in NYC. While I was not terribly disappointed with Becco, I was not really impressed either. On a positive note, they have an excellent and large selection of wines that they offer for $25 a bottle. My friend and I ordered a great Pinot Grigio that was definitely the highlight of the experience for me. The complimentary bread served with olives and hummus is also tasty. You also can't fault Becco too much for its pricing. Most entrees are in the $20 to $30 range. We visited at lunch and were drawn to the $18 all you can eat offering of three different pastas. I'm really not one for ordering pasta at a restaurant since I make it frequently at home, but I figured if this is their claim to fame, why not give it a shot. This offering also included a salad or antipasto. I opted for the antipasto which was excellent, and included red pepper, mushroom, and fish and octopus.The day we visited the pasta offerings included a veal bolognese, a spaghetti with red sauce and mushroom ravioli. The veal bolognese and the mushroom ravioli were really quite tasty and of the caliber one would expect for a good Italian restaurant. I was not impressed with the spaghetti with red sauce. I've had better at people's homes. What really turned me off to this place, however, was the extremely claustrophobic seating (I felt like we were having lunch with the random people next to us) and the bathrooms, which are located directly across from the kitchen. You have to fight your way through waiters to get to them. The service was excellent, however, and definitely more than I would have expected for the price point.

My second visit, I had the salmon which I was pleasantly surprised of as well. As far the other entrees this is where Becco shined, from the Fish of the Day which was pan seared and nicely fillet. My mom enjoyed it. At Becco, they bring you the whole fish before they fillet, to show you ur beautiful whole fish. On my next visit, my friend ordered the lobster fra diavolo which consisted of a whole lobster stuffed with seafood greatness of shrimp, calamari, squid and mussels. The spicy sauce added a kick and it was delivered to perfection, a feast for any seafood lover. As far as drinks- I had their signature Bellini which was a yummy compliment to my salmon.

4.0,8/14/2010,"One of the great Italian restaurants of the immortal Lidia Bastianich, Becco is a fantastic place to hit on a moment's notice to get some great pasta on a reasonably low budget. The always packed juggernaut of Italian food is conveniently located in the pre/post theater district on 46th St between 8th and 9th Aves.Best known for their nightly special, the ""Sinfonia Di Pasta"", Becco offers a huge selection of Italian classics. Their trademark dish is an immense Osso Bucco, however the Sinfonia is the way to go if you want to gorge for a low price. It begins with a choice between Casear Salad or a sampling of various Antipasti, including marinated vegetables, cheese, and fish. Then you receive unlimited tableside service of three daily rotating pastas. On this particular evening I enjoyed Spaghetti with Tomato and Basil (actually on more recent visits, I've been disappointed by the tomato sauce - way too sweet. Not sure what happened), Rigatoni alla Bolognese with Fresh Peas, and Spinach Ravioli with Butter and Marjoram. Fantastic! The key is to have them completely fill your plate up at the end of the meal even if you're full, so you can take the leftovers home.Normally the above would be more than enough, but tonight they were offering an appetizer special of Burrata! Of course I had to jump at the chance to enjoy this rare Italian specialty. Burrata is quite simply a pouch of fresh mozzarella stuffed with additional shreds of cream-soaked mozzarella. The pouch is tied at the top and the interior oozes out when cut. It must be eaten within 24-48 hours, so this delicacy is quite rare indeed, and if found in the U.S. it is typically an overnight import from Italy. Well, needless to say it was insanely delicious, served atop a piece of garlic toast and sauteed broccoli rabe.One final note that makes Becco more than worth while is the $25 per bottle assortment of great wines. Also, despite the sardine-can-like degree of crowdedness, I have never had to wait more than a few minutes for a table.",3,1,2,Darren M.,"Manhattan, NY",4,64,10

5.0,8/12/2010,"I've been to Becco several times and it never disappoints. Although the service can be a bit scattered (especially during peak dinner hours), the food never disappoints. We always get the pasta special here. On my most recent visit we came for lunch - a great deal. The pasta is exactly the same, but it's five dollars less at lunch than at dinner. All in all, a great value. I know some say that the pasta is nothing special, but I totally disagree. My favorite is the simple but totally delicious spaghetti with tomato sauce and basil. For a dish so simple, all the components must be perfect. The pasta (homemade) is cooked until it's just al dente and the basil complements the flavors wonderfully. Since I (and often my dining companions) don't eat beef or pork, we ask for the vegetarian option, which is not a throwaway dish like you might expect. Quite the opposite, as we've found that usually it's the best out of the three pastas offered (an especially savory broccoli/garlic combo comes to mind). And you're in luck if the stuffed pasta choice is the mushroom ravioli. Wow, is that good. Another favorite was the cloudlike ricotta gnocchi. My best advice is to pace yourself. Don't fill up too much on the bread before your meal. I go for the lighter breadsticks dipped in the hummus/bean dip that they offer. Taste all three pastas before you finish one and decide which you want seconds of immediately as it usually takes a while for the servers to come out with your preferred choice. Also, come here hungry, and you won't regret it. A word about the starters for the pasta special. I pretty much always get the antipasto. It is prepared extremely well. The smoked fish and octopus and potato salad are favorites, and the assortment of pickled vegetables and cheeses are delicious. I think it's a better value and a much more creative assortment than the Caesar salad. There's usually not much room left for dessert, but when there is you can't go wrong with the ricotta cheesecake. It's much lighter than traditional American cheesecakes, but just as creamy.

4.0,7/14/2010,"Becco beats the notion that ""all you can eat"" food is unsavory and mediocre. The food, albeit inexpensive at $20-$35 a person, is quality. Being in the theater district, it's inherently a little touristy but it doesn't ruin the experience. Prices are not inflated and you can still get a reservation on a Friday night. Inside, you'll find Becco warm and cozy. Perfect for a date or a relaxing dinner after a show.The glutton in me opted for the three pasta all you can eat special. I received a salad and a never ending amount of carbs for about $23. Out of the three pastas served, I adored the mushroom ravioli. They were plump and savory in a cream sauce. Yum. The other dishes weren't bad but not nearly as notable. I also give credit to the waiter with patience for me. Yes, patience. You see, when I went, two of us enjoyed a nice bottle of pinot noir....Ok, perhaps I'm using the word ""two"" loosely. I probably consumed about 85% of it. Whoops. After the aforementioned behavior, I refused to speak more than two words in English at a time. I was being cute, jovial, and unapologetically inebriated.

1.0,7/5/2010,"I went here recently and felt like I was in some horrible tourist trap, or perhaps the Olive Garden.  Our waiter looked like she hated her life, the decor was cheesy, and the management kept explaining to us that we couldn't share our food-- specifically the pasta.  When we explained we had no intention of sharing the pasta, just the entrees and a handful of appetizers (one appetizer of which was $35 by the way so we were already paying the equivalent of an entree each), they still kept pushing us to order additional food and told us that if we were caught sharing, our silverware would be taken away.  At the end of the day, it was obvious they were trying to shove extra food down our throats to make an extra buck, which I find quite tacky and something you would find at a down-scale Italian chain.  I guess we should have tipped off by the ""all you can eat"" pricing.  I also noticed that most of the more favorable reviews on here are from non-Manhattanites, so I would say this to all you tourists and Broadway show go-ers: you are in New York, where amazing Italian food abounds.  Please don't go to this establishment, because as someone who lives in NYC, I would be embarassed if you thought this was representative of what fabulous food this city has to offer.",2,0,1,Elaine C.,"New York, NY",2,5,0
3.0,7/3/2010,"The business model at Becco is fairly straightforward:  traditional Italian dishes at economical prices.  It is refreshing that tradition is not compromised, but the quality does suffer some to deliver at the very low price points.  For instance, a big draw for dinner is the pasta meal ($22.95) that includes a choice between a Caesar salad or a plate of antipasti and an unlimited amount of three types of pasta.  I opted for it choosing the antipasti plate.  I was served a mix of olives, fresh peas, ricotta cheese with a drizzle of honey, a mix of beans, fresh mozzarella, green beans, mushrooms, squash, carrots, grilled octopus, and mackerel in a tomato based sauce.  That is quite the opening act!  Everything was decent with the standout dishes being the grilled octopus and the classic Italian pairing of peas and ricotta.  The pasta selections were ravioli with a mushroom sauce, orecchiette, and spaghetti.  The raviolis were decent.  The sauce was a little runny, but otherwise the filling and sauce boasted a promising flavor that had me ordering additional helpings.  The spaghetti was bare bones, not offering much pizazz to the plate.  Ditto for the orecchiette.  The pastas were all passable, but only the raviolis stood out.    The service was okay.  I think our server went on a break during our meal, as a few different people were ultimately responsible for our table (this wasn't a captain, sommelier, etc. kind of place).  The ambience is a packed house in the theater district, largely indistinguishable from many of the other restaurants nearby.  It was fairly loud until it became late.  After 11pm, you could finally return to a normal voice level conversation.Recommend for the budget-conscious who arrive hungry.  For more sophisticated fare in keeping with tradition, many better places exist in the city.  Of course, they come at a higher price too.  3.5 stars",7,6,6,Jim U.,"Washington, DC",690,1303,3044

3.0,6/3/2010,OK maybe I need a redo on this place because I was slightly disappointed last night. We got to Becco before our 8pm show and got seats at the bar because the restaurant was packed! We got a nice bottle of wine from their $25 bottle list and ordered a few appetizers to share. Service - superb and attentive. Food - a bit disappointed on my end! I had the soft shell crab which was fried and a bit tasteless in my opinion. The mozzarella cheese was a-ok but not a culinary orgasm by any means....the waiter was over-hyping it. My friend ordered the calamari with some salad...and that was a bit weak too.

3.0,6/2/2010,"As New York newbies (overwhelmed with all the choices in town), we failed to make reservations at other places that require actual forethought, so we went looking for someplace in Restaurant Row to go to after a play.  We were able to get a same-day reservation at Becco on OpenTable and the place was still packed at 9 PM.  I ordered the pasta special and my boyfriend ordered the rack of lamb; his food was way better than mine.  He got a full rack of lamb (7 or 8 chops!) perfectly cooked with a nice spice crust, but the three pastas of the evening didn't live up to it.  I was thinking at least one of the pastas would be ""holy crap I want to eat a bucket of this"" but they were all basically just OK.  (It was a basic penne with tomato sauce, a nettle gnudi, and a somewhat thin bolognese.) As others have noted, I think the pasta special may be a crapshoot.  The lamb was good, though.  Still, next time we're in NY we'll see if we can plan ahead to hit up some other places that are a little more out of the way.",2,1,1,Michaela L.,"San Jose, CA",33,516,30

I enjoy olive gardens endless pasta much more ! as you get more variety, amazingly fresh bread and MEAT! COME ON wheres the meat?!? but also after i finished my first place it took almost 20 minutes before someone came by to offer me anymore... We sat with empty plates for a while. The Caesar salad was delicious! The bread was also delicious. the atmosphere is energetic and happening which is a good sigh. The food is fresh as its constantly being made.

Coarse-grained pepper would have been lovely with my pasta, though.Becco's vegetable-stuffed cannelloni is a treat, as is their Cozze alla Triestina appetizer (12): their mussels are surprisingly meaty and quite delicious, soaking in a garlicy broth of their own juices.

My business colleague ordered the rack of lamb which was done to perfection also, very high grade of meats and fish used at Becco. I am low carb oriented, so the main dish was excellent....no pasta and very filling. The atmosphere was alive even though it was a Monday night and the theaters were closed due to Passover. Table seating is tight and it tends to get noisy, but I thrive in these types of restaurants. They include a very nice Caesar salad with your main course and the total with desserts was less than $70....a real deal given the quality of the food.

I settled on one of the seasonal main course options: homemade sausage with fennel over polenta dressed up with cannellini beans and stewed tomatoes. Holy shiitake!  It sounded good, it looked better (those sausages were huge), and it tasted amazing.  Normally I never leave leftovers.  John S. once wisely told me that, ""leaving pizza at a restaurant is like leaving a soldier behind on the battlefield.""  That night I left much of my plate since I had somewhere else to go and I was stuffed.  All day long the following day I still had sausage in creamy polenta on my mind.  I left the poor soldiers that night.  I'm not a team player.  But neither is Becco.  If  they hadn't made me eat so much of the delicious salty bread (focaccia?) I could have easily ingested those two succulent and beautiful pieces of meat.I sampled the pastas, which were very good and fresh, but my meal was out of this world. Try it. My only complaint of the night was despite arriving on time for our reservation and being told we would be seated in a few minutes, we waited 15+ minutes for our table.  If we knew that a few minutes was going to be more than what was stated we would have gotten a drink to pass the time.  Otherwise, our waiter was lovely and he suggested the same wine my boyfriend was thinking about ordering on the $25 list of bottles of vino.  No complaints there.  3 course pasta + my entree + bottle of wine + tip = $88",11,9,10,Justine D.,"Glen Ridge, NJ",530,485,144

A mad rush to finish? The play ended at 4:00, we were seated promptly, and our virgin trip to Becco exceeded our expectations. The Sinfonia Di Pasta was outrageously good. Judging by other reviews we must have come by on a good night.  Linguine in robust white clam sauce with clams so tender, sweet and slightly undercooked. In other words perfect. Mushroom Ravioli in Truffle sauce and bow tie pasta in sweet red basil sauce.  The taste and texture of the pastas, obviously fresh, were a joy. The service was great and the  the portions kept coming and coming. If I had a white flag I would have raised it after 45 minutes or so. I don't know why I ordered the dessert sampler. Curiosity perhaps.  It was, well,OK but unnecessary.  The included strawberry sorbet would have done just fine on its own.

I had the osso bucco, which was a very very generous portion.  It was very moist and tender, although the sauce was less than impressive. The barley side dish was also unimpressive. The antipasti caldo was above average - had some tiny clams stuffed with some tomato/pepper relish; the 2 shrimp were small and just deep fried; the panceta was delicious, and so was the eggplant stuffed with ricotta.We also tried the halibut, which was awesome, and the swordfish was very good.Service was below average.  VERY VERY SLOW, and our waiter, was a dope and completely out of it.  Think he was cracked out or something.

It's a nice cozy restaurant with dim lighting and dark wood tables. Tables were on the smaller side but the staff placed cups/plates comfortably. We started off with a sparkling red wine off the $25 bottle list, which is a great deal; I would recommend it. Upon sitting, they served a bread/stick/hummus/olive box which was very good. There was a variety of everything and the hummus was a nice touch. I started off with the seafood antipasto and pasta deal. I would recommend the antipasto, giving you a tasting of everything if you're open minded to trying new things. I don't remember all the different pastas they served except for the clam linguine which was very good. The rest was overly drenched over a salty tomato sauce. My date had the  veal(?) I believe, I remember enjoying his dish. Overall, I enjoyed the experiences. I definitely would not get the pasta deal again, the service was not up to par with refilling the linguine which really was all i wanted. Everything else was perfect and I enjoyed the wine and restaurant itself. I would come back to try different specialty dishes and definitely for their olives/bread/wine!

4.0,2/24/2010,"Came here this week before the Monday night show at Birdland -- the overall layout is very intimate yet not very cramped.  There seemed to be 4 major 'rooms' inside one of which is upstairs and overlooks the street.  We were placed in the back corner somewhere (I made a reservation 2 hours before), but it did not seem 'secluded' and we received prompt attention from the staff.So the wine selection -- they have a *huge* list as one option, but they also have a 30$ or so  (forget exactly how much it is) bottle selection on the dinner menu.  We ordered off that and honestly it was very good, and not just given the price.For food I ordered the 'pounded' and breaded veal and we went with the 3 pastas as an app.  The pastas were very good, as was the caesar salad, and the veal was very well cooked, though the melted cheese on it was a bit overwhelming to the flavor of the meat itself.  After the caesar, pasta, wine, and veal we had no room for desert unfortunately.  Clearly they cater to the theater crowd like everyone else on that street, but honestly Becco seemed to be a bit above the norm for that street.  If you do have a play to go to or are in the area give it a shot.",0,0,0,John P.,"New York, NY",22,38,6

I got to be entertained from this out of tune women singing 3 tables away. We were served a wonderful basket of cold bread. The waiter was not the sharpest tool on the block. When ordering the wine he mentioned a few times how they have cheap bottles for 25 dollars. No thank you. After X amount of long minutes we hadn't received our wine. In that time I still had my menu on my plate and they poured water in our wine glasses. service? BlahcoHe finally came out with the wine and was clearly taking down to my boyfriend as if he never ordered a bottle of wine in his life. ""So you know how this goes rrriigghtt?"" ""I already decanted the wine"" while of course holding the decanter. It's a good thing no one was sitting next to us on our left or else they would be very upset as he attempts to pour wine in my other wine glass. BlahcoIn terms of food we of coursed ordered the Sinfonia di Pasta. We both had caesar salads. Which has the same quality that you find in delis that you can order by the pound. When receiving the pasta they splat it on your plate just to make sure they some of it ends up on the tabled cloth. Very watery. I had a sweet tooth and ordered that the dessert sampler along with tea.  Despite common sense because everything has been so bad. Also keep in mind that all of this is served slow.  The dessert came I took one bite of each. The dessert is gross and not fresh. The cheese cake had that gross artificial strawberry sauce I've seen in diners.  My tea never showed up. I give this place two stars instead of one simply because I was able to swallow the food except for the desserts and the place is very inexpensive.  The glasses, the table cloth, and the decor all very cheap.

3.0,1/13/2010,"Also ordered the Sinfonia Di Pasta. As it was our first visit, and our waiter neglected to mention the refill policy (nor did I read it on the menu nor did my homework on Yelp) I wasn't anticipating my bottomless plate. We weren't starved, and we're currently all being careful about overeating.  One friend ordered a chicken (picatta style) main dish, the other had a large house salad as her entree. The portions were generous, but even if they weren't we would eat family style. When the Caesar salad for two was served we wanted our friend, who ordered a large spring salad as an entree, to taste some of ours. Not only did we get a disparaging look from the server, but after the three way split the remaining salad was whisked away from our table without our being asked if we wanted to finish the remaining salad on the serving plate. A single ravioli from my Sinfonia was given to both of my friends to try. When shared with my friend who had only ordered salad, the waiter approached her and said cameras were in the room and that sharing the Sinfonia wasn't allowed. We weren't looking for a deal by not ordering a third main entree, and we were not looking to abuse their refill policy. The remark was rude and we felt uncomfortable for the rest of the meal. By the way, the Sinfona was decent, not the best ravioli or home made pasta by a long shot. The bread selection, olive oil and free chickpea appetizer were very good and the house wine by the glass (cheapest one on the menu -$10) was excellent. The chicken portion was enormous, we took home leftovers. Not running back, even though we go to the theatre often. I don't want to be watched as I eat nor do I want anyone telling me, large portions or small, when to share my food. The food is of a high caliber, but the management needs an attitude adjustment.

We had a 6pm reservation and at first I was a little disappointed we were sat upstairs on their covered patio area. Turned out it was a great spot for the 6 of us. The first and second floors were packed with diners and it was loud and extremely stuffy. I would suggest allowing a little more time for dinner, we ended up just making it to the theatre before the show started since the restaurant was so busy. The service was good but probably would have been better if they weren't so busy, the atmosphere great, great cocktail and a great wine list. The food was delicious and we will definitely be going back!. Their bread box is great; warm rustic Italian bread, crunchy breadsticks, olives and creamy light hummus were delicious! We started off with the Prosciutto and Parmesan appetizer and the Burrata Cheese, Broccoli Rab Bruschetta. All entrees include their house Caesar salad served family style. It was the best Caesar salad I've had in a long time!! It was full of flavor! I wanted seconds and thirds! I probably could've skipped the appetizers (although good) and just loaded up on the items in the bread box and Caesar salad. For diner I debated on 3-4 entrees and decided on the Seafood Stew over polenta suggested by the server. All fish and seafood were cooked perfectly but it didn't wow me. Other entrees ordered... Veal Parmigiana: delicious and a huge bone-in veal chop! Bone-In Veal Chop Special for 2; Cooked perfectly, full of flavor served with sauteed broccoli rabe and potatoes. Salmon served with potatoes and veggies; didn't have a taste but heard it was good. What I should have ordered., was what my mom ordered..Becco's known-for-entree; endless pasta for $24.It was delicious. Each day they served 3 different pasta. This night you started off sampling all three Rigatoni with Broccoli and Pepperoncini, Spaghetti with Marinara and Turkey and Cheese Tortellini in a Chick Broth.

I'd think so before he was clearly making fun of us to another waitor. We finally asked for a wine list, and then he laughed at us and had a manager double check all of our IDs. We all opted for their signature pasta trio: shrimp and penne ala vodka, pumpkin ravoli, and a pesto spaghetti. The pumpkin ravioli was good, and everything else was sub-par. The pesto sauce tasted like spaghetti thrown in with basil, and the vodka sauce was regular old marinara.

Pasta was fine but cooked in a large batch and lacked in refinement. Cafeteria or buffet ish. Entree were fine but also extremely ordinary and predictable. It has a big wine selection. We had $25 full bodied red wines and they were fine. Muscato was surprisingly very good ,  Cheese cake was very fluffy yet had very rich flavor.  Muscato and cheesecake were highlight of our dinner.

Came here today for lunch with a few coworkers and ordered their famous unlimited tableside pasta trio.. i really wasnt impressed. Sauce was salty, pasta was waaaaaaay overcooked. Pumpkin ravioli tasted like greasy pumpkin pie. Had a few bites of my coworkers seafood with lobster sauce over polenta and was very pleased. Took a few more bites though and decided it was way too rich. My coworker didnt even finish half of it. I did, however, really like their pear gorganzola and arugala salad. It was delicioso. And i'm feeling the way all of their wines are 25 bucks a bottle (although it makes it hard for ppl like me to choose...i usually pick the 2nd cheapest wine in each category hehe).

4.0,12/2/2009,"I was a little concerned that going out for Italian in the theatre district would be so typical and/or contrived, but  I have to say I was very, very pleasantly surprised.  Really liked the fact that the focus in this restaurant is not on 100 different ways to serve pasta.  Started out with the complimentary bread,olives and white bean spread (yum!!) and then had a terrific caesar salad.  I'm not a fan of the overdressed, overly garliced caesar salad and this one was neither - perfectly balanced.For dinner, had the pulled pork entree  - wow.  It was truly delish!!!  Extremely tender, not fatty and served on top of excellent mashed potatoes.  Thoroughly satisfying and (thankfully) portion was just right.Service was professional and attentive.  Wait staff checked in on us as well as the manager.  Also thought the price was good, especially given the location of this restaurant.Given our experience, I would love to give this restaurant 5 stars, but the one thing that detracts from that rating is the very small size of the tables and the fact that the tables for two are practically on top of each other.  I was literally no more than 2 feet from the table next to me.",0,0,0,Jenn W.,"West Hartford, CT",3,36,0
2.0,11/28/2009,"I had been looking forward to Becco for a long time. Finally the chance arrived but after dining there, the result was not the satisfying experience I thought it would be. Despite a cadre of New York's finest server-savants, a wide (pastaless) menu and a cozy space, the restaurant failed to live up to my own expectations.The only pasta available was bundled in their perennial three-pasta deal, which has become perhaps, the place's dubious hallmark. It always seemed so Olive-Garden to me. Yes, Becco is in the theater district so I suppose it wants/needs to cater to out-of-towners. But with the pedigree and reputation that Ms. Bastianich has, that would seem totally unnecessary. We didn't go for the semolina-trifecta, so I guess that makes us either dilettantes or weight watchers.The appetizers were entirely competent, so you will do fine on your own without a drawn-out description by me. But it is at the entree point where restaurant wars are usually won or lost. At Becco the battle turned out to be at best, a stalemate. My partner ordered the veal chop and I the osso buco. The chop was sizable and was presented nicely but lacked a competent crusting that satisfied, or the tenderness that would compensate for it. The osso bucco as well, lacked the softness usually associated with the dish. I dare say my own approximations of Marcella Hazan's classic recipe turn out better. The desserts, like the appetizers, were absolutely fine and delicious.And so it went, two steps forward, and one step back. It's true that this review is handicapped by being meat-centric, but had any pasta choices been offered singly, other than a third of a mega three-pack, we probably would have gone for at least one. Dining at Becco was not exactly the tarantella I had hoped to be doing at master Bastianichs' odeum, but I'll try a whirl with Felidia next time.",4,1,2,Roger Y.,"Honolulu, HI",15,39,0
4.0,11/26/2009,"4.5 stars! Quality, fresh, good service, great ambiance, attentive, a bar, walk-ins on Thanksgiving day, all you can eat pasta (the Sinfonio Di Pasta - 3 choices) for $22.95 of the daily pasta. For the Sinfonio, you also get an appetizer choice. Loved the bread and side of olives. They had bread with onions, sourdough, and breadsticks. The spread they provided tasted like hummus and was really good.I shared with my friend the Antipasto Caldo that was $8 per person (so you would get 2 portions each) if you shared with someone else. It came with eggplant stuffed with cheese, stuffed mushrooms, crispy shrimp, and clams topped with proscuitto. Loved every single item! We also split the sausage dish (it's 2 sausages for a plate), and they even split it for us since we told them we were sharing. If you're hungry, order the unlimitless pasta. Otherwise, you can probably split an appetizer and order an entree. I'm so glad we found this place and would definitely come back here again. Great for groups, dates, or a quick stop to enjoy some wine with friends.Unusual thing I noticed: They have a basket of apples near the hostess area.

5.0,11/26/2009,"We came here after trying to go to Carmina's on Thanksgiving Day and found out that we needed reservations.  I absolutely loved this place! The ambiance, the servers, the food and price was excellent! :) When we first got there, the place still had seats for 6 of us, but about half way through our meal, the restaurant was crowded with people! We ordered the Antipasto Caldo which came with baked steam clams, stuffed mushrooms, crispy shrimp, cheesy eggplant, and prosciutto. All of the items were delish and for such a deal of $8 per person! One of us got the sinfonia di pasta which came with an appetizer of the Antipasto Misto/Ceaser Salad and three types of unlimited pasta. I would recommend the Antipasto Misto which is a variety of veggies if you have a palette for sour stuff, otherwise stick with the salad! As for the pastas, you get to try 3 different types of pastas that they offer, the seafood one, the pumpkin ravioli and the tomato and basil pasta. I really liked the bacon in the seafood pasta which was pretty flavorful! The pumpkin ravioli was an interesting pasta which basically tasted like a pumpkin pie! The tomato pasta was ok, but not amazing. Good deal for $23/person. We also tried the sausage dish which comes with 2 large sausages and veggies for $20. This item can be shared with two people since the sausage itself is pretty big!

4.0,10/27/2009,"We wandered in here after a show one night, and they happily greeted my party, seated us in the upstairs dining room, and showered us with bread. I found it pretty difficult to put the foccacia down, but after seeing that they offer Unlimited Pasta, my attention shifted. Three kinds for $23.However, after careful consideration, I decided to, rather than overdose on carbs on one of my last remaining nights in nyc, opt for the pesce special. It was a beautifully grilled whole trout served with potatoes and wilted leeks, finished with a drizzle of olive oil and salt. Loved it.  A couple of the boys took advantage of the umlimited pasta. I didn't get to try it, but they thought it was 'aiite.' Around the table: rib eyes, rack of lamb, veal shanks, veal chops, and mounds of pasta.  Everything came with salad. It must of been close to 11:30pm when our food arrived. Midway though, we ordered another bottle wine, and that's when our server, in an attempt to size up the time remaining of our meal, asked about our day, cracked some jokes, and laughed at a few of ours. Alhough, I know what he really wanted was for us to get the fawk out, he was good company and didn't try to rush us. Even if, the only thing that could've possibly dampened that evening was the pounding rain outside. But did it......?P.s. An entire page on the wine menu dedicated to the $25 bottle.

4.0,10/26/2009,"Ended up here after a few out-of-town friends and I got hungry tromping Times Square... The interior is HUGE. At first, the hostess wanted to seat the three of us at a tiny table amidst a huge gathering of diners where we'd be unable to hear each other, have no room for food, and be jostled on every side by various body parts. I asked her to seat us somewhere ""quieter"". She helped us out, albeit sort of grudgingly. This fantastic Italian place on Restaurant Row has pretty much everything. They have a very famous pasta special where you get a caesar or antipasto salad followed by unlimited quantities of the chef's 3 signature pastas (spagetti, rigatoni and one other I can't remember) for $23. My friends and I chose off the menu. Our entrees included the house caesar salad but the kitchen ran out of romaine lettuce and so used mixed mesclun greens instead. It was still light and good. The bread basket included thin and crunchy bread sticks and two varieties of Italian bread. One was topped in a light and sharp cheese? They also give you a small bowl of dip for the bread which is some sort of creamy cheese and olive oil as well as a small bowel of a variety of olives.I had a seasonal special - Bistecca di Misto. Hangar steak on a bed of wheat polenta cooked with steamed root vegetables ($29). The meat was cooked perfectly, tender and excellently spiced. The polenta was almost a mash consistency which the vegetables adding a slight sweetness/muted crunch. My friend had the Pesce Spada ($25) Grilled swordfish paired with spaghetti squash, stewed cherry tomatoes, roasted pumpkin seeds & pumpkin seed oil. The swordfish absolutely melts in your mouth and the squash is very good but I wouldn't say the best pairing for the fish. My other friend had the tuna special encrusted with black peppar which was served on a bed of spinach ($28?) Also, excellent but the tuna steak was a little too thick to be served as only rare or med rare. We were all too stuffed to partake in any of their desserts but the food was overall wonderful. The service was courteous and prompt. The ambiance was homey (docile paintings on the walls, good lighting, walls of wine bottles/olive oils/pumpkins).

The antipasti platter was the highlight of the meal but the kudos stop there. Salad greens were wilted, like they had been left out for quite awhile. Dressings uninspiring. The pastas was average at best and the spaghetti was quite undercooked. More than al dente, it was ""al stiff-o."" Here's the rub: they bring the entrees out of the kitchen in saute pans and spoon onto the plate. Expecting hot entrees were were surprised this table side service produced lukewarm food at best! The stuff had been sitting around. Chicken was not seasoned well and we've had better seafood in chain restaurants.

You get three different kinds served to you and they are pretty delicious.Normally I'm really good about eating a moderate amount even if the portions are unlimited... but the buttery goodness of the stuffed pasta and the other pasta servings were too much to resist. The three pasta choices were linguine with clam sauce, swiss chard-stuffed ravioli with brown butter sauce, and thenpenne with some sort of tomato sauce (basil marinara?). All I can say is recalling from memory they were all good, with the stuffed pasta being the best. They allowed you to try a little of each so then i was able to decide which one I liked best and get more of that afterwards.Other good things were the appetizer. I had the antipasto Misto. This was very well done and was light and tasty (not too filling to spoil your appetite, but enough so you could wait for your food). I appreciated the generous serving of seafood provided.  My friends also took advantage of the extensive wine list of wines for $25 bucks.Besides pasta they had lots of other serving choices and some of my friends got the steak.

Another nice thing is, too, that you get a choice of three different pasta dishes as part of the deal. And if you're not up for that, you can always order off the menu. The wine menu is rather extensive and they're all $25 (unless you're ordering off the reserve list). However, there are barely any ways (unless you're completely literate in wine) to decide which kind to get other than light, medium, or well bodied and white or red. Can be overwhelming so we just asked our waitress to choose a medium-boded red and it was tasty, so that went well.What didn't go well was our reservation. True, this was a large party of 14 (for a friend's 40th birthday), but they did take the reservation which signals to me that they could accommodate us. We arrived at 7, which was the time of the reservation, but was kept waiting until 7:45 to be seated. The maitre d' was snarky with us after a while, which seemed really ridiculous as we were the ones kept waiting 45 minutes! They did try to compensate us for the wait by giving us a free round of Prosecco and some cured meats & cheese before we started our dinner.What I like about Becco is that there are a lot of options and the food is satisfying.

Near the theater district, I won't complain about the prices, since they really were not that bad (for New York, in a busy area...)But, really the food wasn't that great. I've had better chicken in a place that charges me 10 bucks for pretty much the same thing. My chicken was dry and really kind of gross and pretty tiny. My friend's salmon was huge, but equally dry and lackluster.I'll say the highlight of the meal was my wine and that bread basket with the yummy bread, breadsticks and olives and spread....YUM. But at almost 35$, I can't say I was impressed at all. The service was spotty at best, with a waiter that couldn't remember the specials, and actually FOUGHT with another waiter over tables and tips in plain sight of restaurant patrons. I was surprised that at an establishment with this much traffic that they would allow their waiters to do that ....bad etiquette, if you ask me.Meh was the reaction. I would have rather taken my 35$ and dropped it at the Halal Cart across the street from the Hilton!",4,3,3,Linda C.,"San Leandro, CA",143,441,1

4.0,8/14/2009,"We had a Sunday evening reservation (definitely recommended) and they placed us under a glass ceiling. It was a fantastic setting. After I realized that their ""$25 wine list"" was for the bottle, and the not the glass, I became a fan. If you see ""$$$"" know that most people do either get cocktails or a bottle of wine. I think our total bill for 2 people was $100, and it included two entrees, bottle of wine, dessert, taxes & tips. Not too shabby.As other reviewers mentioned, their pasta special was quite the deal. Egg fettucine - muah. Wonderful. Tomato basil was your consummate ""macaroni and gravy"" dish. The vegetarian cannelloni was also tasty. However, on our return, we will likely embark on other menu items (pork shank, veal, and lamb chops all looked amazing) just to do something different. Dessert, we had an amaretto custard that was tasty - but definitely enough for 4 to share! The portions here are quite generous.We were also fortunate enough to sit next to a very lovely NJ couple. We ended up staying at the restaurant for about 3 hours, mostly chatting it up with our friendly table-neighbors. This was a wonderful experience.

5.0,8/11/2009,"One word describes my experience at Becco: phenomenal. Becco was highly recommended to me by several people, and all aspects of my visit exceeded my high expectations. I came with a group of three with a reservation made last month just to be safe. I tried to get reservations on shorter notice a few times in the past, but they were all booked up--a good sign in my book. We were shown to a nice table next to the bar on the first floor. I don't normally consider sitting next to the bar to be a good thing, but as with so many other things, Becco is an exception. Everything about the interior is cozy yet formal, from the classic décor to the white-table-clothed drop leaf tables to the staff's dressy-casual attire and attitude. Sitting next to the bar, in what was probably the busiest part of the restaurant only brought out the good in all of this. Enough about the interior, though, Becco is first and foremost a restaurant, and restaurants serve food. Becco, in particular, serves the Sinfonia di Paste, unlimited portions of three daily special pastas preceded by a Caesar salad or assorted grilled vegetables and seafood. I ordered the salad, and it was miles above average. The croûtons stood out most. In my book, if your croûtons are clearly made daily from nice stale bread, you make good salads. But that's just the starter. The three pastas on my night at Becco were a beet and goat cheese ravioli with a brown sauce, a fusilli with veal bolognese, and spaghetti with tomatoes and fresh basil. I would have liked the ravioli to be a bit cheesier. It might have been the sauce, which was a bit flavor-dulling, but there was barely any detectable goat cheese. That said, the beetyness was delicious. The veal bolognese was delicious; just spicy enough to let you know what you're eating, but not enough to overpower the other flavors. The veal itself was as tender, succulent, and guilt-enduing as veal can be. The spaghetti was exactly what I was looking for that night: rich but not overpoweringly acidic tomato sauce with tender fresh pasta. In fact, all off the pastas tender and fresh. I don't know why I would expect anything but the freshest pasta from a place like Becco, but the thick, full-bodied spaghetti and fusilli were a pleasant surprise. My only regret is not trying desert, but who can blame me after unlimited pasta? I'll be returning to Becco soon and as frequently as my wallet permits.",0,0,0,Will H.,"Washington, DC",0,3,0

We all had a salad (the Caesar was great), the 3 kinds of unlimited pastas were soooo good, and a main course. I tried the swordfish, it was perfectly cooked. One of my friends had the lemon chicken, it was really tasty, and my other friend had the lamb. The lamb was exceptional, I've never had something that came close to it. It was absolutely great. I'm not a wine drinker so I can't comment on that. And the only reason that I didn't give them 5 stars was because the tables were a little too close together and it was a little loud in there so we sometimes had to repeat things to each other because we couldn't hear each other.

3.0,6/30/2009,"We were suckered in by the $25 wine list. Turns out the wines we saw on the online menu were switched out for the same makers but different vintages on the actual wine list. This changed our decision a bit but we were able to come up with a decent selection. The wine was good, a decent tasting easy-to-drink but not that great of a value. Before we sat down, we went to the bar because our table was not ready. The proseccos we bought were $12 each. I did not expect to pay that much for a glass of prosecco. Now for the food. I got the all-you-can-eat pasta. It was ok. I liked one of the 3 dishes more than the others -- the bowties with tomato and basil sauce. The spinach and ricotta ravioli was very oily and not that flavorful. The linguini with clam sauce was just okay as well. Other food we tried was the bowties with butter sauce which we liked. We also got the short ribs which were done well. The caesar salads were good. We got an appetizer which was mozzarella on thick toast. The toast was a little over toasted and the flavor overpowered the cheese -- but it was a decent appetizer. The cheese was very fresh and good. They also serve bread sticks and a bread basket with a ground chick peas and oil dipping sauce which we enjoyed. They have a dish of good olives -- green and black -- on the table as well.

2.0,6/19/2009,"So, I first came here as a bushy tailed tourist a couple years back. After a good experience, I decided to try it again with some friends from the perspective of a one-year seasoned new yorker. Wow, what a difference a year of new york cynicism and sublime restaurant experiences makes. We of course did the pre-fixe all you can eat pasta deal, which is truly an unbeatable price. But, perhaps the chef had quit before our order was placed that day or something, but the pasta was absolutely awful. So hard and uncooked it took a dente to whole new levels. The sauces were completely flavorless. So now for the good things, the wine we tried at $25 a bottle, excellent deal, was very very good. A rose that was unbelievably light on the tongue. The Caesar salad was also excellent, one of my favorites around. Finding a good Caesar is the hardest thing in the world. But, despite these up notes, the main courses just ruined everything. We did not ask for seconds on any of the dishes. Anyway, overall, I've had good experiences here before, so I am willing to give it a chance (and give 2 stars).

5.0,4/29/2009,"This is a restaurant that my bf has taken me to twice, he loves italian food and Lidia Bastianich, usually restaurants located on Restaurant Row have the reputation of being crappy since they mostly cater to the theatre crowd who usually rushes thru dinner to get to their show and more than likely will not be returning. We were lucky getting a same day reservation, it's actually a pretty sure bet if you try to get in after 9 o'clock after the dinner rush. It was still very packed when we got there but the service was prompt and very good.I can say that this is not the case at Becco. They start you off with a large selection of breads and breadsticks with olives and a type of a bean spread (hummus like consistency) drenched in olive oil and oh so yummy. Then you can go with the reserve wine list or the $25 dollar wine list, guess which one we went with. I couldn't even tell you any of the wines on the list, all I know is that we went for a medium bodied red towards the bottom of the list and it wasn't to bad at all. The hot antipasto is definitely worth a try even if it fills you up -- you get some stuffed mushrooms that are perfectly cooked and seasoned, baked stuffed clams that have a huge piece of bacon or proscuitto on it, a fried shrimp thing, and some really really good eggplant rollatini...my bf doesnt even like eggplant and he loved it. Their take on the ceasar salad I enjoyed, you could taste the anchovy in the dressing which might not work for everyone. Both times we went I got the unlimited pasta, they were both similar..this time around there was a penne vodka with shrimps (excellent), wild mushroom ravioli (excellent) and a green bean and pesto spaghetti (not so excellent). My bf got the osso bucco which was a giant lamb shank with the bone marrow breaded and stuffed back into the shank. At that point we were so stuffed it was starting to get painful, so what does he do but order some dessert of course! Last time we got the dessert sampler which was out of this world, this time we opted for something a bit lighter with the biscotti and capps...all in all it was a great experience and somewhat reasonable in price for everything that we got ($120 inc. tip for wine, app, entrees and dessert+coffee).",0,0,0,Angela M.,"Hutto, TX",518,615,1085

I understand a little bit, but I think the chef loaded it up a bit too much.  I went with my mom and her friend, and we actually all passed each others dishes around the table so we could each try everything.  One got a sausage special and it was great and my mom got the Zuppa served over a bed of polenta.  She loved everything except the polenta - I think because she's not used to getting those crazy intense flavors served over polenta - I think she likes it better with pasta.  Overall, everything I tried was delicious.Good atmosphere.Great food.Courteous, friendly and extremely knowledgeable staff.Will make sure you get to your show on time (huge help if you've been drinking bottles of $25 wine!!)I highly recommend!!!",1,0,1,Jenna W.,"New York, NY",75,137,8

The Osso Buco, the bottomless pasta, steaks are all very good. A whole wine list of under $24 wines? In New York? This is a great deal for good wines.

Add a bottle of the Bastianich Tocai Friulano for some equally-absurd low price, and relax as your bread basket (with focaccia, baguette, and breadsticks) arrives. For the theater district, I'd say that's pretty hard to beat.I feel like I'm potentially revealing some sort of ""secret"" of the no-res bar seating, but one should never hold back on the $6 caesar salad love.

4.0,1/20/2009,"""I've been here before"", is what I said as I approached the doors of Becco with my friend, Scott.  I've not had deja vu that strong in a long while.  My mind drifted back to a dinner meeting with a former client company, whose staff had treated my team to dinner at BECCO.  I remember the GRAPPA (oh, how I remember the GRAPPA) and the osso buco (fall off the bone tenderness) and the desserts....HOW THE HECK COULD I HAVE FORGOTTEN ABOUT THIS PLACE UNTIL NOW???Well, now, I will never forget.  I have it on my bookmarks on Yelp.My friend, Scott, and I felt like pampered royalty within the warm haven of Becco.  Our waiter was attentive and helpful.  He made great suggestions for wine and made certain that we were OUT THE DOOR by 1:30, so that we could make the matinee showing of ""Speed-the-Plow"".  In addition, complimentary coat check is a HUGE plus (especially w/the cold weather and my multiple layers and scarves)As for  the food....oh...the food.  I could GUSH on and on about what we ordered.  Yet, the best way to describe the food is flavorful and filling.  I must admit that this was my favorite restaurant to dine in during my short 2 day stay in NYC.  We ordered the following:1 app (burrata - a fresh Italian cheese, made from mozzarella and cream)2 entrees (osso buco and the sausage special)2 dessert sampler (DELICIOUS!!!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)1 glass of primitivo (paired well with the spicy sausage special)1 cappucino1 bottle of still water (kosher)1 iced teaThe bill total was about $103.50 (incl tax, but sans tip) and it was WORTH EVERY PENNY.The sausage was made in the restaurant and the osso buco was JUST as tender and well-spiced as I remember from several years ago.  In addition, the desserts...OMG, the desserts were little slices of perfection.  There was just the right amount to fill us up, but not make us overly weighed down by sugar or carbs.  In fact, the post-digestive slump that I normally have after a heavy meal did not raise its ugly head at all during our time in the theater post-meal.  As others have raved, the wine is very reasonably priced.  There is a great selection of Italian wines and if you don't know what to choose, ASK FOR HELP.  The staff are always eager to offer assistance in your selection process.  The pasta trio was also a big hit with other diners on the afternoon when we were there. So, if you are in town to watch a show, but want a very upbeat, upscale atmosphere and lively and courteous service, please stop at Becco, you'll be sooooooo.... glad that you did!",3,0,2,Hiromi N.,"San Francisco, CA",496,1009,210

3.0,1/13/2009,"Stopped at Becco with a gal pal beforea  show for dinner. Everything there was pretty much fine. Pasta was fine. Food was fine. Service was fine. The only thing that people seemed upset with was the little area between the outside and the restaurant where you check your coats. They have this ""only one door can be open"" policy that keeps people either waiting in the restaurant, stuck in the little coat room area, or waiting outside to get in. I will say if you do get the pasta special, if you want more pasta, have no fear asking for more! They stop by many many times to ask if you want more. I feel like Becco has the right idea. The Olive Garden....they make you ask for your never ending pasta bowl...and then you feel greedy or fat. So, great option for a 3 pasta sampling that is never ending! Plus, if you like olives, you get a small bowl with your bread at the beginning of the meal.So, Becco will be a solid choice for dinner.

I didn't mind too much, since we came in ten minutes before closing.I have never been particularly overwhelmed by the service. It can also get pretty crowded and noisy, especially the before theatre crowd. If you have to wait for a table there is usually not any room to stand inside without getting bumped into. The bartenders tend to be a bit surly at times as well (no place to sit at the bar, just have to stand dodging people while you wait).  I guess I would be surly too dealing with all the tourists day in and day out.

As more people showed up, you could tell we all wanted to have a drink but there was no place to go with some of the patrons having to go and wait outside.The place seems to be small from the outside but once inside and your name gets called, the place is a maze... we got to sit in the very back room.  A nice, cozy two person table (and by cozy, I mean, very close to the patrons seated next to you) where the waiter had a hard time putting down the bread basket, juggling and moving  the water and wine glasses around to make room for it.  The bread was fab!  Very soft focaccia bread as well as the baguette; served with olives and some kind of spread which was superb!We were handed our menus and if you like wine, here is the deal...They do have a list of wine bottles for $25.  We decided to order two wine glasses of the Montepulciano Italian red wine and each glass costs $11.  Two glasses of wine plus $3 would buy the whole bottle, so be aware of that.  Since we were going to the show afterward, we decided to just go for the glasses as we wanted to be semi-conscious throughout the performance.As I was not as hungry, I just ordered the ""Sarme"" which is classic meat stuffed cabbage braised in tomato sauce with crispy spaetzle.  My friend went for their famous 'never ending' price-fix pasta dinner (classic caesar salad with 3 different pasta choices).  The choices of pasta change from day to day and tonight it was the gnocchi, spaghetti in red sauce and pesto rigatoni.  The server was nice enough to give me salad as well as he did not want me to just sit there while my friend ate his... at no charge... nice touch!The salad came out promptly but our main course did not.  It took a while, at least 15 minutes, before the meal came... which most of the time I would not complaint but, since we did tell the server that we were going to a show, we were concerned about time.  Nicely enough, the waiters would not serve my friend till I got my meal.  Once it arrived, the ""Sarme"" was delicious!  I ate the whole thing!  However, after living in Europe for so many years, I know what spatzle is... and it was nothing like what I got...  eatable, but not truly spatzle.... darn!  I was looking forward to that part of the dish more than anything!  The never ending pasta was very good too.  The gnocchi was delicious.  I am always weary of ordering gnocchi as it is very easy to overcook it or destroy it...  but this one was cooked to perfection. The pesto pasta was yummy too!  The people next to us ordered the meatballs appetizers (3 huge ones too!) with their price fix and they pour it all over their spaghetti.  That is a great idea and will do the same next time.  The Final Verdict:Restaurant Ambiance/Decor:  5.0 out of 5.0Staff Service/friendliness :  4.5 out of 5.0Seating Arrangement/Layout:  3.0 out of 5.0Seating Comfort:  4.5 out of 5.0Alcohol/Wine Taste:  5.0 out of 5.0Alcohol/Wine Price Value:  4.0 out of 5.0Food Quality/Flavor:  5.0 out of 5.0Food Price Value:  5.0 out of 5.0Bathrooms Cleanliness:  4.5 out of 5.0Overall Price Value:  4.5 out of 5.0Final Score:  45 out of 50  (90 out of 100% or A- grade)Final Comment:  A great Italian restaurant where reservations are highly recommended to avoid waiting in a very uncomfortable bar setting.  Once seated, the food is fantastic and wine selection superb!  Price-fix menu is a great deal.  Be aware that you will be ""cozy"" with other people around you.  For the location (Restaurant Row) the place is great and I highly recommend it.",7,1,6,raul z.,"Huntington, NY",504,306,70

(let it be said, i am not fan of the olive garden.) so for the food - i give three stars.  they offer infused grappa's which they produce on site. (i am always a fan of booze infusions) so, our table shared 2 flights. of the six, some were better than others... which was to be expected.but, they offered us spoons to eat the fruit from the bottom of the glass - which in my experience is a huge faux pas - but since i *knew better* than to eat the fruit (cause all the fruit flavor has now been infused in the alcohol)... sadly, my friends at the table learned that lesson the hard way. i wanted to give an extra star for the grappa offerin's - but now that i think about that encouraging folks who don't know any better to eat the fruit - my good heart just won't let me. a good deal if you want to stuff yourself with decent food for very little money. not great if you are looking for the some of the best italian fare to ever hit those tastebuds.",1,0,0,Nik N.,"Oakland, CA",115,343,82

5.0,7/21/2008,"We loved it so much that we ate here twice on our recent NYC trip.  Although it's a little cramped (more so in the bar area than in the back room), the atmosphere is still great and the staff have the knack for stepping out of your way as you approach so you can easily pass them.  The service was very good.  Very attentive but never intrusive.   Our server was more than happy to accomodate my request for a completely vegan entree.  You'll get the feeling that everyone, from the servers to the managers, really wants you to enjoy your meal here.  We thought it was a great touch that the managers offered a complimentary glass of prosecco to a group who had reservations but still had to wait because their table wasn't ready.At my request, the bartender let my mom try two different types of  wine and then on his own, went someplace else in the restaurant to get a third wine which he thought she might enjoy better.  All this while he was single-handedly serving the entire bar.  He couldn't have been any nicer or more helpful.Food was excellent.  My mom liked her caesar salad but thought the antipasto plate rocked.  She loved the famous $22.95 all you can eat pasta, which is served to you faster than you can eat it - you'll have to stop the servers from continually refilling your plate.   But even if it wasn't an all you can eat deal, getting even just one plate of that pasta for $22.95 is great.  I thought the vegetable plate was delicious enough to get it twice.  The wild mushrooms were my favorite.We both had gelato/sorbet for dessert and they were WONDERFUL.  I had mint chocolate chip, chocolate and blood orange sorbet and all were so good I couldn't pick my favorite.",2,0,1,A W.,"Austin, TX",0,34,7
3.0,7/17/2008,"Went here with a large group (14) for a recent work dinner. I thought the service was generally good and the food decent. For a theatre district place they seemed to have a good number of locals dining there. The 22.95 all you can eat of three different pasta preparations seems like a good deal. I had a very nicely done salmon - skinless, and crisped on one side while still cooked just through (the way I like it) in the middle). The apple struedel cinnamon taste was too strong for me and so I didn't love the dessert. The Valpolicella was decent and the 25/bottle wine list offered some good options for every pallette. Moving through the restaurant felt cramped and crowded, but once you were at your table you had enough room. I would go back there for the budget-conscious aspects.",2,0,1,Jonathan F.,"Zionsville, IN",52,35,0
4.0,7/17/2008,"""All You Can Eat Pasta"" instantly brings a few things to my mind. The Simpsons episode where Homer sued the restaurant since it was not actually all he could eat is one of those thoughts. The other is: What if I'm the only one still hungry after everyone else is done? I don't want to the ""that girl"" being the fattie. And finally: this sounds like a reasonable place to host a birthday party. So we made a reservation for 10, about a month ahead of time, and were on our way.Clearly 2/3 of the restaurant was on the same wavelength as me, at least with the last thought.  In between ""Happy Birthday to....YAY!"" surrounding us, we decided on: a bottle of red, a bottle of white (all Italian wines priced cheaply at $25), salad, and the pasta special for the table.The bread was delicious as were the bread sticks and fresh olives.  Next came the salad.  Most of us opted for Balsamic Vinegar instead of Cesar dressing, as if paired with the amount of pasta we were to consume the calorie difference would even make a difference?  But Holy Hell, this balsamic  was amazing. It was the best I've ever had. Since then, we've tracked it down at Williams and Sonoma and it was priced at over $50.  We only break it out for special occasions.The pastas are different every night, so if you get your panties in a bunch when it comes to surprises, stick to the entrees.  I'm sure someone else will let you have some of their pasta.  As for me, I was in my glory with solely the carbs. The waiters come around with pasta in huge skillets and give you heaping portions. My eyes were way bigger than my stomach and I could only do a second portion and barely finished that. Good place to come before a big run the next day!In the spirit of sampling, we got three dessert samplers for ten people: totally served it's purpose.  While our stomachs and our wallets appreciated the experience, we agreed we wouldn't come back.  Just because we already have a favorite family-style Italian restaurant for tourists (shh...Carmine's) and why mess with a good thing?",11,9,8,Nic B.,"Miami Beach, FL",320,516,60
3.0,7/10/2008,"It's strange that their dinner reservations are booked up to a month in advance, but that the place is nearly empty for lunch. I guess that worked to our advantage though, because I was able to get reservations the day before without a problem. There was nothing particularly stand-out about our experience (although my mom's chicken dish was pretty good and my dad's steak was bigger than his face), but it was an enjoyable meal nonetheless. I was a little disappointed in the daily pastas, though. The rigatoni was undercooked, there was nothing special about the spaghetti with tomato sauce and basil, and the roasted beet and goat cheese filled ravioli were mediocre. I guess a prix-fixe menu of an appetizer and unlimited servings of the three daily pastas for $17.95 (for lunch) is a good deal, though, and that is Becco's saving grace.",2,0,1,Minji K.,"New York, NY",92,221,52

5.0,6/19/2008,"I like to think of myself as something of a Becco aficionado: boyfriend and I have eaten here at least 10 times over the past couple years.  Every time, we have ordered the exact same thing: the all you can eat pasta special.  Little touches make a big difference to me, and very strongly affect the way I feel about my dining experience.  One of the things that I always notice is the quality of the bread a restaurant serves before the meal.  Stale, burnt, or dry offerings don't necessarily ruin my dinner, but they often foment extreme annoyance.  The bread at Becco is excellent, as are the breadsticks, and the white bean spread with olive oil that the bread comes with is superior.  Also, they serve you a dish of gourmet olives with the bread.  Bellissima!The pasta special consists of two courses: a choice of Caesar salad or antipasto to start, and then all you want of the three pastas of the day, which the servers bring 'round to you in enormous skillets and heap on your waiting plate.  On its worst nights, the fare is solid and satisfying. On its best, it's inspired.  These dishes aren't haute cuisine; they're just simple, delicious, and always made of fresh ingredients.  I think my dream line-up would be the linguini with clams, spaghetti with shrimp, and pumpkin ravioli.  The portions are super-generous, and the efficient, well-trained waiters return frequently to tempt you with seconds.  This means that you will not have room for dessert (in fact, boyfriend and I have never ordered dessert here!)  A wine list of $25 bottles of really good, unpretentious wine makes Becco an absolute hit (with boyfriend and me, at least).It is true that you get a great deal of food and wine for your money.  Let me stress, though, lest you think me some sort of cuisine size queen, that the reason to go to Becco is not the enormous portion sizes (although it is refreshing to get good value for your money in New York).  It is the outstandingly high quality of the food being served.",2,1,2,Emilie G.,"Astoria, NY",7,19,0

For $9 more, you can also get their entree w/ the pasta. So now its up to you to decide whether you wanna save money and just stuff your face silly w/ pasta, or add $9 and get an entree as well. I decided with only the pasta, and that's a big mistake, cuz 2 of my friends got only the entree, and I tried their dishes and was still drooling, hating myself for not getting an entree instead.Here's the pasta that I had that day.-Clams w/ Linguine (a few clams per serving, too salty and oily)-Homemade farfalle w/ tomato sauce (farfalle tasted al dente, tomato sauce taste like they are canned)-Cheese & spinach ravioli (delicious!)My friend's dishes-Black Angus Ribeye @ med. well (so delcious, soft, and juicy, I didn't think they can make taste so good cooked at med. well)-grilled Scallops dish (The scallops were tender and juicy, not match by many places)Reminder to self: Get the entree unless I'm really hungry.

The restaurant was so much larger than I expected, probably because I couldn't believe that a restaurant of this size could always be booked...but as the tables started to fill up during the lunch hour, I realized that Becco is as popular as the reservationists say.  My friend and I opted to share a bottle of wine for $25, which was a steal since if you try to buy by the glass, each glass is $10.  We ordered the famous pre-fixe luncheon, which includes a choice of Caesar salad or Antipasta, and unlimited pastas of the day (three different pastas are prepared each day).   The pastas that day were a delicious rigatoni with beef sauce, a fantastic mushroom ravioli in truffle sauce, and a spaghetti.  I did help myself to more than one portion of each type of pasta...it was all so good, and for just $16.95!  My friend and I did share a dessert to finish off the meal...we got the apple crisp special that was very tasty.  Overall the service was great, the food was yummy and filling, and the meal was enjoyable!",5,0,3,Krista J.,"Brooklyn, NY",749,1181,35

5.0,10/13/2007,"I use reviews all the time, but never seem to find time to write one. So I had a little time his am after a great dinner last night - walla my review.  My wife and I ended up here after seeing phantom at the majestic. They seated us quickly - without reservations. It was quite busy so the initial service was a bit slow. But the homemade bread, olives, and white canolii bean hummus made for a delicious pre-appetizer. However what I really loved right off the bat was an extensive wine list for a pre-fix $25 bottle.  Many recognizable choices of good value $12-$16 bottles for $25 in a NYC restaurant! We got the Costomolina, a favorite Italian white of mine. Started with the Asparagus potato soup - yum. Entrees were hanger steak (melt in your mouth tender - can't remember ever having one that good)  and Osso Bucco. The Osso Bucco was quite good - not the best I've ever had but enough to classify it on the top end of the scale. One glitch - well 2 actually. I happen to be quite intolerant to cows milk (serious enough to be close to allergic). While the waiter was quite attentive, the wait staff delivered the ""standard"" OB which has a side prepared with cheese. I had to sent it back, and the wait for the new dish was a bit lengthy (everything made to order). Same happened on the dessert. I ordered the sorbet, and the wait staff delivered gelato instead, insisting that it was sorbet. A quick discussion with the mgr corrected that as well - and i soon had a wonderful treat of three homemade sorbets that were out of this world. The concord grape was spectacular - tart and bursting with intense grape flavor. The blood orange was nicely bitter, and the raspberry smooth and sweet. What a treat. I joked with the waiter about whether they were trying to knock me off... and he was very gracious. Brought us some ""on-the house"" extraordinary Grappa - including a home made fig grappa reminiscent of tawny port, as well as a wonderful Italian red semi-sec bubbly for my wife. We sat and chatted with he and the manager until well after close. All in all an extraordinary experience at a restaurant. I travel the world and regularly eat at above average place (on expense account ;-). This was worth every penny of my own money.

1.0,9/17/2007,"Sorry to say, though the ambiance has been improved, not much else has remained the same. I had not been to Becco in several years. A recent evening excursion in the neighborhood inspired me to check it out again. The good---the antipasto and Caesar salad,  the cheery room and the interesting $25 bottle list are terrific. The bad: a clueless waiter who disappeared rapidly after being told we had a time line (BEFORE the dining room filled with evening rush patrons), a 20 minute wait for the bottle of wine we ordered (it arrived AFTER our appetizer was half finished), TASTELESS!!!, overcooked entrees. Needless to say, once our food arrived, we never saw the waiter again, and had to flag him down so that we were on time for our meeting. The final straw: the bill. It itemized our order correctly, but  was accompanied by a credit slip for $20 more than the itemized receipt followed by open tip line. Sadly, Becco seems to be on the slide and has joined the fray for the tourist dollar. Not so good when real New Yorkers are among the throng.

On the back of your food menu you'll find numerous bottles all priced at $25 each. If you aren't that familiar with wines from Italy this offers a great opportunity to try something new without spending a lot of money. But, if you can't find what your looking for on that list, or you're in the mood for a little higher quality, then ask to see the extended list, which offers considerably more Italian wines still at reasonable prices.When deciding on your wine selection however, don't expect too much assistance from the wait staff, most of which are unable to effectively communicate about the list. Instead, ask for one of the friendly bartenders or a manager if you have a question. They should be able to offer more input on the various wine options and help you select a wine to your liking.

4.0,8/14/2007,"I was worried based on the lack-luster reviews here that I'd be in for a pricey disappointment when I headed to Becco last week for a friend's birthday dinner. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised by just how lovely a meal we enjoyed. Number one, the service was stellar--really above and beyond in my opinion. We were a large party and when one more person showed up who we had not anticipated, they coolly and quickly shuttled us to another table without so much as batting (or rolling) an eye. The wait staff was courteous and thorough throughout the meal, despite our size and ever-so-slightly rowdy behavior (c'mon, if you're out to dinner with 8 of your friends from high school, tell me you're not going to be boisterous!). That said, everyone from the hostess to the bus-people were wonderfully nice to us.Number two, the food was wonderful, or at least mine was--I ordered the least expensive entree on the menu ($19), eschewing the unlimited pasta ''deal'' for something I felt I was less likely to cook for myself--the ground-meat-stuffed peppers with gnocchi. It was delicious! Reminiscent of a dish that my dad used to prepare before my palate was developed enough to really love it, the Becco version had the nostalgia factor working for it in my case, but was otherwise just wonderfully executed. I loved loved loved the sauce and the portion was just right too--big enough to leave me quite full, not so big that I was saddled with a potentially-messy doggie bag to schlep home with me. Also enjoyed the $25 wine list and picked out a nice bottle of montelpulciano (yes, this is my new favorite kind of wine) for a few of us to share--I received kudos on the choice from my fellow winos. And, let's not forget the really stellar bread basket that was kept full throughout the meal, accompanied by white-bean-and-garlic spread (it was fun to show off my foodie side to my friends--""it's like hummus' Italian cousin!) and a nice array of olives (the bright bright green ones were so lovely looking, I had to taste them even though I'm not really an olive fan). To speak for the rest of my friends-since-high-school gang, I'd have to say that our dinner at Becco was definitely a step up from our usual level of dining, but not one that we'd be hesitant to take again.

4.0,5/13/2007,"Becco is one of those restaurants along Restaurant Row that offer Italian specialties at pre-fixed theater prices.  When considering the options, price, and food, this place has a lot more to offer than most people think.First and foremost, request a reservation.  The line builds up so quickly that a crowd of people will gather as tourists and locals in the area will pile in itching for Italian good enough to be considered home cooked.  I've noticed the occasional celebrity here and there, I even remember one who was upset because he had not put himself on the  reservation and was subject to a near 30 minute wait. Like some other Italian places nearby, the food can occasionally be salt and a bit overdone.  The bread basket starter is solid, consisting of bread sticks, olives, and rustic bread easily confused for plain wheat multigrain, till you try ripping that sucker apart.  The ""Sinfonia Di Pasta"" is their hands down winner, as its an unlimited selection of their 3 house pastas for only $16.95 for lunch and $21.95 for dinner.  Make sure you call ahead of time to figure out what the 3 pastas are so there are no surprises for later.  So far, the spinach ravioli in 3 cheese sauce and linguine in clam sauce have been my overwhelming favorites.  Ordering a la carte is fine as well, the bread and butter of the business is their assortment of fine pastas and cheap wine deal combination deals.Service here has been fantastic, with exception to the host / hostess at the door.  If your name isn't on the reservations list, an occasional snotty look is bound to happen.  Some folks during the winter time take advantage of the complimentary coat check, but ""free"" it certainly isn't as the coat check folks expect a tip.  The wait staff, majority of which are Mexican but speaking bits of Italian here and there, are fantastic.  They've been courteous, polite, and knowledgeable during each visit.",14,4,7,Jando S.,"Queens, NY",2723,3529,17072
3.0,4/9/2007,"Decided to check out Becco through some Chowhound research on  Midtown restaurants...turns out that this Theater District restaurant is one of Lidia Bastianich's restaurants (she has a couple of PBS shows, most famous being ""Lidia's Italian-American Kitchen""). With that in mind, I was fearful that we had fallen into a tourist trap...well, let's just say it wasn't Olive Garden, but it wasn't a Batali restaurant either. The starter basket of rustic breads, thin parmasean breadsticks, olives (I learned of a new favorite olive - Italian butter olives!), and white bean spread were satisfying and staved off the hunger pangs til the main event. Were it not lunchtime, we probably would have taken advantage of the great deal on bottles of wine - a whole page of wine varietals all for $25. Reviewers have raved about the Sinfonia di Pasta special, which is $16.95/lunch and $21.95/dinner. You have a choice between Caesar Salad or an Italian antipasto platter and an unlimited serving of three of their pasta dishes (which they choose). I went with the Italian antipasto platter, which consisted of a single piece of a number of roasted vegetables, a little bowl of seafood salad (mostly squid, onions, tomatoes, with vinegar), and some catfish mousse w/ bread. A lot of variety going on, but disappointing in flavor and temperature (the roasted veggies were cold). Moving on to the pasta selection - servers come around to give you a hearty portion of three pastas, in this case a striated spaghetti arrabiata w/ calamari, pappardelle w/ broccoli rabe, and mushroom ravioli in a white sauce. This part of the meal was seriously Olive Gardenish...salty and overwhelmingly underwhelming. Arrabiata is supposed to be spicy! None of the pasta was homemade, which is preferable for good Italian dining. And goddamn, that was a lot of pasta. I cannot imagine ever being able to eat the whole plateful and then wanting a second helping. I guess that this is part of the greedy American consumerist side of the Italian-American concept.The other order was for the Contorni platter, the sole vegetarian meal option which consisted of roasted mushrooms, broccoli rabe, garlic mashed potatoes, roasted root vegetables, and polenta.  Can you believe that I actually enjoyed this much more than the Sinfonia? Hrmph.The service was quite good, probably in part because of the lack of patrons due to the pouring rain. The complimentary coat check was invaluable in such a circumstance...the restaurant itself is spacious (always a plus in NYC!), but it feels a bit like eating in someone's basement or cellar. Overall, it was only slightly above mediocre - though I'd definitely head here over Olive Garden. Unless I felt like unlimited soup and salad.",4,3,5,Steph P.,"Saint Paul, MN",264,290,146
3.0,3/21/2007,"Nestled in 'restaurant row' among 5,000 or so mainly generic restaurants, Becco seems to have made a name for itself (at least among Yelpers) for its Sinfonia di Pasta special which includes a bottomless plate of three special pastas and either a caesar salad or a mixed antipasto dish for $16.95/lunch and $21.95/dinner.I tried it for lunch yesterday.  The front area was somewhat dark and generic but we were soon led back to a large back area that was well-lit by two sky-roofs.  Quite pleasant and relaxing.The table was started off with some rustic bread and a wonderful red pepper spread.  I chose the antipasto dish which was somewhat disappointing as I thought it was mainly seafood but was mainly vegetables.  I'd probably get the caesar salad if I came again.Once the antipasto course was done, the pastas came one after another.  The three pastas were a penne w/ broccoli rabe in an olive oil-based sauce, a papparadella (broad noodle) in a tomato-based sauce, and a thick meaty lasagna-like pasta in bechamel sauce.  All were good but I didn't feel compelled to get a second round of any of the three.We finished off with an assorted dessert dish that had no standouts and good coffee.I can't say I came out of this restaurant with nearly the impression of others.  I quite liked the setting, the great roasted pepper spread, and the general thought of trying three pastas for lunch (even though it feels kinda Olive Garden-y).  But, in practice, it's a heavy meal and only pays off in my eyes if the pastas are fantastic (and they weren't this first visit...)",5,0,4,Scott R.,"Austin, TX",309,784,12

1.0,12/31/2006,"We arrived at 3:15 on Thursday afternoon, Dec. 29, 2006. Two young men were at the front register and one rudely said we are closed, we open at  5:00. The place was packed and there was no excuse for his behavior. Never go again, especially if this is the way they treat their patrons. Shame on you!My two teenage daughters were appalled, needless to say we walked 18 blocks to get there.",0,0,1,doreen j.,"NJ, NJ",0,3,0
5.0,12/18/2006,"My boss took me here last year for a birthday lunch. After about 6 plates of delicious pasta and a couple glasses of wine I went back to my office, closed my door and passed out on my desk. Needless to say, it was a great day. My tip: try to starve yourself before coming. Aim for at least 10 hours, if not 24.",1,0,1,Erica Jade L.,"New York, NY",26,262,1
5.0,10/23/2006,"Why 5 stars?The food is amazing and affordable for the area, especially if you know what to order. I had the special appetizer last time I went and holy lord was it delicious; fresh buffala mozzarella with orange and yellow tomatoes in a balsamic vinegar and olive oil mixture was to die for... it defied the shackles of it's caprese salad title. Also amazing? The staff. From the waiters to the bussers to the bartender and the owner, this place has a staff that knows how to take care of one another. Full hands in, full hands out is definitely a motto that they live by at Becco and it shows, translating into outstanding customer service and a great, relaxing atmosphere for patrons. Helpful hint for all of you not from NY: don't head out to Becco right before the theatre - it's going to be swamped. Head over during the shows or well after to ensure you have plenty of time for dinner and conversation.",2,1,2,Lindsay D.,"Roslindale, Boston, MA",159,395,5

3.0,8/20/2006,"Even though we walked in at 6:00 p.m. on a Saturday night with no reservation, they seated two of us at a table for 5 (the rest of our party was not there yet).  Then they proceeded to feed us to the nines with bread which I felt was very good, but also very salty.  Beware!  I ordered this assortment of three pastas, but honestly I was not too hungry after eating all the bread, and the pasta was also a little too salty for my taste.",1,0,2,Joanna S.,"San Francisco, CA",66,393,0
4.0,8/14/2006,"The pastas here are very good - so is the bread. We got here before the rest of our party, and were still seated (at 6:30 on a Saturday night), so we chowed down on the bread. The breadsticks were pretty amazing, as were the other two breads in the basket. The spread that it came with was also pretty good.We ordered the pasta, which came with a salad (not amazing), and three types of all-you-can-eat pasta. Servers come to your table with plates of pasta, and serve you until you can't eat any more. The penne was very good, as was the ravioli. I thought that the spaghetti with broccoli was a bit salty, although it wasn't bad. It was all you can eat, but truth be told, we weren't terribly hungry by the time that the pasta arrived.The service was good - I would give the wait staff a big thumbs up.",2,0,1,Dana L.,"San Francisco, CA",441,541,4
4.0,8/14/2006,I've been a few times and I can't tear myself away from ordering the all you can eat pasta trio!  The pastas are fresh and have a good rotation as not bore you with the same ones everytime.  Will have to try the other items on the menu one day!,1,0,1,Scott C.,"Floral Park, NY",16,112,0

4.0,4/11/2006,"I had the three kinds of endless pasta, which was very good, but I was  eyeing someone's osso buco across the room. Next time I'll have to resist my carb urges and order something off the menu. The problem with the pasta special is that you get filled up so quickly, since it's so heavy. We went for a pre-theater meal, and the staff here is very efficient about getting you fed and out of there on time. My only complaint is the tight seating -- this other couple was practically sitting in our laps and we all had to work hard to pretend we couldn't hear each others' conversations. Oh well. It's New York.",0,1,0,Anita C.,"New York, NY",12,66,0
4.0,3/12/2006,I had a great time at Becco. I went here on a date and it was a wonderful evening. The service was attentive and the decor was warm and inviting. I had the pasta tasting dish which gives you unlimited amounts of the 3 specialty pastas of the day. My favorite were the cocoa pumpkin ravioli. Delicious!,2,0,0,Christina C.,"New York, NY",337,100,7
5.0,2/26/2006,"Everything about Becco is excellent. The food, the service, the hosts, the location... you name it... they've done it right. I have become a regular there over the years and every visit brings with it great memories. I've actually closed the place out a few times friends and never felt rushed to leave. Prices are great and you have to check out their $25 wine list! This place is a must for dinner, lunch.. and make it a place that you come back to often.",1,0,0,Hector L.,"Redmond, WA",42,82,30
5.0,1/31/2006,"I'm perpetually amazed by the food at Becco.  The cuisine is delicious and a relative bargain for the size of the portions.  The Ossobuco reminds you why you can't eat it every day even if you want to, and the pork chop is so good you'd eat Arnold from Green Acres.  But the king high potentate of the menu is the Sinfonia di Pasta.  A bottomless plate of three perniciously good pastas.  Enough to make Dr. Atkins recant his evil ways.  What's more, the wine selection is spectacular (with an extensive list in the $25 range) and the waitstaff charming and informed.  Becco rules The Row.",3,2,1,Gabriel S.,"Santa Monica, CA",222,77,5
4.0,1/13/2006,"Since we were a fairly large party, we were recommended the family-style type menu, which included a Ceasar salad, fresh vegetables, unlimited portion of pasta and then steak, chicken and fish (swordfish) as the main entrees. Then for dessert, which was also included in this deal, we had an assortment of all the desserts that are offered. Everything we had was absolutely great. I have been to Becco several times and I have not been disappointed yet. This is definitely a great choice for dinner. The one item I will comment about is the noise. It is usually very loud and sometimes it is a little difficult to hear the waiter, but we just asked him to repeat and we were fine.",0,0,0,Steve M.,"New Hyde Park, NY",3,528,0
5.0,1/12/2006,"one of the most authentic italian restaurants in nyc is becco...i came here during lunch one day and was pleased with the selection and prices...its still not cheap, but reasonably priced for what you get...i had the pasta sampler, which i would recommend because its hard to choose just one...you can even request to make it all vegetarian  friendly if youd like...the waitstaff is very nice and i was hoping to meet Lidia in the flesh (wishful thinking on my part), but that didnt happen...im not sure what her other restaurants are like, but im sure its all just as spectacular!",1,0,1,Anthro Food E.,"San Francisco, CA",46,421,2

4.0,11/29/2005,"My girlfriend and I went to Becco a couple months ago. We are originally from the Kansas City area where our favorite place to dine out was Lidias of Kansas City. This is another one of the 4 restauraunts that Lidia Bastianich owns and runs. (She is the short little Itallian lady you may sometimes see cooking on PBS) I found several items on the menu to be very similar to the KC location which I was happy to see. The bread which comes along with your water after you place your order is great, several different kinds at least one of which you will love. The calamari is great as a starter. The pasta sampler is also great and not a bad value. The chicken parm and also the lemon chicken get an A+. I have never had any room left for the dessert.",0,0,1,Joseph G.,"Little Neck, NY",2,182,0
5.0,10/24/2005,"Co-owned by Lidia Bastianich, whose PBS cooking show features her preparing Italian favorites in her own kitchen with family members, this is one of many dining spots scattered along that stretch of 46th Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues aptly christened Restaurant Row. For those not counting carbs, the big draw here is the Sinfonia di Pasta - your choice of a Caeser salad or a seafood antipasto (the better option) is followed by unlimited portions of the three daily pasta preparations for only $21.95. The menu also includes a variety of chicken, veal, pork, and fish dishes. Service is warm and very attentive.",7,0,7,Gourmet G.,"San Francisco, CA",99,2099,2099
5.0,5/25/2005,"This is one of the most amazing places in NYC, and we all know how hard that can be. It's a nice restaurant for a reasonable price point. I think entrees are around $20-$30... What you have to go for is the all you can eat pasta. It's creative homemade pasta, 3 types are served and you just keep going. The service is incredible, so is the coffee, dessert, setting. It's a damn shame I haven't been here more than once.",0,0,0,Jean W.,"San Francisco, CA",303,197,69
