4.0,4/27/2019,"Tavern on the Green is worth experiencing, but be prepared to overpay for what you get. The atmosphere is outstanding. I've eaten both inside and outside, both were good, but there was little shade and no umbrellas outside. Aside from the ambiance, the rest of the experience here has been less than stellar. Both times service was fairly slow and took several tries to get servers attention. Food is ok, maybe even good, but not worth the price they charge. Drinks are also very good.",0,0,0,Molly P.,"Flushing, NY",0,31,0

1.0,4/22/2019,"FYI. My 10-year old daughter wrote this review. THIS ISN'T EVEN WORTH ONE STAR!!!! WE PAID $125 FOR EACH PERSON FOR EASTER LUNCH. It was quite the experience. The napkins felt like SANDPAPER. It was not fun to feel sandpaper rubbing against your legs throughout a meal. The menu said that they would start you off with a basket of pastries. Seems nice right? NOPE! The menu specifically said WARMED pastries. When we got them they were EXTREMELY COLD. The actual pastries also weren't good. They were all from a random supermarket. The croissants were not even a tad bit flaky. Being flaky is a croissant's whole purpose!!!! The first course was OKAY. It had a very bland pea soup. Some could even say it tasted like baby food. The presentation for the soup was a HOT MESS. The flatbread sounded interesting. It was bread with chunks of fig and they smacked arugula on top. The best first course meal was the smoked salmon but you can buy that in any supermarket. For the main course some people ordered french toast that was cooked without eggs and came from a frozen package in a sketchy supermarket. it was also DROWNED in whipped cream. The lamb looked like it was boiled. The salmon was OK. Even the coffee was stale according to the people who had it. The spinach on the egg benedict was frozen. You could tell it was from a package. Everything was cold. The creme brûlée had coconut in it and pineapple on the top that everyone scraped off. The olive oil cake looked like a twinkie that dried out a bajillion years ago. It wasn't even as good as a twinkie. The chocolate mousse was ok. But it was not made there, they bought it. I am 10 years old and I will never go back here in the rest of my years of life.",2,2,0,Shakil A.,"Washington, DC",0,5,0

5.0,4/16/2019,"We did a lot of exploring this trip to NY and I would have to rank this as one of my favorite places we ate during our stay.If you have never been in the area, or just want to do some exploring, unrelated to Tavern on the Green. I would recommend taking a walk through Central Park (especially if it isn't February and under 40 degrees). From the outside, the look and feel is very inviting and as soon as the doorman opens the door and lets you in, you walk into an elegant setting. Advice, make sure you call ahead and make reservations because they book up fast. Sunday Brunch couldn't be at a better location. Both of us noticed one app in particular....the Maple Brown Sugar Glazed Bacon --- let's leave it at ---- LIFE ALTERING! Thick, cooked to crispy perfection, it comes dangerously close to ruining all other forms of bacon.Main dish, I had to go with one of my fall back classics (especially since I saved a piece of bacon to accompany my order - The Cheeseburger. Orders were up in about 20 minutes and didn't disappoint! My burger was just the right amount of juicy with all the typical fresh trimmings ++ the most amazing bacon ever! Staff was friendly and accommodating and never left us unattended for too long. Prices are a little high, but it's NYC and on the edge of Central Park. Once you've finished eating they have a gift store that has some signature branded items to go along with some unique treasures. You may just be able to find that 'thank you for watching my dog' gift as you browse through the small space.Overall we couldn't have been happier with our experience here. I would highly recommend Tavern On THe Green be added to your list of 'MUST DO' while in NY places.",9,3,8,Rob S.,"Birmingham, AL",556,792,8199
5.0,4/15/2019,"Bloody glorious is how I would describe the two brunches we enjoyed here. On day 1, we arrived at 9:45 on Saturday and were greeted by a lovely host. We waited in a sitting room area, until our server escorted us to our table next to the large glass windows at the back. Our group ordered Bellinis, appetizers, entrées and a dessert. Appetizers consisted of figs with assorted greens, honey and goat cheese: perfect way to start a meal. My buddy had the thick cut bacon, which would best be ordered to share and to enjoy at the same time as one of the entrées. Finally, one of us had the biscuit and gravy: not the best I have ever had, the other appetizers were definitely better. We moved on to entrées and had the eggs Benedict, one with smoked salmon and the other with lobster, and a third person had the brioche French toast. All were smashes, but you can skip the lobster which was out of season. Each of us were delighted with our choices. We even ordered a piece of carrot cake to share, also delicious but definitely over priced. We had such a good time, we reserved a table again the next day, Sunday at 9:00. Booking was very easy online. Again, the host was lovely, this time a woman who made us feel welcome without being overly bubbly as hostesses can sometimes be. We requested an outdoor table upon arrival and she accommodated us. We shared 2 appetizers between 3 diners. The potato pancakes (pretentious for latkes) were simply great. Flavourful, fried perfectly and served with sour cream and apple sauce. The portion was just right for an opener but can you ever have enough of a good latke? I ordered the mixed pastry basket which was good but not great. Our entrées were the shrimp and grits (not bad), bacon & egg flat bread and the avocado salad with poached eggs served on toast (both amazing)Service was pretty on point, but felt our Saturday waiter started strong and then stopped caring after our entrées arrived. This will be a fond memory of spending the weekend in Manhattan.",1,0,0,Steve S.,"Montreal, Canada",52,8,0

4.0,4/13/2019,We really enjoyed our lunch at Tavern on the Green. We did make reservations ahead of time so getting a table was easy. My husband had the Tavern Burger which set a new record for the most expensive burger we have ever purchased but it was delicious! The meat was flavorful and juicy. I ordered the Chicken Caesar salad. It was good as well. The dressing and croutons were great and the lettuce was fresh and crispy. The cheese was an unexpected treat. Service was good too. The only negative was the chicken on the salad. It did not seem like it was made in house. Prepackaged perhaps? I see why they have other options to choose from regarding a protein. I would choose differently next time. Overall very good lunch.,0,0,0,Nannette L.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",0,3,2

5.0,4/6/2019,"My very pregnant wife and I visited Tavern on the Green on a beautiful Spring Saturday afternoon in early April.  We arrived early to our 2:45 pm reservation, and were directed to the bar.  The entire venue is  a delight, each room being uniquely beautiful in its own way, and the bar is no exception. I ordered a whiskey cocktail, which was boozy and delicious.  My wife requested a virgin version of a their fig and honey cocktail and, not only was the bartender happy to oblige, but upon receiving the check, I found he had charged less than half the price of the original cocktail, despite doing the same amount of work.After being seated at our table almost exactly at 2:45 (and already knowing our order), we ordered the maple bacon appetizer, the avocado poached eggs, and the steak and eggs.  All three were wonderful.  The bacon was especially so.  My wife asked where we could find bacon so thick and uniformly fatty (almost like a pork version of Kobe beef), and I wish I knew the answer.  We informed the waiter that my wife was pregnant when she ordered the steak and eggs, and both came out absolutely perfect, both cooked at exactly the minimum they needed the be to be safe for an expectant mother.  Our waiter, Ben, was also great, attentive but not overly so.Tavern on the Green greatly exceeded our expectations.  We will return often.",0,0,0,Chase B.,"Bethesda, MD",0,23,6
5.0,4/2/2019,"Came here for Sunday brunch and had an amazing time! Great place to catch up with friends and enjoy Central Park. Pros:- Had brunch in the Central Park room and it was lovely. Loved the natural light coming in and getting to see the beautiful kitchen in action. - Split the Homemade Pastry Basket between two. There was one of everything and although the baked goods were on the smaller side it was enough to ramp up our appetites for the entree. - The Steak & Eggs was delicious. Steak was perfectly cooked and sliced! Eggs were scrambled but were not dried out (I usually prefer sunny side eggs b/c scrambled eggs are so dry but not here)- New York Cheesecake was amazingly good. We had to wait a while before getting it because they were making it and the wait was worth it. The sweetness of the cheesecake was balanced with the tartness of the blackberries and lemon curd. - Clean, beautiful bathrooms- Waitress was very friendly and did not rush us.Cons:- Pricey but worth it",1,0,0,Mandy L.,"Manhattan, NY",422,446,71

5.0,3/31/2019,"Tavern on the Green was an amazing experience. As we walked in I was immediately self conscious of being underdressed but was welcomed anyway by an extremely nice hostess. Clearly any and all are welcome. Being seated we were attended to nicely to begin with water and drink orders but then the real show began. Mathew, our waiter, was the show. Mathew.Both my girlfriend and I marveled in our waiters helpfulness with us being new to the restaurant and also built quick connections with us as well. Very personable. We ordered and received our food as well as timely check ins to get refills of our mimosas. Before this yelp review ends I'd be remiss to touch on how great our food was as well. I had the scrambled egg flatbread while my beautiful date enjoyed the avocado poached eggs. Each bite better than the previous. Ladies and gentlemen don't get me wrong the food at Tavern on the Green was amazing but as I stated previously, Mathew stole the show.

2.0,3/31/2019,"We came here with reservations for a Saturday morning brunch. We were seated a little earlier than our reservation time which was nice. Atmosphere: (5/5) The atmosphere is really the highlight of eating here. It's a light and airy open concept. We sat towards the back and had a nice table next to a window with a view of the outside. The decorations are very pretty and the wood beams on the ceiling are a nice touch. Very nice setting to enjoy a meal. The music wasn't too loud, but the selections played were pleasant to listen to. Service: (4/5) Our server was pleasant but not overly observant, and she seemed a bit preoccupied with other diners. She was friendly and was good enough. But not a stellar service just average. Food: (2/5) Here is where the major disappointment came and why I am giving the restaurant a 2 star review. This is, hands down, the worst food we had the entire time we spent in NYC. We ordered: Potato pancakes, the bacon, smoked bacon and scrambled egg flatbread, avocado poached eggs a coffee and a latte. (Total cost about 78$ for everything not included tip) I'm going to break down each item. Potato pancakes (2/5) Sliightly more greasy than expected. A bit bland even with the sour cream and applesauce provided. I've had better tasting at other ""lower end"" dining establishments. Maple brown sugar bacon with microgreens (2/5) Yes, the bacon is a huge portion. But it's mostly fat and not much meat. (I am aware bacon is a fattier meat, however...it was was mostly all fat) it wasn't very maple-flavored and the micro greens provided tasted like dirt. Actual dirt. Flatbread pizza (2/5) I've had better flavored breakfast  ""pizza"" from the freezer section of my grocery store. It was bland and honestly was not good at all, we ate one and a half piece. Avocado toast (3/5) this was probably the best thing we had. It was filling and tasted okay. The potato's were really delicious really the best part of the plate. Positive: the presentation of the food was very nice and pretty and the portion size was great. Overall: (2.5/5): The price for eating here does NOT match the quality and flavor of the food which is a real disappointment. If I'm going to spend quite a bit of money on eating out, I expect it to be a really delicious and amazing meal. So would I come back here, absolutely not. I would rather get a bagel from a small corner store instead.",0,0,0,Courtney C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",26,21,9
3.0,3/30/2019,"I have had a tough time figuring out whether to give this place three or four stars.  It really was pleasant enough, but as I was thinking through the meal and what really disturbed me, I had to go with three.Let me start with the biggest disappointment, which was the Peanut Butter Chocolate Lava Cake (which is what I think they called it).  Unfortunately, a Hostess cupcake has much more lava than this hockey puck of a piece of cake.  It was frankly an abomination.  It is not that it was bad, it was that it did not taste of great chocolate, it was fairly hard, dry and there was very little that was at all like molten lava.  It had a small somewhat soft core that was more pudding than lava.  Now, the kitchen might have had an off moment, but at these prices I expect better.  I did not complain as I was a guest in a group.  I am very into great desserts and this is maybe the worst example of lava cake I have had anywhere in the world.  They should be ashamed that they served this (and even more so if they intended to serve it this way). Definitely NWtC (Not Worth the Calories), Also tried the cheesecake, which was perfectly fine, but not very memorable. Not really worth the calories either. On a more positive note, the pastry basket was pretty good.  Not a very big basket for the price, but a nice small assortment with some excellent preserves.  The Tavern Maple Brown Sugar Bacon was fairly tasty and very thick.  I am not a bacon fan, but enjoyed this.  It came with some greens that were very good.  I would not run back to have this, but it was enjoyable.I ordered The Tavern Burger, which was pretty good. It came perfectly medium rare on a delicious bun (seemed to be a brioche bun), but the bun was not strong enough for the burger, which was a nice piece of meat.  Still it went well with it.  I asked for grilled onions and none appeared.  Got a waiter's attention (not ours) and then someone brought out ""grilled onions"".  They were cold and if they were grilled at all, I doubt it was for more than five seconds.  Anyway, I asked again and got some deliciously grilled onions.  Since I cannot eat ""Salt & Vinegar"" chips, they were nice enough to substitute french fries. They were perfectly acceptable, but frankly nothing special.  Fairly thin.  A bit like McDonald's but not as good (and that is not meant to specifically compliment McDonald's).  The Greek Yogurt with mixed berries was perfectly fine.At the end of the meal, I ordered a decaf coffee and was never even offered a refill.  In fact, the service in general was a problem.  It was pleasant and perfectly fine enough (water glasses were constantly refilled), but not very attentive or always responsive.  At these prices one expects more, even if we were a large group.On the other hand, the setting is so nice.  The light was streaming in on a beautiful day and I was with some good friends.  A pleasant afternoon, but it would be nice if they upped their game, not that they need to as the tourists seem to fill the place up.",0,0,0,Randall S.,"Manhattan, NY",837,109,13

My date and I opted for just the food pre fix menu and ordered from the drink menu The service was excellent. We had a 5:30pm reservation and arrived a little early around 5:10pm but was seated right away. There was a live band laying when you walked in which was really nice, unfortunately we were seated far away from it so we were unable to enjoy the music. We looked at the menu and finally made our decisions. 1st CourseMe: Lobster salad, omg I loved it. The lobster was so good and the blood orange elevated the taste without overpowering the lobster.Date: Fragrois, it was his first time eating it and didn't know what to expect. He said it didn't taste bad he just didn't like the rawness of it. 2nd CourseMe: Red Snapper, my fish was cooked perfectly and enjoyed every bite. Date: Short Ribs, he loved it. If I ate meat I would have love to try it, it looked delicious and was cooked perfectly. I did try one of his carrots and it was amazing.3rd CourseMe: Crème Brulee, let me tell you, it was the best I've ever had. It was so creamy and the top layer was perfection. Date: Chocolate Trifle with Lady fingers, I did try some and this and I have to say It was amazing. After dinner we noticed a little photo set up on the way out so we had our pictures taken.

The architecture and decor is a perfect meld of old world accents and architecture, with modern decor. Even better than the decor was the food. The chef here understands the importance of flavors. The shrimp in green garlic was to die for! And the short ribs were AMAZING. My boyfriend had the steak and it was perfectly cooked to medium and charred on the outside.

I ordered the braised short rib which was served atop cheesy potatoes and mixed mushrooms. The mushrooms were the best part and I wish there were more! I also felt that there wasn't enough sauce considering the short rib was a touch dry, though it was tender and delicious. My friend got the rack of lamb which was phenomenal!

We really saw the waiter go totally animated when we asked for separate checks.  His body language and facial expressions definitely impacted his tip.  We were glad that we went to the TOTG, but our money would have been better spent sitting on the comfortable couch visiting with other guests and having cocktails and eating appetizers.  Had our only experience been with Troche and our meal, TOTG would have received a single star rating.",0,2,0,Kelzee P.,"Austin, TX",0,35,34

My wife had fish and chips and I had the grilled skirt steak. The fish and chips were 2 large pieces that were lightly battered and tasty. The fries were basic but good and certainly plentiful. Their malt vinegar combination was a little different and just OK. My skirt steak was a perfect medium for me. Had what they called a rustic vinaigrette sauce on it which was quite good. The fingerling potatoes were a little overdone but tasty as well. Both entrees came with a small salad which was nice. Not much dressing on them so you may need to ask for more. We got a red wine vinaigrette to add which was excellent. Not rushed out after the meal at all by the check did come promptly. Max was great with water refills and attentive service.

The huge slice of cake was a letdown. The icing was rubbery as if for decor, not consumption. The cake tasted like layers of dense pound cake with sprinkles - nothing elegant as expected. Once I ran out of ice cream, the cake wasn't good enough to finish. I also expected a place like this to have a chocolate mousse option. Birthday cake is a bit Chuck E.

2.0,11/26/2018,"Went to Tavern on the Green for Thanksgiving dinner with my family.  We had a large party and they seated us in a back temporary dining area with folding tables and plastic chairs.  It was very cold outside and the back room was chilly.  The place was packed and while we waited for our table servers seemed to crash into us from every direction.  The food was barely passable.  The steak and salmon were fine, but the turkey was terrible.  The kitchen looked like it was preparing food for an army.  Lots of sad plates of food loaded in advance for servers to grab and throw down in front of guests.  Service was fine and our waiter was pleasant.  At the end of the meal they turned the heaters off in the back room and basically froze us out.  We had to move into the bar area to thaw out while we waited for the check.  Message received that it was time to leave.  This was without a doubt the worst meal I ever had in NYC, and I'd give it 1 star, but the place does exude history and it's in a beautiful setting in the park.  Maybe one day the place will be operated by people who care about quality.  For now it's just a tourist trap.",1,0,0,Chris L.,"Miami, FL",0,15,0
2.0,11/26/2018,"Overall a ""meh"" rating. Visiting from Chicago and have fond memories of prior visits. This was the first trip with out adult children in tow. I think we built the place up a bit too much. The service staff were very good. The food however, was the real problem here. We had the brunch menu and aside from everything being very mediocre the ""sirloin"" was the blandest, toughest cut of meat I've ever had in any restaurant, including fast casual places like Texas Roadhouse or Outback. It was nearly inedible. If we weren't so hungry we wouldn't have eaten the little we did. Our family HATES wasting food, so we usually do just eat the plates that come out.After dinner, we conveyed our concerns to the waiter. We specifically asked him to charge the card before talking to his management. We're not complaining to get a few bucks off the bill, it was seriously horrible meat. Also potato pancakes were burnt around the edges and drowning in oil. I can't imagine letting that leave my kitchen in a restaurant. The waiter said that he did convey and that Chef intended to come speak to us about it. He did not. Ever. So we left, and frankly will probably never return.",2,0,0,Joseph A.,"St. Charles, IL",0,2,0

4.0,11/26/2018,"The good and the bad (overall good):Good: The ambiance, the iconic nature of the place, the food and the service. All excellent. The bar area is my favorite space...it was decorated beautifully for the holidays and has a very dark wood, club-like vibe (old-school club, not dance club). The dining room has a very different feel, which is a bit jarring after the bar area...very light, with lots of gleaming glass, although that did give us a great view of all the lights in the courtyard. Our waiter was great and very helpful with recommendations, and the food was delicious, if unsurprisingly pricey.Bad: The zoo-like waiting area when you first arrive. They don't start seating dinner until 5:00, which is when our reservations were, so a crowd just kept building up and log jamming the area, which definitely took away from what would have been an upscale, comfortable environment. There were lots of kids and a not-super-friendly hostess who seemed a bit overwhelmed by the whole thing. At 5:00 the waiters each grab a stack of menus and go around trying to locate their parties, which only made the scene feel more chaotic.",0,0,0,Patrick D.,"Hartford, CT",129,337,122

But, ironically, our experience wasn't really over the top. The food actually was the best part. We really enjoyed every single thing we ordered. Our server was extremely sweet, but had WAY too many tables. It was not her fault, but it took over 10 minutes for us to even get water once we'd been seated and when our food came we still didn't have silverware. Somewhat disappointing since we knew we were paying heavily for the experience!! Our drinks were great and the food and desserts really impressed us (more than we expected based on some of the other reviews.)

4.0,11/2/2018,"Came here for a Sunday brunch date with one of my good friends. I suggest to make reservations ahead of time. We were able to get a 2pm slot. This place is located inside Central Park on the West side near 66th street. There is a walk in path  to entrance of place between 66th and 67th Street on Central Park West. There is no parking or valet for here . You would have to park . If you are lucky- you can find street parking on Central Park West or you can park in a parking facility - closet one is on 66th near Central Park West - could also enter on the 65th side as well . Door man opens door for you. Gift shop located near entrance well .The Hostess stand is located as you walk into the large room with Bar. I saw lots of people in here around bar And at lounge couches around bar- appeared to be waiting for tables maybe or maybe they were having something to eat here. Appears more casual dress in the bar room. There is gorgeous outside seating if it was the right temperature/weather. Otherwise there is inside dining - two of the room ms are more historic in design and there is one white room which was more modern and has one side that is glass and has gorgeous natural light . This room is called the "" Central Park room"" . We were seated in one of the more historic rooms which were comfortable . Next time I would like to sit in the Central Park room or outside if it were a nice day. Menu was a decent size- good amount of options but not so many that you couldn't decide . Cocktails They had cocktails named after every NYC borough . No New Jersey cocktail though :(  drinks are $13-16 a pop. I had the "" In the land of Figs and Honey"" ... had a nice presentation. Fig on glass for garnish. I also tried the Queens cocktail and it was good also. Friend had the "" Where's the smoke there's fire"" cocktail and she liked it.App- we got the Tavern Maple Brown Sugar Bacon because my friend LOVES bacon. Lol. They give you three strips and I tell you- I was so delicious! For main course-My friend got the Smoked Bacon and Scrambled Egg Flatbread. She enjoyed it I got the Eggs Benedict Florentine with smoked salmon. Could get it with Canadian Bacon or Lobster also.  It was not the best I've ever had but it was pretty good We shared a French toast... at first - I wasn't convinced but once it soaks into All the syrup and toppings ....

It started well; the Roasted Fig appetizer with honey, goat cheese, arugula, & bresaola was a promising first bite. Unfortunately, picking at our  Lobster Pot Pie (a special not listened on the menu) & Tavern Cobb Salad became a means to an end -- dessert. Neither dish was especially flavorful. As for quality, I expected more care from the revamped iconic eatery. Two stars for these two dishes. The Birthday Cake slice & Pineapple Upside Down Cake salvaged our meal, both were masterfully made & presented in a way that matched the beauty & glamour of the restaurant. Taste -- 4 stars.

You can not ask for a more ideal location, I mean IN the park come on, it doesn't disappoint. From location to ambience straight into the food and service all 5 stars. We started with drinks,all delicious, then the 5 of us shared the fig and goat cheese salad, burrata and fresh tomato salads to start. Then I with two others the tomahawk steak a side of asparagus and truffle Mac and cheese, sublime. The waiter was so kind, the atmosphere was classy yet comfortable.

The steak was good but nothing extraordinary for the ridiculous price. I've had steak just as good at many other steakhouses. For dessert I had lava cake and it tasted like it came out of the microwave. Everything is overpriced and I mean ridiculously overpriced.

It was noisy and the staff kept opening and slamming a door/cabinet that was right next to our table. And then a large family with four children were seated next to us and kept screaming. Which of course isn't the restaurants fault. I ordered a salad to start which was excellent it had dates and nuts in it and was light and provided a good Segway into our entrees. I ordered the sea bass and my GF ordered the Salmon. Both pretty good. The sea bass had a light juicy center and a crispy outer texture..well cooked. Service was attentive.

3.0,7/26/2018,"I was excited to dine here as this seems to be one of the quintessential NYC brunch locations.  However, we had just an okay experience here.  I'm appalled at their lack care in presentation, as this is such a picturesque and historic place.We came here for a Sunday brunch-- a reservation that we had to make at least a month in advance to get a prime spot at noon.  When we arrived, we said we would like to be seated outside, and the hostess walked us past every other table (they were occupied) in the cute covered garden area, and sat us behind an ugly bush by the station where the waiters stop to refill drinks.  We were completely separated from the rest of the dining area literally by a bush, and we felt less than cared for despite the fact that we had made the reservation so far in advance.  After we complained to the waiters & asked for a more desirable location, they initially said they couldn't accommodate our request.  After we saw a table clear up, we asked to move once more and after the many servers helping us out rolled their eyes & acted annoyed, they finally moved us to be a part of the  regular dining area.As for the food, we ordered the brown sugar bacon ($16), the Tomato Gazpacho Soup ($12), the Avocado Poached Eggs ($20), and two orders of the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict Florentine ($29 each).  We also ordered coffee and lattes.To start, my latte was absolutely horrible.  It tasted like a latte that maybe came dispensed from a machine.  It was a plain latte, but there was no foam on top, mostly just tasted like they mixed warm milk with some coffee.  Further, it came out all spilled all over the top, dripping down the side, and frankly looked like crap.  I get that it can spill a bit while they walk it over to the table, but COME ON, this looked horrific.As for the appetizers, the gazpacho was very good, but the bacon wasn't really anything special.  The waiter raved that this was ""the best bacon he'd ever had"", but it was super thick, extremely fatty, and not crispy at all.  Was more like slices of Christmas ham than bacon.As for the entrees, the salmon benedict was well-liked by both of my friends who ordered it.  It was filling and the eggs were perfectly poached.  It came with very little smoked salmon though, which for a $9 uncharge, I would've expected a bit more.The real horror of the entire meal was the avocado toast.  The menu clearly states ""chunky FRESH avocado"".  Well take a look at the photo, folks, because that stuff aint fresh.  Further, it was clearly a guacamole-- seasoned with Mexican spices and filled with chunks of tomato and herbs.  I HIGHLY doubt that they actually made this, as it tasted like the pre-packaged Sabra's guacamole.  It's one thing to do that and lie about it on the menu, but hey at least make sure it's green.  I eat a ton of avocado toast & I've NEVER seen it come out brown.  Seriously?? This is unheard of. And I saw many plates of avocado toast go past our table with the same brown/ gray ugly mush slapped onto the English muffins.  You'd think if they're churning out so many dishes, they could keep the guacamole fresh & not leave it sitting around to turn brown.  This just looked atrocious.  It tasted fine, but again, tasted like a Mexican meal as it was clearly GUACAMOLE NOT ""FRESH AVOCADO"" *eye roll*.  All the entrees came with potatoes, but you only got 4-5, so really stingy on that front.  They could have definitely filled up the plate with a few more taters for the price you pay for the meal.If it weren't for the somewhat decent food we experienced with some of the dishes, I would give this place 2 stars.  The experience with the table, the ugliest latte I've ever been served, the small but expensive portions, and the most atrocious-looking avocado toast ever, this place really struck out on a lot of areas.  That being said, it is an adorable atmosphere and really feels like a special occasion to dine here at this historic place.  Just don't come here expecting to have a world-class meal.",2,1,0,Alex W.,"Boise, ID",20,252,466

It was a beautiful day in NYC and the best place to celebrate a nice day is in Central Park.Arrived on time to a packed house, everybody was fairly dressed up and there was a wedding taking place outside. We decided for us to sit inside to avoid potential for swamp ass which comes about from consuming too much alcohol in warm weather.Ordered a few appetizers (roasted figs and greek yogurt) and one bottle of Veuve Clicquot which somehow turned to 3 in what felt like an hour. On the third bottle of bubbly, I was given the nick name Champagne Papi by our waiter lol...(#Drake). I ordered the bacon and scrambled eggs flatbread to soak up all the liquid fun that was taking place in my stomach and small intestine at this point.

We ate in the Bubble Garden outside and it was beautiful (but don't do that if you find bubbles annoying). We had sparkling wines and peach sangria, with appetizers wild mushroom toast and parmesan frites with garlic aioli--very yummy. My main course was yellowfin tuna with fingerling potato salad, and the salad was just frisee (which is my favorite green) with sliced fingerlings and a light vinaigrette--perfect. Dessert was a peanut butter chocolate concoction which was good but would have been so much better if the center had been less like chocolate pudding and more like a flourless chocolate cake/tart.

Whatever sugary frosting they put on that toast --- can I please have that on every French Toast I order for the rest of my life?!?!YUM!!!! My youngest daughter had a Caesar Salad, and it was fresh and crisp. Can't go wrong there. Our service was exceptional. Their computers were down the morning we were there, but the staff did a superb job keeping things running. Pros - Beautiful location in Central Park, great seating both indoors and outdoors, a wide variety of food to suit most tastes, exceptional and prompt service, you get your money's worth for what you pay for in my opinion.Cons - My only complaint (and why I docked one star) was that the dress code seems as if it has decreased over time. The morning we were there --athletes competing in the triathlon at Central Park came in to eat sweaty with their competition clothes on! I was surprised to see people soaked with sweat and dressed in only spandex seated next to me at the Tavern on the Green. :(  Now, I personally put in a solid five miles everyday on the treadmill, but I would never show up to the Tavern on the Green sweaty with workout clothes on.

It was a lovely place with a green house feel. The menu is written for women so lots of salads, small plates, soups and cocktails. I had the cob salad and my wife had the Niçoise salad. My son had the chicken strips. We all enjoyed our food and would recommend them. Our waiter, Zachary W. was very personable and seemed to enjoy his job.

We had the gravy biscuits, potato pancakes, salmon and asparagus appetizers. Then the salmon, French toast, eggs Benedict and breakfast pizza, with 5 cocktails. Service was mediocre. I did appreciate that when they brought out the meals they knew who to serve. Long wait for cocktails; second drink came long after meal was served. Was a nice experience once, but I wouldn't rush back. Dining room with patio closed, was very loud. Atmosphere felt like a loud cafeteria. Music can be heard only in bar area. There is a small gift shop directly inside that is a nice stop for eclectic gifts if you're passing by.I would recommend as a comfortable place to stop at the bar if you're passing by.

Our waitress gave great recommendations and was incredibly attentive. In addition, this is truly just a beautiful restaurant. We were in the room with floor to ceiling glass windows, and it felt sexy, fun, and classy. The outdoor dining area also looked nice and like you could go a little more casually if you wanted to.

You can choose inside or outdoors. We chose outdoors - had live music. There a bar outside. We were seated right away. It took a bit longer for someone to get to our table to offer water. Menu had a wide selection. The waiter forgot one of our sides so had to ask him to remove it from our order. Also ordered a sweetened iced tea and was not sweetened at all. Just small stuff. The food was good. We got the rack of lamb, salmon, and braised short ribs. I thought they had to bake the carrot cake we got for dessert but it eventually came out. Price was decent for NYC.

1.0,5/7/2018,"To whom it may concern. On Saturday, May 5th my boyfriend and I had reservations at your establishment for 3:30. We arrived early and were seated promptly. This was our first time at Tavern on the Green, and I was excited. We ordered our food and I enjoyed a Bellini. I ordered the chicken Cesar salad and my boyfriend ordered the tavern burger. We also ordered the sugar maple bacon appetizer. Our food came and the enjoyment stopped there. My Cesar salad was absolutely awful. The dressing tasted like straight anchovies and nothing else. The chicken was ice cold as it it had been cooked and sitting in a refrigerator for hours. I would've expected at least half warm chicken in an establishment as fine at TOTG! The burger was served completely plain and cooked far less than medium with a bright red center. I ate the cheese off my salad and tossed the lettuce around the bowl, searching for some that wasn't doused it the terrible dressing. My boyfriend ate around the center of his burger and left a portion on the plate. A table within an ears distance from us ordered the same burger, yet it was served with lettuce, tomato, avocado and onion on wooden stake throughthe center of the burger.... why wasn't ours served the same way? We decided to order dessert in hopes it would be enjoyable and though it tasted good. The carrot cake was again served ice cold. I understand the cream cheese icing needed to be served chilled, but in and establishment as fine as this, I would have expected a warm, or at the very least room temperature cake, with fresh icing piped on top. The espresso was very short, burnt and incredibly bitter. It also lacked the proper dressing of a fresh lemon peel served alongside.  In fact my boyfriend didn't even drink his, took one sip and pushed it to the side. Our original server never came back to our table after taking our order, and truthfully I was embarrassed to send my food back in such a high end well known establishment, so I didn't. We wasted over $100.00 on the most disappointing meal I have ever had. Furthermore I'd like to add the fact that I got food poisoning and was sick just hours after leaving and throughout Sunday!",4,1,0,Amanda E.,"Hackensack, NJ",321,12,4

I had made the reservation to bring dear friends and family members from out of town so they can experience a nice outdoor restaurant on a nice day in NYC. First we got seated late in the dingy area behind the bar inside, instead of the nice outdoor areas they have in the photos. It was if they weren't expecting us. The service was Sooo slow and when the food finally came we had no utensils. It was embarrassing sitting there looking at each other waiting for spoons for the soups and forks for the salads. The food was okay nothing worth the wait or price. There were at least 4-5 different servers which made it chaotic and confusing. We ordered coffee at the end of the meal and of course it was cold so some of us asked for new hot coffee. The whole experiences was a disaster. My family members joked about it to make me feel better but it was a huge embarrassment. Never again. I honestly don't know who writes their raving reviews.

2.0,3/17/2018,"This review has been a long time coming. I waited a few months to review Tavern on the Green because my father wrote in with concerns about our service, and I was waiting for the response. Now that he has gotten a response, I can go ahead with my review.I went here on Christmas 2017 for a dinner with my parents, sister, boyfriend, and grandmother. The short version of my review: don't eat here. This place is a tourist trap, the service is slow, and the food is mediocre - but especially disappointing given the prices.My biggest complaint is that my family checked the website before we made reservations and the site said that we could order a la carte but when we arrived, there was a fixed dinner menu and we were told a la carte was not available. Additionally, the website had said that the Christmas dinner fixed menu would be $75, but when we showed up, it was $125 (I will attach photos so you can see the full menu).The dinner rolls were stale, and the first course took over an hour to arrive (my father included his watch in the photo I have attached to this review). The meal would have been average at a restaurant charging half the price, but considering what we paid, the quality of the food was unacceptable. Tavern on the Green would be 1 star restaurant were it not for the gorgeous setting and the live music. If you have money to burn and are looking to show off to friends and family at an elegant-looking place, by all means go. I will never be returning, though.Edited to add: I forgot to mention - I ordered the egg nog to be festive; it was watered down (?!?!) and the liquor was terribly balanced. I dont know how you screw up egg nog as it is literally liquid fat and sugar, but somehow Tavern on the Green managed to do it.Yea, maybe don't eat here.

The cod and short rib were not only tasteless, theOverall texture seemed that it was made in a convection oven. You know the type of convection oven /microwave combo you have at your house, and you use it to make a slightly tastier than microwaved meal, but you're so tired that a blah result comes out? Yea, except you're paying a deal of money for the food, supposed to be made by a professional.  I don't know about you, but nothing irks me more than cold (previously frozen) cod.Now initially I was hoping that the desserts would put this review at least three stars, but those desserts, are replicas of 2.00 street vendor carts, but more mediocre. The financier and brûlée are sad afterthoughts of an underwhelming meal. No refinement put onto a pretty menu, everything here seems to be made for a lunchroom cafeteria.Other fine points 1. Our waiter, Spencer handed me my dessert. Goodness he places a plate on the table, instead of sloppily throwing it at me. 2. Water was not refilled- not even once. 3. I had to tackle our waiter, and notify him 3x that we needed our check. 4.

As a vegetarian, I was between the grilled vegetable scrambled eggs and the french toast with blueberry compote. I don't like squash/zucchini so I went with the french toast. My aunt got the scrambled eggs. French toast was incredible, fluffy and sweet, the compote was to die for, not overwhelming but definitely sweet and creamy almost like a whipped icing, the candied almonds were delicious and the blueberries were fresh.

Surprisingly enough, it actually wasn't loud despite there being lots of people in the glass room.PROS: French toast is incredibly delicious, great view of the park, reservations were easy to make, very friendly staff, complimentary coat/bag check, warm atmosphereCONS: It's pricey for small portions, but that's to be expected.

4.0,2/4/2018,"Quintessential New York restaurant! Tavern on the Green is a must, even if it's just to fulfill your bucket list.Breaking down the review as follows: Reservations: One of the people from our party was late but they seated us anyway since most of the party was there. This is a plus when we are talking about NYC restaurant rules of not seating everyone until your party is there since sometimes you miss out on a good table.Tavern on the Green also had a beautiful bar and lounge area so waiting there with a mimosa is hardly an inconvenience! Ambiance: I love the ambiance of this place. The fireplace by the bar is so cute and the long, plush red coach is Instagram-worthy!The main dining area has and indoor-outdoor feel since they have a nice open skylight ceiling. Service: Our server was very nice and attentive even though it was a busy brunch Saturday. We didn't feel rushed by him even though we weren't a complete party when we got seated. Food: Ok, so this is why they don't have 5-stars. The food was just ok. I'm a foodie so I know my standards are on the high side but the meals we had were pretty plain Janes. I got the steak and eggs and it was a little tough and cold. The eggs were pretty tasty though but overall, the food was ok. The desserts were MUCH better! So, to answer the net promoter score question: would recommend Tavern on the Green? The answer is YES... especially if you have out of town visitors or celebrating a special occasion.

3.0,1/27/2018,"I was very excited to visit this restaurant during NYC Restaurant Week because it's always been considered ""The Place to Go"" in NYC. While the ambiance is really great, the food and the service are both unimpressive. I tried the bean soup for my appetizer, and it was so bland. It should have been described as a bean puree because there were no beans, and it was spiceless. The short rib of beef was delicious, BUT it was served on top of some underwhelming grit concoction. Beef and ribs? No bueno. I'm from the South, and grits should only be served with eggs, sausage, bacon, or shrimp. The dessert was the worst part was the toasted maple financier. The cake was nearly stale, and I really had a great deal of difficulty cutting through it with my spoon. We were super disappointed, particularly given the hype surrounding this restaurant.

4.0,1/23/2018,"I've been dying to visit Tavern on the Green for a proper dinner since I've moved to New York. Thankfully, NYC Restaurant week afforded me the opportunity to do so with my boyfriend. Our server was attentive and helpful. I had the arugula salad, codfish, and chocolate creme brûlée. The seasoning of each dish was spot on - the salad, with just the right amount of dressing, added a perfect touch of acidity. The codfish with roasted tomatoes and some sort of sauce was so yummy! Codfish can be tough to do right, especially texturally, but mine was delicious! The chocolate creme brûlée was very rich but a nice finish to the meal. I just wish that the brûlée was a little more generous. My boyfriend ordered the garlic shrimp, short rib and risotto, and some sort of banana thing for dessert. He certainly lived up to his reputation of ordering the best thing on the menu! That succulent garlic sauce from the shrimp was my favorite bite out of all our food! And the banana cake dessert thing was so yummy. This is the quality of food I expect from a fancy restaurant. The best part, however, was the ambiance. We sat in the crystal room in a far corner of the dining room. I appreciate that they leave the twinkle lights on in the patio even though it's winter. It definitely adds to the romantics feel of the dining experience. I also liked the open kitchen, it was cool being able to see all the chefs and cooks doing what they do!

The ambiance was classic and memorable, and I can imagine it would be even nicer at night for dinner. We were impressed with portion sizes, since sometimes restaurant week menus can be skimpy. The food was also delicious, especially the mushroom flatbread (soup got great reviews too), and the chocolate creme brulee (maple financier was too dense and the only not great plate).

4.0,1/21/2018,"I went earlier today with my mother as a late Christmas gift before going to a show. We both had never been and decided to give it a try. We had 1:15 PM reservations for brunch. Our table was not ready when we arrived, but we were seated by the bar. About 15 minutes passed, and we were brought to our table by a lovely hostess. Very sweet & super knowledgeable. My mom had a bloody Mary and it was super spicy, just the way we like it. We decided to get the maple bacon as an appetizer, as well as potato pancakes. They were both great. For an entrée, I got the Caesar salad and my mom got the eggs Benedict. (I don't eat seafood or eggs, so my only two choices were the salad or a burger, which i wasn't in the mood for.) The salad came out, & it was a very big size, but i was extremely disappointed. I was expecting warm grilled chicken strips on top of the salad, & what i got was ice cold cubed chicken that seemed like it came out of a package & wasn't cooked/prepared there. I was just trying to avoid the chicken when the manager came over and asked how we liked everything. I wasn't going to say anything, but i thought.. for a $20 bowl of lettuce, i was going to tell him. He was extremely sweet & very apologetic. He took it back right away, told me the salad wouldn't be on the receipt & to choose anything else i wanted. Since i didn't want a big burger (or want to wait for it to be cooked) i settled on yogurt & granola. I wish there were more options for brunch. I would definitely like to return again, as the staff & the ambiance were both great. I just won't order the Caesar salad again!",0,0,0,Marisa C.,"Massapequa, NY",1,38,70

1.0,1/21/2018,"After months of planning imagine the horror when you walk into your wedding venue just an hour before your guests arrive and NOTHING is set up - there are card board boxes of the previous nights events where your tables should be. That was my experience in November 2017 at Tavern on the Green.  To begin with: Me (the bride) and my family were yelled at by NYC Cops and security, not allowed to drive up the main entrance to be dropped off with my GOWN and other wedding necessities. The ""wedding team"" at TOG failed to notify security that there was a wedding that day and they must let us, including our guests, in through the private entrance. Imagine running around the streets of NYC with your wedding gown that you spent endless hours shopping for and thousands of dollars on dragging in the streets. Then, Katherine, the person I had been communicating with for MONTHS left someone else in charge of my wedding day, and when we finally did enter the venue she was giving a tour to potential clients instead of making sure my wedding day went smoothly. Audrey was more interested in making another deal than taking care of me, her current client ON MY WEDDING DAY. Next, as late fall and winter in NYC goes, it was obviously cold. I had my wedding in the atrium, and the heat was not on when I arrived, it was frigid, my guests had to leave their coats on during the wedding, and some people had to use the heat from the votives on the table to heat themselves, how embarrassing, when you spend TOG type of money you expect and deserve a lot more than that. Then, as most weddings are the priest/rabbi/or whoever is conducting the rituals would naturally need a podium or something of that nature. I was supposed to walk down the aisle at 7pm but I didn't get to until close to 8!!! Why? Because they didn't have a podium, then one they had kept falling over - imagine all your guests seated waiting for the ceremony to begin and TOG staff running around trying to figure this out, and not just that they don't have a bridal suite, so I was waiting in the BATHROOM in my wedding gown for 45 minutes (because obviously you don't want anyone to see you before you walk down the aisle). For dinner, Katherine and Audrey promised me the guests tables would be spread throughout the venue, however it became very apparent that the events team at TOG either don't read their emails or they just don't care about the service their clients get once they are paid. They, of course did not move the tables. You might be wondering, so what? Well, my guests, including myself were being bumped into by the wait staff, my guests were being elbowed in the head as they staff made their way putting down entrees. Imagine your dear friends and guests in their finest being walked into and struck (albeit on accident) by the wait staff, I was mortified!At the end of the evening the desserts, cake, and coffee were barely left out for a half hour, most of my guests never even saw the dessert table. From the time we arrived to the end of the night the event staff treated us like cattle, as if they were doing me a favor after we spent thousands of dollars not to mention precious time planning what was supposed to be the night of our lives. It is a tragic thing when a New York Icon like Tavern on the Green lets you down this way. Poor service, poor management, highly disappointing.

3.0,1/19/2018,"You know . . . . I was genuinely surprised at the actual affordability for like just a beer in the garden at Tavern on the Green. They're pretty much marked around $8 but I think in my head I was imagining $15 for a coors lite or something. It's a landmark or should be by this point in Central Park. I had never gone and went with a small group of friends for their Oktoberfest specials back in the fall. Beer options were solid. We went with the Empire's Oktoberfest, brewed especially for Tavern on the Green for their festivities. The food wasn't anything to write home about. You come for a drink and to take in the setting after a stroll in the park. But some of the items that stood out - giant pretzel (hard to go wrong with), beer and cheese fondue (you simply can't eff up melted cheese), braised red cabbage with apples (shockingly delicious). I wasn't a huge fan of their sausage offerings and their potato pancakes were a little sad. But it's again a snack and drink kind of place instead of amazing dining. One downside to sitting outdoors at Tavern on the Green, as romantic as it is, there are bugs and it smells like horse manure. Oh, Mother Nature.

1.0,1/14/2018,I would give them no stars. I used to love this restaurant. It was first class. Past tense. My experience tonight ended with my party and I leaving before we ordered. We were early for our reservation. We were told to wait in the lounge for our table. Fine. We sat at a table that had not been cleared of drinks. Two of the glasses were cleared soon after we sat down one remained. A member of my party got up to use the restroom and knocked the glass off the table breaking it. She immediately went to the hostess to tell her she broke the glass. No one came to clean up the broken glass for a good five minutes. There was no urgency to clean up broken glass. Our table was ready. The hostess couldn't find us. She walked by us twice. She was at the hostess stand when we checked in. She asked everyone else in the lounge if they were are party. I finally heard what she was saying and told her that was us. We were taken to the dining room. The dining room was unbearably hot. Like it made me want to vomit. A server came by with a bottle of wine thinking it was for our table. We had just sat down. He is terrible at his job. We sat at the table for 10 minutes. No one  came by. We had no water. No rolls. We finally asked to have the heat turned down when we flagged down a waiter who was not ours he said he would have to ask the manager. I had had enough and walked out. Terrible.

I ordered the sirloin steak sandwich. The meat was chewy, rubbery, and honestly didn't have a great flavor. The sandwich was made with ""caramelized onions""; however, caramelized onions should be made with yellow onions which caramelized nicely and have a sweet flavor. This kitchen used red onions which do not cook well. The onions were still crispy and more bitter. This hurt the flavor of the sandwich. Unfortunately, as well as the overpriced, less than stellar food, the service was subpar. I expected top notch service at this specific restaurant; however, my waiter did not check on the table, I had to ask for drink refills, I was not asked if I needed anything with my meal, and I had to wait a while for the check.

1.0,1/4/2018,"Our much anticipated holiday trip to NYC appeared doomed from the start due to the uncannily freezing temperatures and bitter cold this winter. No one's fault, it's just the weather. Still, we made the best of it and trusted our dinner reservation at the lovely Tavern on the Green to lift our somewhat downtrodden and frostbitten spirits on New Years Day.Now the young hosts at reception were very welcoming and gracious despite our turning up an hour earlier than our reserved time, and they directed us to a table by the bar so that we may enjoy a drink or light snack until we may be accommodated for dinner. The area to where we were seated was pleasant enough but projected a somewhat faux snooty air, almost pretentiously so, what with the suited acoustic jazz trio, luxuriously appointed expanse, and seemingly deep pocketed clientele. But I'm a bit of a ""faux"" snoot myself and was therefore happily unfazed.What troubled me was the food. My girlfriend and I decided to order a couple of small dessert dishes in lieu of aperitifs to whet our appetites and so yes, it was a peppermint chocolate cake and the Tavern Cookie Tray for us respectively.I was indeed expecting something tiny with regards to the cake ($12) and that's ok but the Tavern Cookie Tray (also $12) was an experience in absurdity.Somehow I always knew a visit to the Tavern on the Green may be a crapshoot, owing to the polarizing and mixed reviews of the establishment. But I wasn't expecting anything to the degree of what was to be the ""Tavern Cookie Tray"".Alas - behold, the Tavern Cookie Tray (no picture unfortunately but an adept description)! - you'd be forgiven for thinking of a collection of a dozen (or even half a dozen) of assorted deliciously baked and powdered delectables, yes? Something you might have at afternoon tea perhaps?Oh, No. What we received was three (3) gingerbread cookies measuring about 4  1/2"" tall each.And if this wasn't beguiling enough, the shock/comedy was intensified by the way it was plopped down on the table by the server, making the poor three gingerbread men shift so violently on the little plate they almost fell onto the table. Much like when a prisoner is served mash in the food queue where the fellow on the other side slops a serving size full onto the poor bastard's tray, or maybe when a steerage passenger on the Titanic is unceremoniously presented (thrown) gruel on a rough and tumbly night. After all, each specimen was as hard as an iceberg, with probably just a little more flavour than an iceberg. Apologies for the insensitivity, the Titanic is not a trivial matter. But for heaven's sake, neither were these abominations! I'm quite certain now that the kitchen procured these at the local CVS for $5 for a tin of 100. Or maybe it was stolen from Macy's third shift Santa Claus' back pocket, his personal stash for second break because it would take only 50 seconds to devour them. Not a bad markup I'd say, as it was essentially $4 for each of those wonderfully turd coloured delights. To be fair, I ate them regardless!But life is not fair I know, and I was resolved to resist playing the indignant patron, they're just cookies after all. But for matters of decency the Tavern on the Green may perhaps try to improve their game on the beloved Tavern Cookie Tray before it's bestowed on an unfortunate other. Because in the end we decided to not stay for dinner, leaving that cozy and warm jazz filled place to brave the cold on empty stomachs and try our luck elsewhere.",3,9,1,Gj T.,"Ventura, CA",1,1,0

Not worth one bit of it. I highly recommend grabbing food with ACTUAL flavor from a REAL New York restaurant, taking it in the park, and sitting down to eat. This restaurant is the farthest thing from iconic or a ""must see."" Forget it.",1,0,0,Lydia S.,"Santa Fe, TX",52,4,0
3.0,12/16/2017,"I really want to love this place.... but unfortunately they always under deliver. First, I think this restaurant is a bit confused. Yes, it is a tourist trap but the restaurant itself is really beautiful especially around the holidays, it is great. The dining rooms are really lovely and they have nightly jazz with a singer which is so great at the bar area. The menu prices are ""pricey"", but for NY standards they are normal and the location itself calls for it. Their cocktails are actually relatively inexpensive, considering. However, they need to do something about the dress code here because the last time I was here people were in sneakers , ugg boots and extremely casual street clothes. The restaurant has branded itself as more of a casual place (especially compared to the original Tavern on the Green) but the ambiance of the restaurant and the menu prices just don't make sense. Pick a side- either step up the dress code for these tourists or lower your menu prices/change the menu offerings. I say please step up the dress code! It's Tavern on the Green not Applebees! Having a reservation here means absolutely zero, even though you need one. Twice,I had to wait at least 1 hour to be seated. They kindly ask you to wait at the bar as usual, but when your table is THAT delayed, they should comp a round or two of cocktails at the bar. The last time I expressed this to the host and they did send over two glasses of prosecco to several tables I saw but I think they could have done better.The food is mediocre and sub-par at best. The service and staff are friendly and always try to be as accomodating as they can be. The restaurant is aways busy as of course I mentioned can be a tourist trap especially around the holidays but I have a feeling the wait staff may not be huge fans of the food either because each time I have asked a waiter what they like or is this item on the menu good etc. I have gotten weird (maybe not so genuine) vibes...anyway my family and I have been unhappy with the food each time. With all that being said, I still love the restaurant for what it is and would go back....but never to have dinner there. Perhaps I would try the bar food next time but save your money and dine somewhere else-  just get cocktails at the bar before or after and listen to the jazz musicians- that is the best part of the place anyway.",0,0,0,L A.,"Manhattan, NY",151,37,0

3.0,12/7/2017,"Despite all the reviews saying that Tavern on the Green is a tourist trap (which, yes, it is) and that the food is subpar (read more below)... I still went because it was a date night and it was restaurant week and I had seen it a few times before and loved the ambiance and lights when I walked by. I had previously been here one random summer back in 2015 for a girls night. We sat outside under the lights and drank wine (the tab became very expensive after a few hours) and I remembered wanting to try sitting inside the restaurant and seeing how their dinner was. First impressions: It was freezing outside so we sat indoors in the glass enclosure which still gave us sight lines of the pretty lights twinkling against the glass and giving off a warm, romantic glow. I was there on a double date with really good friends and the company itself would have ensured a good experience. I loved the decor on the inside, it was a Monday night near closing but no reservations, no crowds, no wait time and we got very good seats (we were one of the few diners there, maybe 35% occupancy) despite it being restaurant week. That might have been the first red flag. The food wasn't very memorable. I had the braised beef pasta... the pasta was good, al dente like I like it.. but it's hard to mess up pasta, there was a very skimpy amount of beef. The sauce was good, but I just wish there was more of it. My bf had the chicken. It was a bit dry. but the green beans were good, crunchy and not wilted or overcooked (the couple we went with ordered the same dishes... it was restaurant week so the selection wasn't that big). We opted for the wine pairings, that was good... I love the wine selection but again, I wish there was more variety. Honorable mentions: We spent our time pre-dinner waiting for our friends at the the circular bar. The bartender (forgot his name) was very friendly and had great drink recommendations. We really enjoyed our brief 15 minutes at the bar and would probably more likely return to Tavern on the Green for drinks rather than dinner. The ambiance was just very romantic. I really liked our seating in the glass enclosure, maybe because there was barely anyone there... I'm sure if it was full of tourists and proved to be the tourist trap it's known for, I would revise my opinion... but as it were, on that Monday night it was perfect. I would like to explore the open seating area by the bar with all its cozy and romantic nooks with my boyfriend... it looks like a perfect spot to enjoy a drink and chat with a significant other/date.",12,5,9,Christine N.,"Manhattan, NY",376,78,1735
5.0,12/3/2017,"I've been here a couple times. In the summer, it is great to sit outside with a Bloody Mary or mimosa. Most recently (last night), we decided to come here for dinner. We weren't too hungry from a huge brunch so we decided to do wine and appetizers by the inside bar. We were seated almost immediately (make reservations) and our waiter James was fantastic! He was extremely attentive and made jokes to add to the energetic atmosphere. I got the truffle Mac & cheese while the person next to me ordered the garlic shrimp. We split them. I also tried some of the sweet potato soufflé, shrimp cocktail, and beet salad which were all good. The Mac and garlic shrimp were definitely the two best items we tried so I was very happy with our decision. All of us left very pleased with our experience. Due to the location, this is a heavily frequented restaurant by tourists but we were definitely treated as if they wanted us to come back again and again. As a local, I would recommend Tavern.

Just reading up on it on Wikipedia just now, turns out it reopened in 2014, I am glad the city of New York turned down Donald Trump's proposal otherwise it would be now be called ""TRUMP On The Green"" hahaFrom what I remember the restaurant was very beautiful and unique and a bit of a surprise just stopping by there after a pedicab ride and sightseeing in Central Park, we were hungry walking by and decided to dine there for dinner. It is or was very fancy in an old-time way surrounded by chandeliers and big glass windows that gave views of the park outside while you dined. I suppose that's why it's called ""the crystal room."" I did not have a jacket with me and was told that I could not be seated without one and had to purchase a windbreaker in the gift shop. Luckily they had a black windbreaker with the green Tavern On The Green name and logo on the shoulder which worked out great as it was on sale very cheap and became a favorite souvenir upon returning home.

She almost slammed the door in front of us and never even looked back and without eye contact brought us to our table. How rude is that?

4.0,9/22/2017,"This review is not for the ""tourist trap of a restaurant with mediocre food "" or what seems like a really formal dining space. I have never had a meal here so I cannot comment on that part. What this review is for is the wonderful outdoor bar.We often come here after work and its one of the few places where you can have a nice drink outdoors in the middle of Central Park. They have a good selection of cocktails but we usually order from their solid beer and wine list. The prices are no higher than many other Manhattan bars: $12-15 for wine, $8-9 for beer (no happy hour pricing though). The bartenders are friendly and attentive. And if you stay long enough after it gets a bit dark they turn on the outdoor lights that makes it all the more charming.Go here in summer after work, sit outdoors surrounded by greenery and have a drink or two while the weather is good.",0,0,0,Melville G.,"New York, NY",124,361,697

I met a friend for Sunday brunch. Wow, that brown sugar bacon is delicious. Sure, you kind of feel like you're eating half a pig but it's so tasty, you won't care. I had a 6 mile race that morning so I broke my no bread rule and ordered the French Toast. I was not sorry that I broke my rule. I ate the entire thing, which was not some disgusting, bloated bread slab with crappy compote and a gutter of syrup. It was refined and delicious and not too big, not too small.

4.0,9/11/2017,The best place in NYC for a Saturday or Sunday brunch.  Doesn't get any better place in a summer or spring or fall day to sit on the outside patio area to soak up the sun and enjoy the park while sipping some wine or champagne and enjoy brunch. The menu is just the right amount of breakfast and lunch food that will be enjoyable and filling. Yes the crystal room inside is also beautiful in the not so warm or sunny days and gives you a good view of the park. I am a New Yorker and have been coming to Tavern since 1981 and although it went through a major change about 4 years ago it is back on track to be an iconic location in NYC.  While it attracts the tourists don't let them have all the fun.

2.0,8/24/2017,"I'm giving this place only 2 stars because their staff shows not such great attitude. Was their for the first time on a Saturday afternoon. The place and vibe seemed very nice and friendly. It was crowded because it's a very popular place (there are barely any like this in Central Park) so I thought I'd have a great experience. It was a very hot day and my friends and I were baking under the sun so I asked a hostess to relocate us somewhere shady. I only asked that because there still was plenty of free space. She told me though that it's not possible and offered a different spot exposed to sun even more. Well, it is what it is so I said thank you but we will just relocate inside. Our bartender already had a cc and we only asked to get us a check. We were patiently waiting for 10 minutes before we asked her again. A couple next to us also was waiting. So the bartender looks at us and then and goes: ""holly sh....t!"". To hear something like that in such reputable place is outrages. I get this place is busy and sometimes it gets crazy, but showing your attitude in such manner is just not professional. All places can serve drinks but more important is to get a proper service which was not the case. I'm not giving it one star and will definitely give it another try. Hopefully, I'll have better experience next time.",0,0,0,Roman T.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,18,2
5.0,8/22/2017,"Tavern on the Green was one of the most delightful meals I'd had in ages! The restaurant is charmingly estled into a easily accessible side of central park. The front welcomes you with an attractive patio and the restaurant is only more charming as your proceed.We opted to eat inside since is was muggy out and were led to a table along the window that outlooked the back patio. We were promptly greeted by one of the best servers I've ever encountered named Brigg (spelling?). He was an endless supply of knowledge, an ever smiling face and always nearby to fulfill any needs we may have. I enjoyed a generous pour of pinot noir from Willamette, Oregon to begin, then had the mixed vegetable salad and the roasted vegetable and daily grain. The salad was bright, fresh and perfectly dressed with a tangy vinaigrette. The entree was unparalleled and had an assortment of grilled roasted mushrooms, squashes and eggplant on top of mixed grains I could identify as perhaps buglar pilaf?For dessert, I had a glass of Tokaji. This is a Hungarian dessert wine from the grape, furmint and is often hard to find by the glass.Overall, the meal, service and atmosphere made for my meal meal in New York by far! I couldn't recommend highly enough for a nice dinner in Manhattan! Loeb BoathouseI had such high hopes for this place and came pretty short of expectations. We had 8:30 dinner reservations that we were running a bit late for. We notified the restaurant of this 20 minute delay and there was no implication it would be a problem. The place is hard to find, to be honest. With multiple entrances and the hoststand back behind the bar. We came in and the restaurant was well over half full.Upon being seated, we were greeted and told 'the kitchen closes soon, so if you could ordered asap, that would be great'. This is a fine fact to communicate, but the delivery was a bit blunt.I ordered a glass of sauvignon bland, a mixed greens salad (sub vinaigrette for ranch) and their roasted woodear mushrooms and eggplant atop grains.Amount the staff, we could see several servers on their phone obviously and chatting in the corners of the restaurant. I saw my salad come out and the food runner attempt to give it to two different tables, before getting it correctly to me. It was dropped so quickly I couldn't point out that the dressing was incorrect. I waited to make eye contact with a server, then asked for a vinaigrette. The server returned promptly with just balsamic vinegar. Not exactly what I imagined.The entrees came out with nice timing and tasted wonderfully, but the service has been so impersonal and we felt unwanted. My meal had a melody of mushrooms and eggplant in a wonderful sauce. He enjoyed the salmon with a mango jalepeño reduction. We left with no hunger, but no real desire to return.

Unfortunately, the food was not great.  Not horrible, just not worthy of the ambiance. When you come to a somewhat pricey, gorgeous place, right in Central Park, you expect to be blown away with at least one of the menu choices you've selected. Had the steak tar tar, salmon, and another fish that we shared. The portions were generous. The steak tar tar was prepared well (consistency wise). It was just lacking in season/flavor. The salmon was a bit fishy. The other fish was better, but it was difficult to see our dishes (we were sat behind Teresa and had very little light) so it wasn't pleasant to eat, considering there were small bones we couldn't see...I will definitely return here, just not for the food.

The appetizers and entrees were both very average, nothing stood out and I didn't have the urge to really clean my plate. Felt that I could have had a similar dishes for less than half the price I had paid for. The dessert was the best part of the meal, and I would recommend the cheese cake. The carrot cake wasn't that bad but it tasted like something that had been left in the refrigerator for a while; it had that weird airy taste to it. anyway, its a place I would come for the vibe and I think I'll try it out again because their brunch menu seems interesting.

4.0,7/31/2017,"First, let me start by saying my brother first brought me here as a little girl and since then, I've absolutely loved it here. I only recently found out that Tavern on the Green reopened in which I was compelled to make a reservation here to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. As far as my experience goes, out of 5 stars, I would rate it as 4. The food surpassed my expectations and once again, Tavern on the Green has lived up to its reputable name. Our waiter Miles was very tentative to our request and provided us outstanding service. He was very knowledgeable and assisted in our entree decisions because he was able to understand our likes and dislikes. I especially would like to thank the manager who was on at the time, while I did not get his name, he was also very observant and understanding of our request. Going further however, as much as I wanted to rate my experience as a 5, I am giving it a 4 because of the hostesses as I was not pleased with the waiting time to be seated. My boyfriend and I arrived at approximately 6:40 p.m. and were not seated until after 7:15 p.m. in which I had to approach the desk and inquire about our table. Initially, we were told to have a seat at the bar, someone would be over to seat us when our table was ready. As time went on, we watched others get seated but were under the impression that because our reservation was at 7, we would not be seated until then. At 7:12, a hostess came over as asked if we had reservations. I told her yes and gave her my name, she said she would check on it and then did not return. At 7:15 she returned but walked right passed us to another party who had recently come in and led them to their table. At this point I was very upset because she did not even come back and inform me on the details of our reservation. When I went up to the desk, 3 hostesses were there and among them was the petite young woman with straight blonde hair tied up who had spoken to us a few minutes ago. With discontent, I mentioned to the tall woman of an Asian background (whom I initially spoke too as I came in) that we were still waiting to be seated. Once she looked me up, she replied ""oh, you should have been seated a while ago."" This made me very agitated as that was not the response I wanted to hear. After a few moments we were then seated.As I said, just about everything was all I had expected it to be, aside from this minor set back. I feel that your hostesses should be more attentive and communicate better with your guests. I would like to return here in the future and can only hope for a better experience. I am only bringing this to your attention because I would hate to have someone experience what I did, after all, first impressions mean everything and the hostesses are the ones who provide the first impression and set the mood. Honestly, had it not been for our waiter, I feel that my aggravation, because of this situation, as well as my experience would not have been so great. It is not a pleasant feeling to start a wonderful meal with such an inconvenience.",2,0,2,Rona R.,"Alexandria, VA",176,86,838

What more can I say. If you read my reviews you know that while I expect a hamburger at McDonald's, I don't exactly tell them how I want it cocked nor would I expect to receive it that way anyway.

At an off peak time like 3p they refuse to seat (in a half full outdoor patio) anyone looking for coffee and dessert at a table. That's for the bar (huh?) or sitting on communal outdoor sofas. But it's the manner in which you are informed by the rude little guy working the outdoor host stand that really completes the experience.

We sat indoors in the glass gazebo area at a great table.Our food is as excellent except the lobster roll, which tasted old... our bottle of wine was excellent for a hot day, we also had a killer shrimp cocktail, Cobb salad, and to die for creme brûlée. I should also mention that they refunded me for the lobster roll immediately! The service was great since we had a reservation, I think it's important for getting the right table...Love love this spot !!",1,1,1,Mary Ann F.,"Reno, NV",72,353,284
3.0,7/7/2017,"Service and ambience were beyond excellent.  The renovations make the place look so bright, open, and beautiful. Five stars for both!However, I felt the food wasn't so great, especially for the price. My husband got the skirt steak (cooked medium) and it was a bit chewy/rubbery and bland, which was a bit disappointing. I ordered the salmon burger which was very juicy but just didn't taste ""right"" - it was too fishy for me (I understand salmon is a fish, but I've tasted salmon burgers with less of the fishy taste). The sweet potato fries were tasty, but the way they served it (in one of those metal cups) made the ones on the bottom rather soggy. The Caesar salad was good though, with very crisp and green baby romaine. But, who can mess up on a Caesar salad, right? :)Overall, 3 stars because the setting was amazing and the experience was lovely! But, a restaurant should also be enjoyed for its food, should it not?",0,0,0,Susan S.,"Leawood, KS",0,8,1

We came here for dinner before heading over to the Metropolitan Opera House to see the ballet. My daughter had the salmon with lentils, roasted veggies, and beurre blanc. I tried it and although the salmon was perfectly cooked, the whole thing was fairly bland. Less bland was my beer braised short ribs with aligot and mushrooms - although there were very few mushrooms on my plate. The service - once we got some - was good. Initially we were apparently forgotten about, as we sat there for about 15 minutes with no one stopping, no water, nothing. Our very sweet waitress did comp us our dessert, which was nice.

5.0,6/26/2017,"Like most NYers, I'd known about Tavern on the Green for a long time, but never thought they were a viable option for dinner and drinks. After attending the NY Philharmonic concert in the park, my friend and I decided to drop by for dinner and drinks since we were already there.As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by two very friendly hosts. I asked to be seated indoors in fear of mosquitos. As we were being led to our table, I caught a glimpse of the amazing outdoor space, and immediately changed my mind. The host didn't even bat an eye, and took us to a table outdoors.The waiter was equally as friendly. He was knowledgeable about the menu and dinner specials, and was the perfect amount of attentive. We ordered an appetizer that came with crostini; he walked by, saw we were running low, and without us even asking, went to get us more. Such great service!!The cocktails were moderate. I had a blueberry mint lemonade, which had too much mint in it and was reminiscent of something medicinal. My friend, however, had the peach sangria, which was light and refreshing.For food, we had the beef carpaccio, which had really great flavors, but didn't overpower the taste of raw beef. Similarly, our entrees (salmon and scallops) were seasoned well but the freshness and taste of the seafood were very prominent.",5,1,3,Juliana T.,"Manhattan, NY",220,265,553
2.0,6/25/2017,"This was probably one of the worst places I went to on my trip to New York. The service was extremely slow, the food overpriced and lacking, and the drinks were just okay.

4.0,6/19/2017,"This place is so stunningly BEAUTIFUL! There are two areas to sit, inside the glass room (which is a good enough reason to justify the visit) as well as outside on their patio. Located in Central Park the restaurant is a perfect place to stop for lunch or dinner, after a peaceful walk in the park. We went in for lunch with a party of 6. We had made a reservation however we were still asked to wait for about 20 min while they ""got our table ready"" which kinda put a damper on my already hangry mood. Once seated the service continued to be sub-par. They forgot a friend's order of the salmon burger which we had to re-order twice, they ended up taking it off the check as the rest of the party was done eating by the time it finally arrived. I ordered the steak tartar which was a good portion size despite technically being an appetizer; it was tasty but a little too oily and the toasted baguette it came with was soft and chewy. The Cobb salad was good, and the burger was delish. I would definitely recommend a visit just because the venue is so gorgeous, however the food wasn't that great to justify the steep prices and bad service.",2,1,3,Renee S.,"Miami, FL",397,98,203

1.0,6/17/2017,"Awful service. Without question, the worst customer service I've had anywhere in Manhattan. Overpriced, small, subpar drinks. Sitting at the bar inside because it was full outside. The inside was pretty quiet, not busy at all. We were ignored and never greeted by the bartender after sitting down. We needed to wave the bartender down for a drink menu. After getting the menu, ignored again. Wave the bartender down to order our drinks, we get them a few minutes later. Someone in the group wants to order food, so we ask for a food menu. It took about ten minutes (and asking the bartender again) to get the food menu. Needless to say, we finished our 15 dollar drinks and didn't order any food. I'm sure it would have taken about four hours to get it. Complete waste of time and money.

My boyfriend ordered a scotch and was served a dirty glass. It took fifteen minutes to get the attention of an employee to receive a fresh glass.Another con is the congested seating. We were sitting so close to other tables that I could clearly listen to their conversations. The price we paid for our meals was too high for our sub par experience.

5.0,5/10/2017,"Overjoyed that I was recently able to come here and check it off my buck list. We made reservations for 11am so we were here during lunch. The place is absolutely stunning!!! We sat in the sunroom, I was a bummed that they  got rid of  the old dining area I thought the old design ( the one in many photos) was more suiting and nostalgic for the place. The staff was great and accommodating. My friends and I has cocktails, I went with the Rose sangria and thought it was delicious and refreshing. We then split 2 salads the Cobb and the sirloin. The salads were good however, I thought they both had way to much lettuce and not enough ""stuff"" I had to order additional sides of toppings to give it variety. We also had the Avocado toast and loved it!!!! If you are in town with a date, or Mom, or group of girlfriends get in here and make some memories.

It was a 1/8 inch slice of grilled chicken, and it was $25!!!. Served with a handful of spring salad. This dish haunts me because I've had so many dishes better. Just a thin sliced grilled chicken??? Robert Irving needs to fix this dish. I had to add the two piece cod's lemon dressing to give the chicken and salad flavor. Thank goodness I gave him my salmon.

At least, they gave us free drinks at the bar while we waited. FOOD: disappointed. I ordered the eggs benedict, that usually come with a salad and/or potatoes on the side. They came alone with nothing on the side. They weren't that good. A few people ordered the burger and were happy about it, and same with the side of bacon that was good. The fries were good too.

Thankfully made friends with Sarah (don't know if she still works there) but she made my experience here so nice for a couple times. I once got a mushroom risotto but the kitchen rushed to make my food and it turned out wayyy too sweet I couldn't take another bite. Sarah got it off the check and I instead ordered a different entree and a drink instead. Some of their drinks are super strong, so I always asked for a recommendation for light drinks. Got the strawberry lemonade with rum (it was a seasonal drink) and it was so delicious. Got the long island next time and it came out too strong it just tasted like alcohol. And for the desserts... I liked their creme brulee, but tried the lava cake after and it came out too dry it was hard to swallow. Come here for drinks, but even then... its kinda inconsistent.

4.0,3/5/2017,"This was a ""let's get a drink while we're here"" type of idea, and it ended up being a pleasant surprise. We were here in Mid-November, and given that both of us have adapted to South Florida winters (yet neither are native) we were unpleasantly surprised when the sun set at around 4:45 pm and left us chilly on an unseasonably warm, 65 degree November day. We decided to warm up with some alcoholic imbibement and the bartender was more than happy to oblige. We sat by the bar while trying to soak up any ounce of sunshine peeking between the skyscrapers possible. The decor here is absolutely gorgeous, I wouldn't be surprised if this was a popular wedding reception venue. The drinks here are Manhattan priced, they're not overly priced in general. A lot of the people complaining about the price probably don't understand NYC inflation in general. We didn't order food here but didn't stay long enough. The decor and service and drink pour sizes (for $16 for wine you expect half a glass, and they were certainly generous on that margin) were more than enough to bring us back after our next time gallivanting in Central Park even though we are thousands of miles away.

As for the Benedict it was nothing impressive. Our server wasn't the greatest.

4.0,2/12/2017,"Tavern on the Green is an iconic NY restaurant located within Central Park. It's a bit on the higher-end (i.e. pricey) but then again you're paying for quality food, cocktails and ambience. I've been here 5 times now, not because I'm affluent but because my university used to have their annual Winter Ball galas here (I went each year so 4x) and my 5th time was yesterday's for a ""Galentine's"" brunch. This was my first time being here since their renovation and it was BEAUTIFUL. Upon entering I was greeted by a handsome fellow in a velvet top hat. I wish this happened everywhere I went. Their main lobby area feels like a cross between Game of Thrones and Disney's Cinderella...the prince's castle...if it had a luxurious beer garden...ski slope cabin. Yeah, that's a lot...use your imagination and just know it was beautiful.Further to the back in the dining area it's just flat out princess-like. There I was in a red winter Snoopy sweater because it's cold and snowy out but I'm here, it was warm and fancy AF. They did a really beautiful job with their renovations. It looked much bigger, brighter and much more breathtaking than I remembered it.For brunch I started with their bread basket which had a few different things in it. I opted for their mini croissant with their sea-salted butter. It was fluffy, buttery and virtually a perfect little croissant. I also went with their Canadian bacon eggs Benedict Florentine, a side of creamy Irish gravy with a biscuit and my dessert was Tahitian vanilla creme brûlée.As expected everything was fantastic especially the creamed spinach layered on my eggs benedict English muffins and the creme brûlée, it was actually divine. My only gripe was the ham was a tad weird texturally. But everyone else who ordered eggy benedict seemed to enjoy theirs. Things I also got to try were the salmon filet (really nicely prepared in a buttery wine sauce), their brunch pizza (bacon and cheese on a pizza is never a bad idea!) and their breakfast sausage (perfect crispy exterior and really phenomenally juicy meat - best breakfast sausage I've had in a loooooong time). Beverage wise I had an iced coffee and one of their seasonal cocktails on their menu for this month - it was called the Lady Capulet and it was gin, pomegranate liquor, fresh lemon juice and egg white (I might be slightly off as I'm recanting this from my memory and can't find it online).

3.0,2/11/2017,"I really wanted to like Tavern on the Green, but there's just too much that goes wrong to justify anything more than a three-star rating.To be sure, the Tavern is lovely. Just beautiful. Outdoor seating was closed, as it was cold and a bit snowy, but the inside is lovely, with nice, warm taupe throughout. The outside looks even more beautiful, but again, no going out there. Additionally, service was adequate and friendly, if a bit slow.The problems start with the menu. Here's the menu: salmon, chicken, steak, a burger, a pasta dish. Nothing exciting, nothing fresh. Hell, one can't even order the ""classic caesar salad"" with anchovies.  It's like in the 1950s, they looked at the menu, said ""Golly, this is great!,"" and have kept it static since then. If it was good enough for the 1950s, it's ... no, it's not good enough for now. The food is wholly unimaginative; the restaurant definitely needs a new executive chef (or an executive chef who is given full reign). Then there's the food. I ordered the dry aged sirloin, rare. The first steak I ordered came out between medium to medium-well. I thought a moment about eating it as is, but this is a $54 steak. I sent it back, one of the very, very few times I've sent something back. The second one came out between medium-rare to medium. At this point, I was starving, so I mentioned it was still overcooked and dug in. The unfortunate thing about the steak was that it was obviously a very high-quality cut of meat. It's a bit flabbergasting that a restaurant serving a $54 steak can't nail the temperature after two tries. To be fair, however, after the two strikes, I was not charged for the steak. My wife, not exceptionally thrilled with the menu choices, had a burger, which was fine.Dessert was a high point. I think we might have just had ice cream, but the ice cream, which we were informed was made in house, was fantastic.In all, this is a restaurant that could be excellent if they could get the food right.

2.0,2/11/2017,"I wanted to love this place. Gosh I wanted to. I made reservations for restaurant week because of the history, however my friends in NYC said DONT DO IT! My friends who travel here said DO IT. I should have listened to my NYC locals. Yes restaurant is stunning.  We were here during a snow storm so couldn't enjoy the outdoor area which is a shame. The bar area is cozy and you do get a feel for the old school ambience. The dining area is new, chic, and in all round beautiful class enclosure. We had a very nice spot by the windows to see the outdoors. It was a stunning view. Here's where it goes downhill. I am NOT chalking it up to restaurant week because a good restaurant should give you the entire dining experience no matter the time of year or event. We ordered wine paired with restaurant week courses. The courses were extremely rushed and meals were brought out within seconds of our last dish being picked up. We hadn't even finished our glass of wine before our next course was brought out. No where in our evening could we just sit back, relax and enjoy our meal without being pushed along.The braised beef short rib pasta was just meh. Nothing special about it what so ever. The roasted organic chicken breast tasted  like a meal you'd get at a wedding or benefit. Again, nothing to make me say, wow, I'm at Tavern on the Green, what an amazing chef. The waiter was about to pick up my friend's main course before he was even done. It was all just rush, rush, rush, rush. Totally unsatisfying dining experience for such a legendary place. I sent back the warm fudge brownie sundae because the brownie was bland and dry. I was able to pick another choice. The carrot cake was about the only good thing I tasted all night. After dinner we had one drink in the bar. I wish we had ONLY done this! My advice, if you want to come here - do drinks ONLY!

3.0,2/6/2017,"I came here for dinner the other evening with two of my girlfriends. We picked Tavern on the Green because of a photo we had seen as an advertisement for NYC Restaurant Week. It was of a pasta dish that looked absolutely delicious, we knew we had to try it. We made a reservation beforehand and were seated right away when we arrived. The lounge and bar area when you first walk in is very warm and inviting. The restaurant itself is beautiful, very nicely decorated with endless glass windows. I caught myself looking out the windows most of the time because the view was beautiful. Our server was friendly and helpful and explained the Restaurant Week menu to us. Since we had all seen the photo of the pasta dish previously, we all wanted to try that and it was a first course. When the server brought the pasta dish, which was rigatoni with braised beef short rib, I was surprised at how small the portion was. Much to my disappointment, the pasta dish was terrible! The meat tasted way too game-y and the dish was basically just pasta with bits of meat in it, no sauce or anything. The dish was so bad that I took a couple small bites, then left the rest. It tasted and smelled like canned dog food. My two friends didn't care for the way the pasta tasted either. For the main course, I ordered the roasted chicken, which was two pieces of bone-in white meat chicken. It also came with green beans and mashed potatoes. I enjoyed the chicken dish very much and was grateful for it after receiving the horrific pasta dish. For dessert, I chose the black and white cheesecake, which was a small, circular cake. I ended up taking my dessert to go and enjoyed it later on. The fixed price for the Restaurant Week menu was $42, which usually isn't bad for a three course meal. However, my only complaint about Tavern on the Green (besides the braised short rib pasta) is that for $42, their portions are very small. On the way out, we browsed in the gift shop, which has some pretty cute things for sale.

2.0,1/31/2017,"Beautiful interior, great spot to sit down and get a drink with a massive lounge/wraparound bar. Can't judge the quality of the drinks as I didn't get one, but they'll run you about $15. Went for restaurant week, and can safely recommend that you avoid this in the future. Food is mediocre, service is rushed, then non-existent.Started with the ""beef short rib"" pasta which I almost laughed at when presented. I think there was one cornichon, nearly 0 sauce of any kind, and was laughably lacking in any unique taste/consistency. So so bad. The ginger/carrot soup was OK for me, could have been served warmer. For the entrees, the salmon and cauliflower were both solid - nothing flashy, but tasted fine. This is the point that the waiter rushed over and spilled wine on me as he was giving me the second glass of wine from the wine pairing that came with the meal (not recommended. Stick with a draft beer and/or cocktail). Took him a while to realize club soda may be a good call to fix the situation. I had the cheesecake for dessert and GF had the brownie a la mode. Cheesecake was excellent, brownie was terrible - like, sitting-for-a-week-in-the-pan dry. Vanilla ice cream was, well, vanilla. Avoid this dessert at all cost. Too many negatives to outweigh the positives for a restaurant week dinner, and they ONLY offer RW menu until RW is over. Avoid until then - and be hesitant then, previous reviews don't look any better.",2,0,0,Griffin R.,"Alpharetta, GA",169,34,0

I am sure it will be much prettier when it's a warmer day on an afternoon or something. Anyhow, our server was very attentive. He took down all of our orders which we all ordered from the restaurant week menu. I started out with the short rib pasta as my app which was soooo delicious, salmon for the entrée which was cooked perfectly and then we all shared the desserts they had together which was the cheesecake, carrot cake and the brownie sundae. All the food came out hot and fast. I didn't have a bad experience like others did. I wouldn't mind going back again to try their brunch.

4.0,1/24/2017,"My experience is based on day 1 of restaurant week Jan 23rd 2017. It was a beautiful quintessential rainy New York day in Central Park. We were greeted by a well-appointed gentleman in a black top hat and shoal and immediately transferred back to the Victorian age of New York upon entering the Tavern on the Green. You can just feel the aristocracy and upper class design with colors that are warm and subdued. The showcase displayed deep rich walnut, marble, mahogany browns, dark oak, and shades of burgundy vintage fabrics and trims. With an open fireplace and pleasant music of the 40's, we knew we were ready for a good time! Of course we opted for the Restaurant Week 3-course dinner @ $42 and I went for the additional $20 wine pairing with 3 heavy pours for each course; what a deal!They began by serving us a round individual artisan bread roll that came out nice and warm.  However, it was toasted a bit much and it was so hard, we had to add lots of butter just to softening it up. And attempting to cut through it, the crumbs flew everywhere! And I mean EVERYWHERE!!! Course #1 Frisee, Blue Cheese, & Toasted Walnut Salad vs Braised Beef Short Rib Pasta. WINE- Pinot Grigio: This was an amazing light, crisp and dry white wine with a clean finish. It certainly boasts a mix of flavors on the tongue with hints of Fruity, acidic, lime, honeysuckle, and floral notes producing a balanced and refreshing taste. SALAD: Absolutely divine! Never thought I could be so excited for a salad, but boom it happened. The frisee was beautifully presented making it very easy to eat.  The fresh blue cheese crumbles were potent, creamy and not too overwhelming! The toasted walnuts were to die for and really became the star of the dish! The Dijon vinaigrette rounds out the whole salad giving you a nice citrus kick. Mouth still watering! PASTA: A tab over seasoned to my taste, however, I feel most braised beef tends to be on the salty. The short rib itself was tender and plentiful with perfect al dente mezze rigatoni pasta really making a filling and hearty dish. I love the bits of cornichons giving the pasta a nice snap in texture. Although, I feel the fresh spinach was lacking, and you really need to pair this with the bread in order to stomach each bite. Good thing you get as much bread as you like, but again, hard as rock! Verdict: Salad for sure! I would just avoid the pasta unless you are a heavy eater.Course #2 Wood Grilled Scottish Salmon vs Roasted Organic Chicken Breast. WINE- Malbec: This Red wine so smooth and fruity I loved every drop. This was so easy  to drink, but still deep and full to taste. FISH: The salmon was skinless and the sear was ok. It came out piping hot and tasted as if it was finished in the oven.  When I see ""wood grilled"" salmon, I'm looking for that wood grill finished flavor. Oven finish on salmon gives a particular flavor I'm not a huge fan of. However, the warm lentil and roasted vegetables were a great accompaniment to the fish. That with a warm beurre blanc sauce brings the whole dish together in a wonderful marriage. CHICKEN: This was a bit undersold as it was not a chicken breast that came out, but a third of a small whole chicken that included the thigh and leg. I immediately noticed the crispy skin and tired that to my delight; perfectly seared skin for a perfect crunch bursting with flavor. Unfortunately, the actual breast of the chicken was a bit dry, whereas the thigh was juicy. The parmesan whipped mash was smooth, silky, and absolutely amazing. But to make the mash from amazing to out of this world was the chicken gravy that produced such a wonderful browned chicken flavor! Atop of fresh haricots verts just made the dish more enjoyable. Seasoning was on point and the dish made the protein the star! Verdict: Both! Can't go wrong with either dish!Course #3 Black & White Cheesecake vs Carrot Cake. Wine- Tawny Port: This young port was a bit bitter, and was served room temp. Surprisingly, it was only ok, when now wondering if the bottle was kept open too long? It had a light ruby color and not as sweet or thick as the aged ports I'm used to. CHEESECAKE: OMG this blew me away! Everything was perfect from the crunchy cookie bottom, the rich and smooth cake! The Black and White Chocolate Sauce just made it better! It was the perfect portion size for that sweet creamy indulgence you crave after a heavy meal. Cake: Wow! I'm not a huge sweets fan, and I know carrot cake can be overly sweetened to make up for bland carrots. This was NOT the case here! This carrot cake gave you such a cozy, home-at-Mother's-house-for-the-holidays feeling in every bite. Not overly sweet, topped with a wonderful cream cheese icing and caramelized pineapple bite for a great touch. The cake was moist, dense, and quite filling. Verdict: Cheesecake! To end, I have to mention the service was perfect and very attentive. I was very surprised by the portion size and this is the FIRST time i had leftovers.

2.0,1/17/2017,"Terrible experience.I've been here many times throughout my life (when it was fancy, to a special event, to the casual dining venue that it is now).  I understand that it is a staple in NYC and the space itself is gorgeous, which is why I give it any stars.We had an 11:45 reservation on Saturday (January 14th) for my parents anniversary.  I check in at 11:45 and the rest of of my party came in around 11:50.  Fine, a little late but according to my confirmation email via Open Table, they hold the reservation for 15 minutes.  I made a reservation for 7 people with a highchair (8 spaces).  They questioned why i made a reservation for 8, when i felt like i had to defend myself that ""no, i made a reservation for 7 and need extra space for a high chair.""  The hostesses seemed mad at me for that (not my fault) and probably held that against me.We saw large parties like us getting seated before us that got there later than we did (after our whole party was here).  We got seated at 12:15 (30 min wait) I get that sometimes there is a wait even if there are reservations but the fact that every one got seated first bugged me.  We were THE ONLY party waiting in the front waiting to be seated.  In addition, the hostesses were very rude.  No apologies, rolled their eyes at us when we checked in to see the status (hostess originally said we'd  be seated by Noon), the hostess that seated us told us to ""come on"" when our table was finally ready, again no apologies, no smiles, threw the menus on the table and left.*Note, i don't expect royal treatment but a little friendliness goes a long way.I can pardon the wait, but the service really sucked.",2,0,0,Ngan H.,"New York, NY",64,126,1

I order the Bloody Mary, which was awesome! My husband and I shared some clams and oysters from the raw bar. They were very flavorful. For our main course, I had the wild mushroom risotto and my husband and fish and chips. The risotto was incredible! Very flavorful.

As I told her the situation, she interrupted and said, It's not a problem. We'll get you seated when we can. It was just so cold.

It is indeed quite beautiful inside with the lighting and the cozy fireplace. The food is just average with a hefty price. I honestly just went for the experience.

4.0,10/30/2016,"We came here on a beautiful fall Sunday for brunch. I was a little skeptical because last time I was here many years ago the food was ahhh and the drinks were $$$$. However being told that they changed and updated everything I was willing to give another try . Unfortunately because it was a nice day all the outdoor seats were taken and there was a 45 min wait for a table. So we opted for indoors . Here is my thoughts:1) Decor - the place is gorgeous . Old world wealth and charm meets updated and modern . Heavy woods and stone with updated bathrooms and the glass room with glass chandeliers which feels like your outside however you're in. 2) food- we had brunch . Like I said I wasn't expecting the best and I was completely wrong . Every single thing was delicious . We tried and recommend the eggs Benedict -Florentine combo , the French toast and the biscuit with sausage gravy . Yum yum and yum again . 4) staff and pricing - waiter was nice and good but nothing extra . Once we got our food he really didn't check on us . As for pricing , as expected the prices are high ( but better then the past ) bc your paying for location, history and atmosphere . However with how good the brunch was and how beautiful the place is, I was cool with it .  Totally recommend !",2,0,0,James V.,"Hawthorne, NJ",24,99,460

4.0,10/28/2016,"I'm a litle torn writing about Tavern on the Green. Without a doubt, the restaurant is a true a icon in New York City's dining history. Closures and chef shuffles aside, it's also inarguably one of the most beautiful restaurants in the city, with some of the most incomparable views of Central Park that you'll find. The venue is typically best reserved for special occasions and nicer nights out, but my friend and I found ourselves here on a weekday evening after work with no particular occasion that need celebrating.I'll touch briefly on the ambiance, but the all-white decor and interior is nothing short of stunning, and the wall-to-floor windows that look out on Central Park make for an ideal brunch or early dinner view. There's also an open kitchen where guests can watch as dishes are plated and finished before being sent out, as well as a number of seating options for parties of any size. Space here is not an issue, but making a reservation in advance wouldn't hurt, especially to make sure there isn't a special event or private party being held here.As for the food, the dishes available on the menu are surprisingly few, but perhaps it's for the better. We started off wth the Pan-Seared Scallops, which immediately reminded me of the ones I'd had at Jean-Georges. They weren't particularly thick, perhaps just a centimeter or so in height, but were served with a delicious caulifower puree and a brown butter sauce, and were garnished with golden raisins. While they had a slightly rubbery texture, the overall balance of flavors that perfectly paired the sweetness of the scallops with the savory cauliflower, made for a delicious, albeit small, starter.My friend and I both opted for the Coq au Vin as our mains, and Tavern on the Green took this rustic, homey dish and transformed it into an elegant entree. The chicken had been braised in a red wine sauce which imparted that signature tang and bite into the protein. While i wish there had been more sauce to pair with it, the chicken was nonetheless tender and flavorful, and easily fell off the bone with the prodding of the fork. Paired with some whipped potatoes, crisp haricot verts, and a surprisingly satisfying slice of garlic bread, it was an elevated take on a classic that we both enjoyed. As for the side of white cheddar Mac and Cheese, we both felt that it lacked the necessary bite in an aged cheddar to make it truly memorable.To finish off the meal, we ended up decinding on the Whiskey Cake to share. The cake, for the curious, most definitely is made with whiskey; upon first bite, my tastebuds were immediately overwhelmed by the unmistakable flavor of the alcohol. It's not for the faint of heart, but after several more bites, I started to appreciate the pairing of whiskey with the date cake, which was generously doused in a sticky toffee suace and paired with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.While Tavern on the Green has seen its fair share of trials and tribulations over the years, I can at least say from my visit here that it's a truly unique restaurant in NYC. Yes, it's not a place to come for a casual meal, but for the days that you're willing to spend a little more to dine in a gorgeous venue... you really can't go wrong.",11,4,10,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

Cooking temperatures on seafood was a bit off leaving dry shrimp and crab on our seafood tower and well done sea bass. The beef selection was limited to dry aged sirloin.

The skin was crisp and the fish was cooked nicely on the whole, though I had a few bites that were slightly overcooked.My wife went with haricot verts for her side item.

I was half expecting some throw-away cut of steak with tons of grizzle, but it was really nice. 8/10.I mistakenly chose the roasted baby vegetables as my side. These were terrible. Bland. I should have gone with the creamy whipped potato option instead, but I thought it would be an overload of potato items since they were already in both entrees.The shared carrot cake for dessert was flavorful and moist, but it sort of had the texture of a fruit cake.

I will say in the summer it's great because you get to sit outside in the park and enjoy the great weather. Other than that, I don't know why else you would come here. The food is mediocre at best and the service is just okay. It's expected you'd pay a premium to eat inside Central Park, but honestly it's just not worth the price. I'd rather eat at the Smith or Bar Boulud and walk over to the park. If you absolutely have to eat in the park, I'd suggest Central Park Boathouse, the food is slightly better and with a nice view. It's funny because I'll hear tourists walking through Central Park and someone will say how Tavern on the Green is a famous restaurant in NYC and they heard from their friend who visited that the food there is amazing and next time they should come and check it out.

My nephew Mark took me there to celebrate his grandfather's birthday. Mark had the whole fish - he hated it. I has the same. It was a farm raised midget fish. His grand dad had pork chops which came breaded like pancakes and impossible to cut so he had to pick it up and eat it with his hands. This place is tourist trap with cheap wine at $50 a bottle. The atmosphere is totally artificial and plastic. The service was okay but i notice they hired mostly blacks which a lot of other places could not get away with because of discrimination against Hispanic and Whites.

Unfair to compare, the original was my very favorite place when I first moved to the city - having attended a couple events and a dinner there. The ambiance both inside and outside with lights and maybe lanterns dangling from the trees.  I found it magical and breathtaking and at that point the most memorable place I had ever been. When you adore a place as one of your first experiences in a city, it is pretty hard to compare or beat the original.  I was very disappointed when they closed. I was thrilled when they reopened. Last year for a Sunday brunch, live music playing in the background, was my first time back. The most recent visit was after a walk through the park at dusk - when I have wanted to go and - the lights, while not the same as before, are still  definitely my favorite aspect of the Tavern ambiance giving it a romantic magical quality.Service has always been above and beyond fantastic and friendly every time I have been here.  The double tier seafood tower was wonderful: mixed oysters, clams, shrimp and crab claws.  And the mashed potatoes were probably thee best mashed potatoes I have ever had.

We got the beet salad and the cold potato soup. I probably wouldn't have ordered these normally, but they were delicious. I also had the chicken with quinoa. The chicken is cut incredibly thin and was moist. My only complaint was that there wasn't enough sauce, which was most of the flavor of the dish. My boyfriend had the salmon and loved it. He had the blueberry compote for dessert and I had the chocolate mousse. Both were fantastic, but I'm more of a chocolate fan. The mousse is described as bittersweet, but it is more like milk chocolate in sweetness. I'd recommend it overall.  If you're a New Yorker, it feels obligatory to go at least once.

It was very busy but they handled it reasonably well.We had a 3:00 reservation and were seated promptly at 3 inside in a sunny little spot with a view of the outdoor seating area.Service was excellent as usual. The waiter was very helpful, knowlegable and accomadating. On this hot summer day our water glasses were continually replenished and our dishes cleared immediately WITHOUT giving the impression they were trying to rush you.Ordering off the restaurant week menu we had the Watermelon SaladTried this because I felt like being adventurous. I've seen different versions of this salad being offered all summer but never tried it before. Glad I did. It is really a cool refreshing salad. The fresh, sweet watermelon was cut into perfecly bite-sized pieces. And sprinkled with feta cheese, bacon and a drizzle of something (I can't remember what) that gave it a deliciously sweet salty flavor that was awesome.Roasted Beet SaladExcellent. The beets had a tasty, earthy flavor. The salad consisted of red and white beets. Very generous portion.SalmonGrilled to delicate, tender perfection.Grilled ChickenI think this was the most beautiful if not tastiest dish of the meal. It was like art on a plate.Strawberry ShortcakeMy friend loved it and it looked very tasty. Generous serving size that could easily be sharedChocolate Mousse Tasty BUT omg, the presentation. Um. Chocolate horizontally smeared across a plate with a dolop of mousse in the center. I'm sorry, not saying it wasn't delicious, but I AM saying it looked like someone had an accident on a plate.

Ding ding there's our server, who after more than 10 minutes still didn't even bother to come over when we clearly were waiting to order atleast drinks. We got a glass of wine and a baileys with coffee. I'm in the industry and that takes about 2 minutes to pour. We were sitting directly in front of the bar. The bartender also seemed like they could care less about doing their job. Watched her chat with her coworkers after glancing at the drink ticket. Finally puts the drinks up and I literally sat there and watched them for another 10 minutes. When he saunters over and decides to bring our drinks I am not hiding my annoyance. We ordered some sort of flatbread that was very bland and not surprisingly disappointing. Somehow the bill still managed to be $45.

On a nice day, dine in the Crystal room to enjoy the warmth of the sun and upscale dining experience.

5.0,7/21/2016,"I've been to Tavern on the Green twice, and both were very different experiences. The first time was June 2015 and it was abysmal. We had a slow server, a horrible table, and it took hours to get our food. We had a show to get to, and after over two hours of not getting our food we insisted we speak to the manager. He was mildly apologetic and our food came out promptly. Before starting in on our meal, we asked for the check because we would need to get moving if we were going to catch our show. When we did eat, the food was underwhelming to say the least. We hurried through our meal and were finished several minutes before the server returned with the check. I believe he offered us a free dessert, although I can't be sure he even did that. Given our state of hurry, we denied and left. My second experience there was in June 2016, and it could not have been more different. When making the reservation a few weeks ahead of time, we had mentioned in passing that we had a bad experience there the year prior. Upon arriving we were shown to our seats (an excellent table in an excellent location), had a funny, helpful, and prompt server (whose name I cannot recall at the moment), and enjoyed a delicious meal that was served very quickly. We enjoyed the evening very much. After our meal we ordered drinks and desserts and then the manager came to drop off the bill. This was not the same manager from a year ago, and it showed in the way he handled the situation. He told us the hostess had made a note when we made our reservation and he was made aware of our previous experience at the restaurant. As an apology, he compensated us by removing our after dinner expenses. I believe his words were, ""I understand the service when you were here last year was a little less than expected, so your bill tonight should be a little less than expected."" He had removed around $70 of desserts and drinks without prompting, just to make up for the mistakes of his predecessors. After a short conversation where we explained our experience last time, he assured us that server would certainly not be kept on board had that happened under his watch, and expressed genuine regret and apology that we had encountered such a negative experience.I truly cannot speak highly enough of the staff, largely because of this exceptional manager.

Would expect more from such a legendary name.  The only thing worse than the food was the service...brunch is an institution in NY and this was in the bottom 10 brunch experiences I've had. Not kidding and not exaggerating. Don't go expecting the old tavern on the green. ALL TOURISTS. Few locals and made total sense once we sat down. Rush people in and out service stinks. More fitting if it was in time square. Really sad and totally disappointed. Clearly trading the name of tavern on the green with nothing else in common. AVOID AVOID AVOID. If you're in the area - do the boat house instead. Better food, view, service.",4,0,0,Corey H.,"CANAL STREET, NY",0,6,0

When we entered the restaurant, we were initially greeted by the blatant rudeness of who I believe to be the Maitre D'. She was a taller short haired, dark-skinned woman who I think is named Shaneekuh? (that spelling is probably completely wrong). She barely even looked at us when we were checking in, she faked a smile when she talked to us, and then she proceeded to tell the younger woman next to her take ""take care of this"" as she left and was never seen by us again. The girl who she handed us over too was actually very nice, I think her name was Robin (I asked another one of the hosts each of their names so I could write this.)

3.0,6/12/2016,"Came here with a group from work to celebrate a team members 5 year anniversary. We arrived on time for our reservation and then waited over 30 minutes to be seated, having to recheck with the host after 30 minutes had passed. We were taken a an outdoor table in an awesome courtyard with strings of lights and a live band. A colleague was sitting awkwardly close to another due to an outdoor umbrella with a large base not allowing him to sit properly in front of the table. We asked the server to have it moved. She came back a few minutes later and said, politely, that it couldn't be moved. I told her it actually was a problem and we needed it moved or to move to a new table. She brought over her manager who after seeing the situation was able to move the umbrella for us. Overall, the service was okay. Everyone was polite however they tried multiple times to bring us the wrong food and drink along with having to wave any staff down for assistance or to order. We started with a pitcher of the blackberry lemonade cocktail. Clever way to serve cocktails to a large table however quite tough to serve a proper drink with all the ice really wanting to stay in the pitcher and no spoon to be able to get it out. We had the east and west coast oysters with mignonette, yum! The crab meat appetizers was quite nice with large pieces of fresh meat and avocado. The shrimp that came in the shrimp cocktail were large and tasty! We shared a couple of salads, the chopped vegetables were good and something I'd order again even as a main. For the main I had the scallops which were nicely seared and with a light pesto sauce over risotto. I think polenta or mashed potatoes would have been a better pairing. For dessert we all shared the whiskey cake with ice cream and tasty sauce and carrot cake, both which were large and good for sharing with a table. The ambience is a total 5 star with the lights, live music, and dancing. The food is a 3 star; good but not mind blowing. The service is a 2 star from being seated to having to really advocate to actually have a table that say 5 instead of one person nearly sitting in another's lap.",3,0,0,Karen J.,"Seattle, WA",298,167,374
2.0,6/11/2016,We were walking through Central Park on our last day visiting New York City and thought the tavern looked like a quint place to eat. They have 3 different menus and it seemed like we got the worst one... My husband got the wedge salad which looked like it was the size of a hard boiled egg for $16 and I ordered the Caesar salad with chicken for $26 which was also underwhelming. We were in a rush to check out the rest of Central Park and was hoping we could get through lunch quickly but the service was terrible. It took 45 minutes to get our food and I had to leave while the husband paid because it was taking so long. We found out the pub was serving much better food so we wish we would have either gone there or the to go line so we could have saved some time.

4.0,5/31/2016,"Baking in the sun & enjoying 'greens' for review #420.The irony of that statement is that very few stoners could actually afford to eat here (not to mention the majority would be drastically under-dressed).  This restaurant has been around since 1934 and has garnered quite the reputation, having served millions of tourists, locals, foreign dignitaries, Hollywood celebrities, and even U.S. presidents.On my family's first day on vacation in New York, we decided to start things off right by eating lunch at this iconic American restaurant.  Tavern on the Green was recently renovated in 2014 and it shows.  Clean, tastefully decorated, warm and very inviting.  Once we got seated outdoors, I took one look at the lunch menu and went ""oh good christ, a $26 burger & chips?  Does it come dusted with gold bullion??""  No, nothing here is cheap.Eventually we came to the decision that ordering a few drinks and small plates to share would be best.  My dad chose the BLT wedge salad [$16], which consisted of baby iceberg lettuce with blue cheese dressing, diced tomato and smoked bacon.My mom ordered the roasted figs [$19] without hesitation.  They were served with bresaola (dried salted beef, akin to proscuitto), goat cheese, arugula (aka 'field greens' or 'weeds', teehee), and a drizzle of honey.I opted for the grilled jumbo asparagus [$16]; four large shoots were accompanied by crispy pancetta, a delightful poached egg, and topped with whole grain mustard dressing.Between the three of us, we felt that although the price point was laughably high, the food itself was actually quite good.  Plate presentation was uninspired, but the quality of ingredients and overall taste was impressive.  Local beer was something like $7 a pint, and our server did a commendable job.Bread = 4Circuses = 5+Although walk-up seating is possible, I'd strongly recommend making a reservation well in advance.  After all, Tavern on the Green has been featured in something like twenty movies, most notably the scene in Ghostbusters where Rick Moranis's character (Louis Tully) runs towards patrons dining here, banging on the glass to escape the spirit of Vinz Clortho until he is eventually overcome.  Which reminds me...........Dana Barrett's apartment?  You know, the penthouse of spook central designed by the fictional Ivo Shandor?  Yeah, that building exists right outside the restaurant, in Central Park West.  My inner movie geek was totally nerding out over that fact.Oh, and the bathrooms were immaculate.  Literally one of the nicest, cleanest WC's I've seen in my entire life.  So if you dine here, plan on using their gorgeous facilities.  I don't upload many bathroom photos (because gross), but I make the exception for Tavern.Their website mentions their ""bucolic"" setting (had to google that one), and I wholeheartedly agree.  It's a New York landmark that everyone should try to squeeze in if their schedule allows.  And if you can stomach the eye-popping cost of eating here, that is.Yeah, I could've done a headshop or whatever for my 420th posting, but Tavern on the Green is more deserving.  A sensationally classy atmosphere bolstered by enjoyable food and amicable service, despite insanely-priced menu items.  Get a bite, grab a drink, and check this place off your NYC to-do list.Both Eric S and Dr. Peter Venkman would recommend!****Tavern on the Green not held liable for any incidents involving Terror Dogs, Sumerian shape-shifting gods of destruction, or Gozer worshippers**",6,6,4,Eric S.,"Oak Park, IL",1428,909,2221

The burger was absolutely FANTASTIC. They do not put lettuce or any condiments on the burger, and after tasting this burger, I can kind of see why - anything else put on the bun would literally just be overshadowed. This thing stands STRONG on its own, it is truly tasty. The Cobb Salad was very good as well - the avocado was perfect, the dressing was tasty without being overbearing, and the deviled eggs on the side were a delicious touch.

4.0,3/30/2016,"This overall three star rating is a tad misleading. Granted, after being invited here for dinner by one of my best friends, I'm thought about the polarizing reviews I had been reading. Well, to each their own, I suppose. I really had a wonderful experience here. Luckily, 6 p.m. on a Tuesday is a great time to go, because the bar is hopping but the dining room is empty enough, which I say in a good way! I wasn't bumping elbows with fellow diners. Conversely, around 7:30, when the dining area was gaining more patrons and we wanted a post-dinner drink at the bar, there were ample seats to grab. It's all about timing, I suppose!First off, the entire building is beautifully appointed; the bar is the true definition of a tap room, with its dim lighting and dark wood surroundings. A stroll into the dining area provides a complete 180; cream colored and golden with a view of the open kitchen to one side, and a view of the patio and a glimpse of Central Park on the other. Half of the dining area is beneath glass-enclosed walls and ceiling; for a food photographer or Instagram maven, the natural light here will blow your mind. Ha! As for the food, I was pretty pleased with every morsel I consumed. My friend and I split scallops; this was, literally, the first time I had eaten scallops since I was a kid, easily 20 years, and I was very pleased with the taste and texture of them. Conversely, my friend commented that they seemed a tad overdone to her, but I really have no basis for what a scallop's texture should be. Haha. I was pleased with them, regardless! We both ordered our own bowls of Coq au Vin. Everything about the dish was on point. The chicken was tender, the vegetables were flavorful, and the garlic toasts accompanying it were the perfect accent. We ordered a side of mac and cheese, which...was very mild in flavor. It was good, but the sauce was more akin to an Alfredo as opposed to a sharp cheddar, which would have been lovely. For dessert, we split the whiskey cake; the look of shock upon my friend's first bite was priceless. ""It tastes like whiskey!"", she exclaimed! Indeed...it did! I think we've all had a dessert where an alcohol is toted as a main ingredient, but you can not taste it. This whiskey cake did not mess around! I'm surprised they didn't ID us before we ordered. Ha! (Luckily, I'm 10 years past 21, so it's all good.)Also, the service was impeccable, from the hostess to the waitstaff to the manager, the latter who was kind enough to come check by our table at one point during our evening. Our waiter, Michael, was awesome, personable, knowledgeable, and definitely made me wish I was single. Ha! (Handsome guy!) But in all seriousness, he was knowledgeable about the menu and made good suggestions when we were deciding on sides to split besides our Coq au Vin. He was a delight. Reviews here are up and down, but I had an absolutely wonderful evening here I was more than satisfied with my experience overall. That's all that matters to me.",5,3,6,Allison C.,"New York, NY",215,1638,450

""It closed it 2009 , so when I went to NYC the first time , it was shuttered . I was heartbroken . It had became a visitor center...As luck would have it , they reopopend before my upcoming visit to NYC !!! It was on the top of my list of places to see that week . It was a gorgeous October day, as we made our trek through Central Par, arriving at Tarern On The Green midday.  We decided to have drinks on the patio since we weren't eating.  We sat at a table that didn't have service, so we had to order at the bar.  We spent hours here enjoying conversation and watching all the tourists enjoy their experience as well.  As dinner time approached, I became peckish and purchased some chips from a snack bar window located outside the main seating area ,and brought them back to our table.  The snack bar is open to anyone walking through the park that needs a quick bite or beverage.  We had dinner reservation at Candle 79 later so we didn't want to order food.As we were siting there, the winds started to pick up and I told my friends that it looked like a storm was brewing, and that I thought it was going to dump rain any minute. They ignored my warnings. Then the storm came!  When it rains in NYC, it REALLY rains!  We were under an umbrella , so it was fine at first . It was humorous, watching the chaos as some of patrons ran inside.  We continued to sip our wine as the rain poured down around us. Others people choose to wait out the storm as well. Two older men sitting beside us began to crowd in on us when their umbrella started to leak.   One of the men was practically sitting on my girlfriends lap. I told him that he was being rude but it fell on deaf ears. The drama continued as thunder made its presence known.  We quickly ran inside and snagged a sofa, in a prime spot in the bar.  We had a window to watch the storm while staying safe and dry. Some people were still hanging outside when the lighting started.  They quickly retreated to the safety of the indoors.  It was a dramatic scenario with everyone trying to fit inside, some wet carrying drinks with them.We continued with a few more rounds before moving on . The interior was tastefully decorated.  The renovated Crystal Room was gorgeous. I can't add anything on the service since we ordered at the bar . Trying to get a taxi while its the raining was hilarious.  Über was price surging ""price gouging"" so we walked to our next destination, getting soaked along the way.

5.0,2/23/2016,"I made a reservation for 3pm for a party of 7. We were running a few mins late, so I called and the hostess was very nice and accomodating. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a doorman at the entrance. Very special place. Once I checked in with the hostess, we were seated immediately. Funny how a gentlemen at the host stand knew who I was. The hostess took us to our table. Wow what a beautiful restaurant. This is a lil oasis tucked in the heart of Central Park. I was so happy I chose this restaurant to celebrate a milestone, a birthday. The decor was very nice with wooden panels and a wooden bar at the right of the entrance. Definitely a nice place to grab a cocktail and bask in the nice ambiance. The dining room was very open with nice white tables and chairs. The back of the dining room was all made of glass and the glass doors led to the garden. Very nice. As for the cuisine, just wow!!! It was all delicious and exceeded our expectations. When I made the reservation, I did not realize it would be brunch. Don't ask me why or how. Ha. We were given the menu and we opted for the brunch pre-fixe and one ordered from the kids menu. The pre-fixe included a drink, an entree, a side and a dessert. Looking back on it, maybe some of us should have just picked a few items from the menu. It was a lot of food. So much that we took some home. I for one picked the eggs benedict, the greek yogurt with fruit and for the drink a mimosa & dessert a meyer lemon cheesecake (which I gave away to the rest of my party). I am cutting down. The rest of my party ordered the scottish organic salmon with a side of maple brown sugar bacon, the tavern burger with a side of maple brown sugar bacon or biscuit and gravy, and a truffle caesar. All of my party enjoyed their food and one even said the truffle caesar was the best salad he had ever had. The food was definitely worth it. Omg amazing. The service was great. The waiter always came to check on us. Last but not least, it was time for dessert. Everyone in my party mainly picked the meyer lemon cheesecake and one picked the carrot cake. Thank you to the staff of this fine establishment for making the birthday a memorable one. The waiter came with a cheesecake with the writing in chocolate Happy Birthday and a lit candle. It was definitely special and made the brunch amazing. We sang Happy Birthday and my party enjoyed the desserts. They liked both the cheesecake and the carrot cake. We ordered tea and coffee.

While the ambiance and venue are gorgeous, the service and food fell entirely short of what I would expect from such an expensive meal. To start out, we sat for about 15-20 minutes before we were even offered a piece of bread. When we wanted seconds, the guy was nowhere to be found.The appetizers were alright - nothing to write home about.Then, my boyfriend got the filet of beef for his main course. He was never asked how he would like the meat prepared. The meat came out almost rare and he couldn't enjoy most of his main course.I am a vegetarian and for my main course, I was told I would be served a cauliflower dish. What it turned out to be was 4-5 pieces of roasted cauliflower on a plate with some raisins. The taste was extremely subpar and it seemed like they just put vegetables on a plate and called it an entree. If I'm paying the same price as someone who gets a meat main course, I expect an ACTUAL entree at the very least. They didn't even post the menu on the website in advance, or I would have never made a reservation!The desserts were excellent, however. I got the chocolate lava cake and boyfriend got the champagne cake. Both were excellent.Overall, I wouldn't come back here or recommend it to a friend.

The service, atmosphere and most importantly the food was AMAZING.My girlfriend and I ventured to Tavern on the Green for Valentines Day brunch. To be honest, I was a little skeptical because of some of the negative reviews on here. However I had never been and always wanted to share a moment with my special someone at such an iconic restaurant.Let me start off by saying that as soon as you walk into the door the staff sets the tone. Between the woman working the coat check, the hostess who checks you in, to the hostess who seats you, you will be treated with exceptional care. There is an obvious sense of pride that each employee has for the restaurant, and it transcends though the way they treat their diners.Our waitress was phenomenal. She was incredibly attentive to our needs and made sure that we were comfortable and well taken care of.Now for the most important part.... The food! I cannot begin to express how good the food is here. We started off with a pastry basket with fresh jam and whipped butter. One word.... Mouthwatering. Then we moved on to the main course. I ordered the Scottish Salmon with Latkes and a side of Maple Candied Bacon. Oh my lord.... I have never had bacon like this in my life. So awesome. My girlfriend ordered the Soft Scrambled Eggs with Truffle Butter Toast. She was THRILLED. Our dessert was literally the ""icing on the cake"". The carrot cake and hazelnut almond crunch with raspberry sorbet was something that my girlfriend describes as ""the most amazing dessert that I have ever had. I will never forget this"".

Of course the restaurant is gorgeous, no complaints there at all. We had a nice table and an incredible server. She was very attentive but not overbearing. Most importantly, I didn't feel rushed at all, which is probably why there was a delay but I think that makes it worth it. The timing of each dish was perfect, not too fast, not too slow. I had no complaints about any of the food. My friend and I shared our first and last dishes so, in all, I tried the flatbread, chopped salad, coq au vin, carrot cake, and chocolate tart.

2.0,1/29/2016,"As a New Yorker, I should have known much better than to go to an uber tourist trap - but the recent renovation gave me some hope, and the restaurant week deal was so enticing that I fell for it. We made a 1:15p lunch reservation on Open Table, and were told upon checking in that our wait would be about 15-20 minutes. We were OK with that, however, we were not seated until 2:00p - which was after speaking to the hostess three times. When we were finally escorted to our table, we entered a room with at least 20 empty tables.  Clearly they were understaffed, but it was infuriating that we waited 45 minutes for a table and there were tons available.  We were given a free drink each to help quell our anger, but the adventure did not stop there...We ordered the three course, Restaurant Week lunch menu for $25. We were served two rolls to start - but my bread plate was dirty, appeared to be some kind of leftover greens on it.  For my starter, I ordered a flatbread with cheese, arugula and onions (good), but my main course was not as great.  I had expected a sizeable juicy thick burger from a place like Tavern on the Green, but alas, I received a petite patty (though the bun was great), with chips on the side. To be honest, I had stopped for fast food the day prior and had ordered a burger - and they were sadly very similar.  Thus - I would recommend something other than the burger. The dessert was fantastic.  A caramel chocolate tart that was very tasty. In summary, I would not come back to this restaurant - I would need a lot of convincing.  The waitstaff was very pleasant and tried their best, and the service was fine - but all the things mentioned above would not bring me back here.  For me, Restaurant Week is a chance to try new restaurants, and make new recommendations to friends and family - and this experience sadly did not meet any of my expectations.",8,0,1,Collette S.,"Boston, MA",216,258,169

I am dying to go back now that it is renovated and reopened!      This is the kind of place you need reservations for- we made ours for lunch.  It was a beautiful restaurant, we sat in the Crystal room.  Several chandeliers hung from the ceiling, and I'm sure if it was sunny out, the light would have caught the crystals beautifully.  Lunch was rather expensive, about $50 for each of us. I ordered a special three course meal that included Red and Yellow Tomato Napoleon (red and yellow tomatoes stacked with ricotta salata cheese, balsamic vinaigrette, and a pesto crouton), Roast Chicken Provencale (garlic-mashed potatoes, tomato olive caper sauce, sautéed spinach) and Chocolate Mousse Cake (berry compote and whipped cream). They also bring around a bread basket and little butter rounds.  Delicious bread- light, fresh, and chewy.  I have read a lot of reviews from people that say Tavern isn't worth the 'hype' but I vehemently disagree. I was happy to pay $50 (including tip) for this meal.  It was awesome, down to every side dish, crouton, and iced tea.  I am trying feverishly to recreate my meal, especially the Mousse Cake.  I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but I indulged every bit of this creamy confection.  I not only recommend, but I insist you visit Tavern on the Green on your next visit!",0,0,0,Michele B.,"Cleveland, OH",81,300,103

We sat at the round bar in the middle, where there were two inexperienced bartenders behind the bar: a tattooed female with very short hair and a 20 something male, with brown hair.After we would order a drink/food, the male server would add it to our bill and then not serve said item to us!  Due to several times of him screwing it up (and doing to other guests too!) and then her rolling her eyes, I calmly suggested he wait until the end of our meal to tally up the check, to ensure we were getting what we were being billed for. At this point, he became loud, confrontational and hostile towards me, alluding that I was making a bigger deal than need be, completely embarrassing me.After this, much to his dismay, three others at the bar complained they received the wrong meal, one being my friend, and he had to ""go back there"" to see what was going on, trying to blame the kitchen staff for his incompetence. At the end, of course, there were items on our check we had never been served.He totally ruined the entire day; I felt sorry that other Tavern patrons were being unknowingly swindled and such a freshly restored, historic restaurant was staffed by under qualified, unskilled servers.",2,0,0,Angela T.,"Bronx, NY",3,28,0
3.0,1/14/2016,"What a BEAUTIFUL restaurant this is!  My husband and I went to NYC for our honeymoon over Christmas, and picked Tavern on the Green for our Christmas dinner. The menu was pre fix for Christmas, which was fine. We started with the shrimp that had a sauce that was to die for!  Our appetizers were ...eh. Then the main course...  We got steaks. The menu called for filet but they ran out. My husbands steak was wonderful. We both ordered medium rare. My steak was charred!  Luckily my husband had plenty to share, as I didn't care for my charred, chewy steak. The second best part of the meal, aside from the shrimp, was the desert. I got my favorite...carrot cake. It was delicious. Our waiter was great, but whenever a plate was picked up, we wouldn't get new silverware and had to keep asking. Also, the food came out not in the right order, so we had to send some stuff back. The other thing that bothered me about a restaurant like this, was that there was no dress code enforced. You would think there would be!  I thought for sure there was one, until a family of three sat next to us in jeans and shirts....at 10:00pm....for Christmas dinner!  Come on guys!!!!!  Seriously!!!",0,0,0,Candice W.,"Morehead City, NC",84,47,80

The lighting is perfect: not too bright, and not too dim. We were seated at one of the tables with a cushioned booth along the wall. Our server was a very nice gentleman from Virginia. He did a great job with answering our questions about the menu. For my meal, I had the shrimp scampi. Oh. My. God. This was, hands down, the best shrimp scampi I've ever had. This is not your average shrimp scampi. It comes with two giant (and when I say giant, I mean it) prawns, cooked with garlic and Frascati White Wine. It is served on Spaghetti Cacio e Pepe. I swear, my mouth sang the halleluja chorus as soon as the taste hit it. My husband had their filet mignon, cooked medium. It was absolutely perfect (he was kind enough to let me sample some of his).

They called us a day before to confirm that we were coming. We came at the appointed time and heard that there were no tables available. Overall, we were waiting for like 40 minutes with a reservation!!! I find this to be a bad service, especially for the place which is popular and pretty pricy. I saw other people arguing who had reservation and was not seated at the right time. If staff does not reserve a table for someone who called in advance, what is the point of reservation and why do they call you before to make sure you are coming? On our complains, they did not even say sorry. I guess it is their new policy and maybe that's why the place used to be more popular before. Secondly, place is cute as you enter but the inside dining area is pretty ordinary, nothing special, even reminds of ordinary eatery. I assume this place is wonderful to have brunch in summer with your friends as the outside patio looks cool. Thirdly, food is okey. I would give maximum 4/5 stars. The chestnut soup I took was delicious, carrot cake is the best, tartar is so so. But everything is pretty pricy comparing to other places I've been in NYC.

I love scallops, but I'm glad I didn't get them as an entree since they looked more like an appetizer.  Our server Stacy was friendly and attentive and we didn't have any issues that other yelpers brought up in reviews.Overall, a huge improvement on the former Tavern on the Green -- glad it's back!",0,0,0,Catherine A.,"New York, NY",1,22,2

1.0,12/4/2015,"We anticipated a luxurious Thanksgiving dinner at an iconic NYC restaurant. Boy, were we disappointed.The preview: At $125 per person ($50 to cancel) we were told back in September when we booked it that we would be sent the menu when it got a little closer, but that we would be given a few choices in addition to the traditional Thanksgiving fare. I had to keep asking, and was finally given the menu on Tuesday, but of course, only the traditional turkey was published; two emails later before we got the alternates, Scottish (farmed) salmon or Cauliflower Entrecôte (one of their staple ""side"" dishes, according to reviews.) No ham or beef as I was told when I made the reservation. The ambience: the garden room has a wall of glass that looks out onto a desolate patio albeit with pretty strings of lights. The tables were crammed together- no tablecloths, centerpieces or any decor on ugly melamine plastic deli style tables. We had better ambience in Little ItalyThe service: The service was abysmal- our waitress didn't offer the options until we asked, and even then it was rather reluctantly. For our party of 4, only one person ordered the salmon, the rest ordered the traditional turkey, and the server couldn't even remember who ordered it. They had us right next to the water station yet couldn't get them to refill water, much less check on us. Flagging our servers attention was impossible. The food: The menu said that the turkey would be served ""Oven Roasted Free Range Turkey Sliced Light and Pulled Dark Meat, Warm Gravy"" but there was no gravy- we had to ask and only got one small 3 oz gravy boat, with only a dollop of gravy in it- for a family of four! The stuffing was topped with two burned croissants, it was dry and flavorless. We were served one small dish (5"" x 2"") dish and our dressing loving family left half of it. My favorite part of the dinner were the sweet potatoes which were actually very good. The desserts were less than stellar- warm chocolate molten cake that was neither warm or molten, pecan pie that was dry.

I was wrong. The waitstaff seemed disorganized, the bartenders had their Starbucks frappuccino cups on the bar (I know you guys get thirsty, but put them underneath the bar please), and no one was particularly friendly, nor did anyone ask how we were doing. I think the final straw for me was when a waiter brought out a burger and set it on the bar and not only did the burger sit on the bar for a good ten minutes, three (THREE!!!!) waiters kept walking by and stealing fries from the plate. I was hoping the burger was for a fellow waiter, but as I watched them deliver the plate to a table, I felt a little icky inside.  Totally unprofessional (I mean I was sitting right by the burger--if you wanna steal fries, do it where no one can see you, man!), totally gross, totally sad experience.  I am super glad I did not eat there--we had a lovely dinner at Colicchio & Sons.  I would have expected better from a place like this. :(",1,0,0,Adriana Z.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",11,12,2

And for some reason, drown the fries in truffle oil (not a subtle application). Overall, was disappointed. The adult plates were not adventurous either, though not bad. The best part was probably the bread that came to the table, it was buttery and a bit salty. Wait service was attentive.

You're paying more for the experience.

Food: Excellent menu, tasty options, lots of meat. Like lots. I started with the foie gras parfait (because I'm 30, I can). A small mountain of foie gras in a mason jar, topped with an apricot preserve and some veggie thingies that I guess you're supposed to eat with the glorious spread. Uhh no thanks, me just want the FOIE! Then followed by a tasty filet mignon, with potato puffs and green beans. The filet was tasty and juicy, cooked perfectly. We wrapped up the meal by sharing pumpkin cheesecake with lingonberries. My wife is Swedish, and I'm a cheesecake junkie, so this dessert quite literally is us on a plate. We also really like cheese. Prices are steep for the type of food, but tasty nonetheless.Service: To be honest, I wasn't as impressed. It felt like overall the staff were less friendly and engaging, performing their duties well but not making it a warm, personable experience. Everyone from the curt woman taking our coats at coat check, to our server doing the requisite ""how is everything going?"" and then walking away as we responded, it didn't feel as though we were as welcome as we would have liked.

When we arrived early, the hostess was very gracious and worked to get a table ready for us on the patio. The setting was elegant, natural and a real gem in the middle of the bustling city. There were a couple of people at the bar inside - one guy looked like he'd stopped in for Friday night dinner after work - but it was generally quiet.The patio was set with lights strung to a center pole in the courtyard, while a band played standards and New York-themed songs we've all heard before. Couples danced and the music stayed low enough where we could still easily hear our conversation. Our waiter was prompt; I don't remember having to wait long for anything, and the food was delicious. I had the scallops and my friend had the risotto, both delicious, and the scallops were cooked to perfection.

Most of us think of it as a tourist place....after all, what restaurant a real New Yorker goes to has a gift shop? After my wife and I attended a party there last month, we found ourselves back there last night with our 13 yr old daughter. To our surprise, was quite delicious and the overall experience will be memorable. Our first course was very nice...my daughter had scallops; sweet, fresh, simply prepared and delicious. My wife's Cesar salad arrived and was eye-popping huge portion....one of the better Cesar salads' any of us have had in a while with beautiful touch of table side shavings of fresh truffles. My raw clams were tiny but very fresh baby necks and quite good. Our entrees didn't disappoint either. I had the rib-eye steak....18oz, on the bone served, on 1 plate, with cream spinach and sautéed onions. Was cooked to perfection and served beautifully...about as good a steak as Wolfgang's or The Palm serves!  My wife ordered the rack of lamb, which she often orders when dining out. The size of the order was enormous....and the lamb was meaty, American origin, with waiter giving tableside shavings of fresh truffles - fantastic. My daughters' pasta dish may have been a slight weak spot of the night lacking in flavor but enjoyable enough.  We finished our meal with a couple of desserts to sample...cheese cake was good as was the chocolate cake. Service was very good with waiter being friendly, informative and reasonably attentive.

However, this hello goes out to a refreshed friend of sorts, not the Tavern on The Green of my childhood, but a Central Park haven fit for the 21st century. The old establishment was elegant but growing tired, it needed a facelift despite its timeless beauty. The new establishment received just that and is today a trendier version of itself, vaguely recognizable but revamped with a better than before menu and younger vibe. We sat outside where the old glass dining room once resided, under the carousel lights on a warm August night. And, while the restaurant's iconic beauty and charm was spectacular, I was even more blown away by how warm and accommodating the staff was, as well as how great the food is. While not inexpensive, the chef seems to take pride in offering a wonderful ""new American"" cuisine. The entrees are in the $30-50 range though the quality is well represented. Nonetheless, a reasonable date night could foreseeably include two glasses of wine, a shared entree and well portioned hot first course -- i.e., risotto -- for under $100.

I was disappointed when the salad arrived and only had a penny size drop of balsamic vinegar on the plate. I order the short rib for my entrée and was highly disappointed in it, although the short rib was tender it lacked flavor. The baked beans that came with it wasn't anything to write about and the pickled vegetables taste like pure vinegar on the plate. My husband ordered the lobster risotto which was a $14 supplemental meal choice and he should have just saved that extra money because again it wasn't that good.

Taking a stroll after dinner inside central park was just a bonus. Appetizers: 1. Avocado Toast: I know it sounds so simple and dull, but it was so tasty. They served it on a slice of grilled sourdough, and let's just say they were not cheap with the avocado. I definitely recommend this out of the 3 choices on the menu. 2.

Really wished we had chose something else or even 2 orders of the avocado toast (because it was just that yummy).Entree: 1. Hickory Smoked Beef Shortribs: In a nutshell, it was filling, needed more sauce, but paired perfectly with the Texas baked beans. Warning: the veggies are sour.2. Shrimp Scampi: The gigantic shrimp that came with this dish was impressive; both the size and the taste. The pasta itself tasted decent, but don't expect anything too crazy. Dessert: 1. Rum Raisin Carrot Cake: They are not joking with the rum raisins. Each raisin (there's 2) will be a surprise in your mouth. 2. Spice Peach Cobbler: YUM. I loved it.

We had a reservation and when the hostess said our table was ready, we were brought to a table with 1 chair. Instead of seating us at one of several complete tables, we had to wait for the staff to figure out where to get the chair from.The table was wobbly and it took asking 4 people before it got fixed. We then were offered bread and butter, but only got bread.The food was decent - my white gazpacho soup was definitely the best part. It really was amazing. My date's avocado toast appetizer was similar to what I've made myself for dinner on a whim the previous night (and I have 2 left hands when it comes to cooking) so I wasn't impressed. The entrees were just OK: really no need to put a big head of the shrimp on top of shrimp scampi but some more sauce would be nice.My short-rib was well made in my opinion but some people may consider it too dry. It was served with beans and strongly picked vegetables on top of the beans, which is a weird combination.

3.0,7/29/2015,"I went back to Tavern on the Green again for restaurant week.  They have changed chefs since my last visit, and I was very excited that it was nice and could sit outside. My last visit the ground was covered with snow.. don't miss those days!I had a 7:00 reservation, and when I showed up it wasn't too crowded.  They asked if I wanted to sit inside or out, and I said out.  It was a little warm when we first sat down, but it cooled down a bit, and was very pleasant sitting outside.  My friend and I looked over the menu, but we stuck with the restaurant week one.  Like I said in my last review, I thought the food was good, but nowhere near worth paying full price for. I looked over the wine list, but decided to do the wine pairing on the restaurant week menu.  It was $20 and you got two full glasses of wine and a smaller glass of port wine with your dessert.  Definitely worth it!  My friend and I both ordered the watermelon and feta salad for our appetizer.  It was good, the watermelon was really bright and fresh, and I loved the feta with it.  It was on the small side, but it was very pretty.  For our mains we were both thinking about the shrimp scampi or the chicken, so we wound up each ordering one and sharing.  Normally I'm more of fish/seafood person, but I think I liked the chicken better.  It was cooked well, so it wasn't at all dry, and it had a really good tomato sauce and potato puree underneath.  The shrimp scampi was good, but really nothing special.  For dessert we both got the peach cobbler.  Again nothing really special, also it had coconut flakes on top of it, which I'm not a fan of, and it didn't say it on the menu, so I couldn't ask for it without it.Overall food and service was good, and I was happy I got to sit outside.  I just still feel like it's not worth the price normally.  I mean I guess part of it is going and paying for the ambiance, but even my friend pointed this out to me, it's not really as fancy as it used to be.  It doesn't seem as exclusive or exciting going here.  They have an outdoor beer garden in the front of the restaurant.  It's not as expensive, but still really cute.  I would actually like to go there and check it out.",1,0,0,Rachel W.,"Manhattan, NY",284,202,541
1.0,7/28/2015,"Had dinner on 7/25. Worst dining experience ever. Waited 20 minutes after reservation time (5:30) to be seated, were seated at a bench seat that straddled a break in the bench. Was told no other tables available in a near empty restaurant. The eye roll from the hostess was a nice touch though. Only moved after I told hostess we were not sitting at that table. Another couple was seated at the same table while we were there and kept flagging staff down to ask if they could be moved as well. Took about 5 or 6 requests before anyone moved them.  Ordered wine only to be told our selection was unavailable but they had a comparable substitute we could try. Waited 30 minutes for wine to be brought to table by our new waiter.  ( our original waiter was moved outside). Selection they brought cost twice as much as original request so we sent it back because we no longer had time to drink it before our show reservations. Bread and water made it to table 20 minutes after we were seated even though servers with both had walked past our table a half dozen times. Only offered one piece of bread our entire meal. Shrimp entree was awful. Waiters solution was a to go box. Guess he thought taste might improve with age. Never offered to bring a replacement entree. Skirt steak was ok but not worth he price we paid. I'm  still not sure how a chef can ruin green beans, but they were awful as well. We've had much better meals at Applebee's with their pre packaged food. Table behind us sat for a long time and finally had to flag someone down to ask if they knew who their server was. Wait staff ""met"" to discuss who had to wait on that table in sight of customers. Staff was in chaos. Ladies seated next to me leaned over to express their frustration at the poor service. Yes we were seated that close. They were long time patrons and were very disappointed with the new restaurant. Manager never approached us. His only interaction with an actual customer was to remove a coke bottle from a table. He insisted the customers coke had to be in a glass. Wouldn't want that bottle of coke to ruin everyone else's dining experience. Don't waist your money or your time. If you feel the need to cross TOTG off your bucket list, get a drink outside to minimize your losses.",2,0,0,Donna B.,"North Topsail Beach, NC",41,5,0

The waitress tried it and was unsure so she called a manager who checked with the bartender---in the end, the manager admitted there was alcohol in it. He took off the cost of the mocktail and brought over an actual mocktail, but also seemed pretty casual and unconcerned about having served hard liquor to someone who specifically asked for something non-alcoholic.

I can't figure out why they seated us there, because as we were leaving, I saw the beautiful glassed in area that I then remembered from many years ago. The tables were only about half full!  At any rate, the food was fabulous, I had the red snapper, and my daughter had the shrimp scampi.

We had the reservation set initially for 12 PM and we called to move it 30 mins later and they were very accommodative. I have also called a few times in advance prior to the day to request a table as close as possible to the garden and even though they could not promise it they indeed offered us the best sitting in house. They were also very open regarding adding my own flower arrangements to the tables to make it look like a real celebration.We got there and I was stunned by how beautiful the table was set up and how gorgeous my flower arrangements designed by JC floral design studio were. I read a lot of reviews regarding poor food quality of overpriced items and I was a little scared, but my experience was nothing close to that. We had ordered almost all the appetizers on the lunch menu and the Argentinian stake, the avocado shrimp, the burger and risotto as entree choices . Every single food item that came to our table was beyond delicious. The food had great presentation and every single one of my 12 guests raved about their dishes. We also had an amazing service team with Ailin as our server. She was beyond courteous, making sure that our table is really taken care of, the glasses of water and wine, champagne were always full and she made sure to check on us every few minutes to make sure we liked everything this far.For deserts we ordered all the items on the menu. I must say I'm not a big cake person and I almost don't like anything besides tiramisu. Well their blueberry desert and their carrot cake is out of this world delicious. We had both the executive chef and the desert chef come to check on us and ensure we liked our food and enjoyed our experience. I must add as disclaimer that I live in midtown Manhattan for the past 10 years and we eat outside 5 times a week.

We were disappointed. After we were so wonderfully greeted by the main host at the front lobby, it all went downhill. Our waiter was not at all attentive, seemingly preoccupied and lackadaisical to our needs. My GF and I both wore dark clothing and asked for dark linen, but our waiter seemed shocked at the request and did not know the answer. He returned later to say there was none available.  The bus staff in black shirts made up for what he lacked so kudos to them for their promptness and eye to detail. GF had the English muffin with poached egg and hollandaise sauce, while I had ribeye steak and eggs. My food was bland and so was hers.

The place is definitely an upscale restaurant with typical rich, older New Yorkers who have nothing better to spend their money on but food. Nonetheless, here is my review:Food: My group ordered the pancakes, lobster and burger. The lobster and burger were TINY! It was literally the size of an appetizer. Couldn't bother to order more food considering that it was pretty pricey and the service was slow.  Service: I found the service to be disappointing. Regarding the burger we ordered, I saw that other people had fries or lettuce, tomatoes but ours came just bare. Just the meat and the bread. We would have ordered it with the extras if we were told about it. But we weren't. I also found that the waiters focussed on the ""fancy"" people. They took forever to take our check. The whole time I saw our waiter chatting at other tables. Location: The only nice place about this place. I got a few nice pictures in the restaurant. Great decor.

It was 30 minutes after we first sat down before I was actually back at the table with our beers.  Drink selection was poor.  Didn't eat but from what I saw of other people's food, I wouldn't expect too much.  The venue itself is nice so it's a shame they can't get their act together and offer something a lot better.

She was was ecstatic to take me there, so much so, that we cut our Central Park visit short. This was clearly a mistake. As soon as we got to the restaurant there was a bit of a chaotic tone. The staff was running around and the host informed us that the restaurant was full but she may be able to find seats in their horseshoe section of the bar as she called it. Understanding the dinner rush and without a reservation we were happy to comply.A couple of minutes later we are seated in the ""horseshoe"" where our table is completely unsteady. I asked the host for a table wedge, because it was so wobbly I figured I'd make a mess if I didn't. About five minutes later two women are seated next to us.For about 15 minutes no one approaches our table or the table next to us. I was staring at, what I figured to be the manager, for about five minutes before he approached the women seated after Us asking if they'd like anything to drinking. It was about 20 minutes total before we saw a waitress who did not approach the table with a welcome, or greeting. Rather she asked if we needed or wanted anything. Frustrated I ask again for a table wedge and a glass of water. This takes about 10 minutes before we see her again, it is now clear that this is not the waitress's section as she is rarely present in the area. A bus boy comes with cardboard to place it under the table to make it less wobbly. We order our meal and amidst eating another bus boy, who we later know as Joseph, is the only one waiting our table. He refills our drinks, asks what we need, clears our table, and is EXTREMELY friendly. I truthfully think if not for his hospitality and kindness we would have left. Our waitress does not return after the food is presented so we ask Joseph for the bill. He is chaotically running around to give the other customers as good as a treatment as he's given us. Our waitress then shows up with a dessert menu rather than the check. It took about ten minutes after our food was cleared for us to see her. At this point I approach the manager who I made eye contact with earlier, although it felt as though he noticed us he asked where we were sitting and after explaining our service was not great, he offered to buy us dessert. Continuing to express my high hopes and severe disappointment I tell the manager we would just like the check. We ordered-glass of pino grigioDiet cokeCaesar saladScallops SalmonOur total bill was $90. Joseph said goodbye to us and wished us safe travels. It wasn't until we were almost out the door that the manager called after us. He asked if we live in town and we explained that we were visiting very shortly from Chicago. He said he was also from Chicago. He said the reason he asked is because he was hoping ""we could give them another try"". Maybe we would have! If there were any kind of effort made to mend the absolutely terrible service. My greatest disappoint was that my mother was looking forward to having an upscale dinner with her daughter, which we don't have many, in a restaurant that had sentimental meaning to her. She was eager to see the location after it was reopened, which was stunning but she was completely heartbroken by the experience. I truly wish our dining experience was a lot better or atleast attempted to be fixed in order toUphold a tradition but I do not feel this took place. We both were completely understanding of the busiest dinner rush but there was clearly lack of communication within the restaurant.

Sure, lots of tourists go here (it's a famous place in a unique location in NYC... Obviously people will flock here), but it's a large space with several locations for large parties and events, so I've never felt like it was too crowded or touristy/Time Square-like at all. In fact, it's been beautiful and classy and romantic.

2.0,5/30/2015,"Went to the new beer garden tonight. Extra star is for the fact that it is an outdoor eating/drinking venue in Central Park, which is awesome. That being said we ran into many issues which might be related to the beer garden being new but are still problematic:1. There are only 3 beers available, and one of them is bud light. Prices aren't so unreasonable given the location. 2. Took over 20 minutes for 2 pitchers of beer to come out, despite the fact that it was relatively empty and we saw our waitress standing around and texting by the bar. She at one point came by after 10 minutes and said ""those pitchers will be right out"" then proceeded to go stand by the bar, text, and then eventually asked for pitchers to be filled, let them sit for a couple of minutes, then came over with them. There was nothing else happening at the bar when this was going on. When we asked for extra cups, it took an additional 10 minutes for them to come out and only when we asked a second person for them. 3. Soft pretzel with an assortment of mustards: came Out cold and only with one mustard. When we asked where the ""assortment"" was that was promised on the menu the young man who brought it to us looked confused, then came back with Dijon mustard after about 10 minutes, when the pretzel was done. Pretzel was $9. On the plus side the hosts were quite friendly and the environment is nice. Just FYI not pet friendly.

They have real high chairs with their own table for the baby which was cool because she wasn't making such a ruckus on our table. We sat in the atrium where it was nice and sunny and we can see outside the glass wall and the patio with all the hanging tea lights/lanterns. It was very very pretty. The service was cool, they were very nice and checked up on us all the time. They even gave us a ticket and put our strollers away at coat check for free. The only downside to this place was it was a pretty pricey for our food. My sister got the frenchtoast and it was literally one little log (probably 6 inches long and 2 inches wide) of milky bread with strawberries on top. It was tasty, but small for 18 bucks. It tasted like flan. My burger was thick and was pretty good. Also, another downside was that there is no changing table in the bathroom. Other than it being super posh, it was a good experience.

In addition to the delicious food, the service was great.  The staff is very kind and polite.  The restaurant itself is decorated beautifully.  Each room is stunning.  I especially love the outdoor patio with the lights strung across the tables.  The restaurant is very pricey, but it is definitely worth it for any New Yorker who loves good food and a beautiful view.",1,0,1,Jane B.,"Buffalo, NY",273,399,5557

2.0,5/13/2015,"Even though I'd read the other reviews, I still wanted to add Tavern on the Green to our NYC weekend. We made a reservation for Friday evening because we had theater tickets at 8:00. When we arrived exactly at our reserved time, we were told that our table would be ready shortly. This is one of my pet peeves; why make a reservation if they can't have a table ready? We were seated on the patio on a delightful evening. We had heard that this was the first good weather in NYC so we weren't surprised that the patio looked like it had been set up very hastily. The servers did not know the table numbers. We had a lot of food and beverages brought to our table that were not ours! Our server was very nice, as was the hostess who seated us (finally).  We ordered the Caesar salad to share, which they nicely divided into two bowls. Sadly, it was very difficult to eat because most of the hearts of romaine were still clumped onto the tough middles. I ended up eating some of it with my fingers because the bowl was not conducive to using a knife! And there was WAY too much dressing, so much so that neither of us could eat the bottom half our portions. My daughter had the lobster bisque, which had a nice lobster flavor but it was almost overpowered by the saltiness. I had the Spring risotto.  While the risotto was nicely cooked, it lacked any flavor at all. Fortunately, the veggies and the lardon both added something to it, but the few pieces did not go very far. Hopefully, this beautiful restaurant will get things figured out soon.

One server kept coming over when he noticed our water glasses were empty and would interrupt conversation at the table to ask permission to refill. Every. Single. Time.Hospitality 101 - if a water glass is half empty just refill it. If a wine glass is half empty and the wine bottle is on the table, just refill it. Don't interrupt conversation at the table to ask to refill the water each time you come over. Lots of potential here but someone needs to get the hospitality going here with the staff. I'd have given a 4th star if the service was better.Menu is really accessible. American fare, nothing fancy, nothing wildly special but decent for what it was and the food tasted just fine. Would like to see more accessible wines here that match the food menu a bit more. Did not like the prosecco (too sugary), rose (tasted dusty) nor chardonnay (not buttery or oaky at all).

I left planning to go back to enjoy the summer view and cocktails in Central Park, but NYC has plenty of better brunch spots so it was something that I expected my fiance and I would do alone as we live nearby and not something our group of friends would look forward to because of the high prices and limited menu.  Fast forward, a year later, when I went to dinner.  I had a 7pm reservation and didn't get served until 9PM!  When I arrived I was told ""we'll be right with you while your table is being prepared.""  Not a big deal.  At first.  Ten minutes later when we are seated, I notice only 4 tables have guests.  Four tables!  What were they preparing?  The entire back room was nearly empty.  My guest and I had to wave someone down to order a drink and throughout the night each time someone came to our table it was someone new.  We thought it was strange but, hey, maybe they were training new servers... 9:00pm comes around and we are just served our dinner.  My plate was fine (Salmon) but my guest said he could tell his had been sitting. Looking back, we gave Tavern way too much credit.  I can't believe we stayed.  Not once did anyone come to our table and ask if we needed a re-fill or apologize for the delay. We watched servers stand around and only one was really working.  It was very confusing.  I suppose it was just one of those nights when we didn't want to complain but I do believe something is wrong with the restaurant and it can't possibly survive in NYC with this type of service.  I love Central Park and had high hopes for Tavern, but I advise you just go to the cafe outside for an ice coffee.  Much better service.",2,0,0,Andrea L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0

3.0,4/19/2015,"I hadn't been back to Tavern on the Green since it closed. So I was a little excited when a friend of mine suggested we do drinks there. I wanted to see, well, what's been done with the place! We walked in and I was a little surprised to see so many UWS yoga moms there, in their yoga outfits. While it was Saturday brunch time, I just always expected people to dress up a little more for TOTG? The place was super busy and super packed, but, like I said, it was brunch time. The hostesses, the staff (although, I didn't see that many servers or wait staff) were nice enough, not really anything to comment on. We went outside hoping to get our drinks outside at the bar and sit out there. But the outdoor bar wasn't open, and the seating was all full, although it seemed like half the seating was missing). Ordered our drinks at the very busy bar and finally found some newly vacated couches. I'm very pleased with the new decor. I think the renovations gave TOTG a very much needed face lift and new life. We didn't eat here. I probably should have mentioned that before, but, now I am. So I can't comment on the food. The drinks? We all had cocktails, and nothing to write home about. If anything, a little overpriced... but it is central park. I had the Staten Island, and it felt like something was missing. My friend first had the Los Pastores and he was not happy. He had the Queens next and it didn't fare much better. I enjoyed that no one bothered us the entire time we were there occupying our spot... but part of me would have liked someone to check on us and to see if we needed more drinks than one of us always have to go to the bar for a fresh round. I'd like to go back to try it again maybe for brunch or lunch, see if it was just an off day.",5,3,2,Tova B.,"Jersey City, NJ",96,358,460

4.0,4/8/2015,"The interior spaces at Tavern on the Green made me feel as if I was in a wing of Buckingham Palace or The White house.Hand carved woods, gold leafed ornaments, and an expensive modern addition. Our party was ready to dine in style.The doormen and hostesses were fashionable and friendly.And our waiter treated us like good friends visiting from out of town.The three of us made sure to order a different dish from the prefix menu so we could be sure to try most of it, if not all.The cocktails were sweet as one would expect on Easter Sunday. The Orange 75 was tart, alcoholic, and bubbly. Just like a good blood orange should.The strawberry basil lemonade had all the right garnishes to disguise the fact that you're drinking after church.I had to order both, and was happy I did.The appetizers were good, if not great. Unfortunately, they out did the entrées in both style and taste.The prosciutto and mozzarella arrived with a sharable and tasty portion. Although, I could not detect a taste of truffle as described. Creamy cheese and thinly cut salty meat.The shrimp in the shrimp cocktail were about the size of an Italian sausage and were doing yoga back bends into distinguished sauces.The crab cake stuffed portobello was just that, but super sized. The béarnaise sauce was close to a hollendaise sauce.For entrées, we had the lamb shank which was a fancy version of the slab of meat thrown at Fred Flintstones car. Gigantic and mostly delicious. I don't always care for the taste and texture of the ""fall off the bone"" beef found in many beef stews; and that's exactly what this was. I ate half. The other half was surprising good for left overs. (Yes, I took home left overs at Tavern)My girlfriend had the chilled poached salmon. I've never had salmon prepared this way. It was a pleasant surprise.I had to ask the waiter, because I assumed the ""chilled"" salmon was smoked.I wish there was a side of the goddess dressing it was laying in.The desserts also outshined the entrées in presentation and flavor profile.Ginger snaps with chocolate mousse, a warm berry crumble with vanilla ice cream, and a personal cheesecake with strawberry sauce.They were all excellent except the cheesecake was slightly over dome leaving it a bit dry and flakey.Minus a few points for not being easily accessible if you're driving and for not having entrées on par with the first and third course.Over all, exceptional service, food, and ambiance.

2.0,4/6/2015,The renovations are beautiful!  It is gorgeous inside.  This is the most positive thing I can say.  I came for Easter Brunch.  It was a $95.00 prefix.  I did not pick the venue and was not in love with the menu.  We got seated at the one table I read in reviews was the worse seat in the house.  Right in front of the waiter/ waitress station and the computer.  We basically dined with the entire wait staff.  It was not a great seat. I ordered and changed my order from the eggs to the lamb shank based on the waitresses recommendation.  I wish I hadn't but $95 for eggs?  The lamb and polenta had no flavor and was very greasy.  The appetizer was the highlight.  It was a crab stuffed portabella mushroom.  The dessert was an awful dry over cooked cheesecake.  My friend got the chocolate mousse which was much better.  Our reservations were at 2 and we were done with a 3 course meal by 2:45.  It was completely rushed and really disappointing.  The wait staff should known how to properly time a meal.,1,0,0,Ann M.,"Narragansett, RI",48,9,0

2.0,3/30/2015,Came here on a date for Sunday Brunch during the Mad Men promotion which was $20 for an appetizer and a main course. Good deal!  The salmon tartar was pretty good for an appetizer (pears were not ripe) but the main chicken dish was nothing more than two dark meat chicken wings.  The potato mash around the wings was delicious! But I was so hungry after our meal! I am a petite woman with not a big appetite...so you can just imagine how small these portions were. I don't even think i got $20 worth of food...The food was overall pretty good though compared to the staff.  I have never been around such a rude and unhappy staff in a restaurant!!!  Everyone seemed miserable! The Indian hostess was quite rude to my boyfriend and I and we definitely did not feel welcomed. Not to mention that the assistant hostesses were dressed up in skimpy sweet 16 dresses...Our waiter never introduced himself so we assumed he was actually our busboy.  All of a sudden he said he wanted to take our order...I was so confused!

2.0,3/13/2015,"Visited for the first time since it reopened.  The place looks nice but just feels like the old magic is not there.  Most recent patrons probably don't  know what they're missing out on.  Food was okay and service was disappointing.  The waiter awkwardly used tongs too small for the bread too big to squeeze bread onto our plates.  When my entree came the waitress did not warn me the bowl was hot, so I was unpleasantly surprised when I touched the bowl.  A big no-no.  The waitress had an apron on, looking like she just stepped out of the kitchen even though she did not cook anything.  She checked in on us while mid-bite so we could only awkwardly nod (short of a thumbs up) while clearly not care about our response.  It seemed as of she only stopped by at her convenience, as we had to strectch our necks and look for her when we wanted to see the dessert menu, only to have her pass by us 4 times without making eye contact.  In the old days there used to be a photographer on site for guests celebrating special occasions but now no more, as the place has gone a lot more causual so anyone can stop in for a quick yet expensive bite.  I did not bother to tell the staff that we were there to celebrate anything, as the next table just got a weak ""congratulations"" when they revealed it was their anniversary.  Overall, very disappointed.  A shame that TOTG not only lost its old charm, but also does not have anything new to gain.",1,0,0,LetMe B.,"Queens, NY",0,31,19

3.0,3/7/2015,"I wanted to love it but a bit of a disappointment....For starters our server was excellent and very attentive the hostess was very welcoming. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the service but the food was a disappointment.I went to Tavern on the Green for brunch on a snowy Sunday afternoon.  Everything was ala carte for Sunday brunch.I remember the original Tavern on the Green where I went for special occasions over the years I always left with a special memory.   The food was always out of this world and it had a magical charm.  It was interesting to see the newly designed Tavern on the Green.   While the renovations are very nice I felt the old world charm that I loved so much is now forgotten.  They no longer have fine dining with white table cloths.  It has a very laid back casual atmosphere dress attire was mostly jeans and workout clothing which surprised me.  I felt over dressed.   If I am going to drop over $100.00 for brunch I want fine dining not a casual tourist trap.   The bar area is very nice and spacious where I think it's a good thing they made this area large because this is where they will attract most of their future business.We had a table by the window over looking Central Park on a snowy day. I am very glad they sat us in the back and not in the glass open area where it was very loud and reminded me of a cafeteria in a museum.  They have an open kitchen, which looks like a cafeteria, and the room was very loud.  The next room was quite and had a lovely atmosphere.My mother and I both ordered the Salmon and Eggs Benedict, which are all you, get on your plate the eggs were cooked to perfection but I thought the Béarnaise sauce tasted a bit weird and a little heavy.  I think the Béarnaise sauce was a bit too creamy to put on Eggs Benedict they also gave a very small portion of salmon hidden under the eggs.  When I think of a Béarnaise sauce I think of filet mignon I would not think of putting this on my eggs.  I would rather have a light hollandaise sauce.  We ordered one side of potatoes.  If you are going to spend $28.00 on eggs at least give a slab of bacon or potatoes the eggs looked lost on the plate the presentation was below average considering you are paying $28.00/plate.  We each ordered a dessert the bill came to over $100.00 mind you no cocktails we had coffee and tea. The food did not wow me there was nothing extraordinary about it and my dish was not hot the eggs were luke warm and by the second bite everything just seemed cold on the plate.  The potatoes came out hot because those they brought right out from the kitchen and they were delicious.  For dessert I had a Hazelnut ice cream but I did not realize they were going to pour a shot of espresso coffee on top.  It was very undesirable to eat or was it intended to be a drink? They served the ice cream in a water glass filled with hazel nuts and a honey comb when they poured the espresso on top of course the ice cream melted and the hazel nuts were floating in the water glass.  I wanted ice cream not melted ice cream.  The server realized I did not like this and came right over.  When I told him I really did not want the espresso poured over the ice cream I just wanted ice cream. Even without the espresso this dessert did not wow me the presentation just looked like someone took a scoop or two of ice cream put amaretto in the glass and threw in some hazel nuts.  No cookie on top not even a mint leaf or a dab of whip cream at least put the ice cream in a dessert dish. I don't understand why the presentation is so lacking and makes it less desirable to eat.  The other dessert we ordered was a made to order Raspberry Tart with Apricot Glaze, which was very dry and again the presentation was a turnoff just a bunch of raspberry's in a row nothing special.  I was very shocked at how this food was presented.Overall service was excellent they were very attentive and the atmosphere was lovely and the food was mediocre.  The food did not wow me the presentation of the food was below standards.  I was a bit disappointed but I am sure in the summer this place will be a nice place to have a cocktail out on the patio. I would say you pay for the atmosphere, which is lovely, not the food.

4.0,3/6/2015,"I had a delightful dinner for one last night at TOTG. Took advantage of the Restaurant Week menu. Started with an excellent cocktail called Staten Island. Had the mushroom soup to start. This is on the regular menu -- thank goodness -- because it was so delicious I will definitely want it again. I found no fault with course of arctic char on bed of basil risotto topped with watercress. Dessert was a bit weird, but I actually enjoyed that it made me think (not that that's always what one wants in a dessert). It was a pear poached in red wine, with slated caramel ice cream. What the description didn't say was that it was also topped with red peppercorns and bits of candied ginger. These hot accents actually turned out to be an interesting foil to the cold ice cream. But, I would not go out of my way to order that offering again. The new interior is lovely, and the staff was friendly and properly attentive without being stuffy.

2.0,3/6/2015,"Having never been to the old Tavern, I was very excited to get to try the restaurant for Restaurant Week.  The decor and ambience were beautiful and the service outstanding but I totally agree with Pete Wells NYT review this week when he said ""the fun stops when the food arrives"". Our appetizers of arctic char tartar over pickled watermelon radishes and the cream of mushroom soup were not that bad but when the entrees came it was all over.  The chicken dish was so dry and the side of a scalloped mushroom/potato mound had no taste. The chef's play on spaghetti carbonera was inedible.  As the plate was placed in front of me I almost gagged at the site.   It had and odd paring of peas, huge pieces of fatty bacon,  and was doused in a parmesean cream sauce and topped off with a tablespoon of fresh cream.  I have been to Italy and had this dish many times and never was it like this.  I tried to mix it all together but as I did the thought of how many calories it must have been was making my stomach turn.  I did try two bites but it was way to rich to continue.  I was polite enough to wrap it up because I didn't want the waitress to feel bad that I did not like it but I threw it out as soon as I left the restaurant.  The chocolate mousse was fair but then again how hard is that to screw up but the pear dessert could have been just as bad as the entree.  It said is was poached in red wine.  The aftertaste tasted like it was poached in a bottle of corked wine.  It is such a shame because the space is such a staple of the city but it needs a serious chef takeover to keep it from closing it's doors once again.",1,0,0,Jessica S.,"Manhattan, NY",88,45,0

Other than that, the service was great, my server, Joshua F., was very attentive and was awesome in general. The food was delicious. The salmon tartare appetizer was fresh, not too overly dressed, and I just could not get enough of it. I opted to get the filet mignon, despite the additional surcharge of $35, and I enjoyed every single bite of it. The steak was on the spot and the texture was perfect. They also serve mac & cheese with it, which is a huge plus in my book (I LOVE mac & cheese). I forgot what dessert I got... I know my friend got something with pear... Mine was good too.

My man had the tuna and he seemed to like it but agreed mine was better.

There was a $35 up charge which is crazy town; however, it really was great. I was totally surprised. My bf had the chicken which was moist and he ended up usurping my steak. That was fine with me as I has the chocolate mousse and wish I could gave had two of them. We also accidentally ordered still water thinking it was tap - it wasn't my day for thinking - and it $5 a bottle. We loved the ambiance and the service was good.

I also tried the Artic Char with the Lemon/Basil Risotto. Just a beautiful plate and just the right amount of golden top on the fish and the perfect consistency for the Risotto. But neither of the previously mentioned plates come close to their dinner menu's BRAISED BONE-IN BEEF SHORT RIB. I mean, this is probably THE BEST PLATE I've had in NY. Th bone just falls right off. So rich and tender... my god. With the Vermont Cheddar Grits and the Truffled Pea Shoots, really just the perfect plate. I'm definitely going back whenever the opportunity presents itself. Honestly, don't sleep on the BRAISED BONE-IN BEEF SHORT RIB. I hope that plate becomes a main stay at the restaurant, It's truly that good.

I was torn between 3 and 4 stars, but lean toward 4 because the experience was very pleasant even if there are things that could be improved.First, service is very friendly and welcoming. Perhaps they've taken some of the negative reviews into account, but the hostess, waiter, server, and maitre'd could not have been kinder or friendlier. In terms of the cadence of the meal, they definitely rush things along. Our salads came out very quickly - it felt almost as soon as we had ordered them. As soon as I was finished and put my silverware down, my plate was whisked away before my friend was finished with hers. Our entrees similarly came out very quickly and the server and waiter sort of hovered while my friend finished her salad. They took her salad plate and bread plate (which still had bread on it) away and replaced it very quickly with the entree. Everything just felt very rushed. No one was rude or inept, but we definitely felt rushed.The food itself is quite good. Caesar salad is flavorful and has real anchovies with it (I love anchovies, so this was a good thing). Lettuce is tender and fresh. Arctic char is perfectly cooked - tender and perfectly flaky, not at all dry or tough. Dessert seemed to be a bit confused - poached pears with crystallized ginger, pink peppercorns, and salted caramel ice cream that had been swirled with chocolate. The pears were good on their own and the ice cream was good on its own, but I don't think they were the best combination. All in all, a good dinner, and I would certainly come back for the food. The pace of the meal could be slowed down a bit, especially given that we were there at 6:30pm on a Tuesday, not prime time on a weekend.",3,0,2,Perry T.,"Manhattan, NY",100,444,0
3.0,2/17/2015,"Tavern on the Green has been on my fiancee's NYC to-do list for quite some time, so we decided to make a visit during our NYC trip to celebrate her birthday. Walking in, they had a swing band playing and the bar was packed (and it would remain packed all through the night). So it definitely warrants that even if you aren't crazy about the food here, that it seems like a very cool and fun place to have a few drinks at on a Friday night. We were greeted by our waitress and she was very nice and attentive all throughout the night and promptly put in our orders for our first courses, The Classic Iceberg Salad Wedge. The salad was what you expected, a pretty decent salad from a fine dining establishment. Since we were both fairly hungry from walking around all day, we skipped any appetizers and went right for our main course orders. I went with the Grilled Pork Chop and the Fiancee ordered the Grilled Filet Mignon. The Grilled Pork Chop is truly a spectacle to behold, it is a massive pork chop and it was cooked perfectly, tender and juicy without being too rare or dry (tough to do with a piece of pork this size). A great cut of meat. However, I found myself thinking that the pork chop was still missing something, as it seemed a bit light on flavor. The Fiancee liked her Filet, but I also got the same feeling from her as I did about my dish, that while a great cut of meat and cooked perfectly, something was still missing. So the quality of the food served really didn't disappoint, but I felt that with the money we were shelling out (yes this place is expensive, even for NYC restaurants) that something was still missing about our experience.However, that does not mean we won't be back. While we might not come back to dine specifically, coming in and enjoying the bar scene might definitely be in the cards for the next NYC trip.",5,0,1,David R.,"Fort Worth, TX",95,307,255
2.0,2/17/2015,"Similar to the Russian Tea Room, Tavern on the Green is one of those quintessential New York City establishments you have to try at least once in your life. In fact, once is more than enough. Tavern on the Green is a beautiful restaurant. The bar area, which is separate from the main dining room, is elegant and would be perfect for a drink after work. The open kitchen is huge and is the main focal point for the space. Full length glass windows line the walls and the views of Central Park are breathtaking. I came here for Restaurant Week last night [$38 for dinner, +$20 for wine pairing] and found myself very glad that I didn't pay the full price for a meal.__Cremini Mushroom Soup: The meal started on a very high note. The cremini mushroom soup was extremely flavorful and rich. There was a slight hint of spice which I suspect comes from the chipotle chili cream. It was a complex dish and was absolutely delicious. Roast Half Chicken: The roast half chicken was bland and the white meat was extremely dry. It was almost too hard to get down. Unfortunately, there were three large pieces and I hate to see food go to to waste. The shaved vegetable salad on the side tasted like it was suppose to be pickled but was somehow diluted. It just didn't work. The potato gratin was probably the best element on the plate. Too bad there wasn't more of it. Bosc Pears: In theory, this would have been a great dessert. I didn't find anything about the pears to be outstanding, they were literally pears poached in red wine. The salted caramel ice cream was delightful, but I could have found this flavor in any artisan ice cream shop. The candied ginger was haphazardly strewn around the plate and overwhelmed the whole dish and consequently my palate. ___Presentation on all dishes was sloppy. It seemed as though sauce was just splattered and spilled anywhere the spoon fell. Service was extremely attentive, to the point of being intrusive. I particularly did not like being interrupted mid conversation numerous times by our waitress and the manager. During each course they went around to every table and asked how the food was. Once is enough. $66 per person seemed a little steep considering the quality, anything more would have been a complete ripoff.",5,0,0,Felisa F.,"Brooklyn, NY",52,198,192

While it is very nice to eat on a pavilion in the park the food was disspointing and too expensive. To start we ordered a pastries and bread basket which had 4 pastries and no bread at all. For being a brunch place they forgot the toasts and half the pastries. Then we ordered the vegetable soup and sandwich which consisted on a soup with two small toasts floating inside. The steak was nice although the sides were scarce, the scrambled eggs with asparagus were more an appetizer than a main course as they were tiny and the carbonara pasta with peas, mushrooms and bacon was too creamy and had about 2 pieces of bacon on it. They also gave us lots of inconveniences to sit as we were with a stroller, in spite of the place being half empty. Typical place that lives off the location.

I had this idea that they really meant cooked on a cedar plank or something. I can tell you when you're expecting a hot dish, cold fish is very disappointing! I wish the waiter had warned me! My coworkers got the hamburger and the filet. Both looked excellent, although, I'm pretty sure for the price I can get an equally delicious hamburger at the local pub!

Two of my guests thought the regular old coffee was amazing (how often does that get reviewed), my mimosa with a touch of peach was wonderful, and my husband thought the bloody mary was one of the best he's had.  Our entrees included the salmon eggs benedict, carbonara, stuffed french toast, and asparagus scrambled eggs. Every one of us cleaned our plates. Things were going so well we couldn't resist the desserts and, while I didn't try the others, my chocolate mousse was SO good.Throughout our stay our waiter was perfect - professional, knowledgable, personable, and attentive while not hovering or rushing us.

To drink, I ordered a Bloody Mary, it tasted like cocktail sauce over ice, disgusting.

In good weather, there is a lot of outdoor seating available as well.The great location with the park views, and the area of the restaurant with glass walls and ceilings that allows you to stay warm while being inches away from the snow covered park views is an unbeatable experience.This place is popular especially following the renovations.

I did not care for it but that's probably just because I would not want ricotta cheese in my French toast.  They had a few loose leaf teas  to chose from.  I was given the wrong one initially and had to ask for a new one.  Overall we enjoyed our time and I would definitely go again for brunch and I would like to try their dinner.",3,1,1,Nicole C.,"Manhattan, NY",109,121,477

Fireworks in Central Park, broadcasting of the ball drop, a band, dancing, four hours of open bar, hors d'oeuvres -- it was definitely a night to remember and the perfect way to cap of 2014.We spent most of the night at the bar (no surprise, there, right?) because...Hello? Open bar! But, also, because the band was literally right next to the bar and I'm all about live music (and dancing after a few drinks.) The band was really, really good, too. The broadcasting of the ball drop was also near the bar, so, really, we were in the perfect spot for everything. Servers came around periodically with trays of hors d'oeuvres; I, personally, was a fan of the shrimp, skewers and the chocolate mousse. The chocolate mousse, especially -- it was heaven.Before midnight, we were all given party favors (New Year's Eve tiaras!) and champagne, and they started broadcasting from Times Square. Then, of course, came the countdown and celebrating, but the real ""WOW!"" moment for me was the fireworks that came minutes after the ball drop. I've never celebrated New Year's Eve with fireworks, and New Year's Eve with fireworks in Central Park...it's just about as ""New York City"" as you can get and so, so, so fun! The rest of the night was filled with more dancing, more drinking and more celebrating.The staff (bartenders, servers, etc.) were super attentive and sweet. The bartenders, especially, were great and so on top of things.

Central Park is such a beautiful place and it is very unfortunate that this area has to waste it's space on such a disappointing place. But just like every restaurant in Times Square, despite the food, it is always packed and will stay in business. I cannot give ""good"" suggestions because they are all bad. Honestly, just go to a hot dog stand and take a walk through the park. Better yet, get hotdogs and ride around in the city on a carriage. It will be cheaper and better.

Entrees were also very lackluster.  A few from our group ordered the steak.  The ones that came out were very thin and the requested medium rare steak had to be sent back since steaks that thin are very hard to cook properly.  I split the chicken and the porkchop with someone in the group.  The chicken tasted fine, some portions of the skin were still pretty pale but wow, were the sides salty.  Where most of the rest of the food was bland, whoever was on the sides station must have dumped a tablespoon of salt in each serving.  The pork chop tasted fine although chewy but I've had better pork chops at basically every other restaurant that I've had one in NYC.Service was not bad but he tried to upsell because I guess that's what you do at a tourist destination.  On top of that, the place is priced like Marea but tastes like it could maybe be the 4th best restaurant in North Dakota.

2.0,12/16/2014,"I dined at the refurbished Tavern on the Green last week, and the buidling and atmosphere was more of an experience than the food. Admittedly, I had never been before the renovations, but the current iteration feels more like a museum with fair cafe food than a true elite restaurant. As some other reviewers have stated, the restaurant exudes class. Its walls, lighting and ambiance is classy, yet full of energy. However, the food was unimpressive. I've had better salmon at local mom and pop shops than the salmon I tasted here. The macoroni and cheese side was soupy and bland. The service was fine, but not outstanding. I wouldn't go back to eat here unless someone else was paying for it. At the very least, I'd go for a drink at the bar to soak in the atmosphere. I hope they work on the menu, because I do feel like there's a lot of potential.",2,0,0,N. O.,"Jersey City, NJ",7,38,3

The hostesses were not helpful and spent much more time gossiping up front instead of taking parties to the half empty dining room.

It took fully 45 minutes in line to ""check in"", where we were told they were running 2 hours behind. Really? By 6:30 with all seats requiring reservations? How could their planning be that bad? But it just got worse, which became humorous after awhile. The eventual unheated ""tent"" seating, unable to get our ""included"" champagne (we felt lucky to finally get water), the holiday menu completely changed since our reservation to only turkey or beef, the only two things we didn't want. Each course came incompletely plated from the high school cafeteria style operation they were running in the open kitchen for all to watch in horror. We all ordered the same thing, but each plate was different. Some had everything but were cold, others were hot but missing garnishes, or gravy, or sauce, etc. My son's ""vegetarian"" option was a mound of stuffing, turkey gravy and cranberry sauce (no turkey, so vegetarian). By this time, it was becoming funny in a way to watch this tragedy unfold and we actually stayed, which was our mistake. Many other people simply got up and left mid-meal in disgust. When our bill came, which we shouldn't have paid, I handed them my credit card which they then charged a totally different and higher amount to. When I asked why and refused to sign, they didn't have an answer and didn't return to the table after that.

3.0,11/30/2014,"3 stars for decor, and well, thats about it. Not that the food was terrible because it wasn't. However, I think I came here expecting more because of the legendary name and was disappointed as a result. My first disappointment was the lack of valet parking. No, I'm not the type of snob that cannot park his own vehicle. However, knowing the parking situation around central park, and knowing how much money the meal was going to cost, well yes, I thought somebody could take my car. A gentleman in riding boots and a top hat (why?) politely told us they stopped doing this. I thought maybe you could nix the doorman and keep the valet. I digress....We had reservations, though I saw many people waiting to eat and many open tables. I will never understand this. We were seated and began with a basket of assorted Balthazar pastries which I thought were good but not great.  We also had the Salmon tartare which I will admit I have never ordered before so I cannot say whether it was good or bad. My girlfriend and mom had the Brioche French Toast Stuffed with Cinnamon-Vanilla Ricotta, Pear-Blackberry Compote and Maple Bacon. Could've used more ricotta, and maybe some maple syrup. They offered a pitcher of maple syrup as a side dish. Thats not a side dish. Its a requirement for certain breakfast items and french toast, and certainly a plate of 20 dollar french toast should come with this. My stepsister ordered the Lobster Chowder. Lobster, Lobster Roe Butter and Scrambled Local Eggs with Fresh Goat Cheese and Chives, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Sourdough Toast and enjoyed both, but did not say either were spectacular. I ordered the Grilled Hamburger Steak, Sunny-Side Up Farm Egg, Ranchera Sauce. They were out of hamburger steak so they subbed it for either rib-eye or skirt which was fine by me, but charged me 4 dollars more which I thought was kinda tacky. If you run out of a food item you can either take it off the menu, or sub it for something else, but take the hit if need be. Again, good but not great. The best part of the meal were the bloody Marys which were strong and spicy. Service was a bit on the slow side, and the Waitress, though very nice, was not very good.Im glad I got to experience Tavern on the Green, but certainly will not be returning.",4,0,0,Evan S.,"Bronx, NY",65,191,13

Again, not judge mental or snooty when it comes to food but honestly I don't even know what to say about the turkey I was served. We made friends with our neighbors beside us who were served white meat pieces of turkey. When mine came out it was dark meat that you couldn't even cut your knife into. I asked the waitress to send my meal back for some white meat as I couldn't even eat the dark meat(it was barely edible). The manager brought out my second plate of turkey personally and it happened to be dark meat yet again. He apologized telling me that they had run out of white meat and that he would comp my meal and come back to discuss things with us. He never reappeared. eVEr! When our bill came my meal was not comped. We were disgusted! Please please please do not book your Christmas dinner at this restaurant. You will be mortified at what you get. We walked away with a $500 bill for 3 of us and by the end of the night had to just laugh it off. The owner and manager of this restaurant should be ASHAMED of themselves. If we would have known another place to go we would have walked out on the meal but honestly after waiting 2 hours we were starving and helpless.

However, when we went to leave we encountered a bit of an issue of no one seemingly wanting to call us a cab. It was odd. The bartender said to ask the doorman, who (literally) told us to walk to Central Park West because ""not a lot of cabs come to their door."" Well no shit they don't, that's why we asked you to call one! But, rather quickly, the manager (I think) popped up and a cab materialized.

We sat outside on the patio on a brisk windy day overlooking the park. A jazz quartet featuring a young man reminiscent of Harry Connick, Jr. was playing, so I really enjoyed that ambience. The service was rather slow, but eventually the food arrived. I had the 2 cheeseburgers (you could only order 2) for $34. The most I'd ever paid for cheeseburgers, but actually they were quite delicious. The other offerings were mainly finger food, cheese and crackers, hummus and such. They were just ok. I was a little off put by the price, but the occasion of dining at the iconic TOTG seemed worth it once I chilled with my glass of wine and enjoyed the jazz.

It's with about half that. The brunch includes a small basket of pastries, which were forgotten. We had to ask twice before they were brought to the table.  And they were forgettable.  Unfortunately, the kitchen software apparently crashed right as our orders went in.  Of course, we only found this out (much) later.  It took 91 minutes from the time we sat down until we received our food. During this entire time, the restaurant knew the kitchen was a mess, as the system was rebooted and restored, but they never explained the situation, or offered us more drinks for the inconvenience, or brought more bread, or really anything.  They just ignored us while we waited.About 60 minutes into our wait, the table next to ours got its food.  (and yes, they were seated AFTER we arrived - when all the orders were re-input into the kitchen software, they didn't go back in chronological order).  The server dropped one of the plates - and entire dish of scrambled eggs - on the floor and didn't clean them up.  They picked up the big chunks and left the rest on the floor for the entire time we were there.  Yuk.When the food finally did arrive, it was mediocre.  The brunch sliced ham on a baguette came out as a slapped-together ham and cheese sandwich on very chewy bread with a handful of Lay's potato chips right out of the bag.  This was $45?  Worth about $9 at any NY sandwich shop.  My wife ordered poached eggs on grits. The grits were like a rubber disk and the eggs were not poached, they were hard boiled.  One of our party ordered the steak and eggs, but in the whole 90 minutes we waited none of the servers had time to bring a steak knife.  She wanted over 5 minutes while the rest of us ate waiting for a knife to be delivered.When our check came, there was no apology for the wait or any discount.  We asked to talk to the manager who at first acted like she had no idea anything was wrong.  But she quickly changed her tune and took 50% off our check.  So why not one star?  Well, the décor is nice.  Its a pleasant place to be, even if the service is bad.  Also, the kitchen meltdown is almost certainly. a rare occurrence and I can't believe that will happen regularly.  So really, the two stars is based on the poor service for high-priced, mediocre food.",4,0,0,Bryan M.,"Folsom, CA",0,78,3
3.0,10/28/2014,"I wanted to give this restaurant more stars but just couldn't. Actually 2 stars for the food but added another one for the service. Yes, it's a landmark, an institution and a tourist trap but with the price the food should have been superb. Yes they just re-opened with new owners but the chef should reassess their food offerings and the taste as well. Foodies are very meticulous these days and diners mostly rely on reviews.  For people to comment about the taste of the food is not good for business.

2.0,10/9/2014,"The sum up is, this isn't a tourist trap, but it's a tourist magnet, and there are many places you could go to that are better, and you can stop reading now.The brunch menu is simple--cobb salad, scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, steak & eggs.  That sort of thing.  Diner-ish, though it felt like the ingredients used were high quality.  Nothing I had or saw was bad but none of it was great, and no one would come here if not for the legendary name and the location.  But those two things mean the menu is pricey--that cobb salad is $28.  So you end up paying a touristy surcharge for not-exceptional diner-ish food in a location that is admittedly lovely except for all the ways in which it is very much not lovely, e.g., the Atrium on a sunny day is blindingly sunny in spots and also has horrible acoustics, so it's very loud and feels, in the end, like a very lovingly designed cafeteria.  Service was a pretty confused during my visit.  Our second courses came at the same time, or before, the first ones.  There was some logic for this the head waiter explained, but I didn't understand what he said.  One of our dishes never came.  The bread basket came at the same time as the 2nd course.  Some of the salads seemed to be come without dressing, or so lightly dressed that it seemed more a mistake than an explicit decision by a chef.  There were other small issues.  All of this wasn't so much of a bother, but it did add up and detract from the experience, and this place looks very fancy and charges fancy prices, so you'd expect it to have its act more together.  My sister wanted a dish that happened to come with stringy fries, which she didn't want.  She asked if any substitutes were possible--any other potatoes, maybe?  Rice?  Anything.  They said no.  If this were some kind of Michelin-starred place where the chefs place a premium on the integrity of their dishes and will not suffer substitution requests, then okay.  But it's not, so why not just offer her some other kind of potatoes?  (In defense of the staff, the atrium, where we were sitting, is really loud, and the room was bustling with a lunch/brunch crowd.  Some of the confusion may've been attributed to those things.)Final notes:* The space is lovely and I assume even lovelier in the evening, when strings of lights come on in the garden.  It might be a whole different and better experience.* There is a man in a costume at the door--a top hat and a vest.  You should probably be wary of any restaurant that forces its employees to wear a costume.",4,4,2,Daniel B.,"New York, NY",414,641,407

It was as good as done...it was a setting straight out of a fairytale, I knew that I had found THE place to ask for my dearests hand...

3.0,9/8/2014,"I visited for brunch on Sunday. To summarize, as with a lot of 'iconic' places in NYC, you pay for the location, live music, and name, not the food iteself. I went with friends visiting NYC and the atmosphere did not disappoint. That being said, the décor did not make up for overly slow service and a pricy 2 -course brunch pre fixe ($45 including 1 cocktail).The portions are generous and the food is nicely prepared and presented. I enjoyed the basket of mixed pastries brought to the table (including bonne maman jam, a personal fav from when I lived in France). They also have great iced coffee. I tried the steak and eggs with patatas bravas and had a bite of my friend's French toast which was stuffed with ricotta. Both meals were presented nicely and had fairly large portions. Unfortunately my other friend's meal was sent back 3 times (she wasn't picky, the staff just never brought her what she had ordered). The waiter felt terrible and comped it, also offering us free dessert. Overall the food was good, it just wasn't amazing compared to other brunch places in NYC. I probably will not go back until I have more guests from out of town; however, I do recommend grabbing an iced coffee from their take-away stand and then heading for a stroll through the park.",2,0,0,Nikita K.,"New York, NY",31,224,34
3.0,9/6/2014,"We brought 35 people here for a post wedding brunch.  We thought it would be fun to have the brunch in such a beautiful, iconic setting.We thought the $45 price was a great deal, as this was a three course meal with a nice menu.  The food was quite good, although the service was so slow that some of the hot dishes arrived cold.  Some of our guests had to leave to catch flights before they got their meals because of the slowness factor.  The room we were in was virtually empty, so not sure why the service was so poor.I do need to mention that we got a rather snarky email two days before the event that we would be charged a minimum of $8,000 if we ended up having more than 40 people, or $140 per person.  This would have included the rental of another section of the building for $2500.

1.0,9/2/2014,"I came here for my parents' 40th anniversary and my mom's 70th birthday. Needless to say, it was a very special occasion and I had mentioned as much in the notes section when making my reservation on Open Table. I subsequently called the restaurant to remind them and to let them know that we would have a vegan in the party and asked if they could accommodate. It was clear once we got there that our waiter had no idea about the occasion nor did he know about the vegan. While chatting up many of the tables around us, we sat for at least 15 minutes before we ever got water - which only happened after we flagged down another waiter. This set the tone for the service we proceeded to have throughout the dinner.When asked if he got the note about the vegan in the party, he lied, said he did and proceeded to list the supposed vegan options, many of which had dairy and fish. Then he said something about being from the South, which should excuse him from knowing what vegan means. He wasn't very apologetic. It was also clear he had no idea about the occasion. I then went up to a manager to remind them about the occasion and was assured that all would be taken care of - whatever that means, b/c we continued to receive lackluster treatment thought the night and no acknowledgment in any way that it's someone's 70th birthday or 40th anniversary. Finally, my brother in law asked if they could bring a piece of cake or something and complained a bit in the process. There was finally some acknowledgment, but by then the evening was practically ruined. Going to Tavern on the Green is something my Dad has talked about doing ever since we were kids. This was his first time there, and sorry to say it was huge let down. We didn't expect anything more than good service - and we definitely didn't get that - but a little acknowledgment of the occasion would have gone a long way.

So, I asked for outdoor seating in the shade, and when we all arrived we were seated, and really enjoyed our meal in a super convenient location, almost adjacent to 2 great play grounds, and plenty of free street parking on the Sunday before Labor Day. Food is really good too. I'm not sure what a gourmet foodie would say, but my Cobb salad was fresh, interestingly seasoned, and as a New Yorker, my most important barometer- nobody got sick. A kids menu is available, and at 11am, we could get the pix fixe menu or  ala carte, so everyone was happy, and in my family, that's not easy. Our waiter was busy, but was around for coffee refills, and checking in. And my Bloody Mary was delicious.

1.0,8/25/2014,"I wanted to love this place. Honestly. I really wanted to love this place. I'm almost tempted to give this place 5 stars even though 0 would actually be a more accurate reflection because it really does pain me to see so many others giving it such low reviews. If you're wondering why, here's the story: I had a serious love affair with the history of this restaurant since I first moved to NY as a (very broke) college student before it closed back in 2009, but with its bourgeois menu prices, I had missed my chance because it was way beyond my reach. So imagine my excitement when I heard it had reopened earlier this year, there was nothing, and I mean nothing that was going to get in the way between me and a table.We went shortly after Pete Wells' NYTimes weekly restaurant review was published, and despite his uninspiring account, I just wouldn't - no, couldn't - believe it until I judged it for myself. But oh man.. The disappointment was by far, way worse than what I could have ever prepared for. I won't even describe the scrambled service, it literally looked like watching chickens running around with their heads cut off: servers didn't know their table numbers, the shattering sound of glasses breaking hit us from left and right, and I had even heard a party of 3 at a nearby table getting into an argument with a waiter for how long it was taking to get the check, so let me get straight to the food instead; it was inedible. We ordered the Patatas Bravas with Aioli, Crimini Mushrooms, and I think the Tavern Salad, but Holy Mother of God, none of it was palatable. In fact, one of the dishes, the patatas, was quite literally painful to eat because the amount of salt that was in each bite. It felt like it curing my tongue and burning my tastes buds clean off. As for the mushrooms, it tasted like soap. I still shudder at the mere memory of that meal. On a positive note, the outside seating area is beautiful and feels like you're sitting in an oasis in this ""concrete jungle."" That is, of course, if you're sitting facing the park.

They let us sit down but once our drinks came, made us move to an inside table for another party? ...

For $20 I expected SOMETHING exciting about a veggie sandwich... I dunno maybe an artichoke or something? SOMETHING! Maybe it is my fault because they don't have a veggie sandwich on the menu, I'm vegetarian and didn't want just salad.I had the Berry Shortcake for dessert, and didn't eat very much of it... it didn't taste good at all.I did enjoy my boss' chocolate mousse, but then again that is pretty hard to mess up.

The new owners of TotG did a great job of preserving the look of the old TotG restaurant!!We first ordered drinks - a ""Bronx"" for me, and a Bloody Mary for her. We also ordered the BLUEFISH PATE as a starter - Excellent! Only came with 3 small pieces of toast, but our server was happy to bring more. I had the TURKEY SANDWICH, and she had the GREEK SALAD W/ TUNA. We were both very pleased with our entrees. The only thing that made me take a star off of this review was the size of the menu... There were not many choices. Only 3 entrees, and 2/3 were salads. Though almost everything on the menu sounded great, I would have expected more entree choices. After dinner we ordered a CHEESE PLATE. Great selection of cheeses. Our server allowed us to move outside to eat our cheese plate and enjoy a few more drinks, and that was very nice. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Our total bill was around $150 after 4 drinks, an appetizer, 2 entrees, and a cheese plate.

1.0,8/1/2014,"on Sunday, July 6th, my wife and I decided that since most people are probably out of town during the July 4th weekend, it's a good time to stop by the new Tavern on the Green to grab brunch and spend the gorgeous afternoon.The outdoor seating area was great.  The brunch menu was nothing exciting.  Food was find, but not much to write home about.Our waitress Erica, was alright, stopped by frequently to tend to our needs, but was obvious that she is quite new at this.Towards end of brunch time, when the restaurant was changing over to dinner settings, we chatted with a busboy named Marcos.  Marcos is a veteran in the restaurant business, coming from some fancy restaurants down in the Meat Packing area.  He explained the menu to us, as well as the methods and philosophy behind the chef's choices of foods and menu items.  He was able to make the menu sound a lot more exciting than it actually were, and made our experience there a much better one...something we wished our waitress were able to do BEFORE we placed our orders.  However, Marcos did make us want to come back to try out the dinner menu one of these days.Besides leaving a separate larger tip for Marcos on our way out, we felt compelled to mention this positive experience to the restaurant manager.We were directed to an individual in a hat, ear phone in on ear, with skinny ankle length pants...a total faux-chic individual.  However, manager is manager, we should tell him what a great experience Marcos helped create.  To our surprise, he was very dismissive to what we had to say, and said about our compliments: ""...oh, yeah, we get that ALL THE TIME....""  All the time?  Well, guess what?  Here is our ratings:Food:  3 starsServices overall:  4 starsWait staff (Erica):  3.5 starsBusboy (Marcos):  5 starsmanager:  -16 starsThis adds up to a ""0"" (-.5 technically) to the overall score, but Yelp does not allow us to give 0's or negative numbers in reviews.  Way to go!  Leave it to the 'manager' to screw things up!If I were the chef or owner, I get rid this manager really quickly, and give Marcos a huge promotion to a different post where he gets to talk up the menu to other clients he did to us.",16,6,4,A W.,"New York, NY",124,55,223

The food menu is a bit dated, but everything was tasty enough.  However, my fish still had the skin on it, which made it particularly difficult to eat since there was a hummus like sauce served on top.  I had to take off the sauce, then the skin, then put the sauce back on.  Personally, I don't like having to dissect my food before I eat it, but maybe I'm not cool. It's good, but it all just feels past it's prime.  However, I'd be down for a smart cocktail at the oak bar inside, if anyone's interested.",0,0,0,Topher N.,"ASTORIA, NY",40,60,0

2.0,7/30/2014,"We had fond memories of this place from having attended their last NYE party before they closed in 2009 so when we heard they were open again we decided to return for the memories.  Well you know the old saying...never as good as the first time.  This return trip was supposed to have been a special occasion, my birthday, but instead it turned into such a major disappointment.  They get points for updating the decor, seating us earlier than our reservation, and being cognizant of my allergies (which I listed when making the online reservation) and that's it.While we didn't wait long for our server to give us menus and some water, the waiting time for everything afterwards became longer and longer.  First when I asked to have a different drink (the first one had something in it that irritated my throat) which was a glass of wine, I waited and waited and had to ask two times before I finally got it.  Server said he would have some bread sent to our table.  Saw bread go other places but not to us.  Had to ask two different people for the bread which was tiny skinny bread sticks and olive bread.  The lemon infused butter was nice though.Our appetizer was scallops - $16.00 for two average sized scallops on a baguette.  Our entrees were a mixed bag.  Hub's meal was good; the lamb was tasty as was the curried beans that went with it.  My meal? Asked for my salmon to be cooked medium and it came out well done.  The sauteed greens with it were bitter to the point of being inedible but the carrot puree was tasty.  The server was more often seen scurrying around like crazy going to other tables and who knows where else but not very often to ours.  When it was time for desert I ordered the birthday cake.  He mentioned the cake comes out on a plate with Happy Birthday written on it but would that be an issue as it was written in chocolate (my allergen). I said no as long as it wasn't touch the cake.Someone else brought out the cake with a lit candle in it and no writing.  The cake was a bit dry and bland, I've had better.  When the server just happened to come and check on us the only thing he noticed was that I had taken the candle off the cake and placed it on the table; didn't once notice no happy birthday writing nor did he ever extend birthday greetings to me.Only ate half the cake because besides the lack of taste, we just wanted to leave it had been such a big disappointment for my birthday.  And we had to wait and wait for the check which we noticed the table right next to us had to do when they wanted to leave.  We expected so much more but received so much less and all for over $150.00.  Then when I called to speak with management about our displeasure, it took two days before someone finally returned my call which I couldn't answer as I was at the airport heading home.  Basically it was me playing phone tag with them (I was told the managers were all busy on the floor - really?) for a few days until I was finally able to talk to two managers...and still they have not done what they said they would to try to make amends (still no email from them as promised).Totally uncalled for Tavern.",10,0,1,Teri D.,"Powell, OH",116,721,51

It's nothing to write home about, but sitting on the patio with a glass of wine and a few great friends is what it is all about. The hanging lanterns and stacks of tables remind me of the Tea Cups at Disneyland and, quite literally, the waitresses are the mad hatters - running here and there, forgetting everything, but doing so with a smile on their faces. I can't really recommend any great dishes, but the breadsticks are delicious and I would have eaten tons of those if given the chance.

Cooked Italian Ham and Cave-Aged Gruyere on a Baguette....again sounds great, but came out like a slice from a 6 foot party sub, COLD and thrown together likely a day or so ago. Maybe it was my incorrect expectation, but that's the PERFECT opportunity to press that sucker and get some melty, gooey, goodness. The fingerling potatoes were the best of the bunch...nicely seasoned and served with some good hollandaise sauce, but still seemed like they were prepared a day or so ago and simply reheated.

There service is a bit mixed and needs better organizing, but they are eager and charming.  The outside furniture is wobbly and not too attractive, and the inside a bit too harsh, white, and the sound is clattery and unpleasant but the view of the garden compensates.is Still all needs a bit of polishing, but really a good beginning that with practice should be a rest continuation of the iconic Tavern.",0,0,0,sandra s.,"Santa Barbara, CA",0,23,0

1.0,6/24/2014,"It is here that, several years ago, I proposed to a woman I had been seeing for a little over six months. We had traveled to at least two different States, and there had been multiple instances in which we ate brie or shared chocolate desserts. I heard her fart twice, though on one occasion my ears might have been playing tricks on me, and on the other occasion, it might have been a creaky door. I don't have an ear fetish, but she had large, magnificent ears and thin lips. She was much smarter than I was and more interesting, too. In short, I loved her, and I took her here, to the tavern on the green, because it was such a beautiful restaurant and she was such a beautiful woman and I wanted that night to be such a beautiful memory. No one comes here for the food.She said no. She pushed some fish ceviche thing around her plate and excused herself from the table and never came back. She texted me later to say that she was sorry and that we shouldn't see each other anymore. I never asked her why she said no, and she never told me why. I stopped caring for myself. I gained a significant amount of weight that I suspect I'll never lose. I thought of her again recently. She's getting married to someone who's so unlike myself. I took a male friend to the tavern on the green because I wanted to revisit this space, and I didn't want to be alone. The place looks different from what I remember. The food is still mediocre. It made no impression on me other than being a little pricey for the quality and portion size. My friend and I are dull old bastards, and the dinner was rather dreary.

1.0,6/24/2014,"If I could give this restaurant a minus star I would!!  My daughter took me there for what we thought would be a lovely brunch, as I had reminisced about the original Tavern on the Green.  What a tremendous disappointment.  We were dressed as though we were going to the original one.  Wrong!!  We felt out of place as the norm was jeans, shorts, sneakers, and jogging suits. Not exactly what I would consider appropriate attire for a Sunday brunch in Central Park. When we were leaving, a gentleman was asking the doorman, if a coat and tie was required, as he was prepared if he needed one. Obviously he thought he was going to high class establishment.  Was he in for a rude awakening. The only thing high class about it is the price!  All I can say about the food is that I would have preferred McDonalds!  The ricotta French toast was barely warm and dry. It basically had no flavor at all. Also it came out in less than 2 minutes after we ordered which made it obvious that it was prepared in advance and microwaved.  Not what one would expect from a restaurant of this caliber!  Also there was absolutely no nice plate presentation, which is very common in nicer restaurants.

4.0,6/22/2014,"Lovely!  The remodel has produced a atmosphere that captures the old architecture, the light, open feel of the glass room and outdoor patio seating while bringing in new fabrics and an open, airy feel. The patios is clearly the most desired place to sit so you can enjoy the atmosphere and feel of the park, but other areas are nice as well.  Reservations are a good idea. I would ask for the courtyard if the weather is nice or it is evening and you like the fairy light effect.  The glass room is nice for natural light, but does have the open kitchen so is louder. If you stop in without reservations or go on a whim after being in Central Park, try sitting in the bar area at one of the couch groupings by the open windows facing the courtyard.  It is very comfortable and open with a pleasant breeze.  The service is a bit slow when you first sit down, but everyone is very friendly and attentive once your server visits you. We arrived close to lunch so had a combination of lunch and breakfast dishes.  The blueberry pancakes were a favorite. The lunch salad with chicken had two full chicken breasts served with it that were very tender and so big they had to be shared!  On the pricey side, you are paying for the experience as much as the food, but the food was worth it.  Wine by the glass is around $15-20.  Entrees were about $30. Most dishes and sides are a la carte. A very pleasant dining experience.  We will return!",2,0,0,Bret A.,"Tampa, FL",47,666,140
3.0,6/21/2014,"Meh....Pros: The restaurant is absolutely beautiful. When making your reservation, ask to be seated in the second/central room with the open kitchen. It's truly special: Open, airy and bright. There is a back dining room that is also lovely but darker in decor and lighting. The outdoor and bar seating options are also nice but have a more casual feel.Cons: Both the food/menu and service leave a lot to be desired and it seems as though, as they are newly reopened, they are still working out kinks. Our entire group was unimpressed with the menu. Portions are relatively small and the food itself is mediocre. The bread basket offered two different types of breadsticks - both seemed stale. I ordered the endive salad to be followed by the BBQ brisket. The salad was the highlight for me. The endive was topped with shaved Parmesan cheese and sardines, like a Caesar revamped. The brisket should be listed on the menu as short rib not BBQ brisket. It was disappointing as were it's plate mates, the slaw and potato salad - both flavorless. Beginning with the initial greeting from the hostesses (there was an unreasonably long line/wait to the hostess stand), all of the staff seem lackadaisical and it's disappointing because the ambiance begs for a higher caliber of service.

3.0,6/19/2014,"The atmosphere was very charming. There's a small outdoor patio before you enter the building. Upon entry the decor is lovely and as you walk from one architectural intersection to the next you find yourself in a differently designed space. The middle space with the glass enclosure looked like the most appetizing, but fills up quickly. You get a great view of the kitchen and the inner courtyard without the bugs/mosquitoes and the hustle and bustle smothering one's experience. Closer to the kitchen was more seating, the couches/booths are too soft - be prepared to sink in a bit! The chairs, well, I didn't test those out. There are two bar areas. One more welcoming than the other. The secret ""back room"" has one of the not so welcoming bars - as there's rarely anyone there to serve. It might be used only on special occasions. The other bar area is to the right upon entry and has seating around the perimeter.I sat in the back room - green seats. Less visibility into the courtyard. Dimmer lighting. The courtyard too has plenty of seating, but they WILL NOT alter the tables and their positions. So either, there's space or there isn't. The ""floating"" lights over the courtyard is wonderful at night. Looks like jellies floating in the night sky. We were there from 8pm - 12am. Had no issues with being kicked out or what have you. Plenty of people were still enjoying their meals/time spent there.The waitress we had kept on saying ""oh, that's so good too!"" for EVERYTHING on the menu.... 'cept for mine, she mentioned that it's new and wanted feedback. I completely butchered my dish. It wasn't bad or send-back worthy, but it wasn't that great either. I had the Striped Bass. It wasn't fishy but it was half rubbery half soft. The eggplant paste was gross and did not go with the overall flavors of the dish nor the fish. The skin of the fish was too tough to cut through. I ended up peeling it back and leaving it on the side. The olives and potatoes were a nice garnish. The broth was good, wish the fish had more time to bathe in it. Would have been excellent. The plate came out warm, not hot. :( Prior to that I had ordered the Tavern Salad - without the Speck (ham) - it was pretty good too. All in all it was worth it to go, but the food was not spectacular (especially for the price paid). Some of my fam. ordered braised beef (excellent), half chicken (didn't taste, but all I saw left on the plate were the bones), faroe islands salmon (awful), egg ceviche & salmon ceviche (good), potato side (excellent), etc.The wine selection is good, but we think they got their dry wines mixed up with their soft wines. Have yet to taste a cocktail or other sort. The desserts were all delish. Can't go wrong there. There's no on-site parking, however if you need a taxi they have plenty waiting outside for your convenience. Some of the staff are dressed whimsically - it's nice to see. The bathrooms - All black - Alzheimer's folk, watch out! The first two stalls are tiny! The door folds into the toilet rather than out of, so it's tough to get in and out of the stalls. The H.C. stall is best if you're not thinner than a stick. All in all - lovely experience, and I would go back again.",3,2,0,Ronit M.,"Jericho, NY",93,253,990
2.0,6/19/2014,"Very disappointed. Arrived on a Saturday afternoon with two friends to have a cocktail and maybe an appetizer. We were told by the host we could sit at the tables behind the bar on the patio and someone would be there to help us right away. We sat at the table with no menus and no help for about 15 minutes. At that point I walked up to the bar and saw the waitress who supposed to be helping our table. I asked if we should just order from the bar and she said we could do that or find a table and order from her. I informed her that we already had a table, we were the three women who had been sitting for 20 minutes and no service. Everything took much longer than it should have. It took multiple trips by servers for us to get the correct menus. We ordered a charcuterie plate, a bottle of wine and my friend ordered a cocktail. The food came out within about 10 minutes. About 10 -15 minutes later the cocktail came out. 15 minutes later the bottle of wine came out. It didn't make any sense. The only redeeming factor was that we had a great view of Sheep's Meadow and it was a beautiful day outside for people watching. The waitress did a one point apologize and say that she was sorry because it was ""so busy."" However, it was not busy at all and there were only 3 or 4 other tables being waited on in our area.

I know it's an appetizer but it was seriously about the size of my palm, maybe just slightly larger. Not worth $18. My dad got the ceviche trio and loved it. The caesar salad was good, as was the local duck egg (although, that, too is small).

The build and decor are hands down the best part of this place- beautiful floor to ceiling windows and an outdoor open to the park. Our waitress was great and very helpful. The food: average at best. We tried a variety of the dishes and we weren't too impressed. Their wine list is not bad however. Next, we decided to move over the the inside bar which again the decor was the best part.

Also tried dessert at the bar- the riccota cheesecake was great, the brownie sundae -pretty disappointing. Tavern on the Green struggles to find its place between pretentious/ upscale and casual.

2.0,5/31/2014,"WON'T BE BACK, sadly.  I was so hopeful for the new Tavern on the Green.  We went for dinner last night.  When we walked in, I was blown away with the amazing renovations. It was truly stunning.  Unfortunately, everything beyond the decor was BEYOND disappointing.  It started from where they sat our party of 5... I kept getting hit by waiters and food runners within the first 5 minutes.  Yikes.  Please don't pack us in like sardines.  Our waitress was charismatic, but not well suited for a fine dining restaurant.  She definitely was not nearly as professional as I would expect.  But let's get to the most important part: the food.  WOW, disappointing is an understatement.  We ordered 2 Duck Egg appetizers.  It was overly salty and not well balanced.  We also had the smoked bluefish pate.  It was ok.Then after our appetizers, we waited and waited for our entrees... 1 HOUR later they came , but only 4 out of 5.  Our server forgot to put in one of the entrees and one of the sides.  She realized it about 10 min after the rest of us got our meals.  20 minutes after the 4 of us had our entrees, our friend's entree finally came.  So the food:  overall, my impression is the quality of the meat was not a high quality.  The pork chop was similar to what I can get at the grocery store, thin, cartilage in the middle, and not the quality that I expected.  It was not overcooked, but dry because the quality was poor.  They really should up their ingredients.  Everyone's dish was cold when it was served to us (except of course the last meal that was ""rushed"" to our table).  The Salmon was served luke warm... yuck.  Not layered with flavor.  The Quail was served cold... double yuck.  As the most disappointing, the ""seared"" Tuna which was ordered seared with rare on the inside.  It was served Medium to well done.. GROSS.  I expected that a Manager would have come over to our table, apologize for the long waits, the miss in ordering the food, etc.  We decided to not complain or let our server know on the miss on the entrees (cold and over cooked) because it was late, and we didn't want to wait for new dishes at this point.   The most shocking of all, when we got the bill, the waitress did not comp one thing, not a glass of wine or the 20 min late entree.  WHAT a miss.  I almost never leave 15%, but for that alone, it was a 5% reduction in her tip.  If she was a true professional, she would have found her manager, had him come over, apologize for the miss from the kitchen for the entrees taking an hour, the miss in ordering the 5th entree, etc.  I never even saw a manager on the floor.  I would expect that in the first month of being open, a manager should be actively surveying the floor and making sure that the kinks get worked out.  TAVERN on the GREEN, you invested so beautifully in renovations... Why after spending all that money are you not investing in Good help?So I gave this 2 stars because the beauty almost makes up for part of the night.  My reco: Go check out the renovations and hang in one of the 2 bars they have.  Grab a pre-dinner cocktail and then go to Jean George.. or anywhere else.  This place is not for NYers... this will be ok for tourists.",6,0,0,Dana P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,14,0

4.0,5/30/2014,"Review Shortcut:Go to Tavern on the Green, go during the week (Monday through Thursday) & stay in the center room where life resides there (the other rooms are dark & soulless) or the patio. You will be enchanted. From reading some of these other reviews, they have seemingly cleaned up their act. The entire staff is a dream & I was more than impressed.Full Experience:In celebrating a birthday, I asked my best friend to select from two established, prominent restaurants for a dinner & I threw in The Tavern, since it had been recently remodeled. He and his husband picked Tavern since he had never been & he was intrigued. I had not been since since before the remodel, in December of 2006 & had mad a mental note never to return. A couple of weeks before the dinner I happened in the park & went it in for a peak. It was a Sunday afternoon & the place was bustling with tourists. The decor was certainly an improvement from the chaos it was before, but somehow still lacked a soul. I could see that designer was trying to create a link between the New York of today & the past of the structure's rich history. That somehow was not working. The colors schemes were in some areas pedestrian and altogether banal in others .The overall atmosphere was frenetic with patrons spilling out into major traffic patterns. I was immediately concerned that we had the wrong suggestion.This was in sharp contrast to scene I descended upon last night. I arrived to find my guests already enjoying drinks at the bar. Our chic & lovely hostess, Sandra, showed us to a table in a darker, more somber area of the restaurant, near the very back end. I asked if she could seat us at a table under the glass atrium like structure in the center of the premises. She came back within a minute & said that she could. The mood was immediately changed. The location of the table was flawless, we were able to take in both the views of the well lit room (transformed in the night hours) & the handsome brick sheepfold structure outside. The patio was beautifully lit with unusual string lights & although it was too cold to serve out there, it was lovely to look at. The restaurant has no sommelier so the bar manager took time to elaborately describe a chardonnay from California that was superb. He was delightfully animated in a way that kept you asking for more. The Tavern salad was excellent, as was the quail that I had. The bar manager surprised us with a round of champagne with his compliments, to toast our dear friend. It too was fabulous. We ordered a berry cake for each couple with a candle for my feted guest & loved it. I was so happy we ended up keeping the reservation & that my best friend was so pleased. I highly recommend Tavern on the Green, go during the week & stay in the center room where life resides there. You will be enchanted as we were.

1.0,5/28/2014,"Why do they want to be  headed back to their old designation of tourist trap?This is the first time I have been inspired to write a review about anything on the internet.   Tavern on the Green, post renovation, has some real issues.  As a New Yorker, I don't think of going there but a friend had read a NY times article and wanted to go.  So four of us had an 8pm reservation, which I made a week ago.   Their reservation system emailed me twice to confirm.Upon arrival,  we were told it would be ten to fifteen minutes, then another ten to fifteen minutes, then at 8:30pm another ten to fifteen.  This third time I tried to explain you can't actually ask people to wait 45 minutes in NY when they have a reservation and expect people to come back so I asked if they had a private room I could rent, or some other space.  The answer was no, and the cast at reception seemed in rotation.  We were seated at ten to nine.  If my guests had been any one else less tolerant, this would have been a real problem.     They need to understand that if you keep people waiting you buy them a drink or two, serve canapes, do what's necessary to apologize by action.   We actually suggested this and they did not know how to respond.Then we were met by a waiter who seemed to be  in audition for part in a 1920's movie where he was playing saloon bartender.  He seemed to belch out the menu descriptions.  It was so terrible as it was in your face and odd.   It was difficult to hear anything that was said in the environment of hard surfaces and noise, so in some respect that was actually helpful.Most of the reviews here, say the food is not so good.  Actually, I thought it was ok but really they need to straighten out their logistics, and for goodness sake do something when they have errors like this.  We were certainly not the only ones who had the same issue tonight.",1,0,0,Darren M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0

The hostesses are welcoming and efficient, and all of the serving personnel was great - fast, friendly and knowledgeable.  Also, the new environment is great. It's been beautifully redone and both inside and outside dining spaces are comfortable and charmingly pretty.  The lounge looked really great, and I might eat there next time.As for the food:  it's ok.  A couple of dishes were very good, others were completely bland.  The farro pasta, for example, had no flavor whatsoever (none of the ingredients have much flavor of their own, and there was no seasoning) and was even dull in presentation, as was much of the food, based on what I could see around me. I realize that it's  a big restaurant and they have to deal with the tastes of visitors from everywhere, but they definitely have to ramp up the flavor and appearance of the food, particularly for the price.The dessert we had was excellent, though, so don't skip dessert.

This is completely unacceptable.

3.0,5/18/2014,"It's a nice, classy, bougie brunch place located in Central Park. I came here for their very first brunch and while it wasn't terrible, it wasn't the best either. Understandably, it's their first brunch service and the restaurant recently reopened but their front of house service was kind of lost. It took the hostess 10 minutes to seat my party and food runners kept bringing out dishes that we didn't order. Also, when they reset the table for our entrees, they put our silverware right in front of us in the middle which I found really odd. The staff is friendly and I was happy with our server but it didn't reflect well how their operation wasn't very smooth.As for the food, I wouldn't recommend Tavern on the Green solely based on the food. They have a $65 prefixe brunch menu that looks much tastier than their a la carte options. I got the smoked salmon app which was your basic smoked salmon, rye roast, goat cream cheese so I liked it. The entrees were most disappointing... the poached eggs were overcooked and not lusciously runny. The chorizo that came with with the poached eggs were overly spiced so the whole dish was completely unbalanced. And finally, the desserts were good but it was obvious the kitchen pre-plates them as the cherry jam sauce that came with the cheesecake had hardened on the plate. The restaurant is beautiful and I really enjoyed the setting. The restaurant has a nice outdoor seating area with some table umbrellas for shade or an elegant indoor room for those to prefer sitting inside.

3.0,5/17/2014,"So... Tavern on the Green just reopened, and to be very honest, it has great potential, but it's still getting itself together.  First off, the service isn't efficient.  The hostess stand had a ridiculously long line because there wasn't enough coordination and planning between people.  It took 5-10 minutes to serve each patron at the stand, so let's imagine that there are about 6 or 7 parties with a reservation at 11:45, the wait is a little annoying.  Wait times between courses were also uncomfortable long, but the staff is very friendly.I came this morning, and today is the first day brunch was being served.  The food itself warrants about 4 stars, but there was some inconsistencies that brought my rating down.  I got the prix fixe: mushroom soup, poached eggs and grits, and cheesecake.  The Mushroom soup was beautifully presented and had a single, crouton that was probably the best crouton I've ever fathomed to have in my life.  Seriously it was ridiculously amazing.  I looked down later and I realized I had already devoured it in its entirety, however I don't remember such occurrence.  My second course was much less impressive.  The grits came out smelling heavenly.  However, the grits themselves were weirdly congealed and extremely bland.  The chorizo and tomato sauce were extremely spicy and flavorful though.  I wish that flavor had carried through the grits as well.  The poached eggs were extremely overdone, with zero runniness, which made me very disappointed.  As for my dessert, I love cheesecake, and this cheesecake was bomb, but I could tell that it had been sitting around for a while since the syrup used to decorate the plate had already dried up.  The venue is gorgeous, and it was such a beautiful day.  The food and service could be better, it just needs a little fixer upper.  In a couple weeks time I'm sure it'll be pretty fantastic.",3,1,0,Mary P.,"Manhattan, NY",149,38,0

3.0,5/15/2014,"I would love to give it more than 3 stars, but say ""yay, I´m a fan"" yet - although I would love to be.I visit the park at least twice a day with my dog, sometimes more often and have been waiting for the day TOTG reopens for years - I had never been to the old one.So, although my expectations were high, I knew that a new restaurant always faces challenges and patrons should not expect everything to be perfect (yet).The space is gorgeous, especially the bar area is very nice, the open kitchen is huge and the two dining rooms are very different from one another, one (with the open kitchen) features lots of white and is very airy, the other one (which we sat in) is much more subtle - both are very classy.the table we were assigned was quite small for a party of 5 (originally we booked for 6, I have no idea how they´d fit 6 people there) and of course (it´s NY after all) right next to the other tables and the waiters´ passage.our waiter was very friendly and came back with our order of cocktails quickly - their cocktail list isn´t huge but all drinks were good - most names after NY´s boroughs. Interestingly, they have beer on draft, in bottles and cans. The wines are sorted by their bodies - however, I found it a bit strange to find New Zealand Sauvignon blancs in the ""light body"" section. Drink prices are fine.Most of us ordered the ""Wood Roasted Japanese Eggplant, Pomegranate and Torn Fresh Herbs, Sheep's Milk Yogurt  15.00$"" as a starter- I imagined it to look similar to the ""Plenty"" cookbook cover but it was nothing to write home about, just ok, but not for 15$. Plus, the pomegranate seeds were missing completely. When we asked our waiter, he came back after a couple of minutes and said that they are out of season and that the dish should be taken off the menu (well, then at least mention that there are no pomegranate seeds). It´s not called a small plate without a reason.the mains, or large plates as they call them, are, on the other hand, really large. The two vegetarians among us ordered the ""Baked Farro Pasta with Braised Shiitakes, Heirloom Beans, Blistered Sweet Peppers and Fresh Ricotta  24.00$"", which basically was a big pasta stew. The pasta was too mushy, probably the dish contained too much liquid before it was baked to begin with, which naturally was absorbed by the pasta. I hate to say that this was one of my least favorite pasta dishes in a long time.The burger apparently came out ok, but wasn´t anything special according to my friend. The best entree on our table was probably the lamb although I can´t comment on its taste but trust my friend (Braised Lamb Shank with Creamed Chards, Pickled Golden Raisins, Roasted Cauliflower and a Fresh Mint Gremolata  32.00).one of us chose to have the scallops (Local Sea Scallops with Citrus Butter, Fried Shallots and Capers  16.00) as her entree course. Although the waiter mentioned that it would be small, we didn´t expect tiny. I think it was one scallop which was halved and placed on a crostino.The best part of the mean was definitely dessert, however, we only shared two: the ricotta cheesecake and the spring pavlova.Overall, I am sure there is room for improvement! I was hoping for some kind of acknowledgement from the management/kitchen regarding the missing pomegranate seeds (desert on the house or something like that), but nothing happened.I am going to come back for brunch and am looking forward to drinks in the garden once it opens, but for now, I´m afraid it´s best to stick to the drinks.",4,0,1,Amelia E.,"Manhattan, NY",1,42,0

As soon as we entered we knew it was nothing like before. The lady sat us in the noisiest part of the restaurant. Luckily we asked to move places because it was just unbearable, I couldn't hear my parents talking, just listen to other people's conversation. We sat down in the other room which was a lot more quiet. We ordered from the fix menu they had for Mother's Day ($65 per person). I ordered the Tavern Salad and my parents ordered the salmon.... My plate consisted in three lettuces, three thinly sliced asparagus, one caramelized walnut, and two thinly sliced pieces of jam.... that was the saddest plate I have ever seen in my life.... Keep in mind this is part of the $65 menu... My parents plate was just as sad.... I was still hoping the the main course would be better... Boy was I wrong! It wasn't as sad as the appetizer, the plate was a little bigger and my steak was sliced a little larger.... Honestly Tavern On the Green is an expensive Coffee Shop...

When we were ordering she asked us to repeat our order to her once or twice, and she was leaning so far over us i thought she was joining us for dinner.

I got the duck egg crostada, which was so rich and good, but again, had no balance - everything was salt salt salt and savory. It needed a punch of acid or citrus (i stole a grape from my friend who ordered the quail which helped). the mushrooms with blue cheese were cut too thick and felt tough.Desserts were the most disappointing.

4.0,4/30/2014,"I don't usually review after the first visit, but I plan on going back based on the initial visit. But some things need to be cleared up based on some of these early reviews. If you are unaware that the restaurant went out of business years ago, all the tchotchkes are gone and they are under new ownership, you live under a rock. The new owners have done an admirable job of making the space very warm and inviting, as well as kinda fancy pants all at the same time. If you live in the area, you know that the community board was really committed to making the place casual and affordable. As they put it, they wanted a place where people that had just gone jogging would feel comfortable. Those people should only feel comfortable at home, in their showers. So obviously, what they've managed to achieve was the result of an uphill battle and they really pulled it off.  If you are in the industry, you will really appreciate the attention to detail. And yes, there is still construction outside. They wanted/needed to open as much as soon as possible. Do you have any idea how much it costs to have a restaurant in NYC? So you have to look at some equipment. You'll live. It'll get better. And if you went the first nights and were disappointed in the service, you need to go wait a table or two. You can tell that the patrons are super local right now. We all want to ""check it out"" and most likely bash it as a tourist trap. Well, it will be. But if you go right now - construction site and all - you will see actual New Yorkers in their natural habitat. A restaurant, dressed up, eating some pretty darn good food and drinking awesome cocktails.

2.0,4/29/2014,"--Big thumbs down on service (sorry, the amateur overly friendly staff were over their heads and they confused Tavern on the Green for a ride at Disney).    --Thumbs up on creative bar menu (the boroughs are well represented in drink and are surprisingly refreshing and clean in flavor despite their complexity).--Small negative, the menu was over explained and not cohesive though (the food is good, it is a hard menu to love).--Kudos on great small plates. Great flavor combinations.--Ooops, they failed on service, 45 minutes between courses and cold entrees (and the waiter and staff didn't seem to notice the long pause between courses). Congrats on trying hard and being customer oriented, but the lack of experience and understanding of how to service in this environment is the biggest hurdle the restaurant faces. Hands down a deal killer.--Neutral score on entrees, creative combinations, good flavor but again, all cold and none of the ingredients (back to NOT SIMPLE) stood on their own, the supporting flavors overpowered the star ingredient. There is potential there!--HUGE THUMBS DOWN on desserts. Again the staff oversold the dessert menu, ""they're awesome-that one is great"" ""the Portland area pastry chef brings simple clean flavors"" Okay, all lies. They weren't awesome or great, they were not good. There was nothing simple about them. We tried most the desserts, the mousse was the only one not fit for the trash can. I am a self proclaimed foodie with a broad spectrum of tastes...no one should eat that red velvet cake (flash it is not a cake, it is beet puree on chocolate, inedible wafer).  The dessert chef may not be from ny but do Portlanders not like good desserts? The fusion concept of reconstructing classics and presenting in a new fashion is out-of-fashion - it doesn't work in concept and it doesn't work here and again, don't sell it as ""simple, clean flavors"".-- Thumbs up on the bar and back dining room, thumbs down on the loud, far-from-enchanting chandelier room with the 1990s open kitchen (circa Macaroni Grill).-- So first impression a doorman that thinks he is a bouncer at a Bleecker St bar and last impression inedible desserts.

3.0,4/27/2014,"No longer a fine dining, white tablecloth tourist trap of a restaurant, Tavern on the Green has just reopened as a hipper, more casual tourist trap of a restaurant.The old fancy stuff has been replaced in the bustling, very loud new dining room (currently overlooking construction in the park outside), which has an open kitchen running along one side of it.The menu is pretty silly, divided up into sections based on how the food is cooked, so there are small plates and large plates sections listed repeatedly all over the place. I didn't have extremely high hopes for the food, so given the high price tags on all the items, I didn't go crazy ordering too much:- BreadsticksThey start you off with a couple of cheesy breadsticks and a piece of cold, hard bread. I would skip the bread, but the crunchy breadsticks were actually pretty tasty.- The Tavern Salad ($18)This is not so much a salad as it is a few greens scattered on a plate with a wedge of cheese and 3 nuts next to them. This was ok, but not a particularly great choice as a starter, as there are probably other items that would be more satisfying.- Lobel's Prime Beef Burger ($18 + $2 for cheese + $2 for bacon = $22)This was not a particularly good burger. It was a bit dry and pretty lacking in any seasoning, and I did something I never do, which was reach for some of the ketchup to eat it with. The bun was a bit strange, and it was pretty small to justify the $22 price tag. Also, instead of coming with fries like it should have, it was served with Patatas Bravas topped with aioli, which were not great. They were a bit mushy, with no crispiness, and were lukewarm.- Baked Farro Pasta ($24)This dish was surprisingly quite large, and was pretty tasty. Served in one of those cast-iron pans, it was the one food item we got that was adequately hot. The pasta was ok, but after mixing and sitting for awhile, the whole plate became a bit of a gloopy mess. The cheese and the mushrooms and the sauce all mixed together to form a gummy mass. It at least had some good flavors though.- Broccoli Rabe ($12)At $12 for a side, we just wanted to get one. I'm glad we got the Patatas Bravas along with the burger and didn't have to spend $12 on them. As for this vegetable side, it was pretty good, but would have been better if it were hot.- Red Velvet Cake ($12)I'm all for inventiveness and making changes to classic dishes, but this was a strange take on red velvet cake that didn't quite work for me. One of the ingredients is listed as ""roasted red beets"", which is probably what contributed to the overall lack of flavor in the small slice of cake. The very thin chocolate layer on the bottom had some good flavor, but was overwhelmed by the much thicker, less flavorful red layer on top.- Ricotta Cheesecake ($11)I would pass on the red velvet cake for this much better dessert. It tastes similar to a pretty standard, dense cheesecake, and is great aside from the unfitting fennel-orange salad on top.Service was friendly, but pretty lacking, especially as the night wore on and the place got busy. Once the construction is done in the garden area, I'm sure this place will pack in the tourists and the Upper West/East Side types that can't eat much and don't mind spending $20 on a salad. The meal was enjoyable, and the food wasn't bad, but I would say it's not quite worth it.",26,11,11,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834
