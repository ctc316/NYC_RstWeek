5.0,5/1/2019,"I am still sitting at the bar, licking my fingers from the adult grilled cheese and creamy tomato soup...I decided to take myself out to lunch and not just spend money on five guys or a salad. No, I wanted something a little more upscale and different.  I have been wanting to try Sarabeth's for some time but haven't had the opportunity to do so, but today was a different story.I had a little time to kill before meeting a friend uptown so I waltzed over to the Park Avenue S location, grabbed a seat at the bar, and ordered.I knew I wanted to get their adult grilled cheese bc it looked so delicious, so I ordered that, and an order of calamari.The calamari was perfectly tender, crisp, and came with aioli. YUM! The grilled cheese was all I dreamt of. And it's on a pretzel bun. Double yes!I can honestly say I'll be back, solo, and order the grilled cheese and so many more things. Plus, there's a five dollar bites menu!  Come stop by and enjoy a great meal!!",0,0,0,Morgan R.,"Brooklyn, NY",187,46,72
4.0,4/24/2019,"I came here by myself for breakfast on a weekday morning to treat myself while my partner was running errands. I lived in NYC for several years but never tried Sarabeth's. It did not disappoint!I sat at the bar and the bartender was very nice. I got avocado toast that came with burrata and an egg. The presentation wasn't what I expected - one piece of toast had egg and the other had cheese, but I shouldn't complain, I like playing with my food. It was yummy!And it was light enough that I could order dessert - what I've heard to be the real reason to come to Sarabeth's. I got the raspberry bread pudding, because raspberries are my favorite food. There was a raspberry coulis, but it was topped with fresh blackberries, not raspberries. This makes sense seasonally, and was tasty anyway.If you're in NYC and you're looking to splurge on a decadent, sweet breakfast, this is the place to go.",0,0,0,Elizabeth B.,"Washington, DC",143,264,11

2.0,4/18/2019,"This was a huge disappointment. I went to Sarabeth's Central Park for the first time back in 2015. The smoked salmon egg Benedict was perfect, and this is the dish she's famous for. It was so good, that I used it as a standard for egg benedict for years. I was finally visiting NYC again after all these years. We made a reservation for sunday brunch at this location, because it was the only Sarabeth's location taking reservations for that day. We arrived on time, and there was a good crowd waiting for tables. I ordered the smoked salmon egg benedict, and the poached eggs were oddly overcooked. You can tell they were sitting under food warmer for too long, both half of the yolks were solid, and the other half yolks were still running. Hollandaise sauce had a weird consistency, at least not the way I remembered.Probably won't be going back. Need to find a new egg benedict place now.",0,0,0,Meg Y.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",2,8,15
5.0,4/12/2019,"Very happy with this brunch spot! Would love to return for $1 oyster happy hour. I had the vegetable omelette and asked them to make it without cheese, as I cannot eat cheese. I had one of their house made English muffins, topped with fresh strawberry jam. Everything is made fresh here, you can taste it in every bite. My omelette contained fresh spring peas, and lovely greens. My daughter had crab spaghetti on the lunch special menu. OMG - sooo crazy good. I ate a good portion of her fresh hand made pasta full of chunks of crab. Try the mixed juice, amazing! And don't skip the mimosa. Service was attentive and friendly.

4.0,3/29/2019,"I usually come here for brunch alone when I want to treat myself, or just have a day to myself. I like coming here on weekday mornings/early afternoons because it's slow and quiet, and I like the ambience. I've gotten the pancakes a few times and they are always really good. The coffee is meh; it's typical diner coffee which is a tad disappointing considering this place is supposed to be fancier. Service is great though. My water and coffee are always refilled consistently throughout my meal and I have been asked a few times about whether I am enjoying everything, by both managers and wait staff. I haven't ordered much of anything else on the menu so can't speak to that but I will be back the next time I feel like splurging a bit.",2,1,2,Ada C.,"New York, NY",185,139,4

(I haven't been to the others). It boasts the same menu as the others but the gem here is the craft cocktail bar program. The bartender, Palo, is the best I've ever had and it is apparent they care about their craft --- makes for a fabulous brunch, lunch, happy hour, or dinner! Creative and wonderful!

1.0,3/24/2019,Worst Sarabeth's service ever! Bad hospitality starting from the welcome hostess to the manager. The waiters dont listen therefore they dont bring the right orders.

Food was amazing!  Great choices available for all diners. We had the spinach and goat cheese omelette and the French toast. Both were amazing. We also had the mimosa and a honey and bourbon cocktail, both of which were great.  We were seated on a bank with several other two-tops which were pretty close together. That made it a little bit too close for comfort at times due to some loud neighboring tables within a foot of our table.

2.0,1/28/2019,"Go elsewhere for brunch, do not go to this location of Sarabeth's. The food is very ok (I can get a better meal at a diner for half the price). The worse part was the service. The waiter was slow (not a problem), but they didnt tell us when they ran out of croissants and brought toast instead, without asking our preference. The muffin basket was terrible, stale and dry and had no flavor. When the manager asked how everything was, we told her the muffins were terrible. She removed them, said we would take care of it and asked if she could get us anything, so we ordered 2 cocktails. At any other restaurant, the drinks would be on the house and the muffins comped. They made sure to charge us for the drinks, and then the bill was wrong for the comped muffins and had to be adjusted.

3.0,1/8/2019,"Last Saturday, a group of 6 of us went to brunch at Sarabeth's on Park Avenue.   We chose Sarabeth's since the one couple has a newborn baby (12 weeks) and Sarabeth's is very spacious and kid/stroller friendly, and they also take reservations via Open Table.  We had a reservation for 2 pm and when we arrived we were able to be seated right away.  The booth they wanted to seat us as was going to be too small for 6 adults and a stroller, so they were able to accommodate us at a different, bigger table which was much more comfortable for all of us.   It was pretty crowded at 2 pm and there were several infants and young children there.    The service at Sarabeth's was a little slow - after our waiter took our drink and food orders, he practically disappeared and didn't really check in on us.  We had to ask another waitress for the check.  By the time we left, it had totally cleared out.   As far as the food, I ordered the chicken sausage & kale frittata with a berry-corn muffin and I enjoyed my meal.   The others at the table had the following:  Avocado & Burrata Toast -  was a small portion, very little avocado, overpriced for what you gotClassic Eggs Benedict - just OK; the English muffin was strange looking; again overpricedChicken Salad -  unmemorable mealThe burger -  the burger came with the most delicious french fries; I swear it tasted like the fries were brought over from the McDonald's down the street - they were that good.Overall, the brunch was enjoyable just because of the company I was with.

We were seated after a 5 min wait or so as I've made a reservation beforehand.Food wise, we ordered the following: Goldie Lox, Eggs Benedict, and Chicken Sausage & Kale Frittata with Avocado. I didn't get to try the Eggs Benedict as my cousin ordered it but she really liked it and gave it a 5/5 rating. I got the Chicken Sausage & Kale Frittata with Avocado, and despite me not being an avocado fan, I really liked the dish! The seasonings were pretty balanced, egg was cooked properly, and overall, the ingredients together made it a well balanced dish in terms of food groups. Was also a big fan of their banana muffin as it was quite soft and delicious. Would highly recommend getting this dish!In terms of the Goldie Lox, I wasn't too big of a fan this time because it seemed to be saltier than the last time I tried it? My mom got this and she couldn't finish it as it was definitely too salty. Also the raisin scone she ordered as a side was quite dry and thus, not too appealing. Those  were the only reasons why I give Sarabeth's a 4 star review.For dessert, we got their Lemon Ricotta Pancakes, which I absolutely loved! The pancakes themselves were so so fluffy and the lemon flavor really came through (though I must admit I was missing some of the ricotta). Otherwise, the pancakes with the syrup and butter was a bomb combination and I would definitely order this again!Otherwise, the food here is still pretty solid and I would come back again if I'm craving for some good American brunch!",1,0,0,Tiffanii C.,"New York, NY",621,73,228

I sat with an empty water glass for way too long and it took quite a while once we were done with our meal for the waiter to clear our plates and bring us the check. It wasn't particularly busy, either. The second reason is the bathrooms. Given the beauty and cleanliness of the dining area, I expected the same for the restrooms.

I understand that there are other costs associated but for the price I paid I was shocked that I got toast with a smear of avocado, and a few pieces of arugula.

There's something to be said for a reputable regional chain that imposes clear standards on all the individual stores and thus allows the brand itself to stand in as a seal of quality for the consumer. It's why you often hear me questioning the romanticization of one-off mom-and-pop stores and praise the centralization of Starbucks, CVS (until recently), and of course, the gawd Jeff Bezos's Amazon.com.Obviously, this doesn't mean that I prefer chain restaurants over superb independent restaurants.

I finally did Thursday and it was a great experience overall. Our waiter was kind, attentive, and very knowledgeable about the menu. You can get actual half bottles of wine here, and the Pinot noir is delicious. Both me and my friend went for the prix fixe menu which is $40 a person. Most entree options are about $30 so this definitely was the most bang for your buck. Although the waiter said the baby kale salad is good, he highly recommended the tomato soup and that is 100% the move. It was incredibly creamy, and they gave you a pretty big portion considering it was part of a discount. For the entree I got the steak frites with truffle fries. The steak was perfectly medium, and the bearnaise sauce was also very good. The truffle fries complimented the steak very well, and they came out hot and fresh.For dessert I went for the caramelized banana split sundae.

The salmon scramble was good and a decent portion and also came with 2 slices of toast and orange marmalade and butter- super good, finished it all.

I have to say, everything came beautifully packaged - presentation was great. The avocado toast was really good, burrata was INCREDIBLE, the buttermilk pancakes were satisfying (although I think I've had better pancakes elsewhere).

Perfect spot.  Clean, simple, modern and elegant decor.  Service was impeccable.  Constant refills of coffee and water.  The server was patient, b/c it took us some time to order.  I ordered the kale and eggs which the waiter explained was a kale salad with eggs on top.  I was very pleased he told me what to expect because there was no description on the menu. I was picturing scrambled eggs with kale mixed in.  So, I ordered it anyway because I love salads.  It came with smoked marcona almonds and roasted brussel sprouts..  It was unbelievable.  I got the dressing on the side. I didn't even need to use it because the salad was alive with flavor.  I did taste it though and it was tangy and sweet, very nicely balanced.  My companion got an omelette and a toasted muffin which looked homemade. I didn't know, but he told me Sarabeths is know for it's muffins and bread... Learn something new everyday.Based on what I've heard over the years, my impression was that Sarabeths was a pretentious, haughty restaurant.

3.0,1/15/2018,"With sixteen restaurants that span the globe, from Tokyo to Dubai to the greater NYC area, Sarabeth's is a success story that has brand recognition and cachet. You'll even find their preserves in Stop and Shop supermarkets in Long Island.With a burgeoning global empire, how does this particular outpost of Sarabeth's rank? What first strikes the visitor is the space and sheer amount of it. A walk to the bathroom and back felt like a journey, as if I'd return twenty years older to a world I wouldn't recognize. Tables, booths, banquettes, just about every possible seating arrangement can be found here. I'm unsure of the exact seating capacity but it feels like a Guinness book of world records contender for NYC Flatiron restaurants. I was reminded of certain mega-sized chain restaurants in the suburbs for point of comparison.But it's a beautiful, open space that immediately puts the diner at ease. I was especially pleased with the view from my table out onto 27th street, people watching central. (Or people looking into the restaurant as they go about their busy lives, such is the possibility with such large windows)The menu offered to me was a late lunch one, which spans the time from 3:30-5pm on weekdays. I started with an order of burrata toast before moving on to a pizza margherita.So there's a reason why most of my review has been about the interior of the restaurant and decor. My edibles were certainly pleasant and good enough. There's certainly better pizza options out there and I was being especially bold by not ordering Sarabeth's signature brunch type plates such as pancakes or an omelette. Far better than the pizza was a dessert trio of ice cream sandwiches, where each layer of ice cream was guarded by two different cookies. Decadent and delicious, offering up a welcome dose of that Sarabeth's magic. My cocktail was also spot on, a concoction of vodka and berries that had the color of Ocean Spray but the punch of a tsunami. Well done!So it's only fair to offer up based on items ordered a cautious three star review. There's potential for an update once, and if, I venture to try some Sarabeth's signature dishes. Based on this first experiment, I do think it's worth a visit.",4,4,4,Tom K.,"Forest Hills, NY",337,820,47

2.0,1/14/2018,"Basic brunch spot. There's a beautiful open feel to this restaurant but the food and service was just underwhelming. I ordered the Crab Cake Eggs Benedict special, which came with a small and simple salad on the side. The crab cakes themselves could have used more seasoning and there was barely any hollandaise sauce on the dish, making the dish rather dry to eat (especially with the dry textures of the fried crab cake and English muffin).Service was friendly but not attentive. It was hard to flag down our waiter so we ended up having to hold our hand out and waving around a few times to get any waiters' attention. Lastly, the meal overall was pretty expensive for what it was - it was close to $30 per person for a mediocre entree & plain coffee.

This time, it was snowing, so we went from my boyfriend's apartment to the one on the Lower East- not as chic as the Upper East one, but does the trick. We sat down and it took about 20 minutes for us to decide- everything looked so great, as always! I'm a yoga sculpt instructor, so I'm trying to go light on carbs. My boyfriend got the fat & fluffy French toast with berries, which is always TO DIE FOR so good- perfectly sweet and crunchy, and I got the scrambled egg popover with chives and cream cheese. The eggs were fluffy and delicious, not too overcooked but not too moist. I don't really know why but it came with a side salad- not dressed but decent. The popover was divine. Excellent cream cheese-egg ratio. I stole some bites of his toast! He also got home fries. The service is pretty good, and there were cute hand-written specials on a board and jazz in the background- we had our brunch around 1 pm and it was not too busy.

A friend and I grabbed lunch here on a Wednesday and though it seemed like a random day and time, the place was still packed. We made a reservation beforehand so we didn't have to wait to be seated. For lunch, we ordered their flat iron steak that came with an amazing tomato soup and truffle fries, lemon zested tuna salad, as well as an order of their lemon and ricotta pancakes. Their steak was well seasoned and cooked to perfection (medium rare) and paired well with the béarnaise sauce. The salad came with large chunks of tuna and their greens were crisp and sweet. The dressing added an extra kick to the salad and made it more flavorful yet refreshing.Was it a lot of food for two people? Definitely.

I wanted to swap out the ricotta pancakes instead of the small green salad served with my dish but my waiter told me no. It was delicious. Eggs were poached perfectly. The only thing is that the muffin that it came on was too thick. Oh well guess I'll have to go back for the pancakes for sure. He had the jalapeño omelet which was just as good as my dish. We also had a side order of sausage with apricots. Phenomenal!!Another small thing is that the waiter never came back to ask us how was our brunch.

At Central Park my friend had had one bite of her burger before it was swiped away, we didn't notice until it was too late. The manager offered a $10 refund, which I said was frankly not enough.

But, being the good sister I am, I dragged myself out of the apt & was eventually greeted by a spacious, classy venue. We were a party of 3 & had comfortable booth seating. The noise level was relatively tranquil, & we conversed without straining our vocal cords (which I always appreciate in Manhattan eateries). The waiters were pleasant, checking up to ensure we were enjoying our meal a few times throughout. We ordered the Salmon Eggs Benedict, Crab Cake Eggs Benedict (special), the kale & eggs, and a fruit bowl. The food (I was feeling well enough at this point to eat--thanks for your concern) was good & well-prepared, although I wouldn't say it's the best brunch I've ever had. The eggs for the Benedicts were presented a little bit more uniquely, in a circular mold, that corresponded with the more upscale ambiance of the restaurant, although it did affect their runniness. The ""muffin"" was more of a corn cake that was grainy-in-the-good-way & well-toasted. The hollandaise was kind of lumpy, but the beautiful presentation of freshness of the fruit bowl made up for it. Would I be determined to come here again? Maybe if my parents were in town for the ambiance, but I've had more enjoyable brunch.

3.0,8/9/2017,"4 stars for bar area and 2 stars for table service.Recently came here twice - both times Monday evenings.  First time, sat at the bar and service was fine - my companion order a drink and I order some tea (needed a break from alcohol after the weekend).  Bartender was attentive, atmosphere was nice, was able to find two seats easily.Came here again this past Monday and my companion decided to get a table - we were seated in the back near the window.  There were only two other tables with people in our section - one with six people and one booth in the center with two.  Now I am always sympathetic to wait staff - maybe they are having a bad day, or something else is going on in their lives, but when we are only one of three tables being served, I expect a bit more attention than what we received.  Also I didn't appreciate this waiter's attitude - as if we were a burden on him.  Maybe it was because we didn't order much, or maybe it was the color of our skin (and I am very hesitant to ever suggest that, but who knows these days) but I did not appreciate the service we received from this particular man.To recap my experience, I arrived and my companion was already seated with the menus.  The waiter came promptly and I ordered a tea - immediately I could tell he was disappointed and clarified - a tea? - as if he's never heard of it.  So I said yes, do you have tea or coffee here?  And he said yes we have coffee, cappuccino, latte. So I asked for plain black tea, please.  Thankfully he figured it out what that meant and I received it promptly - though it was lukewarm at best.  At this point my companion has decided on a drink and we've decided what to eat (the margarita pizza) and are waiting for the waiter to return to take our order...must've been at least 10-15 minutes until he returned. At that point I ask for skim milk for my tea (though so much time has passed, I'm basically done with it) and again he gives me this confused look, like I'm speaking another language.  We receive everything promptly after that and that is when we never see our waiter again.  I am pretty sure at least 45 minutes have passed since we are both done with our food and drinks, during which time I see our waiter attending to the other two tables offering them the dessert menu, filling their waters, etc.  He literally does not even walk near us.  Finally, I flag down a bus boy and ask if the waiter can bring our check and he comes within a couple of minutes.  At this point, my mood has soured, we've been sitting at this table for an hour and a half at this point and have been ready to leave for at least 30 minutes.  Maybe he forgot about us, maybe he just didn't care, but I'll definitely think twice before coming to this particular Sarabeth's and when I do, I'll plan to sit by the bar.",1,0,0,Reshma B.,"New York, NY",122,312,6
4.0,8/8/2017,"What a great spot for brunch. Came here with some friends who dine here regularly and it was a great choice. Stopped in on a Saturday around 1 pm and we were able to be seated after a 10 minute wait or so. I was a little confused why we had to wait at all because there were many open tables once we were escorted into the dining room. There was big bar, not busy either. The places was very open and inviting, felt slightly upscale for brunch, which I liked. The menu looked fantastic, lots of delicious sounding options. Their four flower mimosa was very different, had some secret ingredients in it, very unique, very delicious. A few of us got that and others had a Bloody Mary. The Bloody Mary was not spicy at all, but it was flavorful, again, different. It took a very long time for our server to return with our drinks and an even longer time for us to place our food order. We weren't in a rush necessarily, but we found ourselves looking around wondering if our server was ever going to return. Anyways, their menu had lots of omelette concoctions, a few appetizers consisting of burrata, salads, soup and shrimp cocktail. They had breakfast pizzas, steel cut granola, sweeter breakfast options like your loaded pancakes, waffles and french toast and then various entrees. I decided to go with their quinoa crusted ahi tuna and it is hands down the reason for such a great review, it was amazing. The tuna itself was seared to perfection and the quinoa crust added a great crunch, I never need sesame crust again. It was served over a huge bed of kale, lightly dressed with some citrus, healthy, filling and fresh, all I could have asked for that morning. The portion was bigger than I expected, it was excellent. My friends enjoyed their breakfast pizzas and tuna salad as well. Overall it was a great experience and I would definitely come back.

Service was confusingly and sort of laughably bad. We must have had 4 or 5 different servers, all of whom thought our table was theirs. Two different servers at two different times tried to serve us coffee only to realize their coffee pot was empty. One didn't know what a latte was. Lots of clumsy reaching over and almost knocking over glasses. It was strange. It was almost as if they were filming a reality TV show where either celebrities or sophomores in high school are undercover as servers while some wacky hosts laughs at how they mess up from backstage. This restaurant just goes to show that if paparazzi get pictures of Taylor Swift leaving your restaurant once you don't really have to do much from there.",0,1,0,Sam R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,5,0
4.0,7/8/2017,"Came here for a late brunch with family on a lovely Sunday summer afternoon. I had heard a lot about Sarabeth's and had seen locations - as far as Osaka. The beginnings were largely a negative. The crab meat guacamole & chips was tasteless: all three parts. The crab meat was devoid of any crab flavor, the guacamole was like eating into mushy nothing, and the chips was like ""crunching"" into wobbly flavorless cardboard disks. The dainty muffins and sweet jams were tasty, admittedly, but not something I'd go out-of-my-way for. I went for the short rib hash with poblano peppers. It wasn't any mind-blowing but a bit of a deviation from the conventional. The peppers provided a bit of a different flavor to a regular hash. The short rib itself was decent, as it was fairly tender and flavorful. The over-medium eggs on top were perfectly cooked and that I can appreciate. Service was very polite and thoughtful. The only blemish was that I did not get my berry-corn muffin until I brought it up to a server. Otherwise, I appreciated the good service. On a side note, unless you decide to try the handicapped restrooms, the regular restrooms are a bit of a hike (going flights of stairs) from the dining area. The more premium price is for the atmosphere and name; not necessarily the food. 3.5 stars, but I'll raise it a tad because the wait staff.",25,13,22,Phil C.,"Boston, MA",818,816,3419
4.0,7/6/2017,"Sarabeth's is great! I've gone to the location in Central Park (extremely long wait) & this one for the 4th of July. My mom was born on 4th of July, so it was her birthday. We celebrated it with a party of 14. They set up tables in the backroom, in a quiet area which I liked a lot. It was more private compared to the front of the house. The server was OKAY, I wasn't too fond of him because he wasn't engaged at all with the guests and I; it seemed as if he was bothered and they also brought out the food to the wrong people 3 times. The food on the other hand, was delicious once again! My whole table ordered almost everything off the brunch menu (which was served on the 4th of July even though it's only served on the weekends.) I ordered the jalapeño, cheese & cilantro omelette with a croissant. It was delicious and flavorful! One thing I absolutely loved which I tried from my family members was the fluffy french toast (it was indeed fluffy!) & the egg & cream cheese popover!! OMG, the popover was so fluffy & delicious, I could not stop picking off of my uncle's plate. It was the most softest egg with the combination of the hard/soft bread.

Greta and her team made our day perfect, and were incredible to work with throughout the entire planning process. I'm sure that Greta was a little skeptical when she first received our ""group brunch inquiry,"" but she is truly a master event planner who has thought of everything... even if Sarabeth's had never hosted a wedding before. The staff executed our ceremony and reception with precision, converting a 60-person ceremony space into a 60-person dining space - while all 60 people were inside of it - in about 20 minutes. It was beyond impressive. We chose to bring in a cake, and somewhere along the way, it got squished (unbeknownst to us). I later found out that the Sarabeth's team frantically went out to get a very elegant replacement cake for us on their own dime, even though they were not responsible. It underscored the level of quality service that they deliver. Our guests raved about the food and drinks at our wedding. I think some of them might have eaten entire platters of the lobster rolls. The bartenders were very accommodating, and thought nothing of several 20-somethings drinking multiple rounds of shots at 2 in the afternoon (um, myself included). Sarabeth's is legendary in New York for a reason. Yes, it is a busy restaurant for brunch, but the food is very consistent and the decor is impressive. I know if you're reading this, you're probably not going to get married there... but nonetheless, go there for a special occasion, with a big group of friends, or just for weekend brunch.

First (or actually, worst) was service. Not sure if the waiter was new, but given the fact that the restaurant was EMPTY, I was amazed how how inattentive he was. Luckily we were with a great group (of 8) or we would have been really upset at the incredibly long waits. Lowlights: 1) he offered bread, and evn after two prompts, only brought it AFTER dinner was served; 2) I had to get up and find him to interupt his conversation with another non-working waiter to ask for dessert menus.Food was medicro at best. While others enjoyed their dishes, my beet salad was pedestrian at best with bizarre goat cheese balls that were tasteless. The octopus was OK, but had many more pickle slides (?!) than octopus. I will say the ice cream sandwich flights were very good. Though even here, the cookies were not great and some of the ice cream seemed to have freezer burn.Overall, I would NOT recommend.

We went light on entrees - I ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup & E. the chicken salad. Both dishes were ""left a lot to be desired."" Someplace between a 2 & 3. The grilled cheese sat in the window too long and the chicken in his salad was so dry as to be nearly inedible. Finally, dessert was good... E enjoyed the truffle chocolate  cake. My raspberry bread pudding was okay. Perhaps it's because I expected a hearty, homey bread pudding and this was not that. This last item is why they received a 2: Walking back to the bathroom via a slight maze of halls and it smelled like urine. What's more, the fabric walls were stained and dirty. Had I gone to the bathroom prior to dinner we would have left. Perhaps someone braver than me would have the courage to share this with a manager in person, but I simply didn't.

The problem was with everything else - so much of a problem that I was inspired to write my first Yelp review!First of all, the food is wildly overpriced. For a burrata appetizer, a skirt steak, a burger, and one beer, the total came out to $90. You can do better at many of the great nearby restaurants. But the real problem was with management's approach to the place. My girlfriend ordered her burger medium, and it came out medium rare. No problem at all, as we assumed it would come back in two minutes a little bit better cooked (my meal had already arrived and we were trying to eat together). We waited a few minutes and didn't receive anything, so we start eating my meal. 10 minutes later, it's a completely new burger, and it's not better cooked, but actually fully rare this time. We explained the issue and asked for them to simply cook it more so that it could be medium. 10 more minutes and a THIRD new burger comes out, this time it's charred on the outside (crispy in fact) but still fully pink on the inside -- once again medium rare. She took a few bites and then left the rest of the burger sitting on the plate.Management came over to apologize but never took the burger off the bill. In fact, they still charged us $1.00 for the cheddar on the burger!Again, the music was great but do yourself a favor and eat at one of the many great places next door.

1.0,1/21/2017,"Went once will never go back.  I went into Sarabeths around noon for brunch today 1-21-2017.  Wait was very short (10 minutes) which was great however they tried to sit us (table for 2) at a long table that sits 6 with 4 strangers that were already occupying the other seats at the table.  When we asked to have our own table for two the put us in the bar area which we were ok with.  However no one came to even get us water or coffee for 17 minutes, even after we kept looking around to flag someone down to help us. When they finally came by the coffee they poured us was cold and they spilled it since they were running around.  I felt like I was in a highway diner. We eventually got our order in.  I ordered eggs Benedict and it was awful, might as well been pre heated.  The eggs and ham were a tiny portion and had no taste to them and the muffin it was on was hard like cardboard.  The table we were at was so small and the plates so big there was no room for our water or coffee mugs.Once biting into the muffin I immediately looked for a waiter. By the time I got someone it was ten minutes so instead of getting a new meal I just got the check.Most overrated over priced place I have ever been.  For two tiny portioned breakfast entrees, one side of potatoes and two decaf coffees it cost my $72.  Don't waste your money here.  Go up to Hendricks on 37 and third.  Eggs Benedict is $12 opposed to $19 and is delicious.Don't waste your time and money for brunch here.",0,0,0,Zachary P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0

When we were ready to leave and asked for the check, that took a good 15 minutes to come. But while we waited for that, and this is the main reason for the terrible review, another waiter dropped a saucer of Ketchup on the floor, which splattered all over my shoes and all over my friend's pants. It destroyed both my white shoes and his light blue pants. The waiter merely picked up the saucer, leaving ketchup all over the floor and walked away without saying one word. He never came back. No one ever said anything to us. They literally had to walk over the Ketchup which means they obviously saw it. We asked for more table clothes to clean ourselves up. No concern. No accountability.

Chips that came with the lobster roll were soggy and not very flavorful- the coleslaw was also average at best.

3.0,6/17/2016,"This place was recommended by our daughter's college roommate as one of the best for brunch in NYC, but frankly, we were less than impressed with it. We arrived on a Sunday at 12:20 for our 12:30 reservation, and did not get seated until almost 1. Sadly, the three of us were then given a four-person table situated right up against a column, so in fact, only three could actually ever sit there. Also, the table was in a strange area, between two separate dining rooms. As for the service, we hardly saw our waiter, and spent much of the time looking around for him in order to get coffee and water refills. My husband ordered the Apple Cinnamon French Toast and my daughter got the Goldilox, while I decided to try the Toasted Coconut Waffle with Pineapple, Mango and Maple Rum Butter. Our entrées were all OK, but nothing that special to justify the prices. We also added a side order of the Smoked Bacon about ten minutes into our meals, but asked to cancel it after 30 minutes because we were basically finished with everything. However, magically, the Bacon suddenly came out, and it was absolutely burnt to a crisp (and generally, I happen to like my bacon well done, though not charred). Anyway,  by this point, we were so disgusted with the whole situation, that we just wanted to Pay the check and leave . Yet, I will never understand  why it took so long to get the bacon,  and more importantly,  why they would serve something  so bad. Personally, I think  our waiter simply forgot to turn in the add-on (at least until we started asking him about it ). Really wish I had spoken up and sent it back, instead of paying the $9 and not eating much of it. With regard to decor, the restaurant is upscale and chic, though it does not feel stuffy. Diners were wearing everything from blue jeans to Business casual, and the noise level was a bit much. The three of us had to talk extremely loud, in order to be heard.

4.0,5/22/2016,"one of my favorite brunch spots in the city, so this review is based only on Sunday brunches. if you plan on going its imperative to get a reservation so you can avoid a super long wait. once your entire party arrives they seat you promptly, rarely do restaurants run so on time with their reservations like they do. firstly the atmosphere is nice, very large space with a good amount of Windows to let in natural light. the service is fast and the wait staff is always very kind and helpful.  in terms of variety in the menu, they have a lot of omelettes and egg based foods (i mean IT IS brunch) but you can also get something like a burger, a salad, or even chicken n waffles. their menu is online for reference (always helpful)I'd reccomend spending a little more and getting bottomless mimosas for $25 (they really add up) if you plan on having a fun brunch. i am not a muffin girl but their muffin and preserves sampler is amazing. I'd say for a new York city brunch this place is priced pretty average but you get high quality service and good food in a nice atmosphere",0,0,0,Hannah A.,"Paramus, NJ",0,38,8
5.0,5/21/2016,Great place to bring family or friends for brunch. Came in on a weekday so it wasn't terribly busy. The service was great and the food was delicious.

2.0,5/3/2016,Not impressed whatsoever with this brunch spot. Overpriced and nothing amazing. I ordered the vegetable omelette and my boyfriend ordered the rib eye. the omelette was just okay and does not measure up to other options for brunch in NYC.

3.0,4/28/2016,"Had Avocado toast on MealPass two days in a row. Sarabeth's is much better than Wayside's. But for some reason my pickup box emanated a very unpleasant smell. When I was on my way back to the office I kept looking around to see who was stinking, but after I sat down at my desk and unwrapped the box I realized it was literally from my food. But it's only a smell, as I couldn't taste it. Overall nice toasts, but I'd much prefer Balthazar multigrain. It's also annoying that they make all the MealPass orders at once, so if you have a late pickup time your food will be cold, and cold sunny side up eggs are no good. The avocado paste combined with water from the burrata also soaked the bread underneath.",1,0,1,Joy Y.,"New York, NY",266,824,1216

4.0,3/31/2016,"( I now see I checked in to the wrong location) Brunch in NYC is serious business. I don't mean getting dressed up, I mean people ""brunch"" as a term on the weekends and it's important to have a place to go and have good eats waiting at the other end. With that being said, when we head into town we do have some favorite spots to hang with my cousin. But we are always open to try a new brunch location, especially if the word on the street is good food or coffee....or dare I say alcohol. So my cousin said she had recently brunched at Sarabeth's and thought we'd like it, being our last day in the city we wanted good food and a casual vibe.We did make sure to get an earlier start than most New Yorker's probably do on a Saturday morning since we did have an early afternoon flight home. And Sarabeth's was open earlier than some other spots on a weekend. We showed up at 10 am on Saturday and there were plenty of open tables in this fairly large restaurant located Park and 28th. Service was great, we were served drinks and food very quickly at this earlier time. I ordered scrambled eggs in a popover with arugula on the side. I think they used 4-5 eggs so have a big appetite! But who doesn't love a popover!!! Simple and delicious and I always love a eggs on toast kind of breakfast, so I did enjoy this variation.

3.0,3/15/2016,"After visiting other locations in Manhattan, exploring this Park Avenue South location was our first, but now checked off venue for my wife's all-time Sunday brunch list. First and foremost I praise any restaurant that's kid friendly, has room for strollers, provides plastic cups/straws, has patient waiters, and has a kids menu. They definitely earn a plus there. We promised our 2 toddlers pancakes so I couldnt let them down. Service was exceptional, eggs benedict and short rib hash were delicious (but expensive at $21 each), kids enjoyed the pancakes. Its not always easy to appreciate your meal with 2 toddlers then pay a lot for our dining experience compared to other restaurants in the area, but that was our choice and eventually I'll forget that I paid $8 for an OJ.

3.0,2/26/2016,"I've always heard good things about Sarabeth's brunch and although I found the food to be adequate, it was just A-OK for me. I think what hindered the experience for me slightly was the price of the entrees, a little bit more on the expensive side compared to other brunch places that offer similar plates.I started off with the Bloody Mary ($13). The amount they give you is huge. It was like an endless amount of Bloody Mary. The drink itself was good. I was just meh on the pickled garnishes on top. Too sweet for my liking. For my entrée, I got the scrambled eggs stuffed popover. Overall, it was good. The scrambled eggs were cooked nicely, full of that scallion flavor with bits of creamy soft cream cheese in between. The popover was a little dry and overcooked but it was adequate with the meal. The side salad was nice and refreshing with the eggs. I also tried some of my friend's ricotta and lemon pancakes and found the portion to be plentiful and the pancakes to be nice and fluffy with a nice hint of lemon. Overall, it was a good meal.

3.0,2/18/2016,"I love trying new places and before going to NY, I made sure to do my research to have a nice brunch during my stay and after looking at many places I came to the decision to pick Sarabeth's for Sunday brunch (this past Valentine's day). The wait was not long, maybe 20 minutes and we were seated (my daughter and I) which I thought was very quick giving it was both Sunday and Valentine's day. I ordered the steak and truffle fries, the almond crusted french toast for my daughter, an orange juice for her and a mimosa for me and the total bill was $92 and some change including tip. I found it extremely over priced for the food we got. The food was good but not worth paying nearly $100 for brunch for two with just one alcoholic beverage. I am from Miami so it's not like I am not used to over priced meals, but I've had the same quality food and even better for almost half the price in some of the most popular and high rated brunch places here.Overall I'd say it was a good meal however for the price it was not worth it.",0,0,0,Andrea F.,"Miami, FL",0,1,0

Housemade chips are always a plus in my book, and generous portion of crabmeat was fresh!We also ordered the Seafood Cobb Salad, Buttermilk Pancakes, and Almond Crusted French Toast. The french toast was def my ultimate fave. It was just the right amount of buttery-goodness, and texture was crunchy from the almonds, but soft on the inside. I kinda just wished I asked for the strawberry jam on the side (since I'm not a fan of jam).Seafood Cobb Salad was a whole $30, but totally worth it when you see the amount of lobster and crabmeat they give you.

I guess lots of deal makers take people to this restaurant because the restaurant is very business-friendly and have private dining nooks for making deals. The person who took me here is not the type of person who would go anywhere that is not first-class.I was a bit surprised by the menu. It didn't seem like the typical Scotch and Steak place favored by most of the Wall Street crowd. It almost felt corporate and kind of sterile. But safe. However, the food was pretty good and I guess you could call the menu pretty safe as well because there was something for everyone.I had the steak, which was done well and seasoned nicely. The Walforff salad was good as well. I wouldn't call anything I ate the best I'd ever have but it was all pretty good and did the job. The prices were pretty much on par with NYC ... higher than you'd expect anywhere else. I understand that they are known for their brunch ... which would make sense to me because it has that 'American-French Bistro' vibe. Seems like the type of place 'the girls' would like for brunch.This is probably not a spot I would pick for an amazing meal if I was in the city and dining for the experience. But for doing business ... it has a pretty safe menu, is spotless/clean and generic-enough where it won't take the attention away from the deal. The wait staff is very good about getting you what you need for the meal but disappearing while the business talk takes place. It is clear that this is a place people use when they are having business lunches and maybe not so concerned about the actual food or an innovative menu.Will come back and try brunch sometime when it's not a 'working lunch'.

3.0,11/16/2015,"I was in NYC for the weekend, and came to Sarabeth's for brunch because it was one of my friend's favorite brunch spots. Overall, I walked out unimpressed and underwhelmed. When entering the location, I was immediately taken by how nice the place was and the ambiance of the restaurant. At 2:30pm, it was not difficult to be seated quickly. I also appreciated how quick the service was, and we received our food very soon after ordering. I split an adult grilled cheese and the buttermilk pancakes with someone. The portions were pretty small considering how expensive the items were. The adult grilled cheese was very small. While I thought it and the tomato soup accompanying it was good (but nothing special), it was definitely not worth the price. The pretzel bread was soft and chewy and I enjoyed that, but the cheese inside tasted pretty ordinary to me. The soup was creamy as promised, however much chunkier than I would have preferred. The buttermilk pancakes were also a bit of a letdown. Sure, the pancakes were good and fluffy, but again, nothing special. Considering they were $20, I thought they were sorely overpriced for what I got. I realize that it's hard to make buttermilk pancakes very unique, so at the least I expected there to be a lot of fresh strawberries. What I got instead were 6 small strawberry pieces that weren't even sweet/ripe! They were light red / white in spots and so I was immediately turned off by them. My friends ordered the jalapeno & cheddar omelet, and were also not too satisfied by it. They had to use salt / pepper because the omelet was bland and flavorless, which they did not expect since it is a jalapeno omelet. They only finally tasted the jalapeño flavor when they reached the center of the omelet. We had heard good things about the omelet, so maybe they were having an off-day, but that just means they lack consistency in their food. I had another friend order the unlimited cocktails package which was well-priced at $25. I thought the service was great for that; he never had to wait long for another drink and the waiter was attentive enough and came over to ask him if he wanted another drink often enough. I only tasted the pickled bloody mary, and I didn't think it was that good. In my opinion, the drinks/cocktails were more reasonably priced than the food was. But then again, the orange juice was $8, so... If you're looking for a nice place, and want an unlimited drinks package, this isn't a bad spot. However if you want quality food that is reasonably priced, I would not recommend it.4 stars for ambiance / service and 2 stars for the food.",0,0,0,Pooja S.,"Fremont, CA",11,10,0

We ordered just appetizers and said we would order the mains when our companion arrived and then she took our menus. She should have left them because we still had the rest of the meal to order.The muffins and jams were pretty good, the green salad with the roasted pit fruits was a bit dissapointing. We thought we would get more than 3 slices of fruit with it and it was hard to tell that they were roasted. The table was really wobbly, which was annoying but a bussboy took care of it quickly and efficiently. The quinoa ahi tuna was really wonderful however the salad bed that it came on was super spicy! No where did it say that the dressing was spicy, I couldn't eat more than a bite of it. The tuna salad was just okay. The four flowers juice tasted like any other smoothy and was unexciting. The waitors and bussboys are disjointed. We asked to have our extra muffins boxed up and the waitress took them, and then two minutes later a bussboy returned them in the same basket.I do however really appreciate that the manager walks the floor and checks up on parties.

The decor/atmosphere is much fancier than I anticipated, with interesting colors, wide, spacious, bright, and funky floors and walls. I was impressed, and it added more class than I was expecting.

I am the type of person that typically orders Pancakes, french toast, or eggs. But here, i was not willing to waste my money on something so pricy.

That's mad expensive, yo!! I ended up getting persuaded into ""getting what I want"" instead of just doing oatmeal or something cheap. I got the vegetable fritatta which was NOT GOOD, I would not ever get it again. We also got crabmeat/guacamole chips appetizer which WAS very good, even though there was not enough chips for the guacamole and I wasn't comfortable enough with the person I was with to be like ""i'm just gonna use a spoon and eat this $15 guacamole by itself!"" So a lot of it got taken away, uneaten, only to be scraped into the garbage (probably, maybe, maybe not) and to be feasted on by the charismatic rats of NYC. You're welcome, rats.BUTI went again (peer pressure) and got almond french toast and it was muy muy deliciouso. Was it worth $19? Probably not, but that's because $19 is still a lot of money to me. And not worth a meal I spend 20-23 minutes shoving into my mouth.So should you go here? If you like spending $19 on egg soaked bread with some almonds on top, then yes, go.

When you sit at the bar, there is also a strange smell, kind of unpleasant. Sarabeth's serves better food in the winter/autumn...I don't know it is just better. The breakfast is sometimes delicious. However, there are times that I suspect they warm their dishes in the microwave. For example, I once had eggs benedict and the english muffin was warm but the egg was cold on some spots.

I was torn between ordering 2 appetizers (avocado burrata toast and crab guacamole) versus the crab cake Benedict. I ended up going with the 2 apps at the server's recommendation (which I suspected, in hindsight correctly, because they were more expensive).  The crab guac tasted bland as if it was lacking salt and the avocado tasted like it came from a store bought tub. Boyfriend ordered braised short rib hash. Sounds delicious doesn't it? It's really not. The short ribs had no flavor and I've personally made much better. His Bloody Mary tasted like canned tomato sauce in a goblet and was overpriced at 14 dollars. The server took our order and we didn't see him again until he dropped the check.  2 stars because I've tried the location in TriBeCa and it's crowded with a wait for a reason.

2.0,6/9/2015,"I would give this place one star; but their hosting stand is quite gracious, while the rest of the restaurant is rather lackluster. I made a reservation on their website for a party of three at 12:45 PM on a Sunday afternoon, but it wasn't particularly busy, compared to some of the other times I've passed by outside. My guests were from out of town and had trouble finding a parking lot that would accept the car into their lot because it was also a Filipino holiday and the city had blocked off several city blocks to accommodate for the parade. Nevertheless, I checked in on time for the reservation, while letting the hostess know that 2/3rds of my party were still parking. When we were seated, we were placed at what struck me as the most awkward seating in any restaurant I've ever been sat at, much less the most awkward seat in the entire restaurant. Our table was touching one of the columns, and the column was also touching two other tables (if not touching a different table on each side). On two sides of our table, adjacent to the column, there were perpendicular chairs, so my elbow was essentially digging into someone's back if I wasn't hyperaware of my arm placement. TL;DR it was a weird table. Why block off one entire side? After that, our waiter was in a giant rush to get us everything. He gruffly took our orders, gave us our drinks, and kept forgetting our waters. Another waiter saw that we had been sitting there for half an hour without water, so he came to our rescue. Our waiter returned with the breads+muffins basket, which was delicious! But he was in such a rush that one of the muffins literally flopped off the basket because he was practically tossing the basket and slamming it onto the table. Or maybe he was just trying to show us a physics lesson?? He returned with what seemed like a fresh muffin, but who knows? After a few bites, though, I didn't really care because it was delicious. (Pumpkin)Shortly afterwards, a different waiter shattered a water glass right next to our table, effectively making us worried for our feet, because we were all wearing open shoes/sandals. He swept it up immediately, and we felt a bit bad for him, but began seeing that everyone seemed to be trained in a huge rush here? Not sure. The food wasn't particularly anything to write home about, the breads were good. We had the Baby Kale Caesar, which was delicious, but again, nothing special. We also had the salmon eggs benedict, as well as the lemon ricotta pancakes. The Salmon eggs benedict was good, and the toasted english muffins they came on top of was great, a bit hard on the teeth, so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with weak teeth.The lemon ricotta pancakes were good, a bit too floury, despite having ricotta. Whenever i make ricotta pancakes at home, they turn out fluffy and I'm able to eat a lot since they're mostly more airy and crispy, but these were much more floury. Perhaps they were trying to compensate for price? But it wasn't like they were particularly cheap, either. I don't think I will be particularly returning to Sarabeth's anytime soon. Perhaps for the baked goods, To Go.",0,0,1,Christina C.,"Brooklyn, NY",294,77,79

But the services was so atrocious it definitely ruined my meal!Two nights ago we were greeted by the hostess with the worst possible puss on her face I've only seen in bitchy teen made for TV dramas. I thought I was imagining it bc it was so bad but my date commented on it as well. Not welcoming in the slightest. At our table we asked for a suggestion on the red wine, notes, how robust it is, etc. All she knew was one was popular and we couldn't taste it. Fine. Twenty minutes later (literally) and after asking for it twice it arrives. She can't uncork it so we watch her take is to someone else, struggles with it more, pours the glass w chunks of cork, the leaves the bottle of RED wine on the table but not before she puts the mangled cork back in the bottle. Now to the food. Delicious.... But after about 45 minutes after we ordered. Again as we were ordering we asked our waitress what was better the kale or the spring veggies she said well if you like kale it's popular but I haven't tried either. (As a side if I didn't ""like kale"" why would I be asking to order it). I understand that things happen but this is more than a half empty restaurant. There were a handful of seated tables & other servers around. I didn't get it. Oh and she charged us extra on the bill. The crappy service wasn't worth the hassle when there's at least 5 better restaurants in a 2 block radius. And don't get me started on Sunday brunch. Whatever you do don't sit at the bar.

The omelette I ordered was big and fluffy, and exactly as one would hope an omelette should be.  The coffee was excellent.  Here's why it's four stars and not five for me.  I would have liked to have seen more options.  I was surprised that there wasn't a basic bacon and cheese omelette -- in fact, bacon wasn't an ingredient in any of the omelettes.  I didn't want to spend $8 for a side of bacon.  The menu warns that they will politely refuse any substitutions.  However, I was able to have bacon added, despite my waiter's warning that it would ""take more time"" to order this way.  There was a muffin choice available as an ""OR"" but not an ""AND"" -- if a single muffin was available, I didn't see it on the menu.",1,0,0,Andrew P.,"New York, NY",125,39,5

I went on a Wednesday, when they boast live jazz in the bar area. Fun! We were seated right away in the totally empty restaurant. The bar area was sort of kind of full, with people milling about with adult drinks near the jazz trio. We sat for dinner and were pleasantly surprised to be able to hear the jazz at our table. We ordered drinks and the crab guacamole while we waited for the others in our party to arrive. I started with the blue cheese olives martini, which was fine. Truly, just fine. I honestly probably would have sent it back, it was too mediocre. But I didn't feel like the hassle, and vodka goes down easy, so I sipped it. I switched to rose after that. The crab guacamole was only okay. To their credit, there was a lot of crabmeat, but something about the whole dish was just waaaayyyyy too heavy for an appetizer. I don't know. The chips that came with the dish for dipping were crazy salty. We sort of stopped eating it halfway through. We just couldn't deal. For an entree, myself and a friend split the shrimp pizza and the prosciutto pizza. Both were, again, fine. Nothing special, not bad tasting, but not anything worth going back for. Exacerbating this feeling is the prices. It was really, really expensive for what it was. The decor was nice, I guess. Really standard, clean lines, and little feminine, just very, very blah. I might come in for a drink during live jazz, but other than sitting only at the bar and skipping any food, I would completely pass on this Sarabeth's.",1,1,1,Lauren B.,"New York, NY",485,391,60

Definitely liked their brunch (basically the breakfast and lunch) menu. The waitstaff was super nice and really prompt, without making us seemed rushed.

The decor and service is everything you would expect from a restaurant on park avenue. The atmosphere is very elegant and this is definitely a nice place to go to with a group of girlfriends. Guys may not like the stuffy atmosphere too much but it's great for couples as well.My go to meal at Sarabeth's always begins with the crab guacamole and chips. This is excellent, fresh and good for sharing. I then move on to the seafood Cobb salad which is delicious and has a giant prawn right on the middle of a Cobb salad that includes crab meat. They also have specials on certain days that include $1 oysters and $2 shrimp for shrimp cocktail. The food is pricey but that is predictable considering the location. If you order lunch be prepared to order more than one item for it to fill you up. There is also outside seating, however it is about 50 feet away from construction work and the back entrance to a building where garbage is taken out.

3.0,8/31/2014,"IN SHORT: A storied favorite for breakfast or brunch with breads and pastries as elegant and refined as the decor.THE STORY: With its spacious interior full of high-end wood finishes, Sarabeth's seems as if it could have easily transported you into the heart of sunny Beverly Hills in the morning. A simple meal here leaves no doubt that this place is a classic, a timeless node of quality in the New York restaurant world.That being said, the food can sometimes feel as if it were cranked out by a machine in a rush, and consistency often falters across the board. While the Eggs Benedict (also available with smoked salmon) is hearty and creamy and uniquely served on one corn muffin and one English muffin, the eggs themselves can oscillate between undercooked, overcooked, and occasionally just right even within a single dish. The Lemon Ricotta pancakes are also a sweet and fluffy favorite served with fresh berries, although like the rest of the menu's options, there is always a likelihood that one pancake or two will have missed the quality control check and will come served a little raw in the center.Yet despite the imperfections in the food, the service and atmosphere have an upscale, yet simple comfort that makes every brunch entirely pleasant.",2,1,1,Ali M.,"New York, NY",31,234,245

2.0,8/27/2014,"Quick review to complain about sub-par service. Went here early morning for brunch. There was only one other table there when we arrived, and no more than five tables when we left. The service was actually solid up until the end. Our plates had been cleared and our server asked if we wanted coffee or dessert; we all declined. We sat around chatting for a few minutes. My dad went downstairs to the bathroom, told us we ""had to see"" this bathroom, so two more of us went down to check it out. At this point about 15 minutes passed (no, I'm not exaggerating) and we still hadn't received our bill. I stood up out of our booth to see four or five servers just talking in the corner. No, it wasn't a meeting. No, I don't know what they were talking about. I worked at a little restaurant in rural Pennsylvania, and the #1 rule was you always pay attention to your tables, and never get together to talk with other servers, especially in an area where you can't see your table. I had to walk to the corner to ask our server for our bill. None of this would have bothered me TOO much, but she gave me a really snide look as though I was bothering her. When she came back with the bill, there was no apology and she didn't even look at me. Knowing that the bill was well over $100 with at least a $20 tip coming, with few other customers in the restaurant, you'd think she would have been much more attentive and polite. This bothers me to no end. Whoever manages this place really needs to get this sorted out, as I don't appear to be the only one complaining about service.Oh, the food was decent. The eggs benedict was definitely not worth $18, and everyone else at the table enjoyed their meal, but said it wasn't worth the price. I would not recommend this place.

The staff here, particularly the reception staff, has an unbelievable bitchy attitude...as if you should be grateful to be served totally mediocre food (do not order the lemon ricotta pancakes with ordering juice or something to wash them down with...they're that dry!), at insane prices.

4.0,5/28/2014,"I'm not going to lie, after reading a few of these Yelp reviews, I was nervous (sidenote: y'all are harsh.) However, I kept my reservation despite my reservations, and my friend and I had a lovely brunch at Sarabeth's. We both had omelettes, both delicious, and I definitely recommend ordering the pumpkin muffin as your side (YUM!) I also liked that, unlike most brunches, I didn't feel rushed by the waitstaff to leave (my friend was visiting from France, so we had a lot of catching up to do.) In fact, we had to hail down our waitress to get our check.Now to address some of the Yelp concerns/complaints and to let others know that Sarabeth's is not the Seventh Circle...I'm not even going to comment on the prices because, like, get over it? If you look at the menu ahead of time (like most people do these days, ahem) then you're well aware of what you're getting yourself into. Too pricey? Don't come.Food? A lot of people seem to not like the food here. I can tell you though, I was very satisfied with my omelette and pumpkin muffin. Sure, it wasn't the best omelette I've ever had and it wasn't made by the hands of God, but I thought it was still pretty tasty.Waitstaff. The comments made about the servers/hostesses is what really frightened me because if there's one thing I can't tolerate, it's a rude waitstaff. I found everyone to be genuinely friendly, though. And, like I said before, we weren't rushed in any way.I suppose, if I had to complain, I'd say the two-diner tables are poorly laid out and way too close together.

I chose the mixed fruit, lobster roll and chocolate truffle cake. The table was also brought plates of chicken sausage and crispy bacon to share. Everything was absolutely delicious - the portions were huge (some folks had french toast or the eggs benedict...looked amazing) and the lobster roll was perfect. Not too much mayo, sweet lobster meat served on a buttered roll. YUM. The chips that accompanied the sandwich were fried - homemade potato chips. YUM. Bacon was crisp and perfectly cooked; the chicken sausage was surprisingly delicious.

The only thing this place has going for it is the decor. Spacious, clean and beautifully decorated. Service:- waitress was a no-show the entire time, never introduced herself, rushed us at every corner, lacked general sense of a waitress' purpose in driving business- had only one cup of coffee the entire time...never was asked for another- hostess...the brunette with a yellow sweater and black dress (mother's day breakfast time) was absolutely horrendous.

It came with a dry muffin - which is suspect since we were there at 8:30 am. - wife had the braised rib - was ok...way too much herbs in it made it difficult to eat. - in-law liked her omelette...not sure what she gotPrice:- the price is the kicker here.

When she made the reservation she requested a booth because she wears a hearing aid and booths usually provide a quieter setting. Although we arrived on time for the reservation, her request wasn't honored. Not good. Both of us ordered from the $26 prix fixe menu. It included soup or salad and a choice of three or four entrees, but no dessert. That seemed a little high, even by NYC lunch standards, but it was a special occasion. Both of us ordered scallops as an entree. It included a modest-size serving of mashed potatoes topped by slivers of apple, all surrounded by some kind of sauce. Very, very tasty, but there were only three scallops, and each one was about the size of a man's thumb nail. Really? For $26? What a rip-off.

Service was friendly and truthful, decor was simple and trendy, ambiance was bright and comfortable. lots of seating here so I expect you wouldn't have to wait much. Great menu! Couldn't decide what to get 'cause my boyfriend and I wanted it all. I would recommend getting the four flower juice if you want a refreshing beverage to start. Just pure blended tropical fruits. Boyfriend ordered the farmer's omelette (leeks, ham, potato, guyere), which I thought was perfect, but he complained was a little bland. Tip: add some jam, it tastes great! Got it with a side of scone and jam. Scone alone was okay but with the butter and jam was soft and sweet--mmm. He also ordered a side of pork sausages and apricot jam. Sausages were cooked right (not recommended for those who like 'em smokey and over-done). Apricot jam added the most amazing flavor--sweet and zesty. I ordered the seared ahi tuna, which was encrusted with sesame. Wow the tune was so soft and fresh. The sesame didn't add much flavor but it did a nice texture. It came with a bok choy salad that I was afraid wouldn't be good, but the light dressing. along with the oranges, grapefruits, scallions, cilantros, and shiitake mushrooms really added a punch to it. Definitely a very different salad that I had never tried before and really enjoyed. The salad may look like a small portion but I guarantee you it is very filling. Overall the bill came out to $60, not including tip. So not a cheap brunch but I would definitely recommend coming here. Great for a nice romantic brunch on a nice day. Why not 5 stars then?

But what bugged me the most about Sarabeth's is that, while dining here with my husband and our 1 year old son, we were unable to find a place to change his diaper after discovering that neither the men's restroom nor the two handicapped accessible restrooms had a changing station installed. On a hunch, I asked a female friend to check in the women's restroom for a changing station. Sure enough, there it was. Undeterred, my husband and I knocked, then entered the women's restroom and changed our son with one standing sentry to alert any potentially offended female guests. It's a sad state of affairs for gender equality and for men raising children (either with another man or alone) that an establishment thinks that having a changing station in the women's restroom is sufficient.!If you like your steak frites with a side of gender inequality, eat here.

1.0,2/25/2014,"We came here around 11am on Sunday. Seriously, don't eat here. I would rather sit at home with a box of cereal on my couch than come back to this madhouse. There are so many better options in the area. My friend who lives in the neighborhood had been wanting to try this place and said she would never come back. Here is the low down:Food- Not a fan. I ordered the spinach and goat cheese omelet. The omelet was fine but I am not happy with the choice of sides. To go along with their omelets, they give you the choice of a few different muffins, a croissant, engligh muffin, or toast. I ordered a pumpkin muffin which was terrible. The muffin was dry and had sunflower seeds on top and raisins inside. And no I am not mistaking this for pumpkin seeds- I really mean that the pumpkin muffin had sunflower seeds on top which is weird! And my spinach and goat cheese omelet and pumpkin muffin came with a jelly which had a berry flavor (what type of berry I couldn't tell). Is the jelly for my muffin or omelette?! I had no clue what to do with the jelly. The muffin already had way to much going on that I certainly didn't need to add berry jelly to a dry pumpkin muffin with raisins and sunflower seeds. I tried the croissant and English muffin that came with my friends' orders and they were nothing special. They also had mystery jellies that we couldn't tell what the flavor was but came to the conclusion the jelly had to be either apple or peach. I was still hungry after eating my omelette and taking the dry pieces and raisins off my muffin. The omelets don't come with any potatoes. Luckily my friend ordered a side of home fries which were an additional cost. The home fries were decent and were chunks or potatoes with some chopped peppers. I just wish there were more of them. I heard this place is known for their baked goods which is surprising because I have tasted better baked goods from my 12 year old sister's Easy Bake oven. Price- I know Manhattan is more expensive but I still think this is pricey for what you get at $16 for an omelet without any potatoes. Bloody Mary's are $14 and we walked by a different restaurant on the way that had $18 bottomless Bloody Mary's. Service- They filled our water constantly and were also good with coffee refills but it took a bit to get our check and for the waitress to come back for our credit card to pay.Ambiance- This restaurant is big with too many tables. I don't understand the decor and think they are going for a classier or trendier version of a diner. I would be happier at a diner where I am not cramped and get a nice portion of potatoes with my omelette. We were placed in a table in the back in an awkward spot. The servers seemed like they didn't have enough room to get around us and we were very close to other tables. Then towards the end of our meal, they seated a large party behind my friend. They put in an extra table and two chairs; two people in the other table were literally sitting at the corners of the table and practically touching my friend. It was so uncomfortable and we couldn't wait to get out of there.

Let me just say that sitting in this restaurant made me feel like I was in the most commercial tourist trap ever.  The restaurant is huuuuuuuuuuuge.  The biggest restaurant I've seen in New York City without utilizing the space well.  The decor looked like it belonged in a casino buffet. The service here is terrible.  I arrived on time, but the hostesses were slow to get to me.  Once they finally did, they were quick to point out that I was five minutes late to my reservation.  Too bad I had been waiting here for five minutes before you even acknowledged me.  I wasn't seated until ten minutes later.  Staff was yelling at each other (not angrily, but more in a flustered fashion) to explain where each guest sits.  They really didn't have it together.My waitress was very kind and polite.  I ordered the salmon benedict, while my girlfriend got the goldie lox.  Both were alright.  Mine was topped with some peppers, and it tasted straight out of a diner (of which I could get at a much cheaper price).  My girlfriend also got some sort of adult's hot chocolate, which barely had any liquor in it, but was pretty tasty.  On top of all this mediocre food, the price tag was outlandish.  This restaurant by far holds the worst price to satisfaction ratio I've ever had.  Maybe the other locations are better, but I will most likely be never visiting this chain ever again.",2,1,1,Mary P.,"Manhattan, NY",149,38,0

Like another reviewer mentioned, i was surprised by how dense the lemon ricotta pancakes were as well. I tried a bite from my sister-in-law's order and the consistency was like an undercooked buttermilk pancake- really really doughy! I ordered the Chorizo and Sweet Pepper Frittata and it was pretty good! I found it to be a light but satisfying egg dish. Rather than being a slice from a big frittata you get a mini round frittata for yourself which is kind of cool. The chorizo was cut up really finely so it was more like a seasoning in the frittata than a huge ingredient but I kind of liked that. There was this really good red sauce around the frittata but I wish there was more of it! I got the sourdough toast with it and loved it.As other reviewers have pointed out the coffee here is excellent; I wonder what they're brewing?Finally, as I was here with family celebrating my mom's birthday, she ordered the ice cream sandwich sampler for the table to split. The servers did a great job singing her happy birthday and making the dessert service fun. The ice cream sandwiches however were hit and miss. The chocolate chip cook vanilla one was delicious, the chocolate butterscotch cookie one was good, but the last one, which I think was supposed to be mint ice cream and a chocolate cookie, was overfrozen and a little tasteless.

The space is very large and bright, though it doesn't have much character and reminds me of a hotel restaurant. I had never been to a Sarabeth's before, and was interested to try it out, though I was a little hesitant since I knew it would be pricey.We each ordered one cocktail, and one entree, and the bill came out to $154.60, tip not included. After splitting the bill and paying my portion of the tip, I ended up paying about $37 for a meal I thought was mediocre at best. My ""pineapple"" mimosa, a special for the day ($12), did not taste any different than a regular mimosa. I ordered the garden omelette ($16), and for that price I was expecting it to taste much better than your standard diner egg dish, which it did not. I was disappointed - some of my eggs were runny, there were not many veggies and the cheese was not evenly spread throughout the omelette. It was a little on the cold side, and my toast was not at all warm. Another member of our table got fries with her burger, and these arrived cold as well.The staff was almost too attentive, stopping by every few minutes to clear plates or refill waters, and it gave the entire meal a rushed atmosphere.Overall, I would not come here again.

1.0,8/1/2013,"I went here with a group and ordered the daily special salad.  Upon eating half of it, I noticed a ...bug in the salad.  I'm not dramatic, so I quietly made my way to the server and told her about the lurking salad bug.  ""It happens,"" I thought, just not usually with an $18 salad.  The manager came over and asked if I'd like something else. Well, ""no,"" (though maybe some immunizations).    When I got the bill, my item was taken off, but the rest of the bill was fully in tact. Pay up!      IMHO, one can't be a nice restaurant and treat a live bug in the salad in the same way one might treat a dish that was ""too salty"" or along the same lines as a customer saying ""I didn't know this had celery"" etc.  Instead the restaurateurs should apologize profusely and comp the entire meal.  Not at Sarabeths.  A bug in the salad is just a another returned appetizer.Bugger.Never again.",3,1,0,Gale K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0
1.0,7/30/2013,"Went for a celebratory lunch with a group of about 10. Everything seemed to be going OK, until the orders started rolling out. Everyone's food slowly came out. My entree was no where to be seen. It took the scatterbrained waitress a few minutes to realize and then she asked me if I had ordered a garden omelette, I said no, I ordered the popover eggs. She said, I'm sorry I forgot to put the order in, I'll go put it in now. That was the first and last apology. Everyone was 3/4 through their meal when my food came out which I had to then scarf down so as not to delay the meal. Usually you are offered ketchup with eggs. Nope. I had to get up and find a busboy at the other side of the restaurant to get ketchup since there was no sign of anyone checking on us. He took his time in bringing it out. Then, when the busboy came to clear the dishes, he tried to take my dish without asking if I was done eating. The scatterbrained waitress, saw me still eating and came and placed the check next to me since she knew we were in a rush but she really should not have added insult to injury by placing it near me.  Check included a nice 20% gratuity for the incompetent waitress and did not take off my meal or include anything to make up for their mistake.Second and last time (definitely, at this location).

We ordered the muffin basket with preserves ($12), the granola/fruit/yogurt, and jalapeno eggs. Overall, the muffin basket was good (the pumpkin and banana are the best), the granola/yogurt was completely not memorable (nowhere near as good as the comparable dish at Petit Abeille) and the jalapeno eggs were too cheesy. Also it didn't come with potatoes/greens on the side, but instead with a croissant--it wasn't as enjoyable. Is Sarabeths trying to save on ingredients or something?We felt slightly rushed here as well, which was shocking given that the restaurant was mostly empty.

1.0,4/15/2013,"I hate to give such a poor review for two reasons. #1 I ahve been to Sarabeth's CPS location a few years ago and had a very good experience and #2 it is a new addition to my neighborhood that I wanted to like. But they earned this rating based on a horrible experience.We came on Sunday for my sister's birthday and were a party of five. I remember the decor from when it was Primehouse and they left it pretty much as is since it was a nice large room.Our party of 5 ordered- 2 french toasts- apple cinnamon and almond crusted, scrambled egg popover, duck pastrami sandwich, and lobster roll. I got the four flowers jucie which is delicious, but they gave it to me in a wine glass and filled it 1/3 of the way. Really? If you're going to charge $8 for juice give me a full glass. They are obviously trying to get you to drink up and ask for refills.Long story short, that was the least of our problems. We waited nearly an hour for our food to come. An hour for a couple of breakfast dishes that take about 5 minutes, a COLD lobster roll that just needs to be thrown on a bun. And in between we saw our waitress a few times and not once did she mention anything about the food coming out, nor did she issue an apology for the wait.When the food finally came out, they only brought 3 of our plates out while me and my sister's bf had to wait another 10 mins. We just told everyone to start eating because they had already waited so long and were starved. When they came back with the remaining two plates, they wound up giving me an egg dish which was wrong since I ordered the apple cinnamon french toast. When I told the server it was wrong he gave me the ""deer in the headlights"" blank stare. After whisking it away, I was now nearly an hr and a half into the meal and hadn't eaten a thing. My mother stopped eating her meal halfway and started offering me bites. 15 mins later, they come back and again ITS THE WRONG DISH! This time just the regular french toast not the apple cinnamon I wanted. I mean really? This is glorified diner fare not complicated dishes involving molecular gastronomy. It was a simple order and there is no excuse for messing this up twice.At this point, the manager finally came over because I'm sure someone alerted him of their mistakes and how frustrated we were. He apologized profusely, saying the server was new and this and that, but we were all pissed off. I have a hard time believing it was just our server's fault. Seems like the kitchen is very confused. It was supposed to be an enjoyable birthday brunch for my sister but it wound up turning into a disastrous embarassment. The last thing we wanted to do was complain and cause a scene, especially with her bf present but we had no choice.When the correct order finally made the table, it honestly wasn't special. The french toast had a dollop of apple compote and a few raisins and bananas scattered on top. Not a huge portion either. I inhaled it since I was famished in about 2 minutes flat and didn't even enjoy it. My whole family had already finished their meal by then. On a side note, I could tell they were thrilled with their meals either but didn't want to add fuel to the fire. I felt terrible for my sister, as she picked out Sarabeth's and was excited about having a celebratory birthday brunch to be enjoyed with her family and boyfriend.Obviously, they comped my meal and offered a round of free drinks (which they managed to also mess up) but by then the damage was done.I know they are new but after 2 months there is no excuse for such terrible service snafus and miscues from the kitchen. Especially when Sarabeth's has 10 locations and should have this place running like a well-oiled operation. Sad to say but we will not be back.

One of the delayed entrees shows up and now everyone has their entree except me and they say it will come soon..a little too soon....2-3 minutes later extremely under seared , cool to the touch, scallops show up..At this point I am convinced that there is not a trained sous chef at this location....and where is the Head Chef on a Saturday night, allowing these sadly seared scallops to go to the table? Is he at home getting rested up for the real mealtime here.....Brunch ?  We send them back to be cooked more, but now all is lost for me and I am so stressed and so hungry I said thank you anyway, very nicely...I excused myself, very quietly and they removed the scallops from the check, and then I went home to walk the dog never to return .

3.0,4/1/2013,"I had always heard of Sarabeth's referred to as a brunch place with delicious pastries, so I had assumed that it was basically an upscale diner.  However, it really was much more than that, and I was shocked at the quality of the dinner options in general, as well as at my particular meal.   This new location had taken the place of Primehouse, the sprawling steakhouse that was previously there.  The dining area was rather large, though I did find the decor to be reminiscent of a Cheesecake Factory.Our server was just attentive enough without being overbearing, but he was not overly helpful with our questions about the menu.  He defended his naivety by claiming they were a new establishment.  To make matters worse, I saw every other table receive a basket of their homemade bread, while we did not have one delivered at any point during our stay.  We also did not even notice a blackboard of specials until we were leaving the restaurant; no one had pointed them out to us.I must say, though, that I was thrilled to see that they had the Byron Pinot Noir available by the glass, a wine I consider to be a hidden gem among affordable California Pinots.  So, of course I had to order that!  My friend and I also started off by sharing the Crab Meat Guacamole, which was surprisingly a decent portion of the avocado dip topped with just as much, if not more, fresh lump crab meat.  The appetizer was light, fresh, and the perfect way to commence one of the first warm evenings of spring.  The accompanying homemade potato chips seemed kettle-cooked and were very delicious, though a bit greasy.  My Sea Scallop entree contained 4 medium-sized scallops that were very well-seasoned and perfectly cooked in a citrus honey glaze.  They were served over a creamy parsnip puree and topped with beet chips and a beet salsa.  There were also fried onion ribbons adorning the side of the plate.  My friend's Yellowfin Tuna was served rare over bok choy and blood orange, all in a shitake brown butter.  The fish was rather peppery and good, but my scallops definitely outshined them in execution. Though we were contemplating dessert on a very high level, our server only inquired about our ordering coffee or tea.  I declined this idea, assuming that he would then offer some kind of pastry list, but, instead, he just brought the check.  This was fine by me, as I was probably not going to order it anyway, but I would have loved to at least see a menu.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of my meal at Sarabeth's.  However, I am not sure if the few service mistakes were due to this being a new location or what.  It might be better to visit one of their other spots until this one becomes better organized.",0,0,1,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

1.0,3/25/2013,"I came here for brunch expecting really good food and really good service. The cute names given for each dish set me up for a world of disappointment. We waited about 20 minutes before our waiter finally came to the table - this was super annoying as I noticed he might have only had two other tables in the same area.  I ordered the four flowers juice to start ($7) and received a semi-decent juice that was literally less than half a small wine cup of juice. I drank it in two gulps. I was definitely not pleased. The juices here are such a rip-off. After telling the waiter about how little juice there was for each order, he proceeded to pressure me into buying more of this overpriced juice or other drinks that were clearly a rip off. It was just awfully annoying. Service was the worst out of everything.Food-wise, we started off with the crab guacamole served with chips. The chips were gross - I would have preferred crackers or something less oily or more durable to scoop up the crab and guacamole. The chips kept breaking and it was so hard to scoop up the guac. The crab was quite delicious since it was pretty fresh and blended well with the guac. Next we got the papa bear ""porridge"" which was just plain oatmeal with a few pieces of strawberry and a small banana chopped up. This is not porridge in the least. We waited about 5 minutes before someone finally came over to our table so that we could get some honey. No one ever bothered asking how our food was. I had to put in lots of honey to make this ""porridge"" taste semi-decent. McDonald's has better oatmeal than this and that is only a few bucks. We also ordered the Popeye Eggs which was OK - nothing great. This might be the worst brunch spot I've ever been to. Bring back Prime House please.",6,0,0,Bo B.,"New York, NY",490,984,753

The food is all good, nothing crazy amazing but all done well.We had the lobster mac and cheese, crab guacamole (they dont skimp on the crab), and lemon pancakes. The sausage sides were great. I didnt particularly love the Kale ceaser but my wife's frittata was well cooked. All in all a good meal, and great for kiddies.",0,0,0,Ian C.,"Alameda, CA",314,387,407
3.0,3/21/2013,"This newer location is huge.  When we arrived for brunch on a Saturday, the restaurant was busy, but not at full capacity.  There is a whole back room that would be great for throwing an event like a shower.  What's on the menu?  Your typical brunch-fare.  My garden omelette was nice and fluffy but could have used some more herbs and seasoning.  Others ordered the salmon eggs benedict which looked good, but I'm not sure it warrants the $18 price tag.  Muffin basket with preserves was good.  Friend and I ordered a pot of green tea but they showed up with mint tea instead.  Ended up liking it quite a bit so didn't mind even though it was a mix up!",0,0,0,Mandy L.,"New York, NY",115,623,1591

But overall, definitely in the running for Most Mediocre Brunch of 2013 Award. Been to other Sarabeth's over the years, and you know what you're getting - elevated diner food, but consistent.

3.0,3/10/2013,"Review for brunch.Tip: come early otherwise you will need to wait.Hubby and I wanted to check out the new spot, given the limited brunch options in the neighborhood.Of course I had the french toast ($16), but decided to try the almond one instead of the plain. Definitely the right bread, but the batter it was soaked/dipped in, lacked in flavor. Even though the almonds added a nice crunch and some flavor, there was something still missing. All in all though, this dish was average, but I would come back every now and then as there aren't many places that make french toast well.As for the hubby, he had the classic eggs benedict. He said it was pretty good, but not sure if it was worth the $18. Parts of the english muffin was too hard to cut, let alone chew.We also ordered the home fries ($7), which were good.Our server was attentive and the space is nice. Great for groups and for a calm, relaxed brunch. Good addition to the neighborhood and will be back, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.",1,0,3,Michelle H.,"New York, NY",191,497,6
1.0,3/3/2013,"I don't get this place. It's basically a diner with a fine dining facade. Prices are absurd for what you get and the food is nothing special. I had an omelette that was obviously pumped with egg filler. ""Famous"" pastries tasted processed. Staff were friendly but seemed rather confused. I wanted to keep a plate at my table and I was asked literally 4 times if I wanted my plate cleared. When there's that much confusion, you can't really blame the staff but their management. Long wait time, food was a disappointment. This place is packed with tourists as well. New york has plenty of other great small brunch places with amazing deals, this place just doesn't make sense.",3,0,1,D K.,"Chicago, IL",0,14,0
5.0,3/3/2013,"Visited: March 3, 2013The Situation: First Sunday Brunch back in NYC after a few weeks of work travel.Expectations were high based on the memorable food experience from my previous brunching at their location near Central Park. Sadly, I could not make the soft opening period when they featured complimentary meals but I'm glad that my favorite meal was my maiden culinary voyage. Today was their first official Sunday brunch opening.The Scene: As expected, there was the standard wait. A call at 1:30 to check on average wait time garnered the kind response that the average wait time for two was 25 minutes. This is important to note because most places will NOT give you a quote over the phone even if you state that you are only a few blocks away so I appreciated this response. (Interesting to note: in person, my male scruffy looking bestie was quoted 90 minutes; I was given the standard 45 minutes to an hour. We were seated within 30 minutes.)The crowd was a great mix of couples, families, friends, etc. who had obviously heard of Sarabeth's reputation from its other locations. Ample waiting room was available for all, including a parking area for strollers. This space had previously been Primehouse which was predicted by a friend of mine to close within a year..and it did. The space was redone to be more inviting through more lighting and open areas. The Staff & Such: I don't think I've ever written or experienced this in recent dining experiences, but the service was PERFECT. Everyone was friendly and professional, which is especially important since this spot just opened. Our expectations for the wait were managed and there was enough staff to ensure that we always had our needs met. My brunch companion wondered aloud at the attractiveness of the staff but I didn't feel that this was out of the ordinary.We met Stewart, who seemed to act in an overall GM capacity and spent some time discussing the other locations as well as their philosophy in hiring the staff (experience AND attitude). Our waitress, Oyala, was perfect and we ensured that she received the tip that reflected that she performed beyond our expectations.Food:  Full disclosure - I am a huge, huge stickler for how I love my food from the preparation to presentation.We started sharing the crab meat with guac over chips which was fresh and of substantial portions for sharing. I had the scrambled egg popover with its perfect consistency and side of salad and my friend had the lemon ricotta pancakes. The chocolate mousse cake was a unique combination of chocolate mousse and pound cake with an egg based cream. Quite delish. Alcohol: I upgraded my Four Flowers martini to Five Flowers with the addition of  St. Germain while my friend tried out their signature pickled Bloody Mary. He ended up spicing it up more as he found it to be too genteel but in all fairness, I had warned him that it was most likely a recipe mean to appease the average Bloody Mary drinker that may not have his spice capacity. We upped the ante to the Fiery Mango...which caused the Asian blush to make an appearance on a Caucasian man who actually COULD NOT FINISH the drink. I switched out gin for vodka in the French 27 and between the strength and tartness of the drink, had to have an additional glass of water to finish it. The Threads: They were pretty forgiving as the range was from jeans and a sweater to a little bit of dress up. Location, Location, Location: The only aspect of this brunch experience that was even close to negative was that we were seated near the door. Normally, I'd ask for another table, but curious to people watch and check out the scene, we rolled with the spot. It also helped that it was a curved corner and traffic either from patrons or staff was NOT an issue.Wallet Whomp - $$$$ - I'll be coming back for other meals and happy hour but similar to other locations, the brunch is on the pricey side. Expect an average of $50 from cocktail to dessert.

5.0,3/2/2013,"Just amazing! This location is HUGE! They have a closed off dinning area in the back and even though they have only been open for a week it is jammed packed! From the moment we walked in it was obvious that there is tremendous care put into the running of Saraberth's and even Sarabeth herself is running around. The front staff was extremely attentive and kind, the food was excellent and they even made a proper cappuccino (with the correct foam, milk, espresso ratio and everything, this rarely happens State side!) our server was nice and a little overwhelmed but I am sure he will improve over time. So happy this area finally has a decent brunch place (sigh!)",2,0,0,Golsa D.,"New York, NY",2,79,0
1.0,3/2/2013,"Restaurant cannot accommodate brunch reservations of 6 or more, according to weekend manager who seems truly overwhelmed by his duties (and rude, to boot). Too bad, since the other locations can accomodate such reservations and have polite staff.",1,0,0,Bob A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0
4.0,2/28/2013,"It only became apparent recently that Primehouse's old spot (the previous occupant of this location, which was a mighty delicious steakhouse) was going to be filled by Sarabeth's. I've been to their store a few times in Chelsea, and I've only heard excellent things about their granola when I've sent it to relatives as a gift - so I was pretty stoked to go and try out dinner food here, even if that wasn't what they were known for. The setup is pretty much similar to how Primehouse was set up, but the color pattern is a lot lighter, making for a place that feels lighter and more casual despite the high ceilings. As with any new restaurant, though, the service definitely could use work. Our waiter forgot our orders, served iced coffee (instead of the iced tea we ordered), and made it clear he had no idea what the food tasted like when we asked for recommendations. That's pretty poor, because I feel for a new restaurant, the waiters should absolutely have an idea of what their preferences on the menu are. On its own, the waiter was definitely towards the lower end of the lower spectrum - but there are definitely people - like our water server, who had tasted menu items and had an opinion, as well as a personality - who are better. That said, the main waiter for us plain-out sucked.Hopefully the service (or the servers) improve over time, because the food here is really solid on its own. The tuna tartare was done a bit differently than I've had elsewhere - very heavy on the sesame seeds in the tartare, along with a very light vinaigrette, which gave the fish a much earthier taste (in a good way) than I'm used to. My fiancee had the jumbo crab spaghetti, which was really good - it's a very light dish, the crab is delicious, and it comes marinated in a sauce that works really well with the seafood. I had the beer glazed short ribs, which were incredibly succulent - very tenderized and richly flavored, but not to the point where the sauce overwhelmed the natural juices of the meat. We closed it up by splitting the chocolate mousse cake - which, from what I can deduce, was kind of like a pound cake outer layer with pure mousse in the middle...amazing. What I really liked was that the mousse had a firmer texture than other mousse I've had elsewhere.In all, the restaurant is very nicely put together, and the drink menu is not half-bad in terms of offering a selection of wines and a very solid choice of craft beers. The restaurant isn't on the cheaper side, but it's no more expensive than its predecessor. The service definitely needs to get a bit more on-track, but that aside, this seems like a very solid place to have a meal. I'll definitely come back for dinner, but I'll also look forward to trying out their brunch and lunch menus, too!",0,0,0,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",371,1653,169
