5.0,4/30/2019,"Went once for dinner, and decided to do brunch. They have traditional ""nicer"" brunch options (ie lobster eggs benedict), but we splurged for the $40 pre-fixe which was a great deal NY wise (appetizer, main, and dessert). You get way more bang for your buck here on a regular day vs other places during Restaurant Week! We did the kale salad - yummy not too sweet, roasted almonds on it / lobster salad - $7 prefixe but worth it, tagliatelle/clam spaghetti - so creamy and delicious, and nocciola/tiramisu - totally decadent. Our waiter was fantastic, explaining the dishes and his favorites/the signature dishes and the staff constantly filled our water/checked in the right amount. The crowd is more mature (it's a nicer resto), but there seem to be plenty of regulars. You can use the upstairs space for large parties/private bookings too.",1,0,0,Chrissy R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,163,208

3.0,1/22/2019,"Started out great but ended the night with disappointment. Reserved at this restaurant for my birthday because of the great ambience, reviews, and large group seating. My party and I were greeted with smiles and provided great hospitality throughout the night. We ordered 2 Appetizers,Bocconcini and Fritto Misto, 3 pasta dishes ( tagliatelle, agnolotti, and fusilli), a pesce dish, and a carne dish and a bottle of Chardonnay. The food was good, but there wasn't anything that really stood out to me, I think the one dish that I enjoyed the most was probably the fusilli, the texture was nice and chewy with abundant amount of meat. Everything was going well until the bill came out.My friends had planned a surprise cake for me since it was my birthday, but prior to that, they had called to confirm of the ""cake cutting fee"" and were told "" there is a $12 fee"", not per person but just straight up $12 fee. When we got the bill, we were charged $96 ( $12 pp),when we asked the waiter, he said he'd talk to his manager about why we were charged $12 per person. We were given the answer that it was a set price and there was nothing else they could do about it and to add onto that, he told us ""We have our own desserts made in house so you guys can order with us instead of having an outside dessert brought in"". That's not what you tell a customer that is inquiring about misleading information given to a customer over the phone. If we were first informed of the actual charge, we would have kindly ordered dessert from in house, that's not a problem, the problem is the attitude we were given when we asked about the misleading info over the phone. We called to ensure about the fee beforehand.My significant other and a friend of mine wrote about this experience on Yelp as well and Christina, General Manager, reached out to them for a full refund of the fee due to the misleading information we received just to find out that not only were we overcharged for the cake cutting fee, but turns out that there's a $60 flat fee for parties over 5 or more, so not only were we really overcharged, but we were given an attitude for misleading information twice by the waiter, would have been nice if the waiter introduced himself with his name as well. Thank you to Christina for reaching out and resolving this issue, but due to the service my friends and I received on what was supposed to be a very special day for me, we will not be returning. 3 stars because the ambiance was great, someone reached out to us to resolve the issue and it was a special day for both my friends and I.",3,1,0,Jessica L.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",235,110,168
5.0,1/21/2019,"As usual a great experience. Karina our waitress was great and Susan the sommelier was very attentive. Karina was quick but not rushed. Checked in on us but was not interruptive. The food was again on point. We both had the 4 course pre fixe, $85, which I still think is a bargain for NY. I had the carpaccio, the cocoa pasta with rabbit, the veal Milanese and chocolate tart. All were delicious. I had a bite of my husbands octopus appetizer and it was very tender with a nice char. And the filet he had for dinner was tender seasoned well and cooked perfectly. The crowd is older uptown and a lot seem to be regulars, but we were still treated well. Good job to the whole team. Make reservations!!!!",0,0,0,Anthony C.,"North Hollywood, CA",25,41,51
1.0,1/19/2019,"The restaurant is basically a cash grab for locals and tourists alike. They intentionally misinform you on prices to get you to pay more out of your pocket. We came here for a birthday party and called beforehand to ask how much it'd cost in order to get a birthday cake cut inside. The hostess informed us that it was 12$. Which made us decide on that place. After we brought our cake and asked them to cut it for us, they didn't inform us of anything different or asked any question about if we were informed of the pricing. But when we got the bill, to our surprise they charged us 12$ per person and not just 12$ that they initially told us of, which ended up being 96$ for our party of eight, just to serve a cake that wasn't even theirs. When we told the host of the situation, they told us, there's nothing they can do as it is house policy, and told us to order cake there the next time we get there. Guess what? We're not coming back. Before the cake we spent over 400$ in food alone in that place, so the price isn't a problem. It's how they handled it and ripped us off without any apologies that's a problem for us.",1,0,0,Peal D.,"Queens, Queens, NY",4,15,2
1.0,1/19/2019,"I came here with my girlfriend and her friends for her birthday dinner. The food here was great and all but unfortunately they didn't take the liberty to inform us specifically about the cake service. We were informed that the cake service was $12.00, not $12.00 per head per slice. We brought our own cake and the only thing that they did was cut the cake. We could've cut the cake ourselves if we knew, that was the policy. When we confronted them, they said ""the person who told you didn't specify and we apologize but there is nothing we can do about it"". Sadly we got charged in the end but isn't this their fault in the end? Shouldn't they be able to accommodate for their mistake? They did not even do anything or try to do anything about it.

5.0,12/12/2018,"I had to come on here and extend a nod to Ristorante Mornini for their incredible service and professionalism.I had a meeting at the Guggenheim and wanted to grab some delicious food nearby with my friend- and her four year old, spunky daughter. The upper east side has a vibe, and if you're from NY you'll know what I mean. This has the energy of a beautiful high-end restaurant and I was so pleasantly surprised to see that the beauty of this restaurant was not accompanied by any sense of ego. The hostess, and waiters we met were so genuinely accommodating, kind, and professional and made no fuss about one of my guests being a child, even at a restaurant of this caliber. I also personally have dietary restrictions and was so pleased to find that they offer both vegetarian and vegan options. Their waiter was so well trained and educated on what their options were for dietary restrictions and made me feel like a treasured guest, not a problem. The food was delightful- I got a platter of roasted veggies and my guest got salmon. They even had a children's menu- and I was just so shocked by the incredible way they accommodated the child, offering a high chair and the children's menu, anything they could to make our experience more pleasurable and enjoyable. We didn't feel rushed out, and enjoyed our meal and our time here immensely. Though next time my friend and I will prob return sans kids, I have to give credit where credits due and say that this place handled having a child as a guest with class and effortlessness that did not go unnoticed.Cheers to great service!",2,0,1,Gina F.,"Port Jefferson, NY",970,55,44

4.0,11/18/2018,"If you're eating at Morini, definitely do the $12 pasta special!Every Sunday through Thursday after 8:30 PM, half their pastas, which I believe comes out to about seven options, are only $12, and that includes any add-ons that would normally be extra. Additionally, you can even make a reservation, which I suggest doing as we waited 35minutes on a Wednesday night. I would highly recommend the basil and ricotta tortellini and the clam linguine was delicious as well. I personally wouldn't order the pasta bolognese again, but I'm also not the biggest fan of ground beef.

All tasted absolutely delicious! My favorite was the tortellini and I highly recommend definitely trying this one. The spaghetti had so many clams in it, every bite had a piece. Also the red sauce tasted great and I like that the pasta wasn't swimming in it but was just nicely complemented by the sauce.  The service was great, our waiter was attentive and friendly.

5.0,10/22/2018,"So the first time we went to this restaurant it was for dinner and my girlfriends birthday which she put in the reservation as well as requesting not to be sat near the host stand or bathroom. There service was great, decor is nice especially the bar/lounge. The food was spectacular but they sat us near the server station where we could hear all the conversations between the servers/food runners/bussers and they forgot a candle for the dessert. I didn't think anything of it because the food and wine is so amazing. I guess she responded to an email asking about her experience and she was asked to come back by the manager. We got the four course meal where you get to choose an appetizer, a pasta, an entree and a dessert for $78 which we probably should have done the first time because it's by far the best deal, very reasonable for what you get. I ordered the yellowtail carpaccio, English pea risotto, filet mignon and chocolate fondant. I was shocked to receive a checkbook with nothing in it.

5.0,8/23/2018,"The late night $12 pasta at Ristorante Morini is one of the upper east side's best kept secrets. This offer is available after 8:30 p.m. Sunday-Thursday. Do yourself a favor and check it out. Ordered:Tortelloni (usually $25 but $12 tonight)- these little pasta pockets are filled with creamy ricotta and fragrant basil. They can be served with a pomodoro sauce or my favorite, a parmigiano cream sauce. I ordered the latter. Ristorante Morini serves the tortelloni with chopped red, yellow and green cherry tomatoes and a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese. It is delicious. Tagliatelle Bolognese (usually $29 but $12 tonight)- the pasta is cooked al dente and served with a hearty meat sauce. It isn't a heavy tomato sauce, instead the meat is the star of the show. The carrots, onions and celery in the sauce had a nice crunch to them still. Budino ($13)- a smooth milk chocolate pudding topped with two little brownie bites, crunchy chocolate balls, a sweet and salty pretzel crumble, and a small scoop of ice cream. Our waiter was kind enough to let us sample the toasted marshmallow ice cream instead of the vanilla that was recommended on the menu. The budino was decadent. The service at Ristorante Morini is very good. They refill your water glass whenever it is running low and come to check on you often, however, I asked twice for some lemon for my water and it never arrived.

It's fairly expensive, but if you go after 8:30 PM on a weeknight then you can get most of their pastas for only $12. My main issue with the restaurant is it's slightly too high-end and expensive for most people to visit other than on a special occasion or for a nice dinner date, and for restaurants at that price point there are better options in Manhattan. If you would like to stay on the Upper East Side, then Morini is one the best upscale restaurants, but there are plenty of others around the city that have slightly better food at the same price point.",0,0,0,Simon H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0

The service was also professional but a bit scattered and aloof.  What I mean by that is simple things like our server was pleasant but disengaged, competent, but not attentive.  Examples, we had to ask several times for coffee, from our server and others before we actually got coffee.  Menus were placed but not described and when dessert was served, they actually forgot one dessert.  Several times, servers were seen ""hanging out""  instead of checking on customers, asking about their meals or checking on the table.  Not egregious, but just something to adjust.",0,0,0,K E.,"New York, NY",0,50,0

Our server seemed as though she wanted as little to do with us as possible, stopping by our table only when she had to- we had to ask for bread for the table, and even then, we had to ask twice. She then took our wine bottle away when there was still an entire glass worth's left in it. We asked her to bring it back from whence she took it, and though she did, she didn't apologize.

3.0,7/3/2018,"Brunch reviewI will start off by saying that the service I received was terrible and therefore the 3-star review. I have an expectation at an Altamarea restaurant and this was far from it. The waitress had to take care of all the tables, which is about 8 or 10. I can see her running around a lot and was really busy so I gave her the benefit of the doubt in the beginning. Not only did she not smile the entire time, she was curt and has an impatient flair when she was taking our order.  We then asked her to take a picture for us. She ignored us after saying she'll be back. After 10 minutes, one of the servers came by and asked to take our picture. I was done by then. I understand she's busy but she could just say I'll get you someone instead of ignoring guests. I think my issue with her was her over-enthusiam when a guest friend walks in. I have nothing against someone being extra friendly for their friends but I didn't even get 20% of what she showed. She seemed competent and experienced but it does not justify her service, or the lack of. Otherwise, the brunch menu was great. It has a nice variety including a lunch menu that l am sure many non-brunch believers will enjoy. I went for the Morini Special since it has the best selection for a very reasonable price.

Their meatball appetizer is also a winning choice. They have a wonderful wine selection to choose from.Only downside is that it took FOREVER.

4.0,5/21/2018,"Such a different experience from the 1 or 2 stars. I am already very familiar with Osteria Morini and Ristorante Morini has a similar late night pasta deal Mon - Thurs.Reservations were made a month ahead but I need not have bothered. I was able to switch a reservation 3 days before and didn't have problems finding availability. Ambiance is lovely - not stuffy, just classy and modern. Noise level was acceptable and they play soft generic music that fades into the background.Love the service - prompt and attentive. Since we were there for the pasta special, we got 4 out of the 6 pastas- Agnolotti : veal ravoli with mushrooms and fava beans. This was the favorite of the table. The sauce might have had high quality balsamic vinegar as part of the sauce. Amazing - it made a deeper impression on me than the fusili at Marea. - Tagliatte with bolognese sauce: This is not the red sauce bolognese that you get everywhere. This is the real stuff where apparently you start with very little tomato/tomato paste and cook it down to a meat sauce where the sauce just coats the meat. Tried to produce it at home but was never successful. Noodles were perfect - soft, smooth and oily with the perfect bite. If you are a huge Chinese noodle fan, think of your classic wide wonton noodles elevated because this was made fresh that day. - Spaghetti bianco with clams: Nothing earth shattering, just a classic done well. Great spaghetti noodles, garlic and clams.- Fusilli with pork ragu and pecorino fonduta. Very salty. The pasta was great but flavors were very strong and it was aggressively salty. If you prefer bolder flavors, you will love this dish. Dessert was tiramisu and affogoto. Their version of tiramisu was a bit too sanitized for me. I love the heavy cocoa and cream in the traditional version. Affogoto was great but it's hard to mess that up. 1) We did have to wait 10 mins even though we had reservations, 2) when we sat down, initial service was a little weird, menus placed and waiter left immediately, no mention of any specials and 3) we did experience a short lull in water service. All these could be due to how busy the restaurant was that night - full restaurant ! Once we placed our order, service was always fast and attentive.

We had a reservation, but the place wasn't too crowded as there were several available tables when we were seated.After perusing the menu a bit, I decided to go with the 4-course prix fixe menu and my friend ordered a couple a la carte to split.Shishito peppers (3.5 stars): Your standard shishito peppers, though it is quite a large portion.Scallops (4 stars): This dish came with 4 of the smaller scallops and they were cooked well. I enjoyed the fresh pear and pancetta as well.Orecchiette (4 stars): This dish was really good--though it was definitely a small portion--much smaller than my friend's a la carte pasta dish.Tagliatelle (4.5 stars): This was one of the best dishes of the night as the pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was super flavorful.Arctic char (4 stars): The fish was cooked perfectly and was a healthy portion as well. The one gripe I have about this dish is that the leeks were definitely undercooked as they were quite tough to eat--almost inedible.Budino (4.5 stars): We finished the meal with this dessert--and though small, it packed a ton of different textures and flavors that made for a tasty ending of the meal.Overall, this place serves up some great food. This is definitely not a cheap night out, but the service and quality of food was apparent. A bit too stuffy, UES for my liking, but a good spot nonetheless.",2,0,1,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",746,1843,225
3.0,2/24/2018,"Spent a lot of time trying to figure out what was the right restaurant for Valentine's Day. As many are aware, in New York City the trouble with Valentine's Day, Christmas, and New Year's is that practically every halfway decent restaurant jacks up their prices on a ""special"" prefix with very limited flexibility. After a bunch of research I found Ristorante Morini as one of the sister restaurant of Marea (which we absolutely love). When you walk in, the restaurant is split in two: the first floor is a casual dining setting - great for a date night or drinks and food at the bar - while for the more typical dining experience you are escorted upstairs in the elevator to the more formal dining area. Once being seated, we got a cocktail and a glass of sparkling rose before deciding to move onto a bottle of wine. While looking over the menu, the sommelier came over to offer her help selecting a wine, which was very welcomed! She was extremely helpful in suggesting wines that were not only within our price range but that also fulfilled our half assed description of what we were looking for. We ended up with an awesome white that paired very nicely with our dishes of choice. First we both started with the burrata (if this isn't a running trend in the restaurants I go to, I don't know what is). The burrata was good and paired nicely with the bread basket. We then moved on to the pasta: we ordered the truffle butter tagliatelle and the lobster risotto. It was a mistake on our part not to have added the black truffles to the tagliatelle, given that we felt any hint of truffle was missing from the dish, which was a little disappointing. Nonetheless, the lobster risotto was solid. For our main course, we had the char and the black bass. The black bass was a little gamey and the sauce was somewhat overpowering by the end of the dish. The char was cooked perfectly but lacked the flavor we've had at other restaurants. That being said, I still would highly recommend it because it was cooked perfectly and remained extremely delicate.Dessert was fantastic. We paired a semifreddo and a panna cotta with a glass of moscato each. The semifreddo was absolutely divine, the mousse was a perfect consistency and the flavors came together so well. The panna cotta was different to what you normally get as it was topped with a strawberry Prosecco granita which was an awesome combination.Overall, while we really enjoyed our evening, and were very impressed with the service, we found the food to be mediocre when compared to the high standards at sister restaurant Marea. Would be interested to go back and give the more casual dining a chance, given that we've heard such great things.Rich and Sophie",0,0,0,Richard J.,"Manhattan, NY",157,24,35
3.0,2/21/2018,"The restaurant falls somewhere between 3 and 4 stars.  So much potential but it misses the mark a bit.  I really wanted to love this place since i'm always on the lookout for standout UES dining.  We came here last night to celebrate a birthday (we were a party of 4).  The location, the restaurant space and the staff were all great.  Price point was fair.  Shoutout to the sommelier who was absolutely delightful and helped us pick a wonderful red wine to pair with our food.Between the four of us, we ordered a bunch of food (we love to try everything on a menu).  We ordered 4 appetizers, 1 entree to share, 4 dinner-size pasta dishes and 4 fish entrees.  While all the food was prepared well, overall it was a bit boring and uninspired.  My burrata appetizer was just fine - the burrata itself lacked flavor.  The tonno appetizer was also just ok (fish was fresh but the dish boring). The salads were yummy.  The pastas while all cooked well, lacked the YUM factor you want with a savory course. 3 of us had ordered the snapper, but the waiter came back after we placed our order to let us know that the kitchen only had two snappers left.  We changed one of them for another fish but he then came back again apologetically and let us know that they only now had one snapper remaining.  All the fish was fresh but the snapper was certainly the standout.

We had a reservation and were greeted by a hostess throwing down a bar menu and say this is all we have now.  When I was give a chance to speak and explained we have a reservation she huffed off and returned several minutes later to seat us upstairs.

My fiancé and I arrived full of anticipation at this chic upper east side eatery.We ordered the burrata, pasta, and veal Milanese.  The burrata was watery, and we sent it back to the kitchen, it returned again, the same way - we didn't eat it but were still charged for it.  The pasta bolognese was decent, and the one redeeming part of our meal.  The Veal Milanese was anything but Milanese, it was heavily breaded and covered in cream sauce and the veal tasted past its prime. The bread was served ICE cold, and they had limited bread choices for a restaurant of this supposed caliber. The service was completely inept, and had our waitress been on her toes, she would have removed the burrata from our bill since it was not edible.  The waitress was not attentive and we had to flag her down to get any type of service at all.  Also, we wanted to have Pellegrino with our meal, and they brought us house made ""sparkling"" water in a dirty container and charged us $8, then brought us another bottle and charged us another $8 when we didn't ask for another bottle. Total of $16 on non-sparkling, sparkling water.  Overall an unpleasant experience which ruined our entire dinner.

5.0,12/28/2017,"I came here with my fiancé last Thursday as a part of our ""Christmas in NYC"" day. We were visiting the tree and wanted to stay uptown so we found this gem of a restaurant to dine at. Let me begin by saying that this was one of the best meals I have eaten at a restaurant in a long time from start to finish. I ordered a gin based cocktail at the bar while we were waiting for our table, since we were a bit early. It was so fresh and cooling, with the perfect balance of sweet and gin flavors. When we moved upstairs to the main dining area, our waitress brought us to the elevator and then proceeded to meet us upstairs as she took the stairs. I must say, impeccable service. At the table, I ordered a glass of wine and my fiancé ordered a gin and tonic. The drinks came fairly quickly. We got their homemade focaccia for the table as we perused the menu. My fiancé is vegetarian and picky, but I love to try new things and I couldn't decide if I wanted a pasta or an entree. Luckily, they have this amazing deal for a 4 course tasting menu for $75 that includes an appetizer, pasta, entree, and dessert. So I ordered the burrata to start, which seemed to be a full size so we shared it. I got the lobster pasta as my second course, followed by the veal Milanese and the chocolate mousse dessert. My fiancé ordered the spinach and ricotta filled pasta for his main course and we shared a side of crispy potatoes. The potatoes were amazing and had the perfect crisp and burrata was nice and creamy and a perfect complement to the focaccia. Our pastas were dough filled pillows cooked to perfection. My veal was incredible and had the perfect amount of breading balanced by the mushroom sauce. The dessert was chocolatey and creamy and everything you would expect in a perfect sweet ending to your meal. The tasting menu brought me full size portions of each course, which is an extremely generous serving. I could not finish everything as it was a lot of food but I was happy for the opportunity to get to try exactly what I wanted.

1.0,7/25/2017,"Easily the worst restaurant I've been to in New York -- and I didn't even taste the food.I live a few blocks away from Ristorante Morini and tried it for the first time today with a friend.When we walked in, the hosts at the stand seemed very preoccuped getting guests up to their second floor dining space. I stood around for a few minutes before they even said hello to me. We took a table outside on the sidewalk -- no menus, nothing. 15 minutes pass, and I finally walk in to get menus. It's possible I even got the menu from the manager -- I don't know, but it was a woman who was dressed differently than the servers. She did not bat an eyelash over the fact that we were seated without menus.Another 15 minutes pass. I walk in to talk to the host to ask where our waiter is. At this point, it's been nearly half an hour since we sat down and literally nobody approached us. The final straw is that a waiter comes out, half-heartedly apologizes for the delay, and takes our drink orders. He comes out and puts an empty wine glass on the table, then walks back inside. Hardly an efficient route to take -- whoever is managing the ops of this restaurant needs to be replaced.We finally just walked away from the table, as it appeared no drinks or food were forthcoming.I will never go back to this restaurant -- especially not when Grazie, an old-school Italian place, is only a block away. You know, it's an actual restaurant -- one where they want you to order drinks and food and give them money in return.The chef (Michael White?) should be absolutely appalled his name is associated with Ristorante Morini.This is, by the way, the only review I've written for a NYC restaurant in the time I've lived in the city.

Two of us ordered two courses, but the waiter didn't bring the second course until we asked (I guess waiting for the other two people to finish their one dish??). We were basically ignored during the course of our meal, but were able to order coffee after flagging down several employees (the first time, the person just ignored us!). After ordering the coffee it seemed to take about 20 minutes to arrive. They were quick to bring the bill after that, though! How can a place that charges so much have such terrible service?

5.0,6/13/2017,"Love love love this place. Highly recommend for a date spot. If you are following me, you know that I need to consume a large amount of food on a regular basis, and this doesn't seem like the place to do that. However, though I'm nervous to put this out there in fear of the deal becoming too widely known, I'll do it. Monday - Thursday, come in after 8:30 PM and the fresh pasta dishes (half of them) are just $12 (It used to be $10). I came here with two of my friends, and we ended up getting 6 dishes between us and it was way too much. However, at that price, how could you not? The pasta is so fresh and so delicious. The service is unbelievable. Our server didn't want to bring us all the pasta at once, because he didn't want it to get cold, and brought them out two dishes at a time, and brought them out in order from lightest to heaviest so we wouldn't get too full. How considerate and thoughtful of him! Honestly they were all to die for. My favorites were the veal ravioli and the pork shoulder ragu, but they were all really really good. On top of that, they have a late night wine happy hour ($6 a glass, $25 a half bottle). How can you argue with that. If you can hold off on dinner until then, definitely would recommend coming into this place. Personally, I would not be able to afford the dishes at regular price, but if I could, I would definitely pay that much for their food.",2,0,1,Kenneth E.,"Manhattan, NY",354,280,368

4.0,5/23/2017,"KenScale: 8.0/10After my wife Jun and I moved to downtown in the Financial District area, it has become harder and harder for us to come all the way up to Upper East Side, where we used to visit from time to time primarily for museum visits. Upper East Side also doesn't have the same depth of restaurants that other neighborhoods in NYC have, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy my meal at any of the places here. In particular, when I visited Ristorante Morini led by acclaimed chef Michael White about three years ago, I thought there was understated sophistication in the food here that stood out on its own in chef White's growing Alta Marea Group empire. When a friend of Jun visited from out of town and wanted to check out this place, I figured this was a great opportunity to see how the restaurant has evolved. Not all dishes worked to great effect, but we found a lot of dishes to like, especially in the pasta section.The menu at Ristorante Morini consists of broadly pan-Italian dishes. Unlike Marea where the crudos, pastas and seafood dishes are the highlights, Morini's menu is broader. We ended up sharing two dishes each from appetizer, pasta and main dish sections. While Alta Marea Group's restaurants have generally been very good at crudo dishes, the bigeye tuna tartare with trout roe and crispy shallots surprisingly felt not that fresh. On the other hand, chilled Maine lobster with shaved asparagus salad was quite delicious, especially with basil pesto underneath that gave something extra to the dish. As with all other Michael White restaurants, the pastas are the stars at Morini. I was somewhat worried that the spaghetti with clams would come out over-seasoned but actually the flavor was quite nicely balanced to give a rustic touch to the dish. Fusilli at Marea is probably the best pasta dish I've ever tasted in my life, but the one at Morini wasn't far behind either. I absolutely loved the firm texture of the corkscrew shaped noodle and the richness of Neapolitan pork shoulder ragu was quite memorable. If I could eat this pasta every week, I would most certainly be glad to do so! For the main dishes, Jun and I both liked the branzino accompanied by salsa romesco. The grilled sea bass's flavor was not overly salty so that the expertly cooked fish worked well with the salsa without overpowering our palate. On the other hand, I felt the roasted chicken with fingerling potatoes and red peppers could've toned down a bit on seasoning and the overall meat was somewhat uneven in the level of tenderness. On my last visit to Morini, I've had a remarkable pine nut tart dessert, but this time the desserts we ordered came down to earth a little bit. Tiramisu was moist without too much sweetness, but I've certainly had better tiramisu elsewhere. Bomboloni with honey ricotta and strawberry jam was also serviceable, but it was a predictably delicious dish.Getting a reservation at Morini wasn't too difficult but the dining space quickly became packed mostly with grown-up locals from Upper East Side area. There is an extensive Italian-centric wine selection as well as some solid cocktail offerings. Morini is not the crown jewel of Alta Marea Group but it is still a dependable restaurant, especially if you focus your meal on one or more pastas here.",6,1,2,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738

4.0,5/13/2017,Came here for the $10 pasta deal on a Thursday night (you can take advantage of this Mon - Thursday after 8:30pm) and ordered the tagliatelle. The tagliatelle is amazing and you absolutely must order that if you come here. They also have wine specials (I believe it was only $6 a glass for house wines) in addition to the $10 pastas. The portions are on the smaller side for Italian but it's the perfect amount for not feeling like you're going to explode. Overall not a bad deal for an otherwise expensive restaurant. We sat downstairs (there's a coat check downstairs which was a nice touch) and it was pretty full for a random Thursday. The crowd is a bit older but that is expected for the area.

3.0,4/9/2017,"The food was good, but we were not very happy with the service. First of all i had a giltcity however i invited 4 other people and asked given the fact that the majority of people were regular paying customers to get a table upstairs, but i was told that was not possible. I thought this was odd i mean here I am first time customer plus 4 other people and u cant make an adjustment, rules are made by people and if you are a business that puts customers on first place you make that small adjustment. Secondly minutes after we sit down a waiter broke a glass behind us having a rather big piece of glass fly right by the head of one of the people at our table. the glass touched his head but didnt hurt him. We just went on with our evening and didnt let this incident make our dining experience any less than what we expected. However yet another event took place that we didnt like, we ordered drinks and one of the drinks was taken away while the person at our table still had enough in  the glass for another sip or two. We kindly told the waiter about it and asked for a replacement. Again we didnt make a big deal out of it we just asked for another drink. Now while these were minor inconveniences nonetheless when you own a restaurant in NYC you do cater to the customer and what I personally thought showed otherwise was when we received the bill and noticed that not even the replacement drink was included free. We are not customers to make a big deal and we didnt make a big deal for the flying glass, drink taken away, but you would think that they would show some consideration for all of this and give you a desert or drink on the house. We paid the bill politely, and proceeded to exit the restaurant with the final thoughts of not returning or recommending it to other people. As a NYC restaurant I'dd say you need to be competitive and show you value your customer, i didnt feel that the small inconveniences have been addressed properly.",1,1,0,Giagia P.,"BAYSIDE, NY",33,30,2

5.0,3/26/2017,"This place is the real deal. Came with a group of 5 for brunch and was really blown away.The brunch menu was somewhat limited if you're not looking for breakfast, however I decided on the tuna tartare then he tagliatelle bolognese. The tuna was very good. A little less flavorful than I've had in the past. Could be a lack of soy or other flavors which I'm more used to. Very good nonetheless. Others had the cheese platter and butternut squash soup - good reviews all around.Now the tagliatelle - I think this was one of the top 2 or 3 pasta dishes I've ever had. The sauce was thick and seemed to have a heavy wine or similar component. Unreal. I couldn't stop eating it dispirited being completely full. For dessert we split the donuts. By this point I was beyond full but they were so good I'd have to say they're a must have here.Service was great and the experience was phenomenal overall. Only complaint would be the wine by the glass had few options priced reasonably. For someone less into wine, paying 35 for a glass of Chardonnay isn't ideal. However, they do have some under 20 options so not a big deal either way.Cannot wait to go back.",1,0,0,Mike N.,"New York, NY",144,283,75

This was the first Michael White restaurant that I went to, and I can't wait to try another of his amazing restaurants. After lunch I had a few drinks at the bar and met a wonderful bartender, I think her name was Samantha. She knew everything about the drinks and what was even more impressive was that she knew about all of the ingredients in the food that I had for lunch.

1.0,3/20/2017,"We arrived promptly at 6 p.m. and we began the experience with table games . First, they tried to seat us directly across from the kitchen. Then, the hostess tried to move us next to the restrooms. Finally, she ""checked"" to see if a table I suggested was available and, magic, we were seated. Keep in mind, this was after having requested a corner table. As far as the food is concerned, the focaccia was the only part of the meal that was delicious. Don't be deceived by the seemingly interesting combination of ingredients in the kale salad, because it was terrible. It was rough kale, that reminded me more like the bitter herbs. It lacked any taste. The burrata was fresh, but measured the size of a silver dollar. The red snapper was also fresh, tasteless and tiny. The salmon my son ordered off the children's menu was a bigger portion than the adult portion of fish. Finally, the tagliatelle bolognese was missing one key ingredient, the bolognese sauce. It was a bowl of pasta that resembled the color of a bolognese sauce without any substance or meat sauce. The service was ok. Nothing special for a restaurant of this supposed caliber. The dinner lacked substance indeed, but the bill was in fact quite substantial which would be completely fine IF the meal that accompanied it was anything to write home about.",1,2,0,Andrea G.,"New York, NY",0,36,0

We tried the steak and eggs as well as the beef hash with polenta and both dishes were superb. The steak was excellent and cooked perfectly and my dish was well seasoned and delicious as well.

I liked the portion sizes--not tasting menu sizes but not family style sizes. Just the right size! and the service was impeccable--attentive but not overbearing. For drinks, we each got a drink called the Madison (I think) and we ordered seconds. Smooth and flavorful. For dessert, the chocolate cake was INCREDIBLE and moist and the panna cotta was spot on.

1.0,9/20/2016,"I really thought when I opened the delivery bag that a joke was being played on me.  Tonight I ordered the Cavatelli, which was supposed to be with braised short-ribs. There were two containers in the bag: one medium-sized one full of greasy bread,  and a smaller one with my entrée in it. I took pictures (below) because I didn't think people would believe what I'm about to describe.   The pasta dish was extremely dissapointing. For starters, my food was in a typical side-dish container,  and while I ordered the ""half"" sized portion, I paid a very ""full"" price of $22. I went out to dinner over the weekend at Grazie and had a braised short-rib meal, which was easily 4 times larger,  didn't have oil dripping all over it, and only  cost $4 more. The quality difference was like night and day.  Finally,  to add insult to injury, there was ONE piece of meat in the whole container. So I basically paid $22 for a tiny bowl of oily pasta. Living in NYC there are so many great food options, and unfortunately,  it's hard to tell which are better than others without trying them out and paying the price. I would very much not recommend dining here.",8,1,1,Becky L.,"Manhattan, NY",1,16,9
5.0,9/17/2016,"Loved this place every time I came here. One time, I made a reservation at 6:30, but ended up showing up at 7:00 and they were ok with it and still gave us the table - though they did mention they needed the table back by 8:30, but dinner went until around 8:50 and it was completely alright! My granny came with on an excursion to this restaurant, and the waitress led us to a nice elevator so she wouldn't have to take the stairs. The prices here aren't excessive for what you get, a good atmosphere with nicely placed decor and a great meal. The tables are not situated too closely together, so that while the restaurant is bustling with noise on a Saturday evening, you can still hear everyone at your table. The waiters are friendly and accommodating, but when the restaurant is too busy, it may take a while or them to come serve you unfortunately. All three appetizers I ordered I would recommend: tonno (tuna tartare), capesante (scallops), fritto misto (calamari). The calamari was particularly good, where you could reach the squid inside and it was still soft. The crispy outside was not overly cooked or too fried, so that the skin of the calamari cooperated great with the squid. For entrees we ordered the Saturday night special, a baked maine lobster covered with breadcrumbs, the tagliata (steak w/ bone marrow), ippoglosso (halibut), tortelli (lobster ravioli w/ black pasta),  and spaghetti rosso (w/ red sauce). The tagliata steak was amazing, even though it came medium rare when we ordered rare. Sounds weird to eat steak at an italian restaurant instead of a steakhouse, but I would say it is on par with Capital Grille's steak! All on her own, my granny finished her lobster without sharing, so it must have been very good. The lobster was a pretty big meal, but it did come with plenty of breadcrumbs on top of the lobster. The ippoglosso I did not find very special, but possibly because I did not realize I was ordering fish - it was also supposed to come with a few fried oysters, but since they ran out for the night, they offered a different side dish and I chose asparagus which was pretty decent. The pasta here is very good. If you're in the mood for spaghetti, definitely go for it. I loved their lobster ravioli. The skin on the ravioli isn't too soft, that is, it doesn't taste like regular ravioli from Serafina, and it almost tastes as if it is pasta that you cooked in a pot of water but took it out before it finished defrosting. All I mean by this is that you definitely have to bite the pasta and not just swallow, but try it, because the sauce it good, the skin is different and good, and the lobster inside goes well with the sauce outside. Onto desserts, we ordered a tiramisu, torta di noci (walnut cake), and the bomboloni (donuts).You could taste the coconut on the tiramisu, but frankly it was not what I wanted or expected. The tiramisu looked too organized, and the cream was good, but didn't go with the rest of the cake. The walnut cake tasted like a sponge cake that was walnut flavored. They came in the shape of cubes, and the gelato it came with paired nicely, with some actual walnuts on the sides of the cake as well. The donuts were very good, particularly the jam. Jam tasted homemade, which is always very good. Donuts are good after every meal, especially if they taste yummy, so that would be my go to dessert here instead of the tiramisu, regardless of the entree ordered.",1,0,0,Ivy H.,"Flushing, NY",219,21,25

The room was barely half full! When we asked if we could just sit down at one of the numerous empty tables, she rudely told us ""We have one more reservation coming in,"" to which I responded ""But there are at least 8 empty tables."" She then repeated for us to go downstairs and wait for her to set up a table (Twilight Zone, anyone?). After complaining to the man downstairs about the way we were treated, he told us to go back upstairs, but we'd had enough and left.

4.0,8/6/2016,"** Summer 2016 Restaurant Week Review ** Ristorante Morini has been on my Restaurant Week list for a while - but like all other Altamarea restaurants, they only offer lunch so I would definitely need to wait for a summer Friday to go. Their Restaurant Week menu offers 3 options for both appetizers and entrees and 2 options for dessert. There is also a nice selection of wine pairings by the glass available for a $10 supplement.For our appetizers, we both opted for the Quaglia, or grilled quail with creamy farro and radish and a drizzle of aged balsamic vinegar.  I quite enjoyed my appetizer - the quail was tender and juicy. The farro was creamy and soaked up the flavors of the balsamic vinegar and quail very well.For my entrée, I opted to go for the Pork Lion, which features slow-roasted pork loin with a summer peach marmalade and pancetta. I am a sucker for anything with summer peaches so I was instantly drawn in. The pork lion was cooked thoroughly but not tough at all. The peach marmalade and pancetta paired really well together since it was sweet and salty at the same time with each bite.For dessert, we both decided on the Tiramisu, which was presented in a slice of layers of lady fingers soaked in amaretto and espresso and topped with marscapone mousse. The tiramisu was phenomenal - slightly sweet but mostly bitter and fragrant from the espresso. I wish there was more!",1,0,1,Michelle T.,"New York, NY",367,1165,1125
2.0,8/5/2016,"Service // Food // Atmosphere// ServiceI came here on a whim, craving the type of Italian food ""only found in New York or Italy,"" with a group of six friends. Fortunately, one of these friends works for Bullfrog + Baum, so she recommended Michael White's new restaurant, Ristorante Morini. Unfortunately, we are all ""young professionals"" so we apparently didn't deserve good service. I've never had a more condescending waiter. When it was apparent we were going to order primarily from their $10 ""after-hours menu,"" his mood immediately soured. He intimated that we wouldn't be able to afford the full menu, even going so far as to directly accuse one of my female friends of ""not being able to afford her own dessert"" because she requested an extra plate to try someone else's plate. I've worked as a server before, as had most of our group, and I've NEVER seen a waiter just casually insult an entire table over and over again. The best part is, we still ended up tipping the waiter over 20% (having also purchased two bottles of wine and desserts - so he definitely got a good tip off of us). // FoodIt's delicious. If the service tips the scale one way on the balance beam, the food definitely carries attempts to carry its weight on the other. The agnolotti does a great job of balancing veal with maitake mushroom, with neither flavor overpowering the other. Seafood gives me a fun ride to the ER (if I eat enough of it, it's a one way ticket) so I can't tell you much about the other dishes other than everyone stopped talking for a good six to eight minutes (which usually means A++).The dessert was also exemplary, but I find it hard to distinguish between good and great tiramisu. The flavors were light and crisp, and the dessert held its structure; that's about all you can do as far as I'm concerned.// AtmosphereThis restaurant embodies the Italian ideal as far as decor goes. Very classy and elegant, with ornate embellishments everywhere. You certainly feel like you are eating at a fine dining restaurant, and except for our server, everyone else seemed to be very much enjoying their meals. We ran into a friend who did not have the same problem we had - so I very much think this was a ""just this server"" kind of thing.// Final NoteDavid Hirsch, the General Manager of the restaurant did reach out to us after we complained (normally not one to do this but after hearing complaints about this place for three weeks I went ahead and bit the bullet) and offered to oversee the reservation in order to ensure that we had a proper experience. We very much appreciated his efforts, although most of my friends refused to ever go back... so we did not take him up on his offer.

I've been looking forward to coming here for some time, but needed a special occasion (in this case my birthday dinner!!)  The vibe of Morini is really pretty swanky and modern. It's open and spacious and the tables are comfortable spaced out (what a treat in NYC!) The restaurant is 2 floors, with most of the dining on the large 2nd floor. The ambiance makes you feel like you're in for a treat, as does the staff. I was really blown away by the wait staff here; from the busboys clearing plates and filling water, to cleaning up crumbs in between courses (I love that, wish they did it at more places!) The wine sommelier was also by our side when we were perusing and selecting a vino from their vast (and pricey) wine list! After perusing the menu, my boyfriend and I opted for the special Sunday Supper menu. I figured it would be a great way to try more menu items, at a pretty fair price! It's a set menu, which came with 3 appetizers, 2 entrees and a dessert to share. No thinking involved. I'm not sure if it changes weekly, or stays the same week-to-week. Either way we were in for a treat! We had the Romana Salad (basic but great dressing!), Fritto Misto (fresh and delicious, and the zucchini was lightly fried to perfection. The lemon aioli was bomb, Burrata (enough said.) just to start! Our entrees were a pasta dish, Rigatoni Carbonara, which was in a light crèma sauce and was delicious, and the Chef's mixed grilled meats which included chicken, steak & lamb! So many meats!

1.0,2/14/2016,Do not go. This is probably the worst experience at a restaurant we had ever after 40 years  in New York. We had an 11:30 reservation on Valentine Day  and arrived 12 minutes early. The temperature outside was 2 degrees Fahrenheit/minus 18 degrees Celsius. The door of the restaurant was closed and the restaurant workers saw us as we knocked at the window several time to let us in. Nobody came to open and let us in ever after knocking many times over. It was horribly cold and nobody cared. This was truly cruel treatment and dangerous to potential customers. When they finally opened there was insufficient insight as to what happened.We cancelled and had a wonderful brunch across the street.,9,2,0,Nathan G.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",0,13,0

Highlights were:- spaghetti with clams in white sauce - flavorful with a hint of lemon- fusilli with pork ragu and pecorino - great texture and taste- garganelli in bolognese sauce - very hearty I would pass on the paccheri next time - the dark pasta was stuffed with olive, and the lamb was a little tough. Overall the whole table agreed that the olive and lamb were a strange combo. The agnolotti was substantial and satisfying but not a standout to me.

For bang for your buck at an Altamarea restaurant, Osteria Morini is still better.Had dinner with my parents while they were visiting New York. Stars for service, which was attentive and speedy. Cocktails were straightforward enough, and at $15, Manhattan-ly overpriced but not as totally egregious as they could've made them. Which is kind of damning them with faint praise, I suppose.Stars for food, not as much; the polipo/octopus appetizer was lovely, though the flavors were pretty simple, but my father's eggplant parmigiana entree, the single vegetarian option for someone who didn't want to eat pasta (the menu on this Yelp profile, by the way, is obsolete), was a wash-- the eggplant was undercooked but the breading was soggy and clumping. The swiss chard under my arctic char was gritty, as if it hadn't been washed properly-- felt like I was chewing sand at one point-- but the fish itself was cooked well, as was my mother's branzino. Complimentary amuse bouche of some sort of truffle cream on slightly stale crisps of some kind was nice, but not impressive; complimentary chocolate hazelnut almond dessert, possibly a panforte, was quite good and a pleasant surprise.

Right from the beginning you could tell this was going to be a good place...their bread is sooo delicious!!! It's focaccia I believe? So good though. For appetizers, it came with burrata, fritto misto and a salad. We also ordered the foie gras as an additional app. Everything was so delicious. I don't even like foie gras or burrata, but i happily ate them all. The fritto misto was possibly the best fried calamari I've ever had.For entrees it was the mixed grill and a ravioli with truffle oil. The pasta was so good, I can't really remember the meats very well. Not to say the meats weren't also good. My husband devoured them (included steak, lamb and chicken) and I ate a lot of them too, but that ravioli was to die for.For dessert we got a couple extra including the torta di cioccolata and the cinnamon donuts. Even though I was so stuffed I couldn't move, the desserts were gone in seconds. Everything here is fantastic including the service.

I thoroughly enjoyed all four of my courses. The appetizer, was one of my favorites- the lobster was juicy and fresh. The desert, a small cake with a thin piece of toffee was also excellent- sweet and flavorful.The service for the price was exceptional. The waiter provided a new set of utensils for all 4 courses, and refilled my drink very frequently. He described the food in detail, and elaborated on each ingredient.

The risotto was cooked perfectly and wasn't dry. The only thing was that there was hardly any seafood. I expected more seafood relative to the price.TORTELLI (lobster ravioli): This dish blew me away. I've never had lobster ravioli that I've actually enjoyed.

I mean I love salt in my food but that dish was something else. The last drop was that after eating our meal we had to wait 30 minutes for desert!!!!

The setting is very elegant with the restaurant on a separate floor from the bar and an elevator to take you to the second floor. The tables are well spaced out so you don't have to strain to hear your party over the sounds of other conversations.About the food. We did the price fix. Half of us (me included) ordered the beef carpaccio for the first course and the other half ordered the warm mushroom soup. The portion sizes were ample and the food was very well prepared and flavored. For my main course, I ordered the lobster capresse salad. I've never had lobster with cheese before but I loved it, particularly the dressing - a vinaigrette with a lemon zest. And they were not stingy with the lobster. My fellow diners ordered pasta dishes and all seemed to enjoy their dish. The presentation of everything was almost too pretty to eat!Finally, for dessert, I had a combination of gelato and sorbet. This was my least favorite course, but probably because I don't have much of a sweet tooth and was full from the main course. My client did find a piece of something foreign in her gelato which was a bit disturbing but when we told they waitress, the manager came up and apologized profusely and promised they would look into it. It wouldn't prevent me from coming back.  Great place for a business lunch or dinner or a girls' brunch/lunch/dinner.",4,1,1,Meri S.,"New York, NY",50,137,0

4.0,8/13/2014,"I'm a big Michael White fan, so I was excited when I found out that he'd be opening a restaurant on the Upper East Side, where I just moved a month ago. I chose Ristorante Morini for my birthday dinner last night, and was not disappointed. We were seated on the second floor of the restaurant, which is expansive. There is a more casual bar downstairs, where I one day hope to go sit for appetizers and wine. The decor is upscale modern, in the same vibe as Marea. There are even nods to Marea, right down to the oceanic striations in the ladies room.My husband and I chose to do the 4-course tasting menu, which at $84 is a pretty good value compared to other fine dining restaurants in the city. The approachable sommelier listened eagerly to our likes and dislikes (white burgundies are good, Sauv Blancs are bad), worked within our price range, and helped us select a light Italian wine that paired beautifully with our forthcoming seafood courses.Ristorante Morini does feature a lot of seafood, much to my delight. I started with the terrine, and my husband chose the octopus. The terrine was perfectly creamy and nutty, with citric accents and lightly toasted bread. I had a bite of my husband's octopus, which was very smoky and well-cooked, but definitely over-salted.The next course is always my favorite: the pasta course! I saw the casoncelli during the day on instagram: homemade ravioli filled with salt cod, then garnished with fried leeks and trout roe. This is the first time I chose a dish based on instagram, but I should seriously consider doing it more often. This pasta was amazing! All the elements balanced perfectly together, and I think this is a must-order.For my main course, I chose the halibut, which came with tiny clams, corn, garlic scapes, and black pepper gnudi. Definitely a local seasonal dish. I looooved it. The halibut was cooked perfectly, and very juicy. The additional elements brought it all together. I really loved the herb breadcrumbs on top of the fish; it reminded me of clams casino, a personal childhood favorite, and I mean that in the best possible way.The meal timing and service was flawless, but my only complaint was that the A/C was just blasting throughout the meal. I even switched from my cushy bench seat to the chair just to escape the frosty gusts. I saw several other women shivering, and even though we all complained to the servers, it's a true design flaw that needs to be worked out.",3,0,0,Meghan A.,"New York, NY",235,593,533

WEll, we did. We ordered the large portions of the pasta dish and literally can't remember which one but it was filled with a marscapone cheese. Not only was the portion ridiculously small but it was just ok. Nothing special at all and certainly not worth the $50.00 we spent for a handful of tortellini, that was watery, tasteless and too al dente.. And really, one piece of bread is all you get.

3.0,6/30/2014,"OK,  so here we are going to the upper east side  from Gramercy Park to have a nice meal with  our friends who have been wanting to try this new restaurant .We get seated in front of the kitchen , which to begin with is hard to believe that anybody who lives in the upper east side would ever sit in front of the kitchen listening and watching the doors go bing and bang every two seconds.We asked the very nice waitress to please change our seats. After 10 min , and what seems to be a big deal with a 90 percent  empty restaurant , we finally were moved to the other side of the restaurant . The restaurant was also freezing cold, we felt like we were in the North Pole. We asked them to lower the AC and the patron at the table next to us said that she asked as well and was not accommodated. Then we waited another 20 minutes to order some drinks which came another 20 minutes later. instead of  getting a vodka martini with olives that we ordered  we go it with a twist... come on!!!! My husband tasted the martini and realized right away that they had just removed the twist and thrown in the 3 olives. We were so tired of waiting that we did not bother to complain about the drink as we did not want to wait for a replacement drink.No bread still and feeling not too happy, we had to constantly  ask for someone to come and serve us..The food was good but not served hot. But as far as I am concerned the art of dining  is all about the service ... this restaurant better learn that now, as this is NYC and there are lots of great people and great restaurant.

The deserts were elaborate, but not what you would call delicious. The service was outstanding. I should add that for me, music adds a great deal to the experience, but the music playing was a sort of nondescript jazz.

Very little amount of sauce -  Bolognese was not terrible, but nothing memorable at all.  My fiance makes one a 100 times more flavorful.I guess I was expecting more.  Like the unforgettable pasta dishes I used to have at Convivio.  But back then, Michael White was probably actually cooking himself.Maybe it's better for dinner.  This was brunch.

The place lacks energy, the food is over priced, the wine list absurd,  the portions skimpy and the food was just OK. What you can get away with in Midtown with plenty of expense account customers you cannot do on the upper east side, affluent though it is. If you want to charge $30 for a pasta dish, does the portion have to be so tiny? The food cost on pasta is already incredibly low, so why add insult to injury?

The new design although formal is nice. The restaurant on the evening we were there was uncomfortably hot. The service seems very contrived, very robotic, not friendly and overall very mediocre. The portions are extremely small. One of my clients ordered the swordfish and although I didn't have my contacts in, there were two medallions in her dish which could have been mistaken from afar for scallops. The shortrib, although a rich dish, was the size of my index finger. The bistecca was ordered medium-rare and arrived medium-well. I'll excuse all of this, but not at these prices. The pastas were very good, maybe the standout. We were a party of six who managed to drink six bottles of very good wine, but left tipsy because the food was so ""precious"" and because the staff here was ""pouring and pushing' the wine.  We left feeling a little rushed and underwhelmed by the entire experience. At these prices every dish and every bite needs to be perfect and they fell short. But this is what happens when a chef becomes a brand and gains this status. Regardless of the negatives here and elsewhere, you will still not be able to get a reservation because of the success of his other restaurants.

With that being said, Ristorante Morini ran a pretty slick operation with very few hiccups - the one distraction, surprisingly, was the overly attentive service. Think, Stage Five Clinger... chalking this up to opening night jitters, I focused my attention on the food and vast spreads of beautiful people.The menu was simple but decadent (my favorite combo), with options including crude, Roman and Piedmontese-style pastas, lobster-filled calamari and a pan-roasted veal chop.  My chicken with root vegetables was perfectly cooked with just the slightest crisp of skin ($34). Don't skip the chocolate mousse for dessert (pictured above) with a delicate wafer-thin biscotto and halo of rich chocolate.  Many advertised dishes were not actually available, including the tasting menu, so I'd like to return in a couple of months for another pass...hopefully they'll play a little more hard to get and forego the five offers of 'more bread ma'am?'",6,1,2,Maggie A.,"Manhattan, NY",17,82,0

5.0,1/7/2014,"Had one of the best meals of my LIFE here last week. Wow. Still thinking about all the incredible dishes we had!My friend and I came in around 7 and sat at the bar. If you're worried about not getting a table (and you probably should since this place will be slammed in the coming months), this is the way to go. We were taken care of during the meal by one of the lovely bartenders, Justin, and couldn't have enjoyed our experience more. He never rushed us, and was always happy to answer any of our questions or recommend dishes. This is what great service is all about, and Justin went above and beyond to make sure we felt welcomed and cared for. As for the menu, don't bother checking online beforehand. It's a new place, changes are constantly being made, and we tried dishes that aren't currently listed. If you feel like experimenting (and are a little lax with your wallet), I'd suggest splitting dishes in each course. When we told the kitchen we were sharing, they brought out each of our courses already split (and beautifully so, I may add). This was wonderful, because we each got a perfect ""tasting"" portion and had room to sample more yummy dishes!We tried: ...a delicious crudo that isn't listed on the online menuInsalata InvernaleMare NostrumAgnolottiGnocchiAnd for dessert:Crostata di PereFiorentinaEach dish was better than the last. Incredibly bright and creative flavors, all perfectly balanced and beautifully presented. I love when I come to restaurants that obviously care about each and every aspect of the food, and it shines through here. Overall,  I loved my meal and experience here and I KNOW in a few months it'll be impossible to get a table. Get there soon and beat the crowds!",4,0,1,Sarah S.,"New York, NY",100,167,43
5.0,1/6/2014,"Fantastic dinning experience here on Saturday evening.  Michael White has opened another wonderful restaurant in NYC. We even had the privilege of meeting him that night. The cooking and presentation was clearly right on point.  As well as the top notch service we received.  The flavors of the dishes were so mouthwatering and unique.  The snail and the fresh foie gras/quail appetizers are a must.  The snail dish was so truly different and the flavors were just combusting in your mouth.  For entrees my table had the arctic char, the duck and the veal chop.  All were truly magnificent.  It had to be the best veal chop and duck we have had in a very long time and the arctic char was cooked to perfection.  This is a true NYC gem of a restaurant and we will be back again.. We are looking forward to trying some of the pasta dishes the next time in the very inviting bar/lounge area on the first floor.  This truly is a great addition to upper east side dinning.",2,0,0,Jessica S.,"Manhattan, NY",88,45,0
4.0,1/2/2014,"I had a wonderful experience at Ristorante Morini, and considering I was there on the second day they were open, that is really saying something.  The service was superb at every step of the meal.  Both my companion and I are plagued with commitment issues, so we opted for wines by the glass so we could try more of the selection, which was excellent.  For appetizers, we shared the amberjack crudo and the carpaccio appetizer, and both dishes were very balanced and harmonious, with Michael White's usual attention paid to textural details. For main dishes, we shared the lasagnette and the agnolotti.   The agnolotti was quite good, but not amazing, like it is at Ai Fiori.  The lasagnette was a wonderful dish...the kind of comfort food that beckons you: ""Come hither darling...it's winter time.  Get fat!""  However, I think that this dish was very similar, but not quite as awesome as the tagliatelle with ragu at Osteria Morini.  Both of the pastas were not exactly piping hot, but I have no doubt this was a kink that has already been worked out.  I'm afraid to say that the dessert was not very good.  I don't even remember what we ordered exactly...just that it had a scoop of ice cream that was supposed to be salted caramel but tasted nothing like it.Unexpectedly, my date and I were both shocked by how good the water was.  That's right...the ""tap"" water!  As soon as we took a sip, we both commented on how uncommonly good it tasted.  When the sommelier came to the table to ask us if we had any questions, we said ""actually, can you tell us why the water tastes so good?""He replied ""We have our own filtration system.  And I can tell you that I have drunk more water in the past few weeks than I ever have before.""There you have it!  Straight from the sommelier!I live in the neighborhood, so I am probably about to become a regular at Ristorante Morini, but I do hope that they eventually add some more pastas to the menu.",3,0,1,Anna S.,"New York, NY",48,44,8
3.0,12/31/2013,"The ambiance was very nice. The crowd was very upper east side-ish. Upscale, however more family oriented than trendy.My favorite dish was the amberjack, artichoke, and sturgeon caviar appetizer. The menu selection was heavier on the meat options. There were some fish dishes but not  impressed with the fish options. I had the Arctic char for my main course. I chose fish as I like to eat light if the dinner reservation is after 8:00pm, but I thought the  dish was quite heavy the way the fish was prepared. We tried the pastas as well. The porcini gnocchi was delicious.This is a new spot in the upper east side (Madison and the 80s), definitely worth to check out if you live close by.The bar downstairs has space to sit down and grab a bite and/or cocktails. We were told the cocktails are very good, however I drank wine, so did not get a chance to try.",5,0,0,Aida L.,"Manhattan, NY",21,27,14
5.0,12/17/2013,"I had the pleasure of just dining here. The space is terrific, with a cool bar area on the ground floor, and a larger dining area upstairs. The upstairs reminded me of a cross between two other Michael White restaurants, Marea and Ai Fiori. The cooking itself was on point. I tried the aranchini, which I enjoyed but found a little one note. The winter salad was exactly what I'd want it to be: crisp and light with just a few rich bites . The fagottini with a muchroom ragu was delicious enough that I was mad to be sharing it. The tuna was nicely crusted. I found the grapefruit cheesecake a little too sour, but I enjoy cheesecake rich with no apologies. The service was pretty smooth, wit justh a few opening-night bumps. I'm grading on a curve here, but  I'll definitely be back to check-in on the progress in a few weeks.",1,0,1,Aaron G.,"New York, NY",5,10,0
