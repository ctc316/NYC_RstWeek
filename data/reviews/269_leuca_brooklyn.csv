3.0,4/29/2019,"I was here this past weekend with a reservation and when we arrived the table wasn't ready which was fine so we waited about 30 minutes at the bar and had a glass of wine. Once we were sat at the table no one came over to us for about 15 minutes. It took awhile to get the drinks and we never got olive oil with the bread so we got up and got it ourselves! We ordered several apps and antipasto along with entrees and dessert. I must say, the food was absolutely amazing, full of flavor and had a nice twist on the traditional Italian specialties. I really wish the service was held to a higher standard because everything else including the decor and ambiance was sensational.",0,0,0,Christina C.,"Queens, NY",69,72,73

5.0,4/28/2019,Had a wonderful Sunday brunch at this cozy restaurant on the ground level of The William Vale. Highly recommend everything we had! The whipped ricotta with hot honey and garlic was absolutely incredible. We then shared the French toast--not too sweet and we loved the cream and bits of meat that gave it a slightly salty twist (order it with a side of pork sausage to get your meat fix). We finished off the meal with their passionfruit sorbet. Delicious! Wonderful service and charming space.,0,0,0,T C.,"Dallas, TX",55,159,11
4.0,4/22/2019,"I do enjoy this place - the ambience and food that actually has flavors. I can never get the right drink, my friend has gin and raspberry drink and it was delish so I will stick to it next time. Tuna crudo, love the citrus flavor, strong and fresh. Grilled octopus good as usual. We had the burrata pasta -it was light, acceptable considering so far dishes all had strong flavor. And shared strip steak - really not a fan and for the price of $38 I can have fine steak from any fine steak house. With that said - will be back again and try out the rest of the menu.",0,0,0,Daisy D.,"New York, NY",14,59,15
3.0,4/7/2019,"Came here because I ordered delivery and I love their Sheep's Milk Ricotta with Hot Honey & Garlic and decided to come here in person and check it out.I was more impressed with my delivery order than what I received in person.The check-in, so we had reservations and yet we had to wait 30 minutes for our table to be ready.A table next to us, had a white female and an Asian female - the Asian female got up to to speak to our shared waitress.Our waitress came back and brought me a fork, since I didn't have one on the table.Few minutes pass and the white female next to me said to her friend, I can't eat this salad without a fork, where is she (waitress)? I put two and two together and realized our waitress thinks all Asians look the same, since this other Asian had super straight hair (which I do not), red frame glasses (which I wasn't wearing nor do I have a pair) and wearing a colourful dress (which I was wearing all black and pants).Sheep's Milk Ricotta with Hot Honey & Garlic - The delivery version was surprising better, since at the restaurant there wasn't enough hot honey and so the ricotta tasted a bit bland.Grilled Octopus, Baby Potatoes, Olive Condimento - Don't remember it.Penne Rigate, Lamb Bolognese, Ricotta, Mint - Decent.Spaghetti Calabrese with Clams & Oregano - Good, but didn't do anything for me.Sorbetto del Giorno - this was like a mixture of fruit that we couldn't make out what it was, but the flavours didn't complement well with one and other. As we were waiting for our check, we saw another weird situation happening besides us. They were cleaning a table and this one guy came over and cleaned it and put 3 tables together and then another guy and girl comes and pull the table apart. I don't know, it just seems like this place has a lot of work or at least just work on communication and organization.It also took us forever to get our food and our check.",0,0,0,Ro R.,"Brooklyn, NY",83,2220,93
2.0,4/7/2019,"We went to this restaurant three times for late dinner with friends.  While the first was amazing, the subsequent two times were less than so.  Reservations were made in advance and we specifically requested to sit in the room adjacent to the main after sitting there during our first time.  Upon arrival, we were told the room is not available and we will be seated in the main dining room with a bar.  Additionally, since it was someone's birthday from our party of 4, we were told that a special sparkling cake would come for dessert.  Appetizers were delicious, especially the truffle pizza.  For main course, the black pasta and steak were great.  Once the dessert arrived, not a trace of the promised surprise for the birthday person.  We didn't mention it to the waiter or to the hostess, paid the bill and left.  Third time we made reservations and SPECIFICALLY requested the other room once again.  Upon arrival, we were told that there is a little bit of a wait.  After about 45 minutes, hostess graciously offered complimentary drinks and sat us at the main room once again.  Asking to be moved to the other room once it becomes available was fruitless as we were told once you sit down, you can't be moved.  We were seated in a booth in a more of diner like ambiance than an upscale restaurant.  Once again, appetizers were great.  The octopus, the olives with hazelnut and the salad were on point.  For main, the chicken portion was enough for 2-3 people and wasn't as good as previous times.  Steak was rather bland and once again, not as juicy or tasty.  Dessert was tiramisu, which was good once it thawed a bit.  Service was friendly.  Pertinent to note, we were also told that we had to order appetizers and main course at the same time as the chef does not like separate orders.  Questionable, even a bit laughable, but we complied.  In the instant case, first time was the charm with this restaurant and subsequent visits were just ok which is not ok with me.  Probably will not be coming back after this.",0,0,0,Marina M.,"Brooklyn, NY",77,5,0
3.0,4/3/2019,"Nice sophisticated ambiance, good service and staff. Olive oil was delicious, wines were somewhat overpriced. I ordered Steak, I was expecting an Executive Chef touch to that but to me it was really bland. Nothing special on that steak. I see the pastas at the next table, this seemed to me like regular pastas, not housemade, hope they were not. Because when you are paying $25-$30 to a regular pasta, you expect for it to be special.However I really liked the desert, Bomboloni Di Leuca, I would come back only for this dessert. Still not sure for the food though, I wasn't impressed the dishes that I saw around.Menu was not explanatory, since you can't ask each and every dish to the staff, it is kind of a blind guess about what to order since you have no idea what do they contain and what kind of dish is this.",0,0,0,Roxy K.,"New York, NY",2,13,0
4.0,3/31/2019,"I would rate Leuca four and a half stars. The atmosphere is relaxed yet sophisticated. The decor was very modern and comforting. The service was knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive. The food was ready quickly. The rested were gender neutral, plentiful, and upscale. Leuca provides everything you'd want from a modern restaurant.I started with a glass of wine which was recommended by our waitress. We shared a burrata filled ravioli and one of the wood burning oven pizzas. I'm huge fan of wood oven pizza so if you like Speedy Romeo or Milkflower then I think you'll like the pizza here too. For desert, we shared a slice of pistachio cake and I had a glass of amari. They have a huge selection of dessert liquors and digestives.",0,0,0,Joseph T.,"Merrick, NY",98,1667,40
4.0,3/31/2019,"Love the layout and ambience of the restaurant. Came here for dinner, but will return to try their brunch. For dinner, they have a great selection of wine, with their menu order starting from light to heavy. Apps- Octopus: it's hard to make good octopus but Leuca perfected this dish. Supper buttery and flavorful- Connie's Pizza: Both truffle and mushroom flavors were mild, but the bread was fluffyMain - Pappardelle: the noodle was a bit too al dente and flavor too salty- Local Bass: super flaky and buttery with a tasty and complimenting lemon sauceDessert - Pistachio Cake: the highlight. I was worried if the pistachio flavor will be too strong or artificial but the cake was light and dense at the same time. The cake was soft with fun texture, being coated with roasted nuts and goes really well with the ice cream and olive oil- Creamsicle Sundae: not bad, but a bit of a tried hard dish with too much going on. The service is attentive but also confusing. We got our pizza first, then our octopus shortly after and then our pasta as we just got started with the pizza.",0,0,0,Emizz Z.,"London, United Kingdom",104,21,19
4.0,3/29/2019,"So glad we came to try it ! My friends and I have been coming to the William Vale for some time but have never gotten around to coming here. The interior decor is stunning. Very nice ambience after a long day. We decided to eat light and ordered Connies Wedding (the black truffle pizza) , the beet and citrus salad, and the pistachio cake for desert. The pizza was amazing. One of the best truffle pizzas I've tried in NY. The pistachio cake was also delicious- very moist and flavorful - something different from all of the desert options at restaurants. The beet and citrus salad though ? Not a fan. Would recommend not shelling out the 16$ or so dollars on it and order another pizza instead. Peep the pics !",1,0,1,Gabriella B.,"Queens, Queens, NY",1,8,20

5.0,3/19/2019,"My date and I came to Leuca on Saturday night after our plans for Westlight fell through. I am so glad that we came down to this refined and truly delicious Italian restaurant! Leuca has two sections: one with what seems to be leather couches which is reminiscent of how the Romans used to recline and eat in a relaxed way with a bar in the center of the room, and the main dining room where one can see the kitchen. The aesthetic was fresh and modern with obvious references to Italian/Tuscan decor. The staff was incredibly accommodating. Our waiter was warm, attentive, and referred us to the sommelier for better explanation of our expansive wine options. Now for the food! Being that I was more interested in indulging in their enthralling dessert menu, I decided to eat light. The name escapes me, but I ordered the pizza with truffle oil, mushrooms, and taleggio cheese. It was thin and highly flavorful.  A savory balance of earthy and salty. My date got the bass which our waiter described as buttery and flavorful. The fish lived up to the hype! It was quite buttery, cooked a plancha, and paired with mint. Incredibly delicious! For dessert, I ordered the pistachio cake paired with an olive oil gelato. I was floating on air. The cake was lightly sweet and for the first time, I acknowledged that olives can indeed be ""fruity.""All in all, I give Leuca 5 emphatic stars. Great staff, flavorful food, delicious wines, sexy atmosphere.",1,0,1,Giovanna C.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,10,4
4.0,3/18/2019,"First let me say the service was way better than I expected after reading multiple reviews. I called on Saturday night at 9:22pm and made a reservation for 9:45pm. I arrived a few minutes late and was seated after less than 10 minutes. The art and decor at Leuca is gorgeous. Our waitress Michelle was super friendly and patient suggesting all her favorites for each course.

4.0,3/17/2019,Andrew Carmelini's new Brooklyn spot is so hot and  cool - the grub is also right on par.  Southern Italian with a ton of seafood options.  Go with the Local Bass and Tuna Crudo along with the grilled Octopus n Potato starter - (all were highlights of our meal) The pastas were decent - the black shells w/shrimp and calamari & veal bolognese was okay but the Malfidini w/sweet pepped was divine.  They made a special red pepper pomodoro penne for me as I was craving a more simple red sauce. We celebrated a birthday can they came out will full on sparklers! Amazing vibe and service was on par. Would definitely come back the next time I'm in NYC.  I might even consider staying in Brooklyn!,0,0,0,Lor B.,"Seattle, WA",189,452,85
2.0,3/16/2019,"Leuca feels nice, looks nice, and seems nice; however, it's missing the kind of quality food and service that would make it an upscale mainstay in the area. Here's what I thought, with a few improvements to considers. Food: -The ricotta dip is simple but great. No problems there. -The octopus is tasty but a bit too small compared to what other places offer. Even if you tell people it's small beforehand to manage their expectations, that kind of doesn't matter. Why? Because it was one of the dishes our waitress (and one of our other friends) recommended. Why would we want a dish that isn't recommended? You're putting customers, your waitstaff, and your restaurant in a weird spot when you offer something that has an issue with it from the beginning. -The bass mostly tasted like charred skin and didn't have much flavor. Adding bland beans to the dish to make it heartier also feels a bit like a scam. Get better quality fish and probably redo the rest of it. Service: -I'd probably tell waitstaff to chill on the upselling or to find a smarter way to do it. For example, rather than just recommend the $36 truffle pizza that's around 11"" in size, you might figure out what people like more or what goes better with their other dishes. Also truffle anything has a reputation for being a scam. Unless it's actually truffles shaved or something legit like that, your servers should probably have a better pitch or sell? What makes this truffle pizza better or more interesting than any others?   -Our main waitress was pretty good, despite her attempts to upsell items, which was a little annoying. When people start upselling, it makes the experience less relaxing b/c you have to start paying attention more to what you're ordering and whether it's going to be good or is just a scam. -The bussers and some waitstaff lack basic polish. For example, one busser asked us ""can I take this to make way for your entré?"" for an empty plate on the table. When you ask that while one of your customers is eating, it comes off as slightly rude and like you're trying to rush them. The basic fix is to just ask ""are you finished with this?""-Another person on the waitstaff did a ""functionally"" good job but seemed like she didn't want to be there. She would abruptly fill water glasses or almost drop things on the table. It wasn't clear if she had a personal life issue or just didn't care about the job. Yes, life sometimes has a way of affecting how we are at work, but still, it's a customer-facing job....so you have to either coach people on how to deal with their private lives at work or find people who are more motivated or who have better people skills. Right?When we sat down, we were excited to eat there but by the end, we opted not to have dessert and leave. It's a bummer because Leuca is a beautiful, low-lit restaurant.",0,0,0,S.

I started with the stuffed peppers with lamb sausages and the sauce was incredible. Lamb cooked perfectly in the tender pepper! I could've ate more as my main meal lol but no. I had my ""secondini"" was which the braised short rib accompanied by a layered potato gratin like side. The rib was tender and doused in a tomato based sauce. My friends had the scampi ravioli and was pleased. They also thought it had a type of fish inside (shrimp?). Lastly the pistachio cake with olive oil ice cream was delicious.

4.0,1/20/2019,"We went to this restaurant on a weekend for brunch. Since we were a little extra hungry we shared the Connie's Wedding wood-fired pizza to start. I loved that it came with shaved truffles on top. The flavor of the truffle was not overpowering and had a light delicate flavor that went well with the salty taleggio cheese. The pizza dough was very unique since it was not the classic New York thin pizza crust that the city its known for, but had the consistency of a naan flatbread. For entree I got the lumache pasta that came with a pork ragu. The pasta was cooked to very al dente. It had a bite to the pasta, but I'd prefer my pasta to be slightly more on the softer side. The pork ragu was really good but can use some fresh basil to brighten it up. Service overall was very good.

Friends tried the pizzas, I'm not a big fan of pizza so they were only okay. There are better options to choose from. We even got bread for the table to start with. The sheep's milk ricotta was to die for. Creamy, sweet, and a kick of heat on toasty crusty bread. This made our meal even better. We shared the lemon ricotta pancakes to finish.

My favorite section of the menu is the dips.One that I've recently had that stands out to me is the Sheep's Milk Ricotta with Hot Honey and Garlic. Absolutely refreshing and phenomenal. It made my boyfriend and I debate on taking half the bowl home, or asking for more fresh, warm bread to polish it off right then and there. We chose the latter. I still would've opted to order one to go if I were able to breathe after our meal.We also ordered the Grilled Octopus (which was to my liking, but a bit too charred for my boyfriend) and the Pappardelle with Duck and Mushroom (savory, creamy goodness).10/10 would recommend this gem to anyone hanging around the area.

In addition to the delicious meal, the service here is very good.  Our waitress was ever-present and available without being smothering, and the team of busboys and runners worked very efficiently.My only complaint was that for each course of our meal, at least one dish was missing that we then had to follow up about.  They forgot my appetizer, my friend's entrée, and one of our desserts.  It was bizarre that this happened consistently throughout the meal.  However, it's worth noting that when this was brought to the attention of the wait staff, they were quick to apologize and bring out the missing dish.All in all, I enjoyed my meal at Leuca.  Dinner for 8, including cocktails, wine appetizers, entrées, desserts, coffees, tax, and 20% tip worked out to around $840.  Worth it given the quality of food and ambiance!",2,0,1,Juliana T.,"Manhattan, NY",220,265,553

The hostess told us we could grab seats at the bar or the high tops (for 4) as they opened up. We sat at a high top, fully expecting to share with any other party of 2 who needed it. The waiter was brusque - no eye contact, no welcome, no hello - shoved menus and silverware at us, took drink orders and disappeared (my friend's drink was wrong, mine was watery. We both agreed dealing with him over new drinks wasn't worth it). Near our table, he ranted to another server then came around our table to stand immediately behind me and say, See? Two seats here, two seats there. (If a party of two shouldn't take a hightop for 4, why would the hostess suggest it as an option? Or - why wouldn't the waiter handle it like an adult *not* trying to intentionally make someone else uncomfortable?) When he finally came back to refill water, I asked, Can we order food? He said YES in the tone anyone would use to say F***ING FINALLY. Bread comes - thrown on the table. Water is refilled - with a reach across my chest that made me jump back. Other (lovely) staff bring our food. He walks by and - without stopping - looks at me and asks, You okay? My ""Yeah"" must've been sharp enough to keep him polite for the rest of the meal, but we definitely didn't get the smarmy ""anything you need"" we heard him offer the women who took the other two seats at the table. I don't need a server to gush to feel like I'm taken care of, but I don't want to pay money to feel like someone's problem.

The crust was thick and it was kind of like a Neapolitan pizza. For pastas we ordered penne regatta with lamb bolognese, ricotta, and mint. I really liked this pasta I thought it was good and the big blob of ricotta made everything better. My boyfriend got their spaghetti alla Ricci with lemon, chili oil, and lemon.

I was in the area and really wanted to have a drink at the rooftop at Westlight. Was craving pizza and decided to check it out! For starters, the menu is seasonal, so what you see on Yelp is not necessarily what they have on the day you go. When I arrived at the restaurant I asked if we could order food at the bar and they said yes. We sat down and proceeded to order and the bartender kept insisting on whether or not we wanted to order drinks. We didn't want to order drinks because we wanted to have drinks upstairs at Westlight and just wanted to grab a quick bite. He seemed annoyed at the fact that we weren't  ordering drinks but that he was still having to take our order and was not very pleasant during the entire time. Midway through our meal I decided I wanted to order a cocktail so I asked for the menu.

Was then asked to move by rude waiters repeatedly over the course of the next 50 or 60 minutes. We were told multiple times the party at our table was paying, leaving and they were setting our table. I also saw other party's of 2 walking in the door and being led right to their table. Though I don't know the circumstances surrounding that, it's frustrating to say the least. We were told it would only be another 5 minutes, which turned into another 15 or 20.  Eventually we decide we have to leave because we had a show to catch and sure enough as we are walking out the door, our table is finally ready, but at that point we would not be able to sit down for dinner, order, and eat and still be able to make the show. The hostess was nice, but it doesn't make up for the worst customer service I've ever experienced. Why do they bother having reservations at all if they have no intention of honoring them? This place needs a serious overhaul in the way they do business and treat customers. So, in summation, don't go here. We waited an hour and left. Reservations don't mean anything to them.

My fiancé and I were 10 minutes early to our reservation and we had to wait 45 minutes on top. That was fine since the hostess was very friendly and enthusiastic. So we went to the bar to stall time, no one attended to us at all for a good 10 minutes so we were like okay fine and went to the bathroom thinking she might be busy. Came back to the bar and tried to order something, but this time there was barely any customers at the bar. Still for a good 10 minutes, no one bothered to give us a menu. We went to check in with the hostess and was told that they're still getting the table ready. Fine, we went to the bar again since this time I saw a large crowd going there. I stood in the empty space not knowing that someone is sitting next to it because he went to the bathroom. The female bartender came over and gave that large crowd a menu and completely avoided me and placed a menu next to me which I didn't understand. I thought maybe she didn't want to get it in my way or something so I picked it up and she literally came and yelled at me. She was like ""Miss, someone is sitting here, do you not see!"" and snatched the menu away from me. If I saw, I wouldn't be standing there. Other customers saw too and literally were shocked by her attitude. There were countless opportunities for her to give me a menu and to tell me nicely that someone reserved that spot. I'm shocked this restaurant has such a low standard for their staff.

The menu is a little fancy and prices are a bit expensive, but it all goes along with the vibe of the restaurant and taste of the food. Drinks were pricey, but gorgeous presentation and very tasty (not too sweet or too bitter). The calamari was fantastic, light and crispy. The ricotta dip was a little heavy, but I really enjoyed the mix of flavors (not to mention, the bread was absolutely delicious). We shared a classic pizza, it was absolutely mouth watering. My only fret was that it was on the small side. We tried a special gnocchi dish in a saffron sauce as well, this was the only thing I probably wouldn't order again it just wasn't necessarily my favorite taste as far as sauces go. I unfortunately wasn't feeling well about halfway through the meal so I couldn't fully enjoy my experience, and yet, I was still blown away.

5.0,8/6/2018,"What a find! Hidden inside the new hot and swanky William Vale hotel. Very elegant chic ambiance , lots of southern Italian decor elements. Came here with my girlfriend for a summer brunch - amazing food! Got the southern Italian egg Benedict and Baba Au Rhum French toast. Both are delicious, but I especially have to give a raving review to the French Toast. Organic cream is light and not too sweet, sprinkled with Guanciale bacon pieces. The mix of sweet and light saltiness adds lots of flavor to this simple brunch dish. This reinvents my perception of French Toast. Now onto the eggs Benedict. I've had hundreds of eggs Benedict, but the pizza hollandaise sauce definitely makes this Benny stands out! The service is very attentive. All the silverware, marble tabletop and table napkins all shout out chic ! Will definitely come back again when I am in Williamsburg",0,0,1,Sophia L.,"New York, NY",292,13,44
4.0,8/6/2018,"I can't even right now! Whoever told me not to go here was quite sorely mistaken. I've been for both, brunch and dinner and left satisfied every time. Leuca is located in the William Vale, and if you know anything about this hotel you'd know that service and satisfaction is top priority which of course the restaurant lives up to. When I dined at Leuca for brunch, we were a big party and still everything was on point. The waitstaff was patient, helpful, and clearly wanted us to have a stellar experience. My favourite brunch dishes were the Tuna Crudo, Eggs al Forno, & Lemon-Ricotta Pancakes. The other dishes are great, but these are my top favourites that I absolutely recommend. All the dishes were fresh, tasty and very innovative. Their cocktails are pretty awesome too and really different from the usual boring drinks you can find at most restaurants. When I dined in for dinner, my experience was pretty similar with staff being super helpful in deciding what to order and in tune with their patrons. My favourite dinner dishes were Local Bass, Penne Rigate, Classic Woodfired Pizza & the Hanger Steak Vesuvius. Their desserts were delectable & the perfect end to a perfect dinner. I really do recommend Leuca as a great date night with a loved one or a group of friends. Everything about them is what a perfect restaurant should be.",8,2,6,Rebecca A.,"Brooklyn, NY",649,275,2445
5.0,7/26/2018,"What a magical evening spent at Leuca and The William Vale. The Supper Club enjoyed a magnificent night thanks to the friendly staff and amazing service at Leuca. We enjoyed the perfect NYC night thanks to a divine culinary experience by Chef Andrew Carmellini. Guests tucked into a beautiful tuna crudo for the antipasti and for the second course, guests indulged in a casarecce - rapini pesto, sweet & sour peppers, local bass and steak vesuvius. The Sicilian pistachio cake with olive oil ice cream arrived providing a delicious mix of savory and sweet and the perfect finale to a wonderful evening. We were blown away by the remarkable service and the food was equally as spectacular. Words cannot describe how delicious our meals were!

3.0,7/23/2018,"We came to Leuca for dinner with some friends this past weekend. It's slightly below street level in the William Vale Hotel, which is a swanky spot that I don't think existed when I first moved into NYC over a decade ago. It's got a very cosmopolitan yet hipster/rustic vibe going on, with lots of different artwork adorning the wooden walls that make you think you're in a barn - except for the decently high noise level that encompasses the restaurant. Even though it looked and felt relatively new, though, the chairs do seem to unintentionally show their age a bit, punctured (literally) by the fact that I slashed my palm on the nail-laced loose lining of my chair...not the best way to start out a meal. Outside of bodily harm, though, the rest of the ambiance was nice - although the bar area out front has higher ceilings and thus feels a bit more spacious. Service was solid throughout, although it slowed down a bit towards the end (we had a reservation upstairs at Westlight and needed to jet). The cocktails here were pretty solid overall, although the wine collection is definitely on the more extensive side. For a Brooklyn spot, the beer selection? A little disappointing, to be honest.When it came to the food, I generally felt that it was on-point, if perhaps a bit underwhelming relative to where my expectations were. We shared the 'Johnny C' pizza to start, which had a very good crust (lots of good crusts in NYC pizza as of late) but was a bit nondescript when it came to flavors, as well as pushing the envelope on how much money $20 should buy you when it comes to pizza (hint: I'd rather spend the money at Roberta's). We also got the tuna crudo to split, which I enjoyed - the fish was much fresher than I anticipated, as well as a decently fatty cut - as well as the arugula salad with peaches, which was a nice, summery dish, although it feels a bit out of place at an Italian-themed spot. For my entree, I went with the lumache with pork sugo. The pasta was okay - it's a bit like rigatoni, but cut into smaller pieces - but the pork was stringy and savory, and that really made the dish. My wife's sea bass was also quite good, although I was not as big a fan of the tomato sauce it was doused in, and I don't think corn - as the main vegetable - really made sense as a pairing.The food here at Leuca was perfectly fine, and were it closer to where I live (i.e. in Manhattan), I would be tempted to come back and try it again. However, I got the sense that it was solidly-cooked Italian food that is trading on its ambiance as the drawing card, as opposed to blowing people away with the cuisine. Maybe it's a sign of age (or curmudgeon-like tendencies), but I'd rather that the food impress me more.",1,1,1,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",371,1653,169
5.0,7/16/2018,"Disclaimer: I recently purchased a 50% discount on a group of restaurants (including Leuca) through Time Out, so my review will be based on effectively a cheaper bill.As someone who rarely ventures to Williamsburg (the trip to Leuca brings my grand total up to 2, over my 6 years of residing in Manhattan), I'd say Leuca was worth the trip! The restaurant is located in the basement level of the William Vale, and ambiance is on-point. It's much quieter than your average Midtown date spot, although being located in a hotel runs the risk of having families with small children dining around you (and a few toddler cries here and there). The service is super warm and personable, and our table was never without the free sesame crusted bread and EVOO. We ordered the sheep's milk ricotta dip, which was delicious, and the suckling pig to share between two! The skin was super crisp, the meat was perfectly juicy, and the charred veggies on top were delicious. I also loved the punch of acidity in the sauce, which was a much needed foil to the decadence of the roasted fatty pork. We had tons leftover, which was nicely boxed up with a post card. I was super happy about this meal because it tallied up to roughly $30/pp with my discount (although it would've run over $60/pp without it - perhaps a bit too much on the pricier side).Overall, I wouldn't necessarily make the trek again to the area just for the restaurant, but I would definitely recommend it for those already venturing to Williamsburg.",3,1,1,Ivy Z.,"New York, NY",9,78,283

I have now been to Leuca for brunch on numerous occasions (the menu has shifted slightly from time to time), and everything ordered has been delicious all-around. Their sweeter dishes (pancakes/French toast/waffles-- though the waffles tend not to be crazy sweet) are always an excellent choice (no, I cannot choose a favorite). I have also had the frittata with mushrooms and frisée salad a few times, and it is always an excellent choice. I have also sampled other dishes as well -- the mezzalune, the chicken sandwich, and the baked eggs -- and again, all amazing. I can honestly go on and on-- so I'll just say, GO. And try whatever. I bet you'll enjoy it.

We entered through the hotel lobby which was a bit confusing for us... but we were warmly greeted by the hostesses and were seated at a table without any delay.We sat down, perused the menu, ordered our coffees and brunch dishes. It was around 1-2PM by this point, and the kitchen was running a bit behind with orders. We weren't too bothered, but the waitstaff proactively gave us a heads up before our smiles turned into frowns, and they brought out a bunch of delicious pastries for us on the house to make up for the delay. It was a really unexpected but awesome touch of hospitality that we really appreciated. It was definitely more comfortable for us to munch on something while the entrees were being prepped and the time went by really quickly, to be honest.

We didn't realize until our appetizers came then we had to wait for place settings to be delivered. Our food was tasty but our entrees didn't come out all at the same time. So, those that came out first got cold. Two of us got the bucatini and clam dish and while there was an abundance of clam shells, 75% of those shells were empty.

4.0,2/6/2018,"I really enjoyed this restaurant! My boyfriend and I came here on a Friday night for Restaurant Week. I haven't gone to Billyburg as much, but I was super surprised to see a hotel like the William Vale located here, and even more surprised that a huge and beautiful restaurant like Leuca is here. I love the decor of the place. Onto the food: - I love their free bread with fresh olive oil. Yum! We requested quite a bit of free bread - which honestly would be a reason why we felt pretty full by the end of the meal though they have small portions. - Scallop Crudo with Meyer Lemon and Sunflower: this is a raw scallop dish first and foremost. You wouldn't know it based on how it is listed on their menu, but they are raw. I am a fan of raw scallops and this dish was delicious and overall very refreshing to eat. - Chickpea Pugliese with Bottarga and Parsley: it is a very tasty chickpea / hummus like dish. Again you wouldn't be able to tell based on how it is listed on the menu, but the dish itself was pretty good - even better on their free bread! -Casarecce, Rapini Pesto, Sweet and Sour Peppers: Yum! It is essentially a pasta dish and quite delicious! It has a wonderful bitter / sweet / sour taste to it. I loved it. -Hanger Steak Vesuvius: The quality of the steak wasn't the best, but the way it was cooked and the taste was fantastic. Loved it along with the charred vegetables with it. Yum! -Pistachio Cake / Olive Oil ice cream: what an interesting taste and dish! You wouldn't think it was good... but it is fantastic. Very light and a very good foil to the chocolate cake. -Chocolate Budino: very delicious and chocolatey - it is so creamy and delicious. Yum! Overall the food was great and delicious. The portions are a bit on the small side, so be prepared to either eat a lot of their free bread, or order more food. Otherwise, the flavor profile is fantastic.",3,0,1,Gloria C.,"Bensonhurst, NY",140,208,122

If I was basing this review off taste it would be 4-5 stars. BUT the service was incredibly slow. I waited almost an hour for my small dinner (and I was starving!). Our waitress had poor work ethic unfortunately. She never checked on us, but when she did she tried to convince us buy more wine or appetizers.

The pastries arrived only after numerous requests, an order of sourdough bread took 20 minutes, the hot tea we requested when we sat down came only after we asked over and over, and we often couldn't get our server's attention (he seemed to be serving tables over a wide area of the restaurant).

4.0,1/26/2018,"Stopped in for restaurant week and to celebrate a birthday. We both had a very nice time.Apps: Never had raw scallops before - this was a nice surprise (thought they were cooked, so clarification could be nice!). The chickpea dish was essentially just hummus but still pretty good. They kept the free bread train following. Love me some bread and oil.Entrees: The vegetarian pasta dish was divine. Pretty heavy on the salt, but hey I guess that's why it was good! I don't think my bf thought the short rib dish was pasta too, but he still enjoyed it after the initial, ""uhhh ok!"".Dessert: Olive oil ice cream sounds pretty gross in hindsight, but in the moment it was great. The olive oil cake probably took a year off my life, but tasty. The chocolate pudding dessert was amazeballs.Drink:  I hate buying wine when I go out because of the stupid upcharge in wine prices. Paid $14 a glass here. They had a $10 restaurant week special for two wines, but we didn't get the restaurant week menu until after they gave us the full menu. Sneaky, sneaky. Cocktails were overpriced too at $15-ish. Sparkling water will set you back $7 a bottle. Cut back here and save some decent money.Note: They need to be a bit more clear in their menu (ie the scallops are raw, the rib dish is pasta, the chickpea dish is hummus) and get away from the pretentious descriptions that no one really understands.Back on the upswing -- they were also on-top of their game enough to take my Birthday note from Open Table and bring a candle out in one of the desserts. Nice move. Of course, it was kind of funny when the table next to us got one of the HUGE sparkling candles, leaving my bf with a ""wtf' feeling, BUT I gotta thank the staff (which was very attentive, by the way) for the attention to detail.Bill came to about $150 all said and done.

The pizza was your average brooklyn pizza with a twist combo of adding fontina cheese which I appreciated. My squid ink pasta was 4 stars but I have to say I was expecting more with an innovative taste but I appreciated the crushed tomatoes. The pistachio dessert was 5 stars, perfect do not change the recipe. I LOVE the open kitchen, makes me trust the sanitation and serve safe regulations are followed. Why 3 stars? -1 star due to service, although everyone was nice. I was starving and they took forever to take our order and it wasn't even busy.

3.0,11/11/2017,"Went here for brunch-date with my husband, after reading all of the great reviews.  It's a very beautiful restaurant.  The decor is really beautiful.  Each room seems to have it's own theme...  The front room had an open, Le Pain Quotidien-sort of feel.  Families and children were happily eating and chattering away.  I liked that it was family friendly.Though far from full, the front room was starting to fill up.  I found the hostess to be very considerate and mindful of her restaurant - she asked us if we'd like to go into the back room as it was quieter.  This room was beautiful in its own, different way.  Almost like another restaurant entirely.  Though also a large room, it was intimate and cozy, with warm wood tones everywhere, sofas and armchairs, and creative lighting.  I could see even more rooms beyond this one, with even quirkier personality - bright with water and little fish painted on the walls!  Certainly a place with lots to look at.We found the service to be spot on.  Waiters frequently came by to fill up our water, even when it wasn't emptied.  Someone was always close by in case we needed anything.  They were quick to clean up.I even liked that we could see into the kitchen and watch the chef and his team at work.Food-wise, presentation was again beautiful.  Each platter that came out was like a mini-work of art.  Prices were fair and reasonable too!I just wish the food tasted as good as it looked.  Perhaps it was this chef's particular tastes, but we just didn't click.   After reading all the rave reviews about the sheep's milk ricotta with hot honey and garlic, I really wanted to try that.  It was entirely luck with this dish... one bite was creamy and interesting.  Another was strange, and had a weird, unexpected and jarring spiciness to it.  I don't know if it was meant to be that way, as no one else mentioned any sort of spiciness in their reviews, but it really threw us off.  We ordered a cappuccino and latte along with the brunch.  The sugar, though presented in a fancy manner of little balls that you could submerge and mix into your coffee, was ineffective and wouldn't breakdown in the coffee until the end, resulting in undersweetened coffee in the beginning, and oversweetened coffee by the end of your drink.  Unfortunately just unpleasant overall...The french toast, though beautiful, was also bland.  I thought the bread itself was lovely and light, but it just seemed to be missing something to make it memorable.  I tried mixing with the toppings - raisins, cream, and syrup, but it just didn't come together.  My husband got the eggs benedict, but it was more spinach than anything else.  He felt overpowered the dish.I really would have loved to have rated this higher.  I found so many things perfect about this place - so much attention to detail when it came to decor, service, and presentation... fair pricing... a convenient location (hotel, bowling, and the brewery right there!).  But it was the food that left me wanting more. =\",0,0,0,Jennifer P.,"Queens, NY",0,36,38

In the eggplant antipasti and my squash pasta dish the flavors were complex and with surprises and highly attentive to texture. I'm texture crazy, must have plenty, so it was right up my alley. It's rich food. Don't let your eyes be bigger than your stomach. But do try a lot of things, I'd just suggest sharing and passing around tastes a lot if you're in a group. The space is beautiful, the service is professional, attentive, warm and friendly. I spied a gorgeous private dining room in the back with painted walls and ceilings, its own bar looking like it seats about 24? At a long table, with doors that close. It would be lovely for birthday parties, anniversary parties, small wedding receptions. They brought us ice cream with a candle as a surprise for our anniversary. Thank you to them for a wonderful evening. The only disappointment of the whole excursion, which is not Leuca's fault but I note it here if you plan to go, Westlight, the rooftop bar at the hotel has unhelpful, bit immature staff. I called in advance saying after dinner we'd like to go is there anything to know? Nope. Doesn't say we need a reservation. We go up and pass by reception, I say we just dined at Leuca, are coming in the bar, they just point to the door to the outdoor section and again they don't mention getting on a wait list for a table. They remind me of kids working the door at clubs back in college. Turns out once we see the view and come inside we were unable to be seated.

5.0,10/15/2017,"Brought my mom and my kids for Sunday brunch (after saying I was going to try Leuca for like, ever), and boy, I was not disappointed. The first pleasant surprise I got was that we found parking right outside, so the walk, while dragging a 4 year old and 1 year old, was not the hellish march it usually would be in such an upscale area.The interior was absolutely beautiful, and my mom (who once worked at a restaurant) was commenting how even though the kitchen is open, giving you a view of all the chefs working in sync with one another (in an absolutely pristine environment), that you can't hear them talking, and neither can you smell the grease that would normally be floating around from all the cooking--this is a true testament to the architecture and interior design.The mixed juice that my mom ended up getting (pity we were both driving as I would have loved to try the cocktails) was wonderful and not overpoweringly sweet. And, despite it containing ginger (something that can often ruin the taste for me if they're a little heavy handed with the herb), the flavor did not overpower and was amazingly sublime.I don't think there was anything we ordered that I wouldn't order again--We had the Sheep's milk ricotta with honey and roasted garlic (with my one year old also kept on shoving into her mouth)--the contrast of the creamy ricotta, the fragrant garlic, whatever the crispy greens were on top (um, this was amazing by the way) and the syrupy honey called for some crusty bread which we eagerly smeared it upon.Tuna crudo--I am a fiend for fish and even more so for it rare or raw, carpaccio style, tartare, what have you--fresh and thinly sliced, with just enough herbs and tang to make me feel like I'm biting into the last bit of summer.Lemon ricotta pancakes. My mother, who normally hates pancakes, cleaned the plate with none to spare and said she may just have to start eating them if they were all made like this (I am a bit upset I didn't get to take any home for the husband, who is crazy about pancakes, to try). Fluffy, with a bit of crunch from the pine nuts balanced it perfectly.Pizza was originally ordered for the kids but how could I leave it alone when it smelled so amazing? I ate three slices before even realizing that I should be waiting for what I was most anticipating--the black pasta. Guys, I love seafood. I'm obsessed with it. But it's so easy to get wrong--shrimp and calamari can, with very little effort, turn into inedible fishy rubber bands and so I often choose to ignore it when I see it tossed with pasta--but my mom said she's had it before and it's worth trying.I actually, because I had filled up on those dratted pizzas (why must you be so delicious), took it home with me and am eating it as I'm typing this review (this was the last straw) because my eyes rolled into the back of my head with the first bite. The soggy penne and meatballs I had made two days ago that's still sitting in the fridge...? Yeah, that's going in the garbage tonight.

My iced tea never saw a refill, by way of example.The food was overly ""inventive"", in my estimation.Let's start with the eggplant caponata appetizer. It was a very odd mix of flavors and temperatures. First it was served warm. Second it was very sweet, with an odd vinegar-type flavor component. And, third it was a mess to eat. All in all I found this take on caponata to be a MAJOR fail, and it was priced excessively expensively to be such a disaster. (Note: I rarely call out food to price ratio, so take my comment here with a grain of whatever.)The pizza was okay. Kinda pedestrian, to be honest.The olive oil dessert was odd.

4.0,9/11/2017,"Updating review. Was invited back for another chance and received great service. Sometimes bad service can be a one off night. Great food here. Cool atmosphere. They changed my mind with excellent hospitality First: I made a reservation for 9:30pm. Waited till 10pm. Was seated in the bar area by the exit. I asked the group of 4 hostesses if we could be seated in the main dining area because we made a reservation, and was told it would take quite awhile for the main dining area. They also admitted the bar area was for walk-ins. I was having to argue so I asked for the manager. Manager was nice and sat us in the main dining area within 3 minutes. Food: wine list was extensive and decently priced. Honey Ricotta was amazing. Salad was good. Clam bucatini was very good. Cherry desert was meh. Service: Awful. I think we talked to 4 different waiters so wasn't sure who was responsible. Guy in a suit took our wine order, nice and professional and explained the wine well. Our next guy didn't know the menu. I asked him about an appetizer and he clearly had no clue. Said ""you tell me"". And started rattling off buzzwords from the description. He poured basically the whole wine bottle into our glasses out of laziness I'm assuming. Our salad appetizer and side dishes sat on our table while we ate our entrees. Very odd.  Overall I should have expected this experience. They are in the William Vale hotel and its ""trendy"" to be there. Customer service isn't their first priority. Although the manager was very customer friendly. They know they will keep filling the seats no matter what because it's cool to be there.

Also had a Stella Spritz to drink, which was delicious and served in a whimsical fish-shaped vessel. So fun.Edit 10/2018: came back for dinner and tried:+ classic wood-fried pizza+ tomato salad+ malfadini+ penne rigate with lamb bolognese+ bombolini di LeucaThe pastas were excellent and I loved the doughnuts.

4.0,8/28/2017,"It's rare for me to frequent a hotel in Brooklyn since I, you know, live here, but I find myself at Leuca from time to time. The space is breathtaking, and not in that Seinfeld baby way. The geometric floor tiles, the uber high ceilings in the bar area, the intimacy of the dining room. The staff is beyond delightful, even when we aren't. They seemed genuinely pleased to replace a pasta, when my companion found the sauce not to her liking. They are equally pleased to do an impromptu wine flight when we have trouble deciding a wine (but do try a volcanic sparkling rose!). We always always order the ricotta and the tuna crudo. We often order seconds of the crudo. Please, try the crudo. I have also enjoyed the black shells and the octopus (which is great as a main if you aren't that hungry).",3,1,2,Anne W.,"Brooklyn, NY",225,212,191

From its beautiful interior decor and low lights that work to exude an intimate environment, to the attentive staff, and most importantly, all of the tasty goodness elevates this Brooklyn hotel restaurant to 'very high' on my list of recos.My boyfriend and I were welcomed with two complimentary glasses of champagne for our anniversary, which of course added to our overall experience. We also got the plush corner sofa seat - one of the better seats on the floor - which was a great touch. Seats matter! But the dinner just kept getting better with every dish. We were absolutely overcome by the explosion of flavors in the fire roasted cabbage appetizer. We kind of ordered this off the cuff, but it was probably the best decision of the night. The texture/temperature in the yellowtail crudo dish was also perfection and incredibly refreshing. The black shells seafood pasta was savory, with the perfect blend of garlic and tomato flavors.

3.0,8/12/2017,"We came back to Leuca for the roast pig. We were super excited for the feast, but we were some what disappointed.  We waited a hell of a long time to get our pig. Supposedly,  there was a mess up in the kitchen which is totally fine. We were enjoying our drinks we ordered and such.  When We finally got our pig the skin was super crunchy (awesome), but the meat was super chewy and stringy! It wasn't as appetizing as we expected. It was juicy just not as tender as we thought. It was tough and super hard to pull apart and some parts were un appetizingly chewy. Def not good eats. I feel like it wasn't cooked as long as it should have been. Maybe a few more hours for porky.  The rapini it came with was smoky and good but messy since it was hard to cut. Overall, not worth 80 bucks in my opinion ! We also got dessert, little donuts filled with custard which was very satisfying and some gelato. Americano was on point! Leuca is beautiful and romantic.

Anyway, the ricotta with honey and the Italian butter bean appetizers were my favorite part of the meal. Both were amazing! For dinner we split the pesto pasta with the sweet and sour peppers and the burrata mezzaluna. The pesto pasta was delicious... I wish I could say the same for the mezzaluna.

1.0,8/2/2017,"4.5/5 for the management3/5 for the food0/5 for the African American waitress with clear plastic glasses and a platinum blonde mohawk that ruined my nightMy boyfriend and I had reservations 8/1/2017 at 8:15. I ordered off the Restaurant Week menu while my boyfriend ordered off the regular menu. We ordered the ricotta and honey dip and Italian butter bean dip. The ricotta has a sweet and spiciness that complements its creaminess very well. I was quite surprised by the bean dip at first as the oil has a very strong citrus flavor, but, again, it worked. My boyfriend ordered the goat fazzoletti and I got the hanger steak. Boyfriend's dish was quite tasty. My steak was slightly warmer than room temperature. It had already been cut, so it seemed it was rested and then left out. On top of the temperature, it's tough and closer to medium-well than to the medium I specified. I take a small bite out of the second piece just in case the butt-end was the only problem piece (I got 5 or 6 pieces of bite-sized steak, so really it ALL should have been cooked properly). Nope, still barely warm.We get the attention of the waitress and I tell her the steak is lukewarm at best. She looks at me and says, ""Do you want me to have them reheat the steak for you?"" If she offered to have a new one made, I didn't hear it and she certainly didn't offer to rush it. When I hesitated and said something about the meat becoming overcooked, she mumbles about talking to the chef. Less than 5 minutes later, my original steak has been burnt and sloppily replated and sent back to me. I see that they took the time to burn the half bite of steak to almost well-done and plate it too. We call our waitress over again. I apologize before telling her what happened. She looks at me and says, ""Okay, so what do you want? Do you want another steak?"" No apology, no hint of her previous friendliness. I hesitate as I really don't want another terrible steak. She sees this and, instead of offering me another look at the menu, rolls her eyes as she says, ""Okay so do you want the malfadini?"" I look confused, so she rolls her eyes and repeats herself. Seeing the confusion still on my face, she snaps, ""The pasta on the RW menu"". She's speaking to me aggressively and I just want her away from me, so I agree. Right after this point, I realize I've lost my appetite. My boyfriend has finished, and I want to leave. I asked for a manager because I want to tell someone to charge us for the apps and boyfriend's entree so we could go. The manager asks what happened, and I tell him more about the steak than the waitress. I think he thought I was about to cry because of the food as I don't recall really mentioning how awful the waitress was and how I felt bullied into getting a pasta dish. He insisted that I get another steak. When I told him I really lost my appetite, he insisted that we get it to-go. I appreciated how hard he was trying to make it right, so I accepted. As I'm speaking to him, the waitress comes out with the pasta dish and speaks in an alarmingly sweet voice to me. The manager looked surprised, which is why I'm assuming I didn't clearly explain everything. The dish itself was not good. The pasta was overcooked and was salty and acidic. I took two bites and left the rest. She takes the pasta away and comes back shortly to ask what I want for dessert. I tell her I don't want any dessert. When she comes out with the check, I realize she had the gall to charge us for my unfinished meal. We ask for the manager again and he graciously offers to take care of it. I think there must have been a lack of communication between the waitress and the manager as she sidles over again and asks if she can take the incorrect check. My boyfriend tells her we're waiting for the manager. She then proceeds to wordlessly take our placemats out from under our arms. Seemed like a passive aggressive way to tell us to leave as I saw bussers clearing EMPTY tables. The manager personally brings us our check and we are finally able to leave. I didn't get the manager's name, but he's the Caucasian man with curly light brown/blond hair and blue eyes. He really tried his best to make things right, and I feel bad that I wasn't able to explain things clearly. I hope he knows that I didn't want or eat that pasta dish. I was not trying to get free food. I literally told him to just charge me for the dip so I could leave. Honestly, I normally wouldn't get so emotional, but I had a terrible week (lost a source of income, father had a medical emergency, etc.) and this was supposed to be my special pick-me-up date with my boyfriend. Regardless of my week, the service should have been better. The manager gets 4.5/5 stars as he didn't seem to communicate with the waitress about the bill and I never got an apology from her. I have a really bad taste in my mouth, and it wasn't from the food.

There's nothing like paying $400 for a room, trying to share a couple birthday drinks with a couple friends  over some dinner, and some girl comes by and ruins the whole VIBE. The 60 seconds that she was clearing our table, we got a blank rude stare at my brother as he put his dirty napkin aside because he honestly thought she was clearing those as well, she looked at him long and hard saying "" um what is this?"" As she threw it back to the side... we were so shocked and we were speechless. ""What you want me to get you a clean one? Can't you see my hands are full..""  something along those lines....I understand we all have bad days, but for those few seconds that you're around people who are trying to make the most out of their dinning experience, you put a smile on even if you have to fake it !...she was so mad that as she walked away, she literally turned back to us and gave me the dirtiest look.

Started off with the sheep's milk ricotta which was delicious and then the experience went downhill from there. We then had the fritto misto which is a mix of various seafood. The dish was unbearably over salted and would highly recommend you skip it if you do choose to come here. We also had the fire-roasted cabbage. It was meh at best. The classic pizza was flavorless. The hanger steak WAS TERRIBLE. The steak was impossible to chew -- was pretty much what I imagine chewing a tire to be like. One of the members in our party had malfadini pasta. It was also flavorless.For dessert, we had the pistachio cake which was nothing special and the bomboloni di Leuca.

After our initial order was taken and brought our shortly after, our waitress went on break without notice. For about 30 minutes we were left unattended until I got the attention of another waitress. Before I move on I'd like to add that the food was OK at best (3 stars). For being known as an Italian restaurant even the pizza was sub-par. Back to the service, after getting the attention of the new waitress and notifying her that the previous server had not been to our table since taking our order the new waitress then left us unattended to return only with our bill (we had planned in ordering more drinks and coffee). I proceeded to walk up to the bar myself to order drinks for the table. In comparison to Westlight, which is located on the top floor of this same hotel Lueca is certainly lacking.

We order a salad to share for the table and then each their own dish, being the chicken for two, the steak( amazing) fish bass and the mushroom pasta ( the portion a bit small). All very tasty yes, I have to agree , but not worth it the wait.  What i can't understand why they haven't at least brought the salad that we order to share at least, so the wait was shorter? Everything came at once, and we wait a bit longer for the fish dish.",0,0,0,Olga V.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",0,1,0

5.0,4/15/2017,"One of my favorite dining experiences to date since moving to New York. You have to check this place out - worth the hike to Williamsburg.I had originally bookmarked this place for its uni pasta dish, which to my dismay, had been replaced on the menu with the black shells dish (still in search of a delicious uni pasta dish, if anyone has any recs!). My group of 8 was seated at a long group table. The atmosphere of this place can be described as trendy, intimate, and overall just very ""in"" and a cool place to be for dinner Friday night. The staff members were all very accommodating and hospitable - every single one them.We started with the garlic, honey, ricotta dip for the table. I honestly could've eaten the entire thing straight, with a spoon, alone. It was THAT delicious. Although it sounds like an odd mix of flavors, trust me, it is a crowd pleaser. We then split one of the tuna starters and two small pizzas as our appetizers. For my entree, I got the black shells pasta - everyone wanted a taste of mine because it was absolutely delicious.

5.0,4/6/2017,"Pretty upscale place located in Williamsburg inside the Williams Vale hotel. I liked everything about it - the food, the ambiance, decor, service, etc. It's a tapas restaurant and the food was southern Italian, which is supposedly lighter. I didn't know many things on the menu, but we ordered the sheep ricotta with honey dip which was delicioussss! I can eat more of that right now! Also got the black shelled shrimp and calamari pasta dish and the steak for the main. It was just us 2 so three dishes were enough for us to share everything.Didn't get to try the other dishes but I would definitely like to come back and try their pizzas and desserts as well. Also their menu changed and some of the dishes are already off their menu from 5 months ago - like the sea urchin spaghetti that I wanted to try was no longer on the menu.After dinner, definitely to go upstairs to Westlight for a drink.

2.0,3/31/2017,"i would have rated this a 4 but i will explain why I'm giving it 2 stars.i came here for a birthday in November with a group of about 14 people - loved the atmosphere, loved the ambiance. food was GOOD, but not worth the price. portions were very small, service was kind of slow (it was a Saturday but the place wasn't packed). a lot of the dishes are not traditional Italian food, which I'm not opposed to trying. i figured since its a nice spot for an intimate dinner, maybe I'll plan my birthday dinner here for April.i call to make a reservation & I'm told the event coordinator has to get back to me because a party my size is considered a private event & i would have to be in a separate room. When i went with a party the same size in November, we were sitting with a table among the rest of the restaurant - guess a new policy since this spot got a little popular?i receive an email with a breakdown of how parties that size work -- apparently parties the size of 11 or more are considered a private event & are required to work off of the ""family style pre-fixed menu"" which is $90/pp. i'm then told the bill minimum has to be $3,000 NOT including tax & tip. REALLY? so i have to spend $1,260 on food & then another $1,740 on beverages? what if we're all recovering alcoholics? kind of ballsy to tell someone in order to come to their restaurant you have to spend X amount of dollars, just saying. I've heard of this pathetic policy at all of these overrated clubs/restaurants in NYC, but not from a recently opened RESTAURANT in a hotel in Brooklyn.I was really turned off & decided i will not be having any future get togethers at this restaurant by choice. word of advice -- do not make dinner plans here for parties 11 and over unless you want to spend $300+ on small portioned food.",0,0,0,Gia C.,"New York, NY",3,26,4
5.0,3/26/2017,"I've been waiting to check out the William Vale since it opened. Everything that went into constructing the property and it's surrounding area seems perfect. When I found out about the restaurant below and the reviews I had to go.  Leuca is a great dining experience and was a great choice. You come into the main dining room and forget you walked in from the streets of NYc. It feels like a restaurant that's in the Four Seasons. Great open space and beautiful decor plus an exotic feel. You're  just waiting for some one to open a window that's looking out to Carribean water. The food was stellar.  We had the Tuna Crudo, Wood Fired Cabbage and the ricotta plate to start. We then shared the pesto pasta. All dishes ranged from $12 - $20. We werent eating meat but two guys next to us ordered the Duck and it was massive and looked delicious. Next time.That plus a bottle of wine&dessert, and the bill was $150. I thought that was extremely fair. Great place to enjoy a relaxing meal and then head up to their rooftop for a cocktail.",0,0,1,Joe G.,"CANAL STREET, NY",59,144,16
4.0,3/23/2017,"Leuca is well worth a visit. The bar area is large, plush and comfortable. The restaurant itself verges on an open kitchen that you can observe if you wish. The service was friendly and mostly efficient (but not entirely, as they neglected to pour our wine until we had to ask them, as the bottle was in a chiller some distance away).The only real complaint is the absence of any real light. The place is so dimly lit that you need a flashlight to actually see the food, and if you don't have a light with you, the menus may well be undecipherable. The lack of lighting is the reason I deducted a star from this review.(Small rant here: I just do not get what seems to be the current fashion in menu design: small, sometimes even tiny, print in a color that blends into the menu color. It makes reading the menu a real task, and it usually means that you will miss something, if not everything. It is as bad or worse than having a waitperson recite eight or nine dishes that are not on the menu. Why do restaurants do this? Why not have a menu that is readable to everyone, regardless of age, and print out a list of the specials if there are more than one or two?) The food is excellent, at least what we had. We started with the smoky eggplant dip, accompaned by the good bread, and we thoroughly enjoyed the rich, creamy dip. It made us want to try the other dips they offer, but that will have to wait. Next were the smoked beet salad and the fire roasted cabbage, two random appetizers. Both were not only amazingly good, they were generously portioned. We were unable to finish either, as we wanted enough room to enjoy the main courses.My wife had the burrata mezzaluna pasta and I tried the steak vesuvius after our waiter told us the cut they use is the hanger steak, among my favorites. We both felt we could return just to have the burrata mezzaluna dish again. It is impossible to describe the dish, as we could only see it with the light from our cellphone. It was luscious, perfectly done pasta with stringy cheese on top, a delight to eat.The hanger steak was memorable (and I am remembering it right now), but I'd probably order something else next time, mainly to try some of the other dishes. The kitchen knows how to create top notch Italian fare, and it would be a serious error not to try some of their other dishes.Although the prices are reasonable (until you get to the main courses), they can add up pretty quickly. But it would be mean-spirited to deny the place the opportunity to make a profit. Perhaps they can invest in some real lighting.",1,0,0,George L.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,27,0

For starters, they serve an excellent Italian-variety cup of coffee. Our server allowed us a gracious amount of time to enjoy our coffee while reviewing the menu, from which I ordered the lemon-ricotta pancakes and sampled some of my boyfriend's baked eggs.  I was not at all expecting to be impressed by the pancakes, but they are now counted among one of the most delectable breakfasts I've ever had.  Covered in a very generous heaping of crushed pine nuts, drizzled in butter, and served with maple syrup on the side (ya know - the good stuff), each bite was perfect.  I left Leuca knowing that I had just enjoyed a meal that I would be hard-pressed to recreate at home.",2,1,1,Stephanie U.,"New York, NY",6,41,2

4.0,2/28/2017,"KenScale: 8.0/10It's no secret that I am in love with most of chef Andrew Carmellini's restaurants in the city, starting with the rustic Italian paradise Locanda Verde. I've always been enamored with how chef Carmellini's kitchen always seems to achieve brilliance with effortlessness and simplicity of ingredients and technique. When his NoHo Hospitality team decided to venture outside Manhattan to open a new project inside the shiny William Vale hotel in Williamsburg, though, I wondered whether he was stretching a little bit too thin. I haven't been to the William Vale hotel up to the point I had visited Leuca, but from the looks of it, it seemed totally out of place in the Williamsburg neighborhood with its giant, intimidating building and glitzy decors, although it seemed like a great place to go to the rooftop in the summer, in direct competition to the Wythe Hotel that was ruling the Brooklyn rooftop scene until then. Hotel restaurants are always a tricky proposition. Locanda Verde was such a great exception because even though it is attached to the Greenwich Hotel in TriBeCa, it really functioned like a standalone dining space with its distinct vibe. On the other hand, would Leuca be buried under the lights from the brand-new William Vale and at the same lose its identity (and, even worse, quality of food)? My recent visit with my girlfriend showed enough from the restaurant that I think Leuca is not just a cheesy hotel restaurant, or (thankfully) a copycat of Locanda Verde.The menu at Leuca focuses on southern Italian cuisine. Locanda Verde has been famous for its sheep's milk ricotta cheese, and the one in Leuca was equally delicious, this time accompanied by hot honey and garlic that gave a pleasantly spicy kick that my girlfriend just couldn't stop raving about. We also enjoyed fire-roasted cabbage with Caesar flavors, which tasted a bit too salty at first but over time grew on us as we learned that the salty sensation really came from anchovy and nothing else. We also ordered a pizza pie and a pasta dish. The OG pizza with pepperoni, nduja and Fresno chili was serviceable, but it would've been even better if seasoning were slightly toned down. On the other hand, the big surprise for us was the black shells pasta accompanied by ruby shrimp and local calamari that displayed really nice balance of flavor and texture. It's not often that you don't get bored with a pasta dish from start to finish, but we savored every single scoop. For dessert, we went with the server's recommendation and ordered Sicilian pistachio cake with olive oil ice cream, which was so delightfully (but not overwhelmingly sweet) that, even though we were quite full by the time this dish came out, we finished it within a minute. Getting a reservation wasn't too difficult, and the restaurant space is quite large, so you may get lucky and have an opportunity to dine at Leuca without a reservation. There is full bar with extensive Italian wine selections with emphasis on southern Italy and Sicily. The dining space feels more modern and geometrical than Locanda Verde but overall it still worked as a trendy space where you can take your date or have a casual dinner with friends. I'm glad Leuca stands on its own as a viable Italian restaurant in the Williamsburg dining scene notwithstanding its presence in the William Vale hotel. It seems chef Carmellini has struck a nice balance of opening a shining new project that still ensures that the quality of food from his other fine restaurants stays on.",7,1,2,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738

5.0,2/20/2017,"Simply perfect. I came here on a Saturday night with both my girlfriend's and my parents for a birthday celebration. Our table was positioned in the front bar area and although that area was full of energy it was a bit too loud for the parentals! Instead the front of house were able to put in a table in the back dining room for just twenty more minutes. Perfect amount of time for us to get some great cocktails at the bar. Once our table was ready, the restaurant was able to transfer the tab to the table and a hostess moved our drinks over on a silver platter (literally). Both my girlfriend and I have some food allergies which can be challenging at Italian restaurants. Leuca was a complete exception, they did a phenomenal job accommodating to a cows milk and gluten allergy. Our server was very knowledgable of the entire menu and was able to make suggestions and modifications to meet our needs. We started out with the sheep's milk ricotta, hot honey and garlic. Amazing. We also had the artichokes leaving everyone wanting more. Others at the table also had the shaved fennel salad which was a crowd pleaser. The main attraction this time was the Lamb. It is a braised Lamb shoulder with a side of char grilled or roasted potatoes with pesto and also yogurt for those without a dairy allergy. It was enough to feed three comfortable and maybe able to stretch out to four people. It was one of the most delicious peices of lamb I have ever had.

3.0,2/15/2017,"Service here is impeccable, food is meh. Came here last night for Valentine's Day. Before making the reservation I inquired if it would be possible for us to go upstairs to the rooftop bar Westlight and the woman said yeah sure. Big reason why we chose this place, because we figured we would have a drink upstairs and check out the view after. Did not think nor were we told that a reservation was needed for one drink. Appetizers were a blob of ricotta with honey and some seaweed flakes on top. Just okay, like how much ricotta can you have? Then came a shaved fennel salad with Parmesan and green apple- not a huge fan of raw shaved fennel which overpowered the dish and the citrusy vinaigrette didn't really bring the dish together like I would have liked. Then there was a tuna sashimi appetizer which I have had at countless restaurants before, it tasted the same as everywhere else I've had it. Out of the first course this was the best dish. For the second course, there were scallops which were cooked very well but they were on a bed of grains which were swimming in this citrus dressing which overpowered the dish. With that came the sweet potato gnocchi which was deelish!!... not enough of it though in my opinion. We slopped that up but we were still hungry by the time the entrees came. For the entree course, there was a half lobster which was the star of the show! The lobster was cooked to perfection and I loved how the clarified butter was right in the shell so no dipping necessary and it was super juicy. The steak on the other hand left a lot to be desired. They didn't ask how we would like it cooked, It came out medium rare which I would not have preferred and it was a bit chewy. It came next to a red pepper and walnut type spread which I have had at Mediterranean places before. They didn't add much to it. After dinner I still felt hungry and we did not leave anything on the plate except for the some shaved fennel and some ricotta. Dessert was coffee ice cream with some toppings, it was good, not great. When we were done with our pricey meal -- spent $300 including tip with only 2 drinks -- I asked the hostess again if we could check out Westlight and she directed us to the hotel lobby. When we got there, we were rudely rejected by the bouncer who asked If we had reservations, when I said no he started shaking his head right away, did not care that we are just coming from Leuca and they told us it would be no problem. Refused to even consider accommodating us even if when I asked if we could literally go up there for 5 minutes just to look at the view, he said the manager said absolutely no one up there without a reservation. The lack of coordination between the restaurant and sister bar upstairs was disappointing and the bouncers pretentious attitude about the whole thing left us feeling like we did not want to return to either place.",0,0,0,Svetlana k.,"Manhattan, NY",144,5,0

There's a lot of options on the menu and we had several from each category except dessert.The apps were the best - the cauliflower very good. The pizza, which has been getting a lot of press, was eh. The food is VERY SALTY - it may doesn't taste overly salty but you can feel yourself swelling as you eat. The lamb meat was very tender.  The pastas also ""eh"".  There wasn't anything we wanted to finish - we brought it home and I know we will throw it out. It wasn't horrible, but nothing special- I wouldn't even say it was good.  I'm annoyed bc we were running late and I called to let them know and I was told they would hold my res for 15 min, which was a JOKE, bc I saw wide open availability on Open Table, and the restaurant was empty when we arrived and departed. I think it's a chic environment for drinks and a bite, but I wouldn't recommend for a meal.",0,0,0,Jillian b.,"Manhattan, NY",83,18,0

4.0,1/31/2017,"It being restaurant week, we went with the $29, 3 course offerings on that menu. The shandy cocktail was strong, tasty and decently sized. The $10 glass of Sardinian red wine was also quite good for the price, as a restaurant week special.  The semolina breadwith a little side of olive oil was wonderful, but could have been way better with somefresh ricotta dip, but this I will save for the next time.  A few more suggestions on the part of the servers could liven up lunch here. I kind of like it when a server asks: ""Is this your first time here? Do you care to hear more about the menu?""The tuna crudo was excellent, as several reviewers here already agreed. The lamb sausage,was also very well prepared, as were the black shells with calamari. The food came pretty fast, the plates were fairly small, and that left me feeling like something was not right about the experience. Maybe it was just too little food for that $29 price point, so my suggestion is, if you go here with a decent appetite, just order from the regular menu. The pizza looked good but not huge, and may make a good little appetizer. The panini plates needed a little more going on, like maybe some green salad or a few olives. I had a similar feeling about lunch at ""Little Park"", Andrew C's other restaurant in downtown Manhattan.  The chocolate budino was excellent and was the citrus panna cotta, although this last dessert felt oddly out of place on a cold, snowy day in January.  The service was efficient, but the decor felt pretty bland, too monochromatic for such a large space that begged for more color and texture, leaving one feeling that this was a restaurantsomewhere in Orlando and not in Williamsburg.  Bright flower arrangements, modern table linens and some edgy art work could liven this space up considerably.The enormous, white glass hotel lobby walls were an imposing and somewhat anemic backdrop to this space and seemed to be fighting with it. The ultra modern, minimalistarchitecture of the building related not in the least to the beige and brown, very conservativerestaurant upholstery and light wood country dining tables. More needs to happen with the interior design here to get it out of the 90's.",0,0,0,Lucienne D.,"Hoboken, NJ",17,171,0
4.0,1/29/2017,"Our experience at Leuca two nights ago was very similar to a previous review posted by Kate S. which I hadn't seen until after having dined here. Wish I could say this was a 10 across the board but the real issue with this place is their service and truly nothing else.  The decor, atmosphere, food...all really quite nice!  Some of the waitstaff though...could use help.  Especially for a place of this caliber and after having read other reviews on this, I know it wasn't just a fluke experience only we had. My husband and I were really pumped about finally eating here especially after having watched this building go up in the last couple years.  Here lies our issues:Like the previous reviewer, our dinner took 2.5 hours for TWO people!  This is only because of the lack of attention our waitress gave us. 1: When seated, it seemed like forever for anyone to come up and greet us to the point where a gentlemen whom, I'm assuming was the manager, actually walked over to us concerned that we hadn't been taken care of yet.  Now, we're not ones for making anyones job harder as we've been in the service industry ourselves but we had to let him know we've been there a while and were frankly starving at this point.  He politely took our appetizer order.  When our waitress finally came over she didn't even seem to be apologetic for the lack of attention and that we had already proceeded to order our appetizer with the manager.  She just seemed like ""okay great so you're taken care of"" and almost walked away before my husband had to stop her so we could finally order our main course.  Sheep's milk ricotta and hot honey spread was insanely amazing though when it did show up.2: Again, like the previous reviewer, had we known this was a ""come as it's ready"" place we probably would have ordered differently or at least requested they both come at the same time since we were not interested in each other dishes (I don't like spicy food).  But we had no idea and would have appreciated the heads up like most other restaurants would give.Overall, the experience with our waitress was what left us feeling disappointed about the whole experience and don't plan to be back for dinner unless it's just sitting at the bar for a quick app or something.",0,0,0,Danielle D.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,4,1

Even on a frigid day in January, the interior is very warm and inviting.Our waitress was decent, but could've been a bit more enthusiastic. She also flip flopped our Bloody Mary order, but was happy to correct it once she realized her mistake... but she couldn't tell the difference between the spicy one and other one (you can also tell the difference in consistency/smell). For food, we ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes to share between us- delicious and not terribly heavy! My friend ordered the polenta waffles and they looked great, but she left a bit on her plate (could've been the hangover haha).My dad and his girlfriend ordered the eggs al forno (basically baked eggs) and both finished their dishes completely! My dad also really liked the side of bread that came with it. The Bloody Mary i had could've had a little more vodka in it and less ice, but maybe that was a good thing. I ordered the burrata pasta because I'm a sucker for anything w burrata... and this dish was very light, but not terribly flavorful. It missed some salt or spice or something with a pop!

4.0,1/25/2017,"First impressions...why does Williamsburg need another Italian restaurant? But me being the Italian food lover I am, I couldn't resist. Plus with it being heavy on the southern Italian I was all in. FYI southern Italian food is 10x better than the north. We had:Sheep's Milk Ricotta with Hot Honey & Garlic (really amazing, pretty close to how its made in Italy)Smoky Eggplant with Basil & Onion CondimentoSmoked Beets, Pistachio, Ricotta SalataClassic - Tomato, Mozzarella, Basil  (really good Neapolitan style pizza)Burrata Mezzaluna, Marjoram, Pecorino RagusanaI'm not going to go too much into depth about each dish but everything was really amazing, rich, and, tasty. The portions are smaller so you may need to order two dishes, but wow everything was fantastic. Every dish is heavy on flavor and herbs and you can't go wrong with that. Someone mentioned the food was salty, however if anyone has visited Italy most of the dishes are salty. I don't think that is necessarily a bad thing here, but that comes down to what you like also. Service was fantastic and very attentive. Wine list is really heavy on the southern wine (as it should be) and not terribly over priced. I really enjoyed their selection, as it's not typical of other restaurants for the most part. The restaurant is pretty sex inside. Dark and romantic...if that's what you like. From someone who eats a lot of Italian food, I highly recommend it. However, if you're old school like my Italian father in law and like massive dishes and don't care about how a place looks inside then you might not like it here. Bottom line go.

The Monica cocktail was tasty and the service was great, but my main critique is that the sea urchin pasta was so salty that I almost couldn't eat it. And this is coming from someone who would gladly eat ramen three times a week if I could (aka my salt tolerance is pretty high). The black shells pasta was pretty good, but also on the salty side. I must have drunk three glasses of water after I left. I'm kind of hoping it was an off night, since we went at around 8 PM on a Thursday and the restaurant was pretty empty, but disappointing all the same.",1,0,0,Alice C.,"Manhattan, NY",94,46,12
5.0,1/12/2017,"I came here last night for a work dinner prior to going to a show at Brooklyn Bowl and it did not disappoint. We ordered the ricotta and chickpea dips and then the artichoke and duck egg, cauliflower, mussels and clams, and the shrimp as antipastis, and finally the OG pizza, burratta mezzaluna and spicy sea urchin spaghetti. The favorites were the ricotta dip, I could absolutely take a bath in that stuff it was deliciously creamy with a crunch from the roasted garlic. Pro tip - is saving a little bit to put on your OG pizza. The spicy urchin spaghetti has been on my dishes to get list for a while and it also did not disappoint, same with the cauliflower. I could pass on the mussels and clam and bacon wrapped shrimp but were still very good if you love seafood.

5.0,1/3/2017,"A really great experience, from beginning to end. Came here, not really understanding where the entrance was, but finally made our way through the entrance, which had no windows. I think that was what threw us off. When we entered, I was stunned at the sheer amount of space, including the front bar area, which even had a few booths lining the sides. Then we were whisked into the main dining room, where the open kitchen was. The decor is rustic, with a hint of modern art lining the ceilings. A pretty nice homey touch, and elegant at the same time.The menu had a big number of choices, ranging from the dips, to the antipasti, and pizzas. We figured we should try a little from each part of the menu, antipasti notwithstanding. First off, I have to say the sheep's milk ricotta with hot honey and garlic is insanely good. We kept asking for more complimentary bread to dip into the ricotta, and we were almost full before the entrees came. Thankfully, we left some space for the rest of the food we got: OG Pizza (pepperoni, nduja, Fresno chili), spicy sea urchin spaghetti, and Chicken ""Rosalina"" for two. The OG pizza was really great, and had a nice crispy crust. The spicy uni spaghetti came with a decent amount of uni, and the spaghetti had a nice firm chew to it. The Chicken Rosalina was delicious, and there wasn't a dry bite throughout the chicken, which was unheard of. The 4 of us plowed through everything, even though we had already eaten so much bread and ricotta, and we were full to bursting at the end. Nonetheless, we still ordered two desserts: the Sicilian pistachio cake with olive oil ice cream, and the chocolate budino with hazelnut gelato and sea salt. Both were very good, and the olive oil taste was very subtle and delicious.Our server was very attentive throughout the meal, and gave us good recommendations for drinks, and what would be enough to feed our 4 hungry stomachs. Prices are on the expensive side, especially for Brooklyn, but everything was of top-notch quality and execution, so I'll say it's definitely worth the price.  Will definitely be back to try that suckling pig. Hoo-wee. A neighboring table ordered it, and the smell was intoxicating. Made me really crave it, even though it was well after our meal and we were super full. So yeah, it will be an easy decision to go back to try that, not to mention the many other things on the menu.

3.0,1/3/2017,"Decided to come after seeing photo after photo of the amazing looking spicy uni spaghetti on Instagram. Overall, our meal here was okay but not amazing for the price. It's served in a sharing-style, which was fine by us. Food came out hot. In order of how much we liked the food we got: 1) fennel salad, local apple, pecorino ($14)2) tuna crudo, green olives, chili, crispy farro ($16) 3) cauliflower fritto, meyer lemon aioli ($9)4) steak vesuvius ($32, with tomatoes, peppers, and onions) 5) artichokes alla gricia, duck egg, guanciale ($16)6) spicy sea urchin spaghetti ($24)We were both definitely underwhelmed by the spicy sea urchin spaghetti that had looked so good on instagram. But the fennel salad was heaven, a delightful blend of sweet, crunchy, salty, and melt-in-your-mouth good. And the tuna crudo was exquisite, also wonderfully paired to create an amazing taste sensation. My husband wasn't into the heavy breading on the cauliflower, but I liked it, especially paired with the delectable lemony mayo dip. Also, the bread and olive oil brought out for the table was super delicious and a great way to start the meal. The wine list is entirely Italian. As we aren't that familiar with the Italian wines they had, we weren't sure what to get and described our preferences to our waitress, who ultimately recommended two wines we really didn't like. I drank mine, but my husband was unhappy enough that he asked to change after his tasting and was much happier with the second one he got, thanks to the woman who came by with the tasting.

Well our server was somewhat underwhelming. Somewhat detached and not very interested in walking us through the menu. But we felt it was a small price to pay for the excellent food.

They offered a la carte menu. Our server, Katana, was great. She was knowledgeable, friendly and so cute. It's shared plates so I got to try a lot.  Starters: ricotta with hot honey, 18th street pizza, bone marrow and smoked beets. These all may sound like simple dishes but the flavors are so elevated.  They smokiness of the beets really came through. I've never had anything like that, it was really delicious. If you've eaten at Locande Verde, you know the ricotta is amazing.  All the starters are nicely sized. Pastas: spicy sea urchin spaghetti and broccoli rabe malfadini. Meat dish: grilled lamb. Fish: local bass. Again, all the dishes were well generously portioned for sharing. The sea urchin spaghetti was the perfect balance of briney-ness and creaminess with a slight bite of spice.  The malfadini was so unique.  I do like this type of pasta and very few restaurants in NY offer it.  Broccoli rabe makes this dish slightly bitter in a good way. Very hearty for a vegetarian dish.  The bass was on a bed of beans was cooked perfectly, so delicate and flavorful.  We couldn't leave without having desserts after such a wonderful meal.  We got the pistachio cake with olive oil ice cream, budino, gelato (olive oil and espresso were yummy) and the cheesecake was absolutely devine.

5.0,12/30/2016,"I'm usually wary of new restaurants, and also restaurants housed in hotels, but Leuca was thoroughly impressive. It's gorgeous and spacious, a bit of old school glamour with new-school Brooklyn quirk. The entire place just oozes good taste and luxury, and I would kill for a bottle of their room perfume.Go with a large group so you can 1) sit in a huge cushy leather sofa, and 2) order the crispy suckling pig to share. That pig must have been raised with a lot of TLC... not very ""porky"" or fatty at all, it had a really clean flavor, tender meat, and crazy crispy skin. We were picking the last bits of meat off the bones, just stopping short of manhandling the ribs and going at it with hands and teeth because the dining room is not that sort of place. I also loved the fire-roasted cabbage, a sort of cooked rendition of a caesar salad. It took cabbage to places I never thought it could go. The Cauliflower fritto were nice bites for sharing. Pizzas are of the super thin-crust, charred variety (a bit too much char for my taste) - the OG and 18th avenue pizzas were pretty good. I liked the pastas better, especially the malfadini which are ribbon-like noodles that have good chew and pick up the sauce nicely. The sauce of pesto and sweet and sour pepper is just different enough to be interesting but not weird. Although some believe that sea urchin is overdone, I love it and wished there was more in the spicy sea urchin spaghetti (it was still very good). For dessert, my favorite was the Budino. Afterwards, we went up to Westlight, the rooftop bar at the hotel, and I highly recommend you stop by to take in the stunning views. It's pretty spectacular, and you can even see some stars on this side of the Big Apple.",3,1,3,Lillian Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",462,285,1300
1.0,12/29/2016,"The food tasted excellent and if you are an allergy free eater, I highly recommend this restaurant. However, I have celiac disease and ended up quite sick after dinner here. I, as I usually do, explained to the waiter and the hostess that I couldn't eat gluten or dairy. No one ever asked about the severity of my aversions. They did recommend some good options and I chose to have the steak which had onions and other charred veggies on top. Unfortunately after eating a few bites I discovered that the steak had been sprinkled with breadcrumbs. The waiter did check with the chef after I asked about the steak, determined there was an error made in the kitchen and the manager both gave me a new steak and comped it. Like I said before, I do think for a normal diner, this place is great. I just felt there was a lack of concern and attention given to the fact that I am unable to eat gluten. The waiter didn't even apologize! I realize gluten free living is a trend and so some people can get away with eating a bit, I am not one of those people however and I feel at a minimum they should have inquired about the severity of my aversion so they could take appropriate steps and precautions to avoid making me sick.",1,0,0,Amy K.,"Boston, MA",2,15,0

4.0,12/18/2016,"I would love to say I enjoyed everything but I really loved only the spicy sea urchin spaghetti dish. Also tried the tuna crudo, the OG pizza, the burrata ravioli, the lobster, the tomahawk, and finished with the pistachio cake which ended the dinner nicely. The hotel that houses the restaurant is unique and looks very pretty with lights around the trees (it is holiday season after all). I have to say my taste buds are spoiled. Living in NYC, I have the opportunity to try many different kinds of food and even dishes with similar ingredients prepared differently. There was nothing at all that was wrong. I just felt some of the dishes were average compared to other restaurants of the same caliber.I would definitely recommend the sea urchin pasta dish and the lobster dish and pistachio cake as they all pleased my senses with unique flavors. The tuna and the tomahawk were leaning towards slightly bland for me. The tomahawk had a lot (but I guess acceptable) amounts of fat which made chewing a little difficult. The OG pizza met my standards although I was hoping to bite into a surprise. Perhaps my expectations were too high. I feel the ingredients listed (Pepperoni, Nduja, Fresno Chili) are becoming typical now. I was impressed though there's a lot of wood-grilling which you can smell outside the restaurant. The burrata ravioli simply did nothing for me. It is interesting though you can feel the burrata burst in your mouth as you bite into the ravioli and the burrata was fresh tasting but I did not enjoy the accompaniment- would've preferred burrata on its own.But oooh the spicy sea urchin spaghetti - the sea urchin is mixed into the perfectly cooked spaghetti and has a hint of heat/spice that gave it a tasty creamy, simple yet complex flavor. I've had sea urchin with pasta before but never was it blended into the sauce like this dish. The lobster has a kick too (almost Cajun flavor) and was very easy to eat as the meat is prepared is outside and placed back in its shell. Nice preparation and nice amount of meat. The pistachio cake with olive oil ice cream was brilliant. The cake on its own is scrumptious and is heavenly when paired with the ice cream. Don't always need chocolate to end the meal although the other desserts all sounded interesting too.Setting is generally dark and intriguing. Service was attentive although almost robotic. Overall I had a positive experience even if I felt the dishes I tried this visit were spotty.

2.0,11/30/2016,"I really wanted to like my experience at Leuca, but the service/experience is leaving an unfortunate taste in my mouth. We went out for dinner, and had a number of issues with the way things went. Firstly, this dinner took 2.5 hours, mostly because of the slowness of the service. We were not really looking for a total evening affair and were exhausted by the end of it. Pet peeves:1. This is a 'come as it's ready' sort of share-plate place. Had I realized this before I may have declined, because it was 2 other couples, and we have widely different tastes and wanted very different food. So, unfortunately, this meant that at times, people had no food, some people had food, and it was constantly awkward. I really don't appreciate dining experiences like this, and while I get the concept, it really should be able to be delivered in either way. This was not ideal for our group.2. Attentiveness of the service was lack thereof. I felt like we were constantly looking for our server and trying to get help. This is frustrating for a place of this calibur and price, and it was definitely added annoyance that there seemed to be tons of staff milling around and not doing much. Couldn't they have checked on our table?  3. The food was great but not outstanding. I thought the tuna crudo was great, but everything else was fairly standard italian fare.4. The most unnerving part of this is at the end, we wanted to use cash and just put a nominal amount on our debit card, but the server did not do this correctly. It's now 5 days later and I still have a 400 dollar hold on my account (my DEBIT account mind you) and the charge that they eventually charged to my account. So I have 500+ dollars that this place has put on my card right now. This is absolutely unprofessional and ridiculous. No amends was made, no future discount for this, not even a complimentary beverage or dessert. Perhaps this is okay to people with loads of money in their checking account but this is still setting me back and really preventing me from thinking of going back here and from paying a bill I would like to pay.Overall, this place is pretty, is nice and big for Williamsburg, but until they iron out the kinks in their service, I'm not tempted to go back there. Disappointing as I had super high expectations, and was really looking forward to it. Oh, did I mention it was my birthday? Awful birthday experience. Thanks Leuca!

3.0,11/23/2016,"Bummmed out. We checked out Westlight a few weeks ago and loved everything so we had pretty high expectations for Leuca, but the food was subpar at best. Cabbage Caesar was delicious. Cauliflower app was good, but nothing special. The pasta? Woof. Overcooked and had way too much going on. The flavors were all muddled and the overall texture was off. We didn't have pizza, but the table next to us did and it looked oily and boring. We skipped dessert to avoid further disappointment. Staff was pleasant, but inexperienced and not what I expected from an upscale restaurant. Ambiance is really beautiful, I'll give them that! I'm sure it's bound to get better, but I'm not sure I want to give it second chance any time soon.",1,0,0,Marcy L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,28,0

4.0,11/17/2016,"Well its been awhile, very chic restaurant with a rustic feel to it. For starters this place was in the basement of a hotel in a cool area. As you come downstairs you are greeted in a very friendly manner and seated. We were here for lunch, definitely coming back for dinner. We started off with sheep milk ricotta with warm honey toasted garlic and fried basil. Very good dish to eat solo if you love cheese or just to spread on the fresh semolina bread they give you with the warm olive oil. Olives stuffed with Almonds the great part of this was that no overpowered brine flavor to compete with. Tuna crudo with toasted farro was like crack,,,,, Now the pasta was the real deal al dente goat bolognese with shaved parm, tasty.Squid ink spaghetti i think with cuttlefish, stronger flavors going on but recommended for a pescatarian surely. A comped pizza from their wood  burning oven, the char on it is what gave that pie character.You know Ive been to Italy and eating at LEUCA shows that they have it down pat and are not getting over and selling Italian American food.They are doing it well or not even doing it at all.Can't wait for Dinner here and desserts.",0,0,0,Ooooo M.,"Ozone Park, NY",12,42,167

3.0,11/16/2016,"Upon arrival, you can't help but be blown away by the architecture and design of the restaurant. I've seen Williamsburg get built up around us over the past 8 years, and while some may say the William Vale is an eye sore, you definitely have to experience it before knocking it. While waiting for our friends to arrive, we had a delicious (yet very pricey) cocktail at the bar. However, our friendly bartender was not so accommodating to our friend who asked if they had any non-alchoholic cocktails. His response was simply ""No."" Not even an offer to make anything without booze. Annoying, but moving on. The service was pretty great in the beginning of the meal, seemed like we had about 6 different servers taking orders and bringing out food, but they were attentive - at first. The waiter who took our order explained that the chef designed the menu so everyone could share every dish. However, when our antipasti arrived, we noticed that the 6 of us could probably have a small bite of each dish (the salads were slightly larger, but 2 prawns for an entire table to share? Blasphemy.) We all ordered our own pasta dishes, thankfully, to which the waiter noted that they would all be coming out at different times. He was not wrong. The four people who ordered the uni spaghetti (which was quite bland, everyone requested salt and pepper to season it), received their pastas a good 10 minutes before my husband and I received ours. thankfully, my goat fazzoletti was delicious, albeit on the smaller side compared to the spaghetti. the service tapered off towards the end of the meal. small things you would expect from a nicer restaurant they did not do, ie. folding a guest's napkin when they leave it on their chair when going to the restroom, bringing bread to enjoy the dip we ordered (how can you serve a dip without something to dip it in?), they finally brought it about 10 mins after we asked for it, by that time the dip was gone. i think the food was all-around delicious, but they should definitely not be selling their dishes as meant to be shared, especially for a table of 6, unless they want to increase their portions just a bit. also, the service can be improved upon. i know they just opened, so we are hopeful that they might work out the kinks in the coming months. however, we're not sure we'll be running back after dishing out almost $150 per couple for a slightly better than mediocre experience.",0,0,0,Emma R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,8,0
3.0,11/15/2016,"Beautiful restaurant, in a wonderful Williamsburg location. Service was attentive, but the  delivered some other tables' food (for 2) to our table (for 5) on multiple occassions. Nice bar program as well.  Food is where the issue is.  Waiter advised portions were meant to be family style, but the portions were erratic and often not condusive for sharing. A 9 oz steak? 2 lamb chops in an order.  The chicken was the only dish really big enough to be shared.  Chicken was very tasty but could have been accompanied by a few more shishito peppers (and the peppers could have been a little more blistered). Lamb was nice too.  Adding the ricotta spread to the pizza added a little pizzazz to an otherwise boring, but serviceable pizza selection.",1,0,0,Mike S.,"Mineola, NY",367,39,3
5.0,11/13/2016,"There is quite the choice of Italian restaurants in Brooklyn but few reach this level of service and sophistication. As a Brooklyn born Italian American I grew up eating plenty of southern Italian and Sicilian food but I've never had a version so expertly  crafted. It has all the familiar flavor profiles spicy, Agra dolce , anchovies, olive, breadcrumbs, pistachio etc. but combined and used in New and interesting ways like fire roasted cabbage with anchovies and bread crumbs or their version of steak pizzaiola which is topped with roasted tomatoes hazelnuts and grilled scallions. The standouts were the Campo Rosso salad with its blood orange and cured olive dressing, the aforementioned cabbage, the OG pizza which is the penultimate pepperoni pizza, the sea urchin spaghetti and the chicken Rosalina which takes 3 days to prepare and a beauty to behold. Do not leave without trying the standout desserts like the Sophia Loren(the largest craziest and most delicious afogato I've ever had) and the sublime pistachio cake. Perfetto from start to finish!",1,0,0,Robert M.,"Brooklyn, NY",106,8,8
