3.0,3/10/2019,"I am not a big fan of restaurant week, because I feel the kitchens usually try to cut corners on their menu... This is the first time I come to Perrine and I don't really know what to expect.  The style of the restaurant  is very classy and Upper East side... ( if you know what I mean . Hehe). Staffs are nice too But wait a minute.... you serve me Ribs and Fried Chicken ⁉⁉  I think I ll go somewhere else for that",0,0,0,Danny L.,"New York, NY",85,42,148
3.0,2/8/2019,"The food and service was excellent the last time I went and I was so excited to go again. To my disappointment, the food was not up to par and neither was the service. Besides waiting over 20 minutes for my drink because the waiter had forgotten, he told us about the additional supplemental fees for certain dishes on the restaurant week menu. Then when we ordered, we happen to choose one appetizer that had additional supplemental and one entrée that had additional supplemental as well, the waiter proceeded to tell us again about the extra cost, and I understand that they may have been misunderstanding in the past with other customers so he's reminding us but the fact that he forgot that he already told us was a little annoying. However, he was polite enough and did apologize but never came back to ask us if we needed more bread, another drink, or to check on us. Now let's talk about the food... the bread and butter was delicious as it should be at a French restaurant, I had the veal carpaccio for the appetizer and it was well-made but bland. I pushed my friend to order the lamb chops because last time it was so flavorful and tender, however this time around the lamb chops were bland and there wasn't enough sauce on the plate to help with that. The short ribs were Well cooked but nothinbut I really regret not ordering the buttermilk fried chicken. (I have been craving that for a long time). I thought it would be a waste to order a fried chicken in this sort of establishment. What a mistake... The apple tartin was okbut the nougat cake was mediocre at best.The meal itself took over two hours because it took more than 30 minutes to receive our appetizers and there was almost a 45 minute gap between the appetizer and entrée.To sum up, this is one of those disappointing meals when you come out of the restaurant full, yet unsatisfied. Where as last time, you came out saying to yourself ""money well spent"".",0,1,0,Catherine Y.,"Queens, NY",6,54,195

5.0,2/5/2019,"Its Restaurant Week and decided to try Perrine because of the Yelp rating and their menu. It turned out to be an excellent choice.Appetizers included butternut squash, tuna tartar and steak tartar, all of which we enjoyed. Entrees were short ribs (big thumbs up!) and lamb chops which was full of flavor and melted in your mouth. We all had the apple tart for dessert, a perfect ending to our meal. The room is quiet so conversations can be had at normal levels. Service was polite and attentive, yet not overbearing in the least. Decor was nice and chairs were comfortable.

1.0,2/3/2019,"Such high/expensive hopes were dashed upon our entry to this restaurant (a part of The Taj Pierre in NYC) We reserved the late seating (9 PM start time) for NYE 2018 and we're aghast to see children well under ten-years of age bouncing up and down the restaurant. The service was horrible. The first seats that we were placed in were next to the kitchen door and right next to of the terrible live band playing very loudly in the middle of the restaurant. The next table we moved to was better-situated but directly across from the kitchen area where food was being distributed. I don't use this world carelessly. There was absolutely zero service. The food was not prepared tastefully and overall was thought to be a total waste of over $1,041.64 (which contained a set gratuity of 18%. Had the service been what was expected the gratuity would have been increased. The room set aside for dancing didn't have a hardwood floor on top of the carpeted area making it had to dance and once again the terrible band played on. The best way to describe the evening would be a bad bar mitzvah reception with little kids running amok at 11:30 PM.

3.0,12/10/2018,Mario was great.  Went for breakfast and it wasn't nothing special.  The service was just ok.  They offer fresh juices.  The food mediocre at best.  The location has potential but it just feels old and tired.  It seems like the staff could use a refresher course on hospitality.  I asked for brown sugar and our server literally grabbed a bunch in his hand and placed it on mine.  What???  The proper way is to put the sugar packets on a plate and place it on the table.,0,0,0,S C.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,86,2
1.0,11/12/2018,"I cannot believe this place has 4 stars. Avoid. Came here with my family (4 adults, 2 kids) for brunch. The restaurant was maybe 20% full and it was impossible to get a servers attention the entire time. We waited about 20 minutes for water and then another 25 minutes to place our orders. Once we ordered , another waiter came to take our order. We ordered one lemonade and got 3. We ordered a chocolate milkshake and got vanilla. When we politely explained that the milkshake was wrong, the waiter gave us attitude and said that when someone orders a milkshake it's assumed to be vanilla (sure .. but we ordered chocolate). At one point I was desperate for more water , so after waiting almost a half hour I tried to wave over a waiter- he looked at me and continued re-arranging napkins on a different table.We all tried desperately to get someone's attention to get the check for approx 20 minutes - my mother finally succeeded after 3 other waiters ignored us.Any of these individual things in a vacuum would have been totally fine , but all together they made for a miserable two hours trying to flag disinterested, snotty waiters down.

1.0,8/17/2018,"My friend and I came for restaurant week and all I can say is never again. The food was good, nothing amazing or worth going out of your way for. The service, however, was memorable... and not in a good way. In fact, it was so bad, this place could earn a spot on Gordon Ramsey's restaurant rescue show. Everything was dreadfully slow, from getting our menu to getting our check, which was delivered a full half hour after I originally requested it even with our credit cards sitting very obviously on our table in front of NYC's least observant waiter. Our water glasses were never refilled during the meal. In fact, my friend's glass was empty for a good hour. At no point did anyone ask if she would like more. Unconscionable for a fine dining restaurant. Our dirty wine glasses were never removed despite several bussers dropping off parts of our order. My friend ordered coffee that took nearly 30 minutes to arrive, she was done with dessert by the time it came despite explicitly asking to have it come out together, kinda ridic  at the low low price of $8 for a tiny cup that barely holds a drop over a cup's worth. Everyone who works there seemed miserable and we witnessed several altercations between the staff in the dining room. One waiter was angry at the guy whose one job it was to keep the water bottles full and the manager had to practically pull them apart. We got the reality show, but still no water. When I asked the guy who brought dessert for the check after a lengthy wait he snarkily said ""I'll ask the waiter.""

2.0,8/15/2018,"Came here for restaurant week 18' and like all other reviews, the service was terrible. We made a reservation for 1:30pm and when we arrived, the hostess said they needed a few minutes to set up our table and told us to wait at the bar. We waited at the bar for over 15 minutes, when there were tables open. The main dining area is actually really small and so seating is limited, especially during lunch hours. We finally got seated and they placed us allll the way at the end in a corner table behind some pillar. It was so hard to get anyone's attention. Our waiter did not greet us at all or seem happy to serve us. He didnt even introduce himself. He basically just came and asked what we wanted and left. He didnt come to check on us at all afterwards. We got the three course lunch for $32. I chose the steak frites for my main entree, which was an extra $12. I paid an extra $12 and the dish didnt even come with fries. Like cmon, its literally in the name of the dish. The dish came with ketchup and some mayo sauce, which was probably for the fries... like how are you gonna give me those sauces, but no fries? Was I supposed to dip my steak into that? Honestly, it was whatever. I didnt want to bother them about some fries and maybe this was a sign that I shouldn't be eating the extra calories. The steak was tender and was a nice size portion. All our other dishes were good too, except the seared tuna salad, which I thought was pretty bland. My boyfriend got the spring chicken and he liked it. I really liked his grilled shrimp salad, which was an extra $9. When they came to change our silverware for dessert, they gave us dirty spoons. Overall, Even though the food was decent, I did not feel welcomed at this restaurant. Our server barely made contact with us and they took forever to take away our dishes for our next course. I just felt like I was in there foreverrrr and I just wanted to leave the whole time. This is considered an upscale restaurant, but the service definitely needs work. The prices on the menu was nothing crazy. It's honestly average for Manhattan.

I got the tuna tartare, lamb chop (extra $12) and chocolate cake with pistachio nougat ice cream. The tuna tartare was well seasoned and very flavorful. Some of my girlfriends got the salmon as starters. I got to say, the nice mix of different texture (crunchy mini croutons, vege, cream cheese, smoked salmon) and the blend of flavor, made this appetizer extremely appetizing!!! I love that lemon drizzle, made it so refreshing! The lamb chop was very well seasoned, marinated, and extremely well cooked. I ordered medium well and the meat was not at all dry! It was still very juicy and tender. Such a pleasant surprise. For the chocolate cake, it was rich and luxurious. I love the pistachio ice cream that provided a refreshing feel to the rich chocolate cake. My friend also ordered the citrus creme brûlée. OMG. So smooth and just so so good!

3.0,6/17/2018,"When I first reviewed this restaurant in the Pierre a year ago, I said I wished I could give it 5 stars but had to take off a star for the service. Now, one year later, I had to take off two stars. We had an open table reservation and were seated promptly and given the menus. The captain came over to take water and drink orders and saw that my menu was presented upside down and the daily specials were rightside up. He corrected the issue and presented the menu back to me. When he returned I was suprised to learn that one of the daily specials was Curry Chicken. This was Saturday evening and Curry Chicken is the Sunday evening special. I was actually in the mood for this dish. We ordered the Sauteed Sugar Snap Peas appetizer and the Tuna Tartare to start, and the Slow Cooked Halibut and the Chicken Curry special for our entrees. A big fuss was made about the bread that was served but the server failed to bring butter. When we mentioned this he took butter off the preset table of a group that hadn't yet arrived and gave it to use. The Tuna Tartare was excellent, as were the Sugar Snap Peas. Then the entrees arrived. The server plopped the Curry Chicken down on the table and left. One would think that they would at least offer to spook the first portion onto the plate like any fine restaurant would do, but not here. The halibut was excellent as it was on a previous visit. The Chicken Curry, however, had a strong tomato taste with little curry flavor. The crisp pappardam that accompanied it was good but the wheat had the texture of shoe leather. The dish was accompanied by some chuttney. I kept wondering though if the dish was left over from the previous Sunday and when it was no longer offered to any of the diners that arrived after us, I really wondered it is was left over from several days ago. Dessert was warm chocolate cake with pistachio nouget ice cream. This dish was good. The server forgot about my $8.00 decaf until he was reminded of it. Actually, the pot held two cups of decafe and it was excellent in quality so I didnt' mind the $8.00 price. Prices here, in all honesty, are considerably lower than one would expect at restaurant in a hotel of this caliber of legindary quality. But the service just doesn't measure up which is really annoying since the servers all seem like seasoned professionals who should be able to do a fine job.  I'm not sure what the problem is here but it feels like the components are all available to have a fine dining experience, but it ends up dissapointing.",0,0,0,Bob G.,"JAMAICA, NY",17,213,400

I am somewhat of a picky eater, and have high expectations of quality. He prepared for me shrimp over pasta as that is what I was in the mood for and requested. It was prepared with pasta in a white sauce tossed  with mixed vegetables and tomato confit mixed with shrimp. He also prepared me a calamari salad that was absolutely perfect. Finally, I asked for plain, fresh fruit instead of a rich dessert, and the presentation of the fruit was amazing, not to mention the quality and freshness. The pictures are worth a thousand words.

3.0,3/28/2018,Okay... went to this place through gilt. The food is really expensive even when it was through gilt. The best part about this place was eating dessert and food at the rotunda. Was very disappointed in the food that were served. Asked the waiter to take back two of the dishes as they weren't cooked very well / was too bland Pro- their rotunda- cocktails- the fact that those are the only pro is very sad - the charred octopus was great!Con- none of the other food I tried was great. I saw that the chef really tried to play around w the ingredients... but the taste didnt go well. The Chicken was dry... the bass was not cooked well. The octopus dish had a extremely lemony cream sauce on it that we just ignored to try our best to enjoy this beautiful experience.- the waiter apologized.... but it wasnt his fault.

4.0,2/2/2018,"Went to the Perrine at the Pierre as part of the restaurant week.I'm a vegetarian by choice so I'm usually sceptical about fancy places as I know how meat tastes and it's usually hard to make vegetarian food taste that good. But Perrine was an exception!The first course was the best butternut squash soup I have ever had. I'm a snob with that, I either love it or hate it. This was right on top on that list. I'd recommend to just go there for the soup alone. The breads were fresh and went perfect with he soup. Others tried the tuna tartare and the salad, both I hear were good.The main course was roasted farm veggies. They we're not my fav veggies as they were the ones on the sweeter side of the spectrum - beets, carrots etc. But the texture and consistently was on point. Did not feel full after it. I would say it was solid, not my favorite though as it felt too sweet after the soup. Others had the fish (bass) and lamb chops (medium) - they were excellent apparently.The dessert was the classic French brulee. Perfect. Accompanied by Madeline, that went well.As a plus, the adjoining dining room is absolutely stunning. I could sit there reading a book and having my coffee all day long. Would recommend just to see that!A special mention about the service. Had 2 servers both tried to be funny and not overwhelm with unnecessary suggestions.

The beef was not warm, super dry, and not worth $60+. The dessert also was disappointing. The only thing good about the dinner was the drink...never coming here for Christmas again.

3.0,8/27/2017,"I went to the Perrine last night. It was my second time at this restaurant. The first time, I sat outside and had brunch with a party of four. When I saw a voucher for dining at the Perrine on Gilt, I had to take the deal as I enjoyed the restaurant the first time. The food didn't disappoint; typical French cousine, nothing too special but the flavors were pleasing in all the three courses. It's rare to go to a restaurant in NY that is not overcrowded, but the Perrine is such a place. I had gazpacho, followed by sea bass, then chocolate fondant with ice cream. My boyfriend's meal included octopus, chicken, and as he is gluten free - he got gelato for dessert. We got two drinks included in the voucher, and we had two additional drinks. Now, there were negative points too. When handing the check to me, the waiter said, ""without the voucher the dinner is $200"". I was treating my boyfriend for dinner and I didn't appreciate that the waiter mentioned money. When I treat someone for something I don't want him to know the cost of it. It was very inelegant. The check only mentioned my two additional drinks + the suggested tip on them. So first, I signed for only that amount on the receipt. Then, I crossed it over because I remembered the total was $200 for the full meal, and I tipped on that. Before leaving, I mentioned to the waiter that the suggested tip on the receipt should include the real value of the dinner, not only the items we consumed in addition. That way there would be no confusion and he wouldn't need to mention at the table the real value of the dinner. Now, I didn't like the waiter's reaction. He started to go into specifics like "" it was mentioned on the voucher, in the U.S. people tip because it's part of the salary..."" and he started to show me things on the screen of his computer. I wasn't interested, but listened to him anyway out of politeness. I had two glasses of champagne, I was in a good mood, and I just wanted to help with my suggestion. I didn't need his explanation. It was awkward. I know what I need to tip on and what the customs are in the US... My point was, and still is; it would be a more sophisticated and seamless experience if the suggested tip on the receipt would be on the full value of the voucher dinner.

4.0,7/1/2017,"I had absolutely wonderful dinner this past Thursday night. I had the old-fashion cocktail from the 40's with expensive special rum, lime juice & egg white. It was so delicious! Then an incredible creamed corn soup but not heavy with tiny pieces of well-done corn kernels & pretty green oil on top.For my main course, I had their grilled New Jersey lamb chops with some special tasting brown sauce & some little stuff cut which I don't remember what it was but oh, it was yummy!But the best was last course: desert! WOW!It was a delicate black cherry tart, paired with Myers lemon ice cream with small bits of crunchy brown cookie crumbs.A dinner that I will remember for a very long time.Janet",0,1,0,Janet H.,"Manhattan, NY",21,8,0
3.0,6/30/2017,"The maitre d' at first was going to seat us deeper inside the dining room but then decided to sit us next to the door by the 61st street entrance. We accepted it, thinking whatever, its fine. Little did we know, there's an outdoor dining area which meant servers were in and out every few minutes. We had three flies surround our dinner, one of them I killed and left on the table. I had one mosquito bite on my left hand and two on my left ankle. We had a Gilt City voucher, and I have a feeling the maitre d' did that split second decision to seat us at the worst table because we were Gilt City voucher clients, maybe they dont have double standard for Gilt City voucher clients but it certainly felt like it. Food and our server was excellent though.",1,0,0,thida s.,"New York, NY",118,14,0
5.0,6/21/2017,"Maybe the greatest restaurant experience of my entire life. I'm not exaggerating. And I eat out - OFTEN. Not at cheap places either, when I dine out I like to treat myself and go somewhere special. My dinner at Perrine was special alright - and then some!My husband and I recently took a much anticipated trip to NYC and stayed at The Pierre Hotel (amazing hotel - 10/10 would recommend) and on the last night of our visit we decided to eat at Perrine, the onsite restaurant. Every single thing about our experience was exceptional. The ambience. The service. The cocktails. And the FOOD. My god, the food. It was incredible. Every bite was an absolute delight. Kudos to the chef and kitchen staff - they are making magic. I want to give a special acknowledgement to the waitstaff/hosts. Sometimes when you eat at high end establishments there is an air of haughtiness about. This can put an easy going LA girl like myself ill at ease at times. Not so at Perrine. I can't pinpoint exactly how they did it, yet while they were extremely classy and professional, all the while they made us feel right at home and very welcome. Next time we visit NYC you best believe we will coming to Perrine again for another meal that I'll no doubt be dreaming about for a long time afterwards.",0,0,0,M. M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,0

5.0,3/31/2017,"Thanks to years of self-meditative practices, my life has never been one dictated by FOMO. The city's biggest social event could be tomorrow and my own absence would never crush me. So, you could imagine how baffled (and slightly bitter) I was feeling when it dawned on me that I was experiencing FOMO over a photo of a slice of a banana cream pie found on Perrine's Chef Mignano Instagram page. I was transfixed by the dreamy cross-section and sheepishly found myself re-visiting this very post more times than I'd still like to admit today. I could feel the cream's airiness and filling's decadence with immaculate precision, all of which intensified the masochistic turmoil. I had lost my battle with FOMO and made reservations. I will always respect Chef Mignano for cracking me through his powerful gift of pastry arts. I don't even like banana cream pie. I've now dined twice with Perrine and the consistency is more evident than ever. + Soup: Order any of them. Perrine soups have purist's roots but deploys on intriguingly elegant components. The flavor profile is intelligent and this philosophy inspires me. + Imperial Crab Flatbread: Made with naan cooked in the tandoori oven located in the basement. Dedication to the creative process exists in every bite. + Tuna Tartare: Perrine's will make you realize that everyone else has been cutting corners.+ Banana Cream Pie: I now go to bed with peace in my heart. The entire staff is the perfect blend of charisma and regard, making them the most upscale and friendly neighbors you've ever had. And I'll admit it. They have me completely wrapped around their fingers but if that means they'll take me out of my FOMO, let's just say I'm okay with that.",5,4,1,Jeanne P.,"New York, NY",128,36,0

Cost of wine was comparatively low and the quality of food was the best. Looked fresh and appetizing. We ate up to the brim with stomach fully loaded.

4.0,12/5/2016,"Upscale and low key describes the vibe. Tucked inside the Pierre Hotel, it doesn't seem this place attracts much or any walk-in diners and most patrons, including myself, had a plan to be here. The Perrine serves a wicked near perfect Bloody Mary for brunch and seemingly innocuous dishes such as the Pierre Burger and chicken paillard use top notch and fresh ingredients, even if it does not win any innovative awards. A lot of dinero went into the decor of the Perrine and you will not be disappointed, from the modern lighting fixtures and paintings, it's overall surroundings are befitting of its 5th Avenue location.  Service was professional and prompt and no snobbery was evident. Even though it seemed more of an ""adult"" type of restaurant and generally quiet, the staff was super accommodating when we dined with our 2 young children (age 1 & 4) and were extremely family friendly. The staff even gave the kids free Beanie Babies to take home after our meal! (Caveat: I probably would not take kids here unless they are well behaved diners)Of course all this comes at a cost, more so for the location and ambiance than the food, so please do not expect to come here on a budget or if you are counting pennies. I do not expect anyone to come here with their bros or girls night out, but if are seeking an under the radar location with the family, in-laws or your significant other, the Perrine might work for you. To be fair, the Perrine probably deserves 5 stars for most people except for my sometimes over-critical ratings.  The food was very good but just did not have the amazing or wow factor.",4,0,0,Ray L.,"Manhattan, NY",59,103,82

5.0,8/11/2016,"Spectacular!! Took mom for her birthday last night and we had the best dinner in a long time.  Service:  If you read my reviews you will know that I am all about service.  The entire staff here was so friendly and amazing.  They were attentive, so nice and just really pleasant.  I couldn't have asked for more.   They didn't rush your order, rush you TO order...or even rush you out of your seats either.  It was so nice. Decor:  Upscale, classically modern!  Simple and beautiful. Food:  10+ stars.  I had the Baked Oysters....never thought I would like it but I wanted to try something ""new"" for me and it was SOOOOOOOO good.  Flavorful and not too chewy.  Just perfect.   We had the Chicken for dinner...and usually chicken is a suckers bet but I was thrilled.  The chicken was not dry, it was not drowning in sauce it was cooked perfectly.  Desert...we ordered the chocolate cake.  YUM!  It's like a NY staple and this was divine!  The prices were reasonable!  For 5 people with one bottle of wine it was round $450.  Not bad.  It was a great dinner, we would return in a heart beat.",3,1,1,R L.,"New York, NY",153,462,19
5.0,7/17/2016,"Great spot for weekend brunch inside 5-star The Pierre Hotel, located next to Central Park.The interior of the hotel is stunning. This would be an ideal place to hold a wedding for those looking for a place, but better save up.Back to the food...........Enjoyed all the courses by Executive Chef Ashfer Biju at this mid-priced New American restaurant (opened for only couple of months).Highlights:  Catskill smoked salmon, tuna tartare, 'The Pierre' burger, and the black sea bass.Staff also highly recommended the grilled shrimp salad & pineapple upside-down cake; Will try them next time.Definitely will be back to try the dinner menu or brunch again.Excellent service.

2.0,6/26/2016,ughh. will say that the food was good. not amazing but good. however the service was horrendous.  went for birthday dinner tonight. got seated at a decent table (so we thought). turned out there was CHEWED GUM stuck to the bottom of the table that attached to my brand new dress. and it wasn't a cheap dress.  we had to ask to be moved. ask for club soda. ask for anything that would remove the gym. waiter didn't even acknowledge the situation. manager didn't come over. such terrible handling of the situation.  it wasn't handled. NOTHING was offered. will ny return and will advise friends not to also.  happy birthday to me - chewed gum on my new dress. they could at least offer to pay for cleaning.,5,2,0,Jess Z.,"Syosset, NY",0,3,0
