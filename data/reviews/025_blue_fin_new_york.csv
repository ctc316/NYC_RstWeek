5.0,4/29/2019,"Of course I'm at a seafood and sushi restaurant, and I chose the steak. It was so tasty! I took out the blue cheese. The spinach was to die for and the medium cooked steak was so tasty. I had to have the desert ...:) I like the vibe, it's low key right next to Times Square. After a long day at work, it's nice to listen to the lounge music. As I'm here for business, I eat alone and they are always caring about where they are seating me. Great service!Definitely worth checking it out.",0,0,0,Stephanie H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,48,19

2.0,3/6/2019,"Came here on a lazy weekday afternoon while staying at the W hotel for work. Overall it's a convenient location with a beautifully modern yet warm vibe - like a yacht -and nice staff. BUT the food (especially the sushi) was pretty lame. I live in CA so maybe my sushi standard is pretty high (?) but the rolls were so-so. Not much creativity for a so-called sushi bar and the fish quality seemed average at best (pretty fishy taste overall). I also ordered the Brussels sprout kale Caesar salad, which took 30 mins to come out even with an empty restaurant. I'd describe it as ""edible"" at best. Pretty sour with some overly Parmesan crusted toast. Like basically a stick of Parmesan cheese instead of toast....Unless you're really desperate, you're better off finding somewhere else to eat in Times Square.",0,0,0,Allison W.,"San Francisco, CA",122,10,6

But as soon as we got a table, more theatre goers started streaming in. Service was fast and friendly. I ordered a Lobster bisque which was tasty but has only one small piece of meat in it. For dinner my wife had two sushi rolls (Times Square and Spicy Tuna I think) which she said was good but not spectacular. I had the Thai Hot Pot which made up for the lack of lobster in my soup! It was a spicy combination of shrimp, lobster, clams, calamari, etc etc in a delicious hot broth! Large portion - couldn't finish. Blue Fin's a little expensive but what isn't in Times Square?

3.0,2/14/2019,"Came here for dinner on Valentine's Day with a couple of friends. Honestly was a little disappointed with the food quality, especially given the steep price point. The service was also incredibly slow; we waited ~20 minutes for a cocktail and ~30 minutes for our food to come out. We ordered the sushi sampler, rigatoni with short rib, and grilled branzino. The grilled branzino was definitely the best dish of the three.

Atmosphere: Great interior, comfortable table. Food: Bomb. The pork belly baos were tender and had a nice spicy kick to them. I loved my short rib rigatoni. I tried a bite of my friends steak from her surf and turf and it was alright, but preferred my pasta. Chocolate mousse was great. I had to roll myself out of the restaurant -- that's how full I was.

5.0,2/6/2019,"Restaurant week of 2019 has come upon us and my friend and I decided to indulge! We chose this restaurant based on its location and also the great selection of food for restaurant week. We made a reservation for 6:45pm on a Tuesday night and got seated right away. The wait staff was very very friendly and informative. For appetizer my friend got the burrata and I got the spicy shrimp and salmon roll. Our entrees followed and my friend got the surf and turf and I ordered the braised rib and rigatoni. We both ordered the chocolate mousse for dessert. We also both got a class of the special white wine they had available. The portions were a wonderful size for restaurant week and so so delicious! The ingredients were very fresh and the meals were perfect temperature. After trying this place for 3 dishes for $42, I will def be back to try the other items on the menu!

2.0,2/3/2019,"I went for dinner on a Saturday night and the service was terrible from the moment we sat down. We sat down and were a little confused when looking at the menu and there were the words eggs and brunch. Nonetheless, we ordered our drinks. The place the empty except for about 3 table when we sat down. Our drinks took forever to come and when I spoke up about the menu not looking like the dinner menu I saw online, the waiter noticed and said ""so sorry, this is the brunch menu."" He swiftly took the brunch menus away and brought the dinner menus. The drinks took forever to come out considering the place the pretty empty. Drinks finally came and they were underwhelming honestly. We proceeded to order our dishes. My girlfriend order the tuna, she enjoyed it and I had the burger, I asked for it well done with steak truffle fries. The food came. I had order the burger well done but when I cut the burger down the middle, not only was  the burger was cooked  medium rare but my truffle fries were never ordered. They take the burger away and assure me they will cook it as ordered and will also bring me the truffle fries. My girlfriend ate her entire dish before my burger came back out so I was just watching her eat. They brought out the truffle fries, needles to say the truffle fries were soooo disappointing. No flavor, what so ever, and I don't know what truffle seasoning was used but where was it ???? While I waited I guess the waiter felt bad and brought me out a lobster bisque on him.... It was very nice of him but I had to chuckle after he was gone. I would've thought it would've ran through his mind, hey this is a predominantly sea food restaurant and she ordered the burger, perhaps she doesn't eat seafood.... I guess it's the thought that counts. My girlfriend did say it was good though. The burger finally came. The burger had an egg but once I cut the burger in half the egg yolk to was too cooked and it didn't even ooz. I just wanted to pay the bill and leave. I don't usually ever leave reviews especially negative ones but the service was subpar and the drinks left me craving an actual good drink. If those 2 things would've been on point, I don't think I would even be writing this review. The food in a place doesn't have to be great,even though that's always the hope, to me two things that define an experience at a restaurant is the service and drinks, and both were very underwhelming.",0,0,0,Paola C.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",89,2,0
2.0,2/3/2019,"New Yorker here - plenty of good sushi close to Times Square, but not at Blue Fin. By all means, get your sushi here if it keeps you in the human cesspool of Times Square - but if you're looking for actual sushi made by real sushi chefs, you're just a few blocks away from far better fare.This place suffers from the Times Square Tourist distortion bubble; travelers here from Omaha or Tulsa or Beijing who haven't the faintest idea what quality sushi can be.   give this place five stars as they do all the surrounding franchises and boring tourist holes.No self-respecting sushi restaurant - many of which can be found just a few blocks away in Hell's Kitchen - would serve food or employ staff this ill-considered. Limp fish, tossed with a few grains of rice and crammed onto a plate. Sliced wheat bread with butter to start. Grainy steak on a sad brown sauce. Dessert that had been scooped out of a soggy cardboard box. A decent martini made this a two star review instead of one. A waiter dropped a jar of soy sauce and it exploded onto my guest's pants. Apologies were made and a manager came over to apologize... but we still got stiffed with the whole bill. Comping a round of drinks or tossing in free dessert is the way to be. Avoid this tourist trap and extend your reach to Hell's Kitchen... or don't, we kinda prefer you stay in Times Square anyway.",0,0,0,Julie F.,"New York, NY",0,5,0
4.0,2/3/2019,"Prime location in Times Square which explains the large crowd during restaurant week and the crowding was the only thing I didn't like. I had to squeeze in an 8"" gap to get to my seat and it was very uncomfortable. Otherwise everything else was great. Very attractive staff I may add, I'm sure this was done on purpose lol. I had the shrimp and salmon sushi roll as an appetizer, the cod for my main which was bland but ok and the cheesecake for dessert. $9 glasses of wine to round out the meal- overall a decent experience.

4.0,2/2/2019,"Restaurant week tasting can be tricky at times, but Blue Fin is not one of those places that are dingy in their quality, creativity, or portion sizes at those times.The restaurant week menu include  four options of appetizers, four options of entrees, and three options of desserts. Among everyone in the group, we ordered(1) roasted butternut squash soup, which was first presented as an empty bowl with a few pieces of granny smith, almonds, and brioche in the bottom; then the server came back second time pouring the creamy roasted butternut soup into the bowl. Taste was amazing.(2) sweet shrimp and spicy salmon rolls, which despite their ordinary looks, were not subpar. (3) faroe island salmon: salmon may seem to be a boring option, but not when surrounded by chickpea stew, white polenta, and escarole. More importantly, the crispy skin on the salmon was the cherry of the cake.  (4) spicy crispy chicken bowl, whose spiciness comes from kimchi and avocado spicy aloli. It also looked like a beautiful garden, you've got to check out my photo on this.Amazing taste + creativity + fresh ingredients = I am giving a big thumb up.",1,0,1,Chen H.,"New York, NY",13,51,347

The place is really is placed on Times Square so right in the middle of everything.It's a nice cosy place but the light is terrible I have seen lots of people used phone to read the menu.Food was well cooked and very tasty.

2.0,1/5/2019,After friends raves about this restaurant I went here for my anniversary. What a bummer! The music and atmosphere was so loud I could barely hear my waiter. The servers bringing out the food either sat it at the edge of the table and I had to reach for it or slid it in front of me. It took so long for our entrees to come out and when they finally can it tastes as if they were reheated a few times. Finally I had to leave to make a 8pm show - as well as others who did not get a chance to eat. I paid the bill and felt taken advantage of. Mostly because we left practically full plates of food and some anniversary treats on the table. We didn't even want to take it home it was so awful. I don't know what location my friends went to but I can't imagine it was this one. This one was nothing to rave about.

2.0,12/25/2018,"This was a disappointing experience that costed a pretty penny.  Most restaurants make it clear online or in Open Table that there is special menu for the Holiday.  Nothing was stated in either places and we made our decision to go based on their regular menu.  To our surprise they ONLY offered a ""Christmas 2018"" menu with limited choices.  When we asked if they also offer their regular menu, we were told no and that they only had the holiday menus for the whole day.  Instead of brunch we had a dinner priced lunch.  When we arrived, the restaurant was fairly empty as we had early reservations.  Having said that, service was very slow, we've asked for a bowl to split a paella dish and up until the time we left, we were still waiting!The appetizers were very good but the paella was disappointing for $43.  We were offered dessert menues but after we ordered, our waitress came back to tell us that we were given the wrong menu Apparently there was a Holiday menu which didn't include one of the two items ordered.  We skipped dessert and went to Max Brenner instead  Merry Christmas!Even though I was looking forward to try this restaurant, it is not a place I would rush to go back.",0,0,0,Athina K.,"Murray Hill, Manhattan, NY",0,6,1

I showed my friends who assumed it was plastic. We grabbed our waiter and she took it to show her manager.

3.0,10/29/2018,"This restaurant is in Times Square and I usually avoid restaurants in the tourist areas as the prices are elevated for average tasting food. But my sister had vouchers from the time share experience so we each had $25 off our meal. We had a reservation and arrived a little early but we were able to be seated. We went up the stairs and the restaurant was less than half occupied on this weeknight. The restaurant seemed quite dark, I would have liked a little more lighting. I looked at the drink menu and no cocktails appealed to me. I asked if they had a certain beer which they didn't. I waited until the rest of our group arrived before deciding on a drink and entree.The menu had various seafood and meat options. I went with the halibut, gnocchi, and squash entree. I asked the waiter for a wine recommendation and he made a suggestion. I should know better as it seems they often tell you the most expensive option which was the case. While we waited, I appreciated resting in the booth after a day of walking and not to have bright lights from outside shining in. There was bread to start which was good. Based on the meal alone, I would this 4 stars. The halibut was tender and flaky and gnocchi flavourful, but not too much squash. I wasn't sure if the portion size would be enough but I was full after my meal. When we ordered we informed our server we had the vouchers and he said to include it with our payment. But when it was time to pay on one bill, he said he couldn't process it and would have to generate separate bills so they prolonged our stay. Without the discount, I wouldn't have come for a $60 meal as there were some good eats including seafood to be had for less.

They had a raw seafood bar as well but we got in just before closing and really didn't look very closely at these options but it looked good.  Restaurant was nicely done and looked as they though could seat a pretty good number of people.  Nice bar as well.",0,0,0,Dave D.,"San Clemente, CA",14,189,220

It's a bit odd if you enter in Times Square level because the bottom floor of the restaurant has tables yet it is empty because they only serve upstairs. I bet that scares a lot of customers away to see an empty restaurant. Our meal overall was great. They were out of our first choice wine when we tried to order a bottle, but our second choice was less expensive and excellent. We had the octopus appetizer and lobster mashed potatoes, along with a couple sushi rolls.

Service was terrible and pretty much had to beg to get someone to come over. My partner had the tuna which was bland at best. I had halibut with gnocchi.....it might have been many things but gnocchi is not one of them!!!!! sushi rolls were ok but nothing special. We did email the Blue Fin and the manager contacted us. Called him back and was told he was out for 10 minutes but knew he wanted to speak to us and would call back within half and hour. Waited over an hour and called back again only to be told he was not in that day. Have not heard from since. A restaurant is only as good as its manager which explains everything!!!

5.0,8/24/2018,"5 star sushi! Excellent truffle rainbow roll (tuna, Hamachi, salmon, kanpachi, avocado and cucumber with truffle oil) and excellent specialty roll they had that night consisting of BBQ eel and spicy tuna. Although my shellfish allergy didn't let me try it my party said the Alaskan king crab and jumbo shrimp were excellent. Although the molten s'mores chocolate cake was only good the coconut cream pie for dessert was SO incredibly good. Food is so amazing I kept eating even when stuffed. 5 star ambiance! This restaurant is seated in the heart of times square and it has an unassuming, constantly packed with noisy tourists vibe from the outside. Nothing could be further from the truth. It's pretty easy to get a reservation and the ambiance is excellent. They have live musicians playing soft, cheerful jazz in the background. It somehow manages to be perfect for both a business dinner or a nice date. The service wow. Our waiter had worked at the restaurant for 10+ years and it showed- my water was never empty and the second it looked like we were done with a drink or a dish the waiter appeared to offer more.A++ experience.

The next course was the trout with carrot harissa puree, tri-color cauliflower and grilled nectarines. The grilled nectarines were definitely the standout of the dish, and the trout was tender and beautifully cooked.  The last course was the dark chocolate cheesecake with an oreo cookie crust, bing cherry compote and cappuccino ice cream. That was a really brilliant dish and a wonderful marriage and various flavors and textures. I loved the cappuccino ice cream and I'm not even a coffee drinker lol. I also had a chance to taste the sorbet trio which had grapefruit, guava and peach flavors which are all made in-house. The guava was brilliant, but the peach was also really spectacular.

3.0,4/13/2018,"I was really looking forward to dining at Blue Fin as I heard the seafood here was excellent and finally we were able to make it after seeing Kinky Boots nearby. We were promptly seated on the second floor which is the main dining room.  Our server, Manny (real name German) introduced himself with a smile and I thought we were off to a good start. Here is where the best part of service ended. We decided to start off with some sushi rolls and see where it takes us as it was late in the evening, almost 10 PM and we did not want a heavy meal before an hour-long drive home.  We ordered three rolls.  The rolls were brought but no chopsticks, no soy sauce and ramekins for it. We had go flag a busboy to bring these. The rolls were pretty good, not spectacular but fresh and the truffle on the rainbow roll added a certain umami taste to it. The real crabmeat in the Californication roll was also awesome. Not once during this appetizer course did Manny come by to check on us, to pour more water, to see if we wanted anything else.  We were done with our sushi and a lady came by, she was more of a hostess/captain who upon seeing that we have had empty plates, cleaned them up. We wanted to order a main dish now but Manny was going around the room, coming back to this and that table multiple times but walking past our table, even when we tried to flag him and make an eye contact.  Finally, after about good 20 minutes of just sitting at an empty table and btw, not another person stopped by and asked us if we wanted to call our waiter, Manny made an appearance and asked if we wanted anything else.  We ordered the halibut main entry.  The moment that a busboy placed the dish on the table, Manny appeared and asked how did we like the halibut when it was clearly noticeable that the dish has not been touched yet!  It turned out to be excellent.  I am not a fish person but this was truly exceptional, very fresh and it came with crabmeat, roasted yellow squash and tiny ravioli. We did not get any bread to start the meal with and I saw other diners get it.  My verdict: NYC has so many restaurants and I am quite a formidable home cook myself, so going to restaurants is really all about experience and service is a huge part of this experience.  I normally never have bad service. I smile, make a small talk with a waiter, use a sense of humor in a polite sense and it helps to establish a great rapport which turns into a great meal.  Not here.  We were clearly ignored.",0,0,0,Baby S.,"Oceanside, NY",0,698,0

The outside is deceiving, the inside is beautiful and modern. The hostess was very welcoming and accommodating. We went upstairs where are table was located. We had a great semi round booth along the wall so we could see everything. Our service started slow....took 3-4 minutes to get the water service and then they forgot to fill my husbands glass. It took more than 10 minutes to get his glass filled. We ordered two drinks which took some time...gin and tonic and processco...easy. We placed our orders after waiting 10-12 minutes for the waiter to come back. We order the tuna tartare appetizer special, a salad (special request lettuce and croutons ONLY) two of us ordered a role and my husband ordered the sea bass special. Next they brought bread... yes bread! Who serves bread at a sushi place. Maybe a NYC thing. I am not sure. Then our entree rolls came, no appetizer and no sea bass. Needless to say we sat our entrees to the side waiting on salad and appetizer. A manager (in training) walked by and noticed we were not eating so she stopped. We explained the situation and she was very accommodating. She brought the salad but it had tomato's and onions in it so we explained again what was requested. Then the appetizer came which was good. Even after us saying don't worry about the salad they brought it correctly. My husband has now been waiting on his 2nd drink for 10 minutes and still his meal. The MIT came back with the drink and salad (at no charge). Then finally the sea bass arrived after our rolls have sat on the table for 35 minutes. We ended up ordering another roll because we were still hungry. That came lightening fast too. The MIT brought dessert to go which was very nice and good! Cookies and caramel popcorn.

We sat and enjoyed our meal and multiple glasses of wine. We ordered mostly sushi rolls and all were excellent. When I had made the reservation I had noted that it was my guests birthday. To my surprise dessert was brought out with a candle and an extra plate of goodies. This was a fabulous touch that really made the evening perfect. Thank you!,0,0,0,Alyssa E.,"Manhattan, NY",172,2,0

4.0,2/20/2018,"I really enjoyed this place during my trip to New York. Originally, I was on the hunt to find a highly rated pizza place, but after my 2 mile walk there, I realized the place was closed. I ended up in Times Square and honestly I was disappointed. I didn't want to eat at a chain restaurant or anything I could eat back home in Cali. BUT I saw Blue Fin and figured I'd try it out. Plus sushi sounded good after a weekend of bagels and endless carbs.Walking in, I was very impressed by the ambiance of this restaurant. I knew I was walking in to a higher end sushi place and I was also happy that there weren't too many people. (I walked in around 10pm) At first, service was a bit slow. It took awhile to be greeted, thus the reason why I am taking off a star. Being alone, and not being greeted for sometime makes things a little awkward. After my waitress came, things were great. I had the Spicy Tuna Tartare for an appetizer which was very good. It was presented beautifully and tasted as good as it looked. I also ordered the Rainbow Roll which was recommended and that was also very good. For dessert, I had the Molten cake with cappuccino ice cream. The molten cake was your typical molten cake, nothing too special, but the ice cream was so good. It was also plated beautifully. I am very glad I made this my last dinner in NY, and if I'm ever back in the area, I'd definitely come back.",0,0,0,Lindsay L.,"San Jose, CA",160,135,34

4.0,1/15/2018,"This place is a diamond in the rough considering it's putrid location. Literally located smack center in the heart of times square, where you see nothing but international tourists and individuals on the streets passing out mixtapes to try and make a name for themselves, Blue Fin lets its food speak for itself. It's like you walk through the doors and the restaurant evolves into a casual, yet mature looking dining space. From the outside looking in, you would assume it doesn't work, but you're wrong. The service needs some work, but the food was extremely flavorful, cooked to absolute perfection, and beautifully presented. In fact, the edamame appetizer is my favorite preparation created by any restaurant I've ever been too. The crunch from the peanuts and spice from the chilis are so well balanced that it's making my mouth water as we speak. I ordered the sea bass as my entree and some of the vegetables served underneath were a bit mushy for my liking, but the piece of fish presented had a beautiful golden oak color and was so tender, you could probably eat it with a plastic fork. I'm telling you to not judge this place by its outside cover. The only reason I didn't give it a perfect 5 star rating was because there were numerous technical service errors that I picked up on throughout service, but by no means should that stop you from dining at this NYC hot spot.",1,0,0,Brandon G.,"Hoboken, NJ",255,22,0

4.0,12/30/2017,"This was my first time here, as a recommendation from a friend for a must visit restaurant. I was able to make reservations fairly easy, through open table for the same night, as a spur of the moment visit. I liked the layout of the restaurant, it's very relaxed, upscale atmosphere. All of the staff is very friendly, helpful attentive. I was able to check my coat in (although it was a little harder to find, even with a ticket, I'm glad it didn't get lost, as my wallet was still in my jacket). The waiter was fairly attentive, although I had to ask for a refill from some of the other staff passing by. But, they seemed pretty jam packed, which i'll chalk up for some of the experienced delay. He was very helpful, giving a few recommendations for some of the favorites, which were good choices.The food on the other hand was outstanding. The plating, the presentation were all exceptional. The flavor, combinations and the freshness of the food were all excellent. We sampled a few of their appetizers, which I would recommend all of them: pork belly bao buns, lobster and shrimp spring rolls and tender spanish octopus. They were definitely the highlights of the visit. We did try a couple of rolls as well, although I can't remember which ones, they were very good as well.This place is definitely on the higher and more of a pricier end. Which, taking that into account, along with the overall experience, that's just the reason for the 4 stars. For the price and cost of the admission, I would definitely expect excellence all around, on all aspects from the service, to turn times of refills and everything else. Overall, it was a great experience and I would recommend to others, while visiting this place myself, next time I'm down there and in the mood for some Sushi.",0,0,0,Dan K.,"Roseville, CA",182,227,75

1.0,12/25/2017,"Not as good as we remembered.We've been dining at BR Guest restaurants for years and can't recall a bad meal. Until tonight. Perhaps the acquisition by Landry's, parent company to the gourmet Rainforest Cafe has contributed to a decline in food quality and service.A few weeks ago, we called to find out if the normal menu would be available on Christmas. We were told it would be, alongside a few specials from the Chef. Upon arrival, we were told there was only a special Christmas menu, but it was ""pretty much the same as usual."" That may be true, if you stripped off every entree under $35 (which, incidentally, were the ones I was craving when looking at the menu online. Grilled calamari, I'd love to have had you).Service was lackluster. Bread arrived with no bread plates. Silverware was filthy. Food was wandered around the dining room until servers could identify their tables. And when food arrived at the game, it was auctioned off (""who got the scallops?"") rather than given to appropriate person, as seat numbers in the POS should have had.Food was disappointing as well.

2.0,12/23/2017,"We had dinner here before a show and the experience was mediocre at best from start to finish. Let's start with the hostess, who was proficient but curt with all of the guests. While not rude, she certainly didn't create a welcoming atmosphere to start the meal.We were seated in a back room, which was more intimate and quiet than the main dining room. If you want to eat here and can get a table there, do. Drinks and bread were slow to arrive and our first mini loaf was overcooked and tough. The salads were good and they split the plate for two of our diners who were sharing a salad. The lobster and shrimp spring rolls had no visible lobster and small shrimp overwhelmed by noodles and veggies.The sea bass entree got a good review and the chirashi bowls were a good size. The sushi fish was not high quality and the sushi itself left much to be desired. I'd recommend sticking to the entrees. The oyster platter was dropped on the table with no description of the oysters therein. A side of lobster mashed potatoes for the table was bland and brought out with no plates for sharing. On the flip side, bread plates were only partially cleared before entrees arrived and cluttered the table for the remainder of our meal.When we ordered after dinner drinks and a dessert with the warning that we needed to leave soon for a show, coffee and tea arrived so late after the dessert that we had to leave them untouched. The apple pie had a flavorless crust, an even worse sin as the pie was a fully encased tartlet rather than slice. The apples inside were dry and not enough to overcome the crust's shortcomings, while the sour cream ice cream tasted like plain old vanilla ice cream with none of the tang I was hoping for.The women's restroom was vastly undersized for the number of patrons and at 7:30 pm on a Friday evening there was a line out of the restroom and around the corner.A thoroughly unimpressive experience.",1,1,0,Kate K.,"Long Beach, CA",64,232,402

4.0,8/3/2017,"It's surprising how I had never noticed this restaurant, until the Restaurant Week. Came here for a week-day lunch with friends and loved it! We ordered the ""Slow braised pork belly bao bun"" for appetizers and the salmon for main course. The pork buns were one of the best I've had - this coming from someone who has to order pork buns if it's on the menu. Crispy char siu with lettuce and a spicy sauce, wrapped in super soft buns are to die for!The ""cedar plank faroe island salmon"" was well done like I had asked for and came with charred corn salad. The burnt crispy later of salmon, conjured up by the chef makes it worth the price. It's not very often that you like the salad that comes with salmon as much as the salmon! The chef made that happen here.Then came the beautifully decorated desserts. You've got 2 options -  1. Triple Chocolate cheesecake with ice-cream  2. Summer stone fruit upside down cake. Get the second one, yes definitely, get the second one! It's ridiculously delicious, a no-brainer.The server was extremely courteous, ambience was fancy but not overwhelming. They got my friends' kid a drawing kit and made sure she was comfortably seated. It's right next to the red stairs are Times Square, so a great location.

The Chirashi bowl was filled with a large portion of really fresh sashimi, and the sushi rice was prepared perfectly. My friend ordered the grilled Montauk calamari which came with about 5 small whole squid pieces and a delicious grain, cauliflower and greens salad. We ordered the king crab sushi for an appetizer. 6 pieces for $19. The Sushi felt overpriced but the quality was great.

I have never had a host ask me if his allergy was contact or airborne, and was even more impressed when I told the host that and the reply was ""well every restaurant should ask that!""! My son's plates were labelled as allergy sensitive and the waiter was highly knowledgeable. There are only maybe three or four restaurants I've been too where I feel as secure eating there as here.On top of that, the food was very good. Salmon burger was tasty, sushi was excellent, and my son's waffle fries were the best I've ever had in my life. Yeah, that sounds like a really inconsequential thing to point out, but those waffle fries were the ideal form of waffle fries.A little pricey, but that's not a criticism because it's about right in the middle of Times Square so that's to be expected (meaning it's about the right price for its location) and totally worth it if you have good allergies.

3.0,1/6/2017,"Dined at Blue Fin last night prior to the theater. Wanted to love it; did not. Firstly, the waitress, while polite, professional and attentive, came across (to me) as a salesperson in a clothing store or car dealership. For almost each interaction, before I could speak, she proceeded to explain what she liked most and which dishes were popular--which took quite some time each time. I think she meant well, but it felt like she was pushing her wares and that her wants or needs came before mine. I think she thought I was a tourist and/or had not dined at fine restaurants many times before?Secondly, the kitchen seemed extremely disorganized. My entree (Chirashi Bowl) came out by itself, without entrees for my two companions, when our appetizer (a dozen oysters) was not yet finished and still on the table. Our waitress noticed this and immediately removed my entree from our table before I could blink--she literally swooped in and took the food away before I could say a word to her. (I noticed other plates being delivered and returned at other tables around me, so something must have been going on.)Unfortunately, we then experienced a rather protracted delay between our app and main course. Nobody came to remove our appetizer plates after our oysters were fully consumed. Our main courses did not come for quite some time after that. And this, despite the fact that we had informed our waitress at the beginning of our meal that we had theater tickets. The unusually lengthy delay significantly marred our dining experience.The food was primarily very good but not entirely. My girlfriend loved her grilled salmon. She said it was terrific. (Unfortunately for me, she cleaned her plate without offering me a bite!) My Chirashi Bowl was good but not great. The eel was cold. I wonder if I was served the same bowl that had been abortively delivered so many minutes earlier--or, worse, if it had been pre-made ahead of time and ready to go for the pre-theater dinner crowd. (I'm accustomed to Unagi being served slightly warm.) The ""Californication"", a California roll made with lobster, that my other companion ordered was very good. The flourless cake with strawberry ice cream that we ordered for dessert (as well as the coffee) were terrific, but the lengthy delay getting our entrees meant we did not have time. We rushed through a few bites, leaving almost half of it, even though we loved it and would have preferred to enjoy more fully.Finally, the waitstaff used the space between my table and the next as a passageway, so that during our meal I was bumped into about 10 times while sitting at my table. I tried moving an empty chair into the space so the waitstaff would get the idea and find a different path or slow down, but it didn't help: a service person with a tray full of another table's dirty dishes stopped to move the chair out of his way while balancing the tray of dirty dishes over my shoulder.I'm being a difficult critic even though most of our food was very good because when spending more than $200 for a relatively small meal for three people the overall experience should be good. At that price point, a restaurant should know how to ensure a pleasurable dining experience so you walk away wanting to come back again.",0,0,0,Gerald G.,"New York, NY",0,40,0

5.0,11/14/2016,"We were meeting a friend at the Marriott Marquis and wanted a close, good seafood spot. I dug around with Yelp/Google/Open Table etc and no luck. So, I went old school and called the Marquis, asked for the concierge, and requested 3 choices for seafood. This was followed by more Yelp research. Their website says an ""Izikaya inspired menu""...meaning Fun!The restaurant is actually located in the W Hotel and is causal, yet elegant. After wading though a sea of tourists as this is in Times Square, the ambiance strikes you as wonderfully peaceful and quiet.For Dinner there's a Raw menu, a Sushi menu, Seafood and Steak as well as a cheese selection and a great wine list. I like options and there's no shortage, here. We started with Poke and Lobster rolls. Both were excellent starters. From here, we ordered the middle sized seafood tower. On top of all of this, I managed to devour a grilled halibut dish. All of the dishes were excellent, though I really loved the Mezzanine raw Tower with great lobster and shrimp.Needless to say, we skipped desserts, the incredible cheese list and the charred octopus--all of which looked awesome.There's enough variety here to hit this restaurant many more times without getting bored, or ever ordering the same thing twice!  Great service and great ambiance!I look forward to the return!",2,1,2,Dave F.,"Santa Monica, CA",305,1494,220

4.0,8/6/2016,"My wife and I came during the restaurant week; it was a busy and rainy Friday night. Although  the weather wasn't to one's complete satisfaction but it had not dwindled the passion of hundreds of thousands of people gathered in Time Square. The restaurant has two entrances, one on Broadway and inside the W hotel on W47 for the other. Be cause of the two separate entrances, my wife and I were a little confused at first, waiting simultaneously at the two separate entrance and couldn't find each other. Anyway we eventually had the problem resolved and walked in to the restaurant hand in hand. Blue Fin is a modern and trendy restaurant, with beautiful settings and lovely ambiance. Our polite usher immediately led us to our reserved table and we were kindly received by our waitress. With plenty experience from the past, and recommendation from Yelp (I do lots of homework before going), we chose one RW prefix and ordered additional dishes such as Spicy Tartare Trio and Lobster and Shrimp spring roll as appetizer, and  White Sesame Bigeye Tuna as entree. Mind you many restaurants dislike patrons doing additional a la cart if RW prefix is selected, requesting everyone at the table to participate with RW menu saying it would put too much hassle for the chef. Anyway, the rating for this review should have been two sets of scores, 3 for the prefix and 4 for the regular. As usual, the RW menu for most restaurants are on the weak side, and unfortunately Blue Fin couldn't escape the fate. For the night, we had Mussels Al Ajillo to start, Seafood and Chicken Paella as entree, and homemade Churros to finish. A lot of times, I feel that the strength of a restaurant lies closely with its appetizers, as if a chef couldn't even handle a dish on the small scales how well could you expect on the entree. The mussels were definitely a disappointment. They were brought out in a blink of an eye. Although I am not a chef, but I have cooked and ate plenty of mussels and I know good mussels dishes takes at least 10 minutes (steamed ones) or more to prepare and plate. To have ours delivered from kitchen to table this fast was unimaginable. One taste and it confirmed our suspicion: it was salty, lukewarm, and slightly rubbery, all signs pointing to a mass produced, precooked batch for the prefix. The funny thing was that the mussels served within the paella had the same kind of texture and taste as of the appetizer was further testament of our guess. Aside from the mussels within the paella, it was cooked great but had too much salt and the piece of fish was falling apart as if overcooked. I mean it's usually very hard to mess up a paella as long as  you cook it with patience and care. The final touch on the prefix was the churros. We had it sent back and our waitress kindly exchanged it for the cheesecake. Fair to say, I never had any decent churros experiences except that of the subway style. Our churros looked and felt the same when compared but it was gooey on the inside, which meant it was under-cooked. To be on the safe side, I even texted my coworker, where churros are served in his country, and confirmed it should be soft and fluffy on the inside. The switch to the cheesecake was a saving grace. The goat milk was intense in flavor, an excellent choice for cheesecake lovers.Our regular pick of the menu had the complete different effect. Both appetizers of Spicy Tartare Trio and Lobster and Shrimp spring roll were delicious. The hamachi, salmon, and tuna trio combo was fresh and flavorful, served on crunchy fried wanton wraps, making my wife and I fighting for the treats. The distinct difference of flavor and texture between lobster and shrimp was beautifully presented within the crunchy spring roll wrappings and further enhanced by the spicy sweet coconut dipping sauce, marking this appetizer a must try. Our entree of Bigeye Tuna was served over a bed of black rice; each sesame encrusted piece was a giant cube of perfectly cooked fish. There was only one drawback: too much soy sauce. We believe the soy sauce was meant as a condiment for the tuna, as the fish had hardly any salt on. But the problem was that the black rice had sponged up all the soy sauce, making it extremely salty even with the tuna to balance. I guess this was a small oversight by the chef. And finally, I also had a Love at Midnight cocktail of coconut rum, lavender and pineapple, which was enjoyed by my wife as well.There is a saying that the difference between a cook and a chef is that cooks fulfill your stomach and a chef fulfill your tongue. Blue Fin is a great restaurant at a great location. One would expect equal greatness on all levels. Just be cause RW menus are on economical budgets,it should not be treated anyway less especially when they are a centerpiece to showcase during this eventful period. Patrons, especially local ones know the difference. Will we come back a second time? Yes! Will we do RW again? No!",0,0,0,T.K M.,"Jackson Heights, NY",3,66,81

4.0,5/18/2016,"This was an impromptu lunch stop after striking out at the TKTS booth across the way. We were hungry, disappointed and not too eager to try to brave the Times Square crowds so soon. A quick search on the gluten-free app showed that this could be an option. We walked across the way to look at the menu, and decided to give it a shot. I mean heck, I love me some seafood, and thankfully, my girls do, too. Walking in to the foyer, you see a hostess stand, a bar along the back wall, and a large flight of stairs to the left. It was only after we were seated that we realized that the top part of the building was a different restaurant altogether. We weren't given an option at the stand as to which one we wanted to dine in. Maybe because we didn't have reservations? Or maybe we looked too causal, too much like tourists? Anyway, we were at a small table opposite the door, which was unfortunate in that we got a gust of cold air every time they opened. Our waiter was friendly enough, but he seemed a bit distracted. They were all running between the bar on our level and the restaurant upstairs, so I'm sure he was just busy. He did take the time to hear our allergy alert, and to answer our questions. We decided to share the seafood platter (the ""balcony"" version), as well as a spicy tuna roll and a Dynamite roll. The odd thing is that they brought out pastries to start with. There was a scone, a biscuit and a slice of some kind of carrot cake. Didn't really go with the seafood theme, but of course the two of us who could consume flour ate them. We were afraid we'd still be hungry after our meal, but it turned out we ordered just enough food; we were satiated without being stuffed. My favorite thing on the seafood platter was the ceviche. Shame it came in such a small cup! Wait, let me back up. The platter came with oysters, mussels, squid rings (not fried calamari), crab legs, ceviche and clams. While everything was fresh and tasty, my favorite - as I mentioned - was the ceviche. It was just perfectly prepared, not too citrusy, not too bogged down by other ingredients. The spicy tuna roll was also very good (my husband would have approved), but the Dynamite roll really wasn't. It was just kind of bland, which was surprising, given all the spice notes rolled up in it. Overall, it was a good lunch meal to tide us over, and allowed us to feed the seafood urge.

5.0,4/14/2016,"Blue Fin takes serious pride in both it's food and service.  This is no easy task, given their location in the heart of the theater district.   Think about it.  Blue Fin's clientele are people who have braved both NYC transportation AND being accosted by numerous cartoon characters.  Plus, they need to make a curtain time for a show that probably cost a small fortune to attend.  Not the easiest clientele to make happy.   But Blue Fin does it and does it well and with style.I have been to Blue Fin several times.  The food is always impeccable and, with a fish-centric menu that again is no easy task.  Tonight our server was Brett.  He was knowledgeable about the menu, professional and happy to answer any questions we had.  The drinks we ordered were terrific and more important, exactly as ordered.  In addition to Brett, much appreciation to David Robeano,  Greg and to Blue Fin and it's staff for an altogether delicious memorable meal and a great dinner.  Blue Fin remains my ""go to"" place for dinner in the theater district.  I will be back soon.",0,0,0,Bonnie E.,"Manhattan, NY",451,82,0

3.0,4/3/2016,Visiting from SF Bay. I love sushi. We were really hungry and decided to eat here. Our bill for 4 and a toddler was $400. The food was good but not worth the price tag. I've eaten at Nobu in Malibu and paid $400 before. Nobu is totally worth the $$ but this place wasn't. If money isn't an issue or you plan on ordering light then go ahead and try it. I just didn't think it was worth the $400.,1,1,1,Lizette T.,"Castro Valley, CA",103,40,0
3.0,4/3/2016,"Came here with my best friend for our annual restaurant week ritual and this was our lucky chosen spot based on our love for seafood. For starters we were both starving and when we were first seated they waitress there was attentive and kindly asked if we had tickets to a show that we needed to get to I guess just so they needed to know if we were in a rush since the area is surrounded by theatres. I thought that was a great gesture and their service overall was great.However, the food itself wasn't astounding as we had thought it would be and I happened to be seated in an awkward place where there wasn't supposed to be a seat...but they crammed us in there.  So much of the time throughout dinner I spent shifting my seat so that waiters and people could squeeze through between me and the next person to get by and eventually their manager had just asked me to move over to sit in the aisle.The portions there were pretty big and we were both stuffed by the time we had gotten to dessert and so we were only able to get a spoonful of each. None of the dishes stood out to me besides the salmon; they were able to get the perfect crispy skin and soft and just about done meat. Probably wouldn't come back again for a regular meal though considering it was just an average food experience; but was on the pricer side.",2,2,2,Angel T.,"Queens, NY",246,49,51

I ordered the roasted chicken sandwich on ciabatta. Somewhat tasty, but the complaint I have on the sandwich is that I got a big piece of grizzle or something. My colleague also ordered the same sandwich and had a big piece of grizzle in his as well. I started with the potato leek soup which was very good and my colleague had the garden salad with apple which he enjoyed.Service: very polite, happy to help, but did take far to long to deliver a club soda I ordered. Other than that, they were great.Atmosphere: clean, professional, good setting for a business lunch or with friends, literally right in time square.Misc: doubtful I'll be back.

We liked every thing we ate. I had the simply grilled halibut and my husband the glazed Chilean sea bass. The portions are definitely on the small side.

Compliments to the sushi chef, as he appropriately ordered the sushi pieces in the correct order to eat them from light to heavier fish!Our entire experience here was great and I would definitely return here for good sushi.",1,0,2,David K.,"Austin, TX",423,153,207
2.0,3/11/2016,"Great location, in the heart of Times Square, Asian/Japanese fused seafood restaurant, very modern and chic.  Came here for a work dinner. Ordered the grilled calamari, simply grilled Faroe Island Salmon with the charred broccoli side.I wasn't expected my calamari are whole calamari, I wasn't the kind of crispy grilled calamari I was looking for. It was just ok. We also ordered the bang bang edamame for the table. It was edamame with the Chinese sweet and sour hot sauce, nothing special.My entrée salmon was ok. I ordered medium rare but it came out more like a medium, the half Chinese cabbage was extra salty. did not like it. My charred broccoli was good. But the random Chinese sweet and sour sauce again on one broccoli, I am not sure if they did it on purpose, ruined the whole thing. Overall, I don't think this place did very well with the Asian fusion. It wasn't authentic and weirdly paired with things.

1.0,3/6/2016,"My mother and I made a reservation here before a show last weekend. It was quite busy; however, they were prompt about seating us. The food was okay, we had some nigiri, a couple of rolls and a side they had on special (Cauliflower Au Gratin - which actually had no cauliflower in it whatsoever, it was broccoli). The reason however for the single star rating is the service. Our waiter would not make any sort of eye contact with me or acknowledge me. When he gave his speech about the specials he looked entirely at my mother and failed to speak to me completely. When he came by to check on us, he would only ask her how things were, not me. Lastly, once the meal was over he came by to clean off the table and he only cleaned her side. As an adult, I found his behavior exceedingly disrespectful, and markedly unfounded.Thus, if you must eat here, please avoid a tall red-headed server named John, he will ruin your night and make you feel like a second-class citizen (not the kind of treatment you should receive at a pricier restaurant).",0,0,0,Gabrielle W.,"Hamilton, NY",174,36,12

I looked over the list and came upon Blue Fin.  I had a read a few reviews about the place and wanted to check it out.  I expected a really nice lavish modern decor because someone described it as ""gorgeous"" but I was truly a bit disappointed with their rather casual decor/atmosphere...not really befitting the usual W hotel ambiance.  We came in for lunch and the place filled up pretty quickly.. There were patrons to my left and right.  Now the important part of it is the food which I thought was pretty ok.  For the appetizer my dad chose the tomato soup-- which I had a taste of--- it was alright.  I chose the squash burrata appetizer-- didn't like it! ... It was way too sweet.  For the main course, we both chose the Faroe salmon-- it was good-- maybe a tad bit salty.  the best part of the meal was the dessert--I ordered the cheesecake and my dad ordered the warm chocolate bread pudding--- both desserts were amazing---for $25 a person for a 3 course lunch---definitely not bad.  Of course, not included were the wine and coffee---but the coffee was very very good!  Not sure if I would be back for the purpose of enjoying a nice extravagant meal--- because it definitely was not that kind of experience.  Although I gave this place 3 stars I would have given it a true 3.5 stars instead--- I just can't give this place a 4.",0,0,1,Ji Won K.,"New York, NY",12,70,419

The fish was nicely cooked, good sides as well.  For dessert, we had the Lemon Layer Cake (bing cherry compote, buttermilk cherry ice cream) and the Warm Peach Crumb Pie (pecan streusel, bourbon caramel, vanilla ice cream).  Both were delicious.  The lemon cake was light and had a good lemon flavor.  I love the peachs on the crumb pie.  They also gave us some wonderful cookies which we took back to the hotel.  Unfortunately, we left them in our refrigerator so we never got to each them.  :(Good service and good food!",1,0,0,Karen C.,"San Jose, CA",177,634,569

And we also never got bread but after having our entrees I realized that the runners were giving out bread, just not to us...The drink was also disappointing. It was chilled enough, and then I saw the bartender shaking another drink- which means a slight shake- that explained why...The food was not great either. Def not on the level that they want to be.

3.0,7/25/2015,"Came in for restaurant week, and before anyone tells me I shouldn't judge because it's restaurant week. Well it shouldn't mean the quality of their food should decline just because it's a special. With that being said. We arrived they accommodated us fairly quickly since for a Friday it wasn't that busy,  and they do have a bag and coat check.Appitizer:  I had the avocado and crab meat gazpacho (it was fairly light, not too spicy.) My girlfriend had the roasted peach salad came with camembert and pistachios. (The peaches and cheese paired well together the mesclun seemed to be under dressed and the pistachios were boarder line burnt.) Entree: I had the miso glazed cod with a green papaya salad mix cold soba noodles and soy ginger vinaigrette. (this is where dinner turned south for me. The soba noodles were over cooked didn't see much papaya mostly bell peppers and it was overdressed to the point I was puckering the miso cod was over salted, generally just had a bad dish. Consistency went out the window with that.) My girlfriend had the steak frites au poive it was a hanger steak and a poive sauce and a side of fries (i must admit.. I kinda wished I order that. The steak and poive sauce was a heavenly mix. Sweet nodes from the brandy with the ""buttery"" and ""juicy "" of the steak *side tip: if you can, eat rare I advise that. The fries it boarder line killing the dish. Hands down good steak.)Desserts: we just shared both desserts. Frozen yogurt with blueberries, vanilla poached peaches with tiny bits of toasted almonds. (Barely had almonds.. the froyo is.. not that memorable. The peaches were tasty.) Bittersweet chocolate mousse. (The presentation was nice, the cherries paired well with the mousse. If you eat the froyo first then the  mousse it doesn't overwhelm you with the usually chocolate taste u get when u have mousse. ) Overall experience was nice the ambience was nice not too crowded so we weren't yelling to each other, but honestly would have only gotten 2 stars if it wasn't for that steak.

Interesting because the BR Guest group owns both Blue Fin and Ocean Grill and Ocean is much better quality sushi than Blue Fin. The salmon roe was bordering on expiring, they don't use any mirin at all, and the dressings on the sushi all pretty much tasted the same. I actually had king salmon belly and kanpachi today in Hoboken that ""blew"" blue fin away. Stay away from the thai eggplant, as well. Looked interesting but came out rubbery and quite dry.

5.0,6/1/2015,"Excellent $$$$eafoodFood: 4.75 StarsNo  matter what you order, you will enjoy the meal (unless you knowingly order something you dislike to prove me wrong). The seafood without a doubt is fresh. The sushi glistens in the light as though it was caught/trapped/speared earlier that day. Each piece in the sampler has their own little addition whether it's a sauce or a thin slice of jalapeno. The seafood tower is gigantic, but overpriced for what you receive. The food is delicious. Almost a whole lobster with salmon ceviche, mussels, clams, shrimp and more. Everything is placed neatly over ice in a very presentable tower. The lemons are wrapped in a thin cloth to prevent the seeds from falling into your food. The dish is well planned out for the simplest and easiest dining experience possible for the customer. $52 for 1-2 guests.Oh that Halibut! Nothing impressed me more that evening than the melt-in-your--mouth goodness of that piece of fish over Portobello mushrooms and gnocchi. The outside layer is crisp, but once you break through the fork will flow through it like water. When you have your fellow diners raving about the bread and soft rolls, you know you are doing something right.Drinks: 3.25 StarsThe weakest link of the evening was the Blue Fin cocktail. It is the signature drink of the restaurant and by far the most intriguing on the drink menu. The sweetness of the Blue Fin cocktail was off putting. Taking a sip overpowers any dish you are eating at the time. I highly recommend going with a cocktail with a lower sweetness or go with beer/wine.If you are drinking at the bar, without food, it is something to try, but unless you love sweet drinks you likely will not enjoy it. The Swedish fish is a nice touch. Service: 4.5 StarsThe server was very friendly, helpful and moderately quick despite handling a large quantity of tables in the section we were seated. He was able to spout out the specials with authority and without stuttering at any point in time. Knowing the specials of the day by heart is common in any restaurant, but the delivery and the personality of this particular server made you really want to order one if not all the specials. He made them sound delicious.The tiny fork clip on the server's tie is cute. I wonder if all the servers were wearing them, or if it was only our server (didn't play close enough attention). Ambiance: 4.5 StarsOnce you get past the bar crowd at the restaurant you witness a sight to behold. Everything has a modern flair from the tables/chairs to the walls. Where else in New York can you find the walls plastered in such a way to look like a rippled sandy untouched beach. The beautiful environment and the comfortable chairs almost make you forget about the loud conversations muddled together from all the nearby tables, but overall who cares when you are with your fellow diners enjoying a good meal.Need to use the restroom and the ground floor is overcrowded? Try the restrooms on the second floor. The crowds are non-existent in comparison to the ground floor and are majestic in its décor, but not the odor. The stalls are bizarre and the lighting is awful.The only noticeable flaw I discovered is the proximity of the tables to each other. There is enough room to pass through, but in the colder months the space becomes mildly cramped. Overall: 4.5 StarsDishes are delicious; take my word for it if you are willing to pay for it.Restrooms on the second floor are recommended due to the crowds on the first floor.Becomes crowded and noisy during peak hours.Mind you the prices are a bit exorbitant, but it is in Times Square and everything is high quality.The portions do not look like much, but don't underestimate them; you will be full by the end of the meal, so don't fill up on their delicious soft bread.Make sure to have a reservation to guarantee a table.Going to a show or maybe just eating out.

Despite the fact that we had a reservation for a booth & the downstairs hostess confirming this fact, the upstairs host put us at a wobbly table. When my cousin complained to the manager,Alex, he gave us a massive attitude & proceeded to argue with us. The restaurant was not full & in fact, he had given smaller parties than ours booths without an issue. When we finally got the booth, our waitress was nowhere to be found, our food was delayed & mine was cold. We asked the other manager Marcella to get us the check because the server never returned & we had a show to see. Although I wrote to the feedback address listed on the bill, I never heard back.

The restaurant is two levels so there is ample seating for all and there's a bar on the main level where you can booze and watch the people from all over the world walk pass.The service at Blue Fin was spot on. Our server Bryon was personable, knowledgeable about the menus (drinks/food/dessert) and gave us great recommendations. If possible sit in his section.The drinks here are damn strong which is a plus, the food (sushi) was really good, the carrot cake was delicious and the rum raisin ice cream that came along with the carrot cake had a little too much rum in it for me.Overall, I liked my dining experience here and would come back. The reason why Blue Fin is getting 3 stars instead of 4 is because we only got 6 pieces in our sushi rolls. If I'm paying $17-$18 for a roll I'd like more than 6 pieces please. I'm use to getting 8-10 pieces so Blue Fin catch up.What we had-Kumquat Blossoms were refreshing and packed with gin (4 stars). Definitely a drink to try if you like Gin. -Shrimp & Lobster Spring Rolls were just OK (2 stars)-Truffle Steak Fries were thick and crunchy (4 stars)-Sushi Roll of the day: Soft Shell Crab should definitely be part of the regular menu because its that good (4 stars)-Times Square Roll: must try (4 stars)-Eel Avocado Roll: highly recommend this roll (4 stars)-Faroe Island Roll: didn't really like this roll (2 stars)-Carrot Cake with Rum Raisin Ice Cream: loved the cake, but thought the ice cream had too much of rum (3 stars)",7,3,4,Norm J.,"Near North Side, Chicago, IL",776,590,2135

2.0,3/22/2015,1st I would like to say the only reason I'm giving this Resturant 2 stars is because of the location and the layout of the seating is very nice and intimate.But other than that the place is horrible. The food is not that good the service is okay and the food is overpriced...We had a $500 plus Bill the waiter was not accommodating for our very large group. And even after spending that amount of money we were asked when are we leaving because they had another group coming very very inconsiderate and unprofessional......I would not recommend this place to anyone there are a lot of other better restaurants......My advice to someone looking to go here to eat don't do it.........,0,0,0,Jamar B.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,5,0

2.0,3/20/2015,"""Worst 70 dollar meal I've ever had."" Yes they have the atmosphere. Yes, the waiters and help staff all well trained. But the food was bland and unremarkable in every way.We started with edemame. And that was alright. We didn't care for the extra seasoning. I would recommend getting them with just salt. The bread felt warm coming out but the outside was hard and seemed stale. Like it had just been sitting under a heat lamp.We came here for sushi not realizing there was 5 fricking choices. You would think they would all be good! But this was not the case. We order the Time Square, caterpillar roll (which is basically their eel roll) and some other roll. I think salmon. The best one was the caterpillar and it's not even technically on the menu. They all had no flavor. We drenched every piece of sushi in soy sauce out of necessity. In the end, we let the bus boy take half our dinner away.I ordered a Stella and my boyfriend had a Sapporra. Besides taking a while to come out those were fine. It was very busy and our waiter stayed close so we weren't worried. The beer was probably the high light.All in all, I can't believe for a place that has 10 things on the menu can't get 4 of them to taste decent. This is not a sushi restaurant. It's a bar that sells raw fish. Costco has better sushi than this and not to mention better selection!",0,0,0,Alle M.,"Grapevine, TX",5,1,0

They had a table for us downstairs but we asked if we could sit upstairs and they had no problem with that. We ordered the Charred Spanish Octopus as an appetizer and it was spectacular. For our entrees I had the Faroe Island Crispy Skin Salmon which I thought was quite good. My girlfriend had the Pan Seared Halibut which she enjoyed and I thought was good too. For desert we had one of the Valentine's day specials which did not disappoint either. It was a great meal to end a good night. Our waiter was always around and answered all of our questions precisely. Our food came in good time and we were always well tended to. The meal ended up costing a little more than we expected but it was worth it.

If you're in the market for well prepared, good quality, delicious seafood dishes (sushi to cooked) - then this is the place. But you must also remember that you are paying for the quality of the food, so even though we feel the prices are reasonable, others may not. By no means let the location - in the midst of Times Square - fool you. Even though tourists may stop by to eat here, this is not a tourist stop. At this point I think we've tried most of the menu! Their salads are fresh and delicious; their daily soups  are warm and comforting; their sushi is unique because it includes a variety of different ingredients; their main dishes are well portioned and worth every bite; and their desert is top notch.

The main dish was the cod which was pretty good too, although nothing special. The presentation looks very upscale as well as the quantity they give(not a lot).for dessert, i got the chocolate torte which def was the best part of the meal.

I came here for Xmas eve and it was sensational. This is one of my favorite places to get seafood in the city. Whenever I come here it's an absolute treat. I always want to eat everything. And even the bread basket is to die for! I have been fortunate to have been here a fair amount for birthdays. And we are always getting that special treatment and special seating. I always start with the octopus! It's perfection! The presentation is just as good as the taste. Those crispy charred tentacles are my absolute obsession. On this occasion they had a Rose Cava!? A must have in my book! Two of my fave wines combined into one. Let's just say I was not disappointed. For my entree I got the crispy skin salmon with sunchoke puree, pocini and pearl onions. So many of my favorite ingredients all in one. It was mouth watering. I have had the halibut in the past with the gnocchi, lump crab, petite portabellos and arugula. Also a real winner. Blue Fin has a clean and focused concept with their dishes and the flavor profiles just work. Another favorite is the sesame crusted tuna, the rare tuna and the Asian noodles definitely hit the spot when you want to change things up. Now let's talk about my favorite part of the meal....desserts!! On this recent Xmas eve I had the Buche de Noel (Xmas Log). The xmas log is a rolled cake to resemble a log. This particular log had a cheesy and raspberry filing and a chocolate cake with chocolate frosting and meringue mushrooms. I could not have been more impressed or happy. It was a seasonal dessert.

The Restaurant it's self is beautiful and the service was outstanding.

I had never been but was told it was pretty good, and the Yelp reviews seemed pretty reasonable, so I looked forward to trying it out.Blue Fin primarily is known for seafood and sushi, and this dominates their menu. I decided to start with a lobster bisque which I felt was fantastic. It had a very rich flavor and was quite yummy, though it was a bit skimpy on the lobster itself. I next split some oysters on the half shell, and both the presentation and flavor were great. Since sushi is one of their specialties, I decided to split 3 rolls with another person, all 3 rolls having been recommended by our waitress. Admittedly, I was pretty nonplussed by the rolls. The presentation was reasonable, but the rolls themselves were nothing fantastic. I am a sushi connoisseur, and these rolls just don't compare to really good sushi rolls. So although I really enjoyed the first 2 parts of the meal, the disappointment of the sushi really brings down the overall rating for me.The prices were a little high for the amount of food received but weren't horrible. The service was fantastic, and our waitress was very attentive and also very knowledgeable. The food was a mixed bag for me, as the starters were great but the main attraction was a bit blasé.

The tartare and spring rolls were also great. However, we move on to the main courses. There were two orders of the filet mignon and two orders of the halibut. Both steaks were asked to be cooked to medium rare but when i got mine, it was well over. It may have looked medium rare but i broke into a sweat trying to cut through the meat. Really, really upsetting. But its a seafood restaurant! So i had my money on the halibut. I took a bite of my parents and almost felt bad that they had to eat it. It was as dry as a brick. Wildly overcooked. It did not flake apart loosely like it should have. I was shocked a restaurant of this cost and hype could put out something so disappointing. Overall, we started off great but the entrees were a complete upset. However, we did have a great waiter who was sharp, polite and attentive.

2.0,12/6/2014,"My girlfriend and I popped into Blue Fin for a post-theater-outing bite. It really was average at best, and pales in comparison to other modern Japanese restaurants like Ipuddo. The oysters were very weak, no particular flavor or body. The shishito peppers were too soft, but they were flavorful. The halibut was incredibly dry and lacked any particular character. The only dish really worth any praise was the tuna tartare. Gorgeous flavor, chunky and delicious. They did have a good sake list. No complaints there. My girlfriend was very satisfied with her dirty martini.The service leaves one wanting. While our waiter was perfectly nice, it took WAY too long to get his attention. In my mind, service should be seamless, and I kept getting distracted by him running around, clearly a bit overwhelmed - which really is more of an indication to how the restaurant is run, and not the individual. Would I come back? I'd give it a second chance, but only in the situation of a downpour when I was going to the theater with friends. It really is not a special spot for a date or any special occasion.",2,2,2,Josh T.,"Manhattan, NY",95,10,4

People were talking but it is by no means loud. Food was delicious. Started with raw bar, clams, which were super fresh. I had the catch of the day and my date had the lobster.

4.0,10/28/2014,"There is a stand-out amongst all the eateries in the tourist driven Times Square area. Blue Fin is definitely easy to love. The operation is located on the ground floor of the W Hotel. I learned BF is part of the well respected, multi-concept group of restaurants from BR Guest Hospitality.Upon entering, you can't help but noticing the sultry vibe taking place in the bar which is a great place to meet for a drink. Ascending the stairwell to the upstairs dining area one is caught up swimming in an abstract sculpture, a school of white fish adorning the wall.Whats not to love about bivalves and our must have to start comes from the raw bar. Catch a splendid selection of several varieties of oysters on the half shell as a prelude to entrees. We sink our teeth in a few from the West coast. The Totten Inlet from Puget Sound have a medium salinity and a taste of seaweed. Further South in Carlsbad, CA come the Luna Lagoon. They bring out a melon like finish and are mildly briny. From Canada's Prince Edward Island we devour the firm Deep Coves. Don't miss the jumbo lump crab cake with meyer lemon aioli. Blue crab, red bell peppers and Old Bay seasoning are bound with with mayonnaise and a hint of breadcrumbs.Next, we plot our main courses. Dive into the Scottish Salmon with crispy skin, chanterelle mushrooms and an almond-parsley emulsion. The moist fish is artfully arranged over a creamy celery root puree. Notwithstanding, it's the fine dispersion with the sweet kernel of fruit coupled with the slightly pepper herb that take it to another level. Reel in the delicate Mediterranean Bronzino teething with red quinoa, chorizo, spiced walnuts and pear. I admire the clarity and complexity of flavors. Be sure to hook up the signature entree of pan seared Halibut with herb gnocchi, crab meat, petite portobellos and wilted arugula. The entrees show off the finesse of Chef and truly inspire your palate. Great food demands great wine. With an impressive list  of some 200+ selections one is sure to find the right match for their dining experience.We would love to stay longer and order up more well-made dishes. However, curtain call for our Broadway show is soon approaching and fortunately time does allow for dessert. Keeping with the season, a decadent pumpkin cream brulle, punishingly rich and velvety does the trick. To compliment our end of meal, a glass of Sauterne from a Chateau Laribotte 2007 is the perfect finish to an outstanding repast. Recommend Blue Fin to your friends and they will undoubtedly thank you.",1,0,1,Carson D.,"Chicago, IL",5,23,0

4.0,10/4/2014,"This is a four star rating in the context of where this restaurant is:  NYC, in the heart of the theater district.  As most people know, it is almost impossible to find a nice, reasonable place near Times Square.  I needed a ""proper"" place for a pre-theater lunch with my Mom an 9 year old (that means waiter service, no pizza joints, and nothing ""too ethnic"".   was hesitant to try Blue Fin due its lack of stellar reciews, but I have to admit I was quite pleased with the place.  In the W Hotel, this bi level restaunt is sleek and modern with large comfy booths and tables.   I do need to address the service since that seemed to be an area of concern on previous reviews I had read.  On the day we were there the service was absolutely fabulous.  The servers were pleasant, friendly, and extremely accomodating.  The food came out super fast.Seafood is the star at Blue Fin so that is what we mostly ordered.  My mother loved her Cherrystones ($10/6).  Blue Fin has a fairly large sushi menu, but 9 year old and I just shared one roll of his choosing, Californication ($12).  I thought this would just be a pretty straight forward Californa Roll but it was much better.  The crab was actually fresh (not surimi), so along with the fresh shrimo, cucumber, avocado, and mango sauce, these were a few very tasty bites.  Indeed, each of us only had 3 very tasty pieces as all of the sushi rolls has only 6 pieces.For brunch, various breakfast type items are offered.  My Mom had the Tomato & Gruyere Frittata.  She was happy with it but  9 year Old and I had to stick  with seafood.  He ordered the Maine Lobster & Shrimp Roll ($26).  This was a huge portion and very tasty.  It was however not a traditional  New England style lobster roll with nice big chunks of lobster.  It was more like a really high quality lobster and shrimp deli salad (small pieces of fish & a tad too much mayo).  I thoroughly enjoyed my Seafood Salad ($24):  shrimp, crab, calamari, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, avocado, & corn with a luscious, zingy lemon pepper vinaigrette.  All these texures and flavors melded beautifully on the plate and in my mouth.  Fantastic!At brunch all dishes come with a mimosa, bloody mary, or beverage of choice.  My bloody was strong & yummy and made the upcoming musical even more enjoyable!  The bread basket was yummy too, filled both with sweet and savory treats.  Yes, it is expensive, but Blue Fin is definitely a convenient, elegant, and tasty option in the theater district.",10,8,9,Joan L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",678,971,6603

3.0,8/20/2014,"Blue Fin Restaurant...July 2014 - 3 Stars: smack dab on Broadway at 47th Street in the middle of Times Square. If you are going to a play on Broadway, this establishment just might be your cup of tea for location and offerings. We had heard that the fish was very good but the sushi was uneven. We stuck with the fish and only had a single tasting of the sushi, and weren't sorry. The small plate appetizers and soup stole the show. Our party of four split lobster toast and tempura shrimp appetizers - both were five-star nice and offered just a taste of the variety here; could have made a meal out of the lobster toast...and the breading on the tempura shrimp didn't encumber the shrimp. For dinner three of us had the halibut (all three felt it was so-so) while the fourth ate lighter with just spring rolls (very nice). The problem with the halibut was that the Chef put the lemon on for us and it was way overdone ... I think that's a classic mistake in putting lemon on for the customer - let the customer do it tailored to their taste. The halibut was nicely prepared and flaky, but you couldn't taste fish just lemon. Two of our table had the corn bisque soup with the entrée and felt it was the highlight of the meal. Dessert was molten cake and a sorbet variety ... both were very nice. We chose a light French white Sancerre wine to accompany the meal - perfect notes.All-in-all fun place to have dinner - the restaurant had a cool décor and service was very good. Coupled with the fact that our playhouse was just around the corner, it made for a perfect setup for the evening. Broadway is noisy outside, but all was quiet and calm inside ... give it a try but don't forget to ask for no lemon.",3,0,1,Rick B.,"Orland Park, IL",33,806,440

I felt the seafood calamari salad was not too fresh since it made my stomach hurt and another person said the shrimp was the kind that came in a bag. Being that it is a seafood restaurant, I would expect it to be and taste fresh. I tried their east and west oysters. I'm not sure which it was but I was not happy with that either. It had a really slimy feel. The only appetizer I was happy with was the sushi that they brought out. It tasted like your typical maki roll. I had the cod to follow which was not bad but because of the appetizer, I couldn't bring myself to continue my meal. Finally I had a few bites of my chocolate mousse cake with cherry ice cream.

I thought this was a great idea because the restaurant looked AMAZING and they had a decent restaurant week menu.Here is Why I will NEVER Eat here again and suggest that you do the same:I am a food critic that writes articles for several publications so as you can imagine I dine out quite frequently! The food was not the major issue it was the disgusting service that we received.After we sat down, our waitress completely ignored us for over 15 minutes before coming over to take our drink orders (Im talking about walking past and when asked if it was ok to order a drink her response was to rudely say "" GIMME A MINUTE"")..please take into consideration that when we were seated at 9:00PM on the upstairs section it was NOT busy .  We ordered our food which i will describe in a little but what i wanted to elaborate on was the way in which this waitress spoke to us when she thought I had made a mistake. For dessert I ordered the summer peach shortcake, when the waitress came to the table she brought the chocolate mousse tarte. I told her that the order was wrong because I ordered the shortcake. Her response was:1) Yes you did order the chocolate cake2) Maybe it was the accoustics but I know I heard you say chocolate3) I can change it for you but I know you ordered chocolate In all of that I did not respond to her because I do NOT eat chocolate so I am unsure as to why I would choose to order bittersweet chocolate for my dessert.Oh But it doesnt end there!When she brings the dessert out to me she then reiterates ""here is the dessert ; even though thats not what you ordered."" Before we finished our dessert she came and dropped the check on the table as if she wanted us to eat..not asking if we wanted anything else because the entire table was ready to order more drinks and try other things on the menu but instead we took our business elsewhere.. if you want to be treated like a second rate patron..go to blue fin for dinner!",5,3,0,Sean H.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,1,0

And again, there was a crowd swarmed around their station. I will admit,  I made a pig of myself and glad I did. I never had spicy crab and to say it was outstanding wouldn't do it any justice.

We were really the only table left.They have some really interesting, super Americanized sushi options if you're into that. We tried a few. Free drink for every person during brunch, but the drinks are SO SO weak it's very silly.Thai Sesame roll - spicy hamchi, crunchy quinoa, coconut green curry - comes wrapped in something that isn't seaweed and the wrap isn't good. Almost no quinoa - some pieces were missing it entirely.We also got the special roll - came with several types of fish, pear, avocado, and a bbq eel sauce. Not bad.Corn bread and banana bread are complimentary on the table.Also, how weird is it that they don't have any steamed white rice? How do you make your sushi rice then if you don't start with steamed white rice?Servers were so hard to get a hold of even once the place cleared out. I have no idea what they were doing or why they didn't ever check up on us.

They have a very large seafood selection however we did not partake. I had a classic eggs Benedict which was good, nothin to write home about but it is kind of a standard thing to order anyway. I didn't find it to be extraordinary but we didn't order anything too mind blowing so who knows, maybe their sushi is fantastic. One thing I did like is that they bring mini cornbread muffins and poppy seed banana bread for the table which was nice. All in all a good experience it just wasn't exceptional.

I was dumbfounded.  In the meantime the hostess walked towards me and I said, ""did you see what he just did?""  She said. ""I have no idea what you are talking about"".  OK  The waiter then appears and apologized saying he didn't mean to run me down.  I said of course not but you really have to be more careful.  Hostess is hearing all this turns on her heals and scoots away.  The waiter is still apologizing so I wave him off and say forget just be more careful.  I really expected someone to come to the table and offer a drink or dessert.  But nothing.  Not even when we were leaving.  Walked right by the hostess and the manager.  I will never return to the Blue Fin and I am sure no one cares but somewhere you have to say to yourself.

(there was an appetizer and a main dish that both had ""scottish salmon"".)A.  I'm not sure.  (he had to go into the kitchen to ask, then comes back).  It's from Scotland, and it's raw.   We were happy to get an answer, but he didn't know this from the get-go?? We thought he was a trainee.We then asked him what a major ingredient in the chicken dish description was (Mangito or something).  He had no idea and never found out for us. We think it was one of the veggies in the dish.If you have celiac or other dietary restrictions, this kind of ignorance could be deadly.He didn't know if the regular non Restaurant Week menu could also be had in the much brighter, glass- windowed bar, which is the much-more fun place to be hanging in this restaurant.We then asked the guy who was very official looking at the host/hostess podium if the chowder was on the regular menu.  He didn't know.Poorly trained staff.And first floor toilet is a single stall bathroom right by the kitchen (unappetizing in every way).  The 2nd floor is more elegant, dark, and probably has better toilets.",0,0,0,Robin G.,"New York, NY",2,45,0

3.0,2/18/2014,"Coming here at 10:30pm on a Monday night may have been a bad choice. First of all there were barely any tables so it seemed like the most logical would be there would be servers that would have their attention on us, instead we were put in a corner away from most people and occasionally just ignored. On top of that servers constantly came around us setting up and getting ready for the day tomorrow. In my opinion if people are still eating in your restaurant around you and are trying to enjoy their dinner it doesn't seem very kind or respectful to saunter around them coming in and out around tables putting coffee cups and putting away dining placemats. As for the food, I could say for the price I have had better. We had the set dinner which included an appetizer, entree, and dessert. I had the salmon and avocado roll, salmon with nuts and spinach, and assorted sorbets. The sushi was a little meh, considering it is supposed to be a sushi place this kind of depressed me. I also had the salmon which was actually quite delicious. Moist and juicy with the nuts and spinach really hit the spot, wish there was more on the plate. Finally the sorbets really pulled it off because there seemed to be more sorbet than there was entree and appetizer combined. I had three LARGE scoops of raspberry, grapefruit, and mango. Sadly the sorbet came at least 15 minutes after they had cleared our table and I felt like I was waiting forever for something that would never come. For a place that was highly reviewed I felt a little underwhelmed.",0,0,0,Haidee P.,"Alameda, CA",35,27,53

First of all, the space of the restaurant is very pretty and its a good place to go for a business lunch.  The downstairs area is a little louder than upstairs.  The waiters here are wonderful and ever so accommodating. I have celiac and the waiter told me that I can chose any sushi roll I wanted from the menu and with minor adjustments, they will make it gluten free.  I have been here a few times and the food is consistently tasty.  I have had salmon from their simply grilled menu and several sushi rolls (such as tuna roll, salmon roll, tuna avocado roll, and a special roll that had avocado and cucumber with king crab on top).  Everything was so delicious. The portions are moderate so you will be full but not overly stuffed.  I typically get one special sushi roll or two simpler rolls and a salad.   Its enough to fill me up.",0,0,0,Sana A.,"Brooklyn, NY",20,137,4

1.0,1/28/2014,"Last night my family and a friend went to Blue Fin for dinner. We ordered our drinks and a few clams and oysters to start. After placing our order for our drinks and appetizers with the waitress, she continued to talk to us instead of placing the order into her computer. Finally the appetizers came and it was time to place the main order. My father in law ordered a 2LB steamed lobster in the shell and my family friend ordered a broiled lobster NO SHELL stuffed with crab meat, during this whole ordered main entrees time, the waitress continued to talk almost to the point where she did not hear our order. So dinners arrive, the waitress comes out (for my mother in law) with a steamed most likely 1LB lobster OUT of the shell, not what he ordered! My friend received her lobster steamed in the shell stuffed with crab meat. The order was completely wrong and the waitress instead of redoing the order without us knowing, decided it would be better for her to bring out the lobsters, tell us she messed up or the kitchen messed up and see if we wanted that instead. OF COURSE WE DON'T! That's not what they ordered. So instead of listening she just kept on talking. My father in law asked for a new lobster steamed in the shell, and the one good thing they did the entire night was bring in a 3 LB after messing up two lobsters. Second problem! I don't understand how a place that serves lobsters, serve the lobsters without lobster crackers and without lobster forks? So we had to ask the waitress, yet she was nowhere to be found and so instead we asked a busser and finally after my friends lobster was finished we received ONE cracker and TWO lobster forks.... I'm pretty sure we ordered two lobsters.... and because they messed up the one with the crab stuffing they should have given two, but they didn't. Finally my Father in laws lobster comes (no cracker) and it was broiled/ burnt! We can't get the waitress because now she is nowhere to be found, but finally decides to see how we are doing once my father in law is done with his burnt/broiled lobster. We spoke to the manager and of course he had nothing to say except sorry. Next problem! No we don't want dessert; we want to leave this place after all the problems. The bill arrives along with a bowl of cookies and some chocolate pieces ""on the house.""  We thanked her for the cookies and thought all the problems were done with. We ask the waitress to please put a SPECIFIC amount on the card and the rest of the bill pay in cash and your tip is included in the cash. You will never believe what she does..... She puts the ENTIRE bill on the card and keeps the cash! What?!?! A 250% tip..... Obviously another time where she is too busy talking about the cookies and chocolates to hear what we said. It's not like it's busy in the place/ loud and it's not like we are whispering either. Of course we can't call the waitress over because she is too busy talking to another table, after 10 minutes of trying to get the waitresses attention my father in law has to get up from the table and find the manager again. We tell the manager what happened and he again just says sorry and fixes the bill. When he comes back with the bill the only thing he can say to us is ""Here is my card.....""  I don't know how his card will help? But the waitress kept the original tip she received without coming over and apologizing for not listening to her customers.  I have worked in the restaurant business before and do not understand how so many problems can occur during one meal. We went to dinner very early and the restaurant was very empty. How can all these problems occur while the restaurant is empty at an early dinner? In addition to that, something should have been taken care of or done by the manager besides ""here is my business card...""I cannot believe a nice restaurant in the heart of Time Square could mess up a dinner for 4 people at such an early dinner seating.",0,0,0,Esther F.,"Manhattan, NY",35,5,0

To our surprise when we called to let them know, we were told that they would move our reservation to 6: 00 and to drive safely. Did i mention this was the week between Christmas & New Years? When we finally got to the restaurant we were greeted by the hostess and escorted to our table on the upper level.  the atmosphere at Blue Fin is quite energetic. Because the restaurant is part of the W hotel and on the corner of Broadway & 46th, it gets a wide range of visitors so don't expect a romantic atmosphere. Starting with the service; it was excellent as our server took our drink order and gave us time to decide on appetizers. When he returned we ordered our app's and entrees. His recommendations on the Entrees were spot-on. We enjoyed a chilled lobster app along with some steamed dumplings - delicious. For dinner we went the Sushi route, ordering some hand rolls and Sashimi that was absolutely Fresh, Delicious, and Beautifully Prepared. As for our drinks; I had a couple of bottles of beer and my wife had a couple of Magnificent Gin Martini's. Blue Fin is a great place to escape the madness and ocean of people on Time Square, especially during the holiday season.

The branzino was under-seasoned but my main issue was that the kitchen neglected to heat the plate, which meant my dish was cold by the time I was halfway through.

1.0,11/29/2013,"So appalled by Blue Fin I created a yelp account just to write this.Went to the city for a cocktail this morning with my father. Unbeknownst to me at the time, he had just started a new medication. But he ended up having an adverse reaction to it. We couldn't find an available cab, so I had to help him through Times Square to the train station. After several blocks I thought it would be a good idea to get him off his feet and rest for a bit. Given the day, our options were limited, but luckily we finally saw Blue Fin was open and went inside to take a seat at one of the lounge tables,First of all, the bartender wouldn't even serve me, He pretty much looked at my father in disgust, and in front of the all the patrons at the bar, basically made it sound like he thought my father was an alcoholic (not the case), refusing us service and tell me we ""should probably leave."" This was very embarrassing. We just needed to sit for a bit so he could get his bearings. Couldn't even do this.So since we were essentially getting kicked out, I decided we should use the bathroom real quick. It was a single stall, so my dad used it first, then I. But when I came out I heard two employees AND a manager (I assume. Headset/jacket) talking shit about him in their side hutch. I mean, at least wait till we are out of earshot, So we left right after. Luckily we made it back to the train station, given the cold and the crowds today. No thanks to the staff of Blue Fin.  Now the worst part is, up until August I used to WORK for BR Guest, the company that owns Blue Fin. Also right in Times Square. I was even BORROWED at this restaurant before. So I know for a fact that this behavior and attitude is not what we are taught during training, nor is the standard that we strive to hold ourselves by. My GM at the time would be just as disgusted as I if this was the kind of service that was provided there. We would never just refuse service like that. We have even at times insisted people stay longer just so we knew that they would be safe.So in short Blue Fin, I understand that you are in the W hotel, and think you are hot shit. And I get that you have a certain price point and a certain service which allows your staff to walk around with their noses in the air and look down at us common folk. And I know that this review will probably never be seen by anyone there, or just fall on deaf ears. But for what its worth, you have lost my respect.

3.0,8/9/2013,"I decided to book this restaurant during restaurant week and to celebrate an anniversary. First, I hate walking near Times Square because of the insane amount of crowds but was willing to push that aside since I love seafood and sushi. It's easy to find the place and inside, it's a classy and elegant feel. The host was kind and sent me upstairs despite the fact that I was super early for the reservation. The wall decor is beautiful and nice to look at. The bread we received was soft inside and SUPER salty outside. Choosing from the restaurant week menu, we selected Tuna roll, Salmon with crispy skin, trio of sorbet and Balcony seafood platter. The place is very busy so you'll see the waiters flying by and letting you feel a nice gust of wind like you're sitting outdoor. The tuna roll was a bit spicy but not bad. I would never pay full price for that and would rather go to the sushi places for $2.50 rolls which are huge, fresh and delicious. The salmon was good but I wasn't liking the tomato and beans that came with it. It was pretty weird and I had to shove that around my plate. The trio of sorbet was unique which included strawberry, grapefruit, white peach. Strawberry was the only one I could tolerate. The seafood platter was interesting. It came with lobster, shrimp, mussels with a strange sour ceviche-like topping, oysters, and a bit of other stuff I wasn't sure about. Basically, this can be a seafood lover's dream. Everything comes pre-cracked and easy to pull out and eat. Pretty nice. Gotta love that. I would only go back to celebrate a special occasion but that's probably only once in a while, if even once in five years. Good experience but I wouldn't recommend to go as a regular customer.",0,0,0,Shelley L.,"New York, NY",96,466,1212
4.0,8/8/2013,"I dined at Blue Fin while in NY for a long work weekend. It was a quick meal, as we were on our way to catch a show, but overall, the experience was quite pleasant. We ate at the bar, since there were just three of us, and were seated immediately. I appreciate how prompt and attentive our waiter was when we told him we were in a bit of a hurry to make the show. I enjoyed the Times Square roll (which was flavorful and fresh, but a bit large in size) and a glass of Prosecco champagne. The rest of the menu looked a bit limited for a sushi joint, but covered all the raw essentials. I would have loved to try a hand roll or some nigiri but we were just too pressed for time.Overall, a lovely experience and I appreciate the speedy and considerate service!",1,0,1,Carolyn K.,"Columbus, OH",339,126,48

We ordered sushi and it was super STINKY!! I guess the seafood on Monday afternoon is more ""leftover weekend fare"" than ""fresh catch for the week"".   We were polite and forgiving while telling our waitress that the fish tasted bad (like it had spoiled). She offered up a different choice but we had come for the sushi. She took it personally and never returned to our table. The manager came over to ask about our meal. No apologies made. A different server came to bring our bill for 2 iced teas and one of the five partially eaten sushi rolls. It felt more like the buffet at the Rio in Las Vegas than an upscale restaurant in Times Square. So many choices of restaurants in New York.

2.0,8/5/2013,"I was so disappointed with this restaurant. The place was clean, and I loved the colors and decor, but the food was just blah! My friend and I came here for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. There are two levels and we were seated on the second level. We were starving and were glad that they weren't too busy considering they're located right in the heart of Times Square.We both ordered the Wild Mushroom Omelet, and we both wished we had ordered something else. There was way too much egg and not enough filling. Actually, there was hardly any mushrooms or cheese in the omelet, and it was so bland. I usually don't like adding salt and pepper to my food, but I had to for this meal.The service was good at first, but when we were ready for the check, the waitress was no where to be found.

5.0,8/5/2013,"My friend and I were trying to kill some time in Times Square so we decided to give Blue Fin a try. IT WAS AWESOME.First off, the interior of the restaurant is gorgeous. Most of the patrons here seem to be businessmen who are treating colleagues or clients out to a fancy dinner, and the decor and atmosphere of the establishment reflect that. Both levels of the restaurant are designed to be very modern and high-class, and I highly recommend that you dress to match if you're planning on going!Since my friend and I just decided to walk into the building on a whim, I felt severely underdressed the whole meal (I was wearing shorts and a collared shirt).As for the food, prepare yourself for some excellent seafood!For appetizers, my friend and I ordered the 3 East, 3 West oyster platter and the tuna tartar. Both dishes tasted incredibly fresh, and the tuna tartar had a slight spiciness to it that I really enjoyed. I highly recommend both.For my main entree, I got the crispy skin Scottish salmon. The bed of sweet corn, squash, beans, and red pepper coulis that the fish sits on actually makes for a healthy stew of sorts that wouldn't be a bad entree on its own. The salmon itself was high-quality and expertly cooked, and I just loved feeling the crunch and tasting the saltiness of the crispy skin.For dessert, we got the vanilla creme brulee, and you really can't go wrong with that decision. The pistachio biscotti it comes with was something new that I hadn't tried before, but its nuttiness complemented the sweetness of the creme brulee very well.As for the service, my friend and I were big fans of our waiter. Contrary to the atmosphere of the restaurant, he was very down-to-earth and candid. He gave his own personal opinion on some of the dishes we were looking at, and we're extremely glad he did! He warned us away from dishes that wouldn't satisfy us (even if they would have made the final check and resulting tip larger).In addition to all of this, the general manager heard that it was our first time eating at Blue Fin, so he took the time to personally introduce himself to us in case we needed anything. At the end of our meal, he came by the table and gave us chocolate chip cookies to go because it was our first time dining with them!I haven't experienced that sort of restaurant hospitality or service in a long time!I was really impressed with the dinner experience I had at Blue Fin, and I highly recommend the restaurant to people looking for a high-class seafood dinner in Times Square.Phenomenal service, food, and atmosphere.

1.0,8/2/2013,"If I could give ""0"" stars I would. First off, the hostess was rude because she couldn't get my name right. Second, it took 10 mins to get water and it was a really hot day. Third, I asked for a virgin cocktail: anything sweet and good (emphasizing SWEET). I instead received a passion fruit + grapefruit cocktail = bitter and sour. I sent it back and they gave me a cheap mix of pineapple juice + cranberry in the same glass with all the juices dripping off of it. Fourth, I asked for a medium salmon. Instead I received a fully cooked and dry salmon filet. I sent it back and the second time it was again fully cooked and dry. This is supposedly a top-notch seafood restaurant, why can't the executive chef make medium salmon properly? The waiter argued back with me that it wasn't fully cooked so I asked for the manager (Mike). The manager looked disinterested in listening to my complaint and didn't say a word except, ""Did you order your dessert already?"" I said, ""Yes."" He then took my barely-touched plate away and didn't say a word. I sat for 10 mins hungry and confused as to what the manager is planning to do. I signaled to the manager when I saw him and he came over and I asked him, ""Did I miss something? What am I waiting for?"" He replied, ""For your dessert."" This was shocking to me because after I told him how unhappy I was about my experience he did nothing to compensate but literally wanted me to get out as quickly as possible. It was ONLY after I asked for the general manager that he felt threatened so he shaped up when it was too late. He finally offered a steak filet free of charge and I took his offer but who wants to take home a cold steak and eat it at 10:30PM when I could have had dinner at 7:00?

It's definitely a good alternative to all the chain places located in the area.

The breakfast side I would say their fresh squeezed juices are definitely worth a try, I've had a coup,e and my favorite was the Power Driver, which is a mix of orange, carrot & ginger. I think I've recently replaced my pomegranate obsession with ginger because it seems like I can get enough of it. The almond crusted French toast is also a great breakfast choice.

3.0,7/17/2013,"By rule, I tend to avoid any of the restaurants in New York city that are within a block or two of Times Square, solely because of the fact that most of these restaurants cater solely to the tourists, and with the plethora of fine restaurants in New York, I never want to feel like I'm wasting my time at one.Blue Fin can't get any closer to Times Square. It's located on the first two floors of the W Hotel right smack dab in the heart of Times Square. I went as part of a business dinner with colleagues who wanted to try it, so I didn't complain.First Impression:This place is very classy and I liked the modern decor. Traditional Maitre D' setup downstairs, with a secondary station upstairs. We were seated upstairs.TableFive us us were dining, but they put us in circular booth with a chair on the one side of the table. Not the most comfortable setup for men, but it was doable.ServiceOne word...excellent. Our waiter was on us when we needed him, without being the overbearing waiter type. He got us our drinks, put in our app orders, and waiting an appropriate amount of time to take our entree orders. Also, he asked if we were seeing a Broadway show, so he could gauge the timing of our dinner. Nice touch, even though we weren't seeing a show.FoodWe order the seafood tower as an app. This thing was huge. Shellfish, mussels, clams, shrimp, crab, lobster, oysters.....delicious. The majority of us ordered fish as our entree. I was expecting this massive cut of fish, but was actually pleasantly surprised with the smaller portion. I think us Americans have been spoiled and conditioned to getting massive portions at the so called ""family restaurants."" I like when I get just enough food to eat. My fish, the Halibut, was cooked to perfection and tasted great.Overall, I was happy to eat here. I certainly wouldn't scoff at coming back, but with SO MANY choices in New York to go eat, I'm not sure I'll rush back, but not because this place was bad. On the contrary.

The bottom layer contained 9 oysters - a good variation of west and east coast.The middle layer contained a small cup of ceviche, a small cup of calamari, and ~6 clams with tomato and onion garnish.

Have not been for a few years and went last night and was very disappointed. First, one good thing; the server was excellent and got our food out quickly as we'd asked. She could not have been nicer. But the menu was so unfocused, it was disconcerting. I just don't expect a place called Blue Fin to have pasta with short ribs on the menu. My son had this and said it was quite good, but it just seems to out of place in a supposedly seafood restaurant. Just looking at it kind of ruined my appetite for the sushi and dumplings I ordered. The shrimp dumplings were okay, nothing especially good or bad about them. I had a California Roll and an eel roll with barbecue sauce and again, they were just okay.

3.0,3/7/2013,"I dined at this restaurant three times now; I've had a pre-Broadway dinner on a Saturday night, early lunch on a Saturday day, and brunch on a Sunday. All three times had one consistent theme: slow & poor service. I believe when you ask for something, your waiter should bring it. You shouldn't have to ask more than once or attack someone else's waiter for the request who then doesn't help you either. I also don't think the menu options were that great. There wasn't too much here that impressed me. Well...that's a lie. The basket of bread for dinner and breakfast was great. The decor is very cool at Blue Fin, it has a nice atmosphere. However, it's in the middle of Times Square, you have to remember if you're driving that parking is ridiculous over here. Additionally, everyone and their mother goes to Broadway on Friday and Saturday therefore I HIGHLY recommend never parking over in that area even if you're at a garage. You could spend an hour on line just waiting for your car. Miserable.Overall, I would dine here again if I had to. Key words: had to. I wouldn't say, ""Oh hey!

3.0,2/3/2013,"I gave this a rating of 3 because I stopped in twice while in NYC:  the first time was great, the second time... not so much. Blue Fin is located in the heart of NYC (Times Square) and is part of the W Hotel.  It's a beautiful restaurant with a contemporary, sleek decor. For both visits, I booked tables via Open Table and had no issues (we went during the week, late evening, though). The first time that I went, the service was great, however the second time, the waitress that was assigned to our table frequently went AWOL and thus, the service was incredibly slow. First time: I started with the warm baked goat cheese & beet salad (ruby red beets, baby arugula, macadamia nuts, balsamic vinaigrette) and it was delicious - the combination of flavours worked amazing well together. The portion was just right to do a bit of sharing (but not too much :-) )I then ordered the pan-seared halibut (with herb gnocchi, portobellos, arugula, jumbo lump crab). THe halibut was great - it was thick but nice and flaky, and perfectly seared. The pièce de résistance for me though, was the gnocchi. Oh. My. God. They were amazing! Soft little dumplings of melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness. Though the portion was just right, I could've force-fed myself a few more just for the heck of it. I ended with a pistachio crême brulée. It was good - very light. But nothing to write home about. On my second visit I ordered sushi as an appetizer (spicy tuna). I enjoyed it, though I've had better. That said, it was very spicy, which made me happy!  I then ordered the soft shell crab tacos, which were a total disappointment. I'm very particular with what I eat, so when I ordered this dish, I expected tacos with fresh crab meat. Wrong. What I got were three tacos stuffed with VERY deep-fried crab meat (and very little of it) with a dressing/ salsa that was so spicy I thought my tongue was going to disintegrate into ashes. Anyway, the menu didn't indicate that the tacos contained deep-fried crab meat because if it had, I would've ordered something else. I didn't enjoy the tacos so only ate one - and wasted the last two. So.... I would say give Blue Fin a try but don't order the tacos.!",1,0,0,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",224,632,609

I guess she realized she was not giving us the service we deserved she made up for it by bringing back complementary Champaign and desert allowing me to move it up a star.

Couple of tips - brunch on Sat - Sunday is from 11:30-4 and is a better deal as the menu is the same, yet you get a free coffee/tea, scrumptious bread and a free bloody mary or mimosa. If you don't drink, then you can get an Orange Juice. Coffee is normally $4 and juice is normally $6 so you save $10 plus you get the bread basket. Also, you can order a side of Lox for $5 (this is the best deal going, but it's not on the menu).I didn't try their smoothies, but they also had those as well.

3.0,10/8/2012,"Blue Fin is the ultimate tourist trap.  It's right smack in the middle of the heart of Times Square and has a very ostentatious / swanky look to it, which I would suspect is appealing to out-of-towners looking for that NYC trendy-vibe dinner.  If I was from Middle America and wanted to have a Sex and the City kind of dinner and didn't know any better, I'd come here.  I think I would like Blue Fin more if it WASN'T in Times Square, because venturing to that part of the city just gives me straight up anxiety attacks.  Decor is upscale and trendy with perfect mood lighting, which happens to be off-set by the seizure inducing lights flashing in from the outside (I clearly hate TS with a passion). Now, don't get me wrong - I am not bashing Blue Fin at all, just calling it like it is.  The food is actually quite good and the service is on point.  Sushi rolls are creative and tasty.  Their sashimi is alright, but I've had fresher.  Big fan of the Maine Lobster & Lettuce wrap.  Desserts are indulgent - have had the house-made sorbets and a very decadent chocolate tart served with ice cream and strawberries.",1,0,0,Julie G.,"London, United Kingdom",677,999,19

There was also an upstairs area which appeared to be a dark and quieter lounge. The main dining area had lots of different seating was extremely noisy. Not somewhere I'd go if I wanted to hold an actual conversation. Also, my waitress was kind of awkward.That being said. I loved the food. 5-star food. The rolls came out warm and the butter was very salty. The lobster wraps were very refreshing, though surprisingly filling. I enjoyed the mixture of avocado, lima beans, sweet corn, and fruit juice. As an entree, I got the salmon (prepared medium). It was very soft and juicy, cooked to perfection. The skin was crispy as well. It also came with delicious vegetables. I could've done without the white sauce though. My friend's halibut was tender and juicy as well, though not as flavorful as my salmon.

1.0,9/18/2012,"Trust me when I say, don't bother wasting your time or money by going here because this place is nothing but a joke!!! Despite the fancy decor and the shimmering lights of Time Square, this restaurant failed to deliver for the lack of focus on one thing and one thing only --FOOD!I came here a few of months ago and was completely turned off. Their staff was pretentious and the service was slow and lacked attentiveness. We went during restaurant week and perhaps that was the reason why we felt slide with their service, but either case that should have not been an excuse!For appetizer, I ordered the blacken shrimp with puree avocado and cherry tomatoes.The dish was weak as the shrimp were on the small end (about 30 count /lbs.) It was over seasoned and it felt like it was a dish that can easily be mimic at home.  Unfortunately my appetizer was just a prelude to my poorly executed entree. I ordered their prosciutto wrapped cod and not only was it overly done, my prosciutto was rubbery and tasted a bit burnt.  With so much disappointment, I decided to just stick with their sorbet for dessert which I felt was a safe dish since it's pre-made. The sorbet was good, but I can't can't say it was stella since it's pretty much a mistake free dish.All in all, Blue Fin should really reconsider renaming their restaurant as they fail miserable when it comes to preparing seafood!

4.0,9/10/2012,"Being a French tourist visiting NYC and also having worked there for a few weeks, I've been many times to Blue Fin.At first I was very judgmental, like always when It comes to those trendy restaurants having sushis/makis on their menu : ""Well, the location is sooo touristy, this place must be a trap but Hey I'm craving for some eel sushis..."". Could not resist.That's how I started going there and discovered a nice restaurant that can come accross as very snobby but with actually very good products at the sushi bar.It took me some time to actually try the diner menu and I was really pleasantly surprised by it.I would advice to stick to fish meals, that's really the main asset of this place in my opinion. And you can definitely come back there, their menu changes pretty often. That's what I kept doing.I really like the design of the restaurant too, even though I prefer the first floor which is friendlier and less ""Hype"" than the one linked to the W-Hotel. Oh and please, yes please, don't go to the ""bar"" part with the tiny tables with view on Times Square. This is for attention-wh**** who want to be seen there and just looove to have strangers looking directly in their plates every 2 seconds...And of course at Blue Fin you get to see everything: from the loud tourists, the young trendy people trying to impress their date, to the party girls in high heels getting warmed up before a Saturday night in Manhattan.I love eating there before going out, taking a cab directly after.

Three of us ate seafood which was good but not exceptional. One ordered a steak which should have been decent. It could not have been worse. The steak was all grizzle and had to be sawed to cut. When we told our server she shrugge her shoulders. We had to ask for the manager. He came over and was very abrupt with us. My friend was trying to at least eat the side dish but he rudely took the plate from her as she was eating the side and told her he'd talk to the chef. When he didn't return, we asked our server what the chef said about the steak. She called the manager over. He said the chef said the steak was good. In addition, we ordered a second round of wine spritzers which were more spritzer than wine and for the same price of a glass of wine. Return? You've got to be kidding!

As you dine, a pianist plays on the grand piano at the top of the stairs, filling the tall ceilings.While here we had the seafood tower, which was good, although having just come back from eating the freshest of fresh seafood on vacation in Cape Cod, didn't quite compare to what my taste buds had grown accustomed to. The tower included salmon and calamari ceviches, jumbo shrimp cocktail, lobster, mussels, oysters and clams.

3.0,7/31/2012,"Two of my favorite times of the year came together last week - Restaurant week and my birthday!For my 22nd birthday, I decided to go to Blue Fin at the W Hotel with 6 of my girlfriends. I dined at Blue Water grill for RW Winter and had a mediocre time but decided to give the chain another try because I love great seafood.One of my gfs and I arrived 30 min early to check out the place and the bar. Blue Fin is directly at the heart of times square and, like many other yelpers have mentioned, perfect for people watching as the bar is right at ground level with ceiling to floor glass windows. It was quite amusing to spot a couple of smurfs walking and completely stop chatting to my friend midsentence. Only in New York!We were sat quite quickly and the hosts were happy to sit us before our entire party arrived. The restaurant itself is huge with two floors and very spatious seating arrangements. We were sat upstairs in a very large and comfortable booth. The décor of the restaurant is really great, very elegant and trendy and not ""too classy"" to the point of being snobby. There was also a live jazz duo playing on the staircase which was pretty cool.They only gave us 3 restaurant week menus to share amongst the 7 of us, possibly to entice us to order from their a la carte menu more? Our waiter wasn't extremely attentive and service was slow-ish ... but I've been treated differently at many restaurants for restaurant week and so I wasn't phased by it.To start off, I chose the salmon makin as did most of my table. It was good, I don't know why I keep opting to try the sushi at these places because it's never mindblowing. I've had much better sushi for 5 bucks a roll at some small japanese restaurant.For my entree, I opted for the chilled salmon. It was a huge chunk of salmon which I was really pleased with. There was a sort of asparagus puree and it was over some really delicious potatoes and other assorted vegetables. The salmon was cooked very well but I could've perhaps done with a bit more flavor. The best entree of the table was surprisingly the Cod over hummus which was the least ordered entree as well. The cod was seasoned and cooked very well. The steak and salmon I would say were both above average.Dessert was fine. Nothing spectacular or mind blowing but was quite tasty. I got the peach tart and the waiter stuck a candle in it and called it a celebration.I would say definitely come for the decor, ambiance, and ""classy but not stuffy"" feel and maybe the cool bar to people watch the plethora of weirdos that is nyc, but I don't know if I would come back just for the food.",0,0,0,Nancy S.,"Manhattan, NY",224,153,2

For entrees, it was prosciutto wrapped scrod and skirt steak. The scrod with the pesto and eggplant caponata paired very well but didn't like the hummus. The caponata was my favorite, a nice balance of sweet and sour.  The steak was tasty with the vinaigrette but it could've paired with potato instead of arugula and radishes. My dinner companion had to order a side of rice (being Asian and all) to fulfill his appetite. Dessert was a nice finish of a trio of sorbets (guava, mango, and coconut) and the warm chocolate tart with ice cream. Service was excellent--just like clockwork. I had a 7:45 reservation and was seated right away. I love the decor and there was nice jazz music playing. The atmosphere is very lively and it's conveniently located in the heart of times square.

I love fish, so i would for sure recommend this establishment to anyone who eats sushi, or a tuna steak on the regular.

The trip to the elevators is like walking underwater in Seaworld (thanks, lights show!) and the 7th floor lobby is amazing! We enjoyed the giant tic-tack-toe game, but always ended up in a draw.For brunch, the lobster benedict and lobster bisque were big hits. I enjoyed the oysters as well. Bloody Mary is made from a premade mix, and maybe the most black pepper-filled mix I've ever seen. Low on garnishes too. But there's also mimosas, bellinis, etc included with the meal, so, can't complain!Service was not top notch for Manhattan - slow, forgetful, no ice in the water.

All of those things would normally turn me off completely, but Blue Fin is good enough to overcome its handicaps. Sit upstairs, first of all, and if you can, get a reservation for 8:15 or so on a Friday or Saturday. The theater crowd will leave and you'll be left with a really great restaurant all to yourself. It is pricey, however it's very very good. As far as recommendations, the halibut is especially good, as are the raw oysters. I had one (or three) pretty mean dirty martinis, too.

It finally came at the end of my meal and the mushrooms were spongy and oily, definitely not well done, the green beans were still hard and undercooked. I told the waitress about one of them.

The server took quite a while to fill our water glasses and take our order. Once we did get a chance to order, the drinks arrived after our food. But what Blue Fin lacks in service, they definitely make up for in food. The tuna tartare was tasty, however this was my least favorite of our meal. It was slightly on the bland side. The three rolls we got were amazing, though. The lobster roll was tasty and went perfectly with the soy mirin glaze. The combination of the tuna and the lobster went nicely and both stood up to the flavors of the roll. The smoked salmon roll had a nice twist to it with the refreshing slices of mango and the spiciness of the shrimp. BBQ eel was also a great roll and very flavorful throughout.

It wasn't the type of Chicken salad you typically imagine with lots of mayo. It was just little snippets of chicken breast mixed in with cold soba noodles. Although the portion is pretty huge, it didn't have any flavor to it and didn't look quite appetizing either. I actually enjoyed my appetizer more which was the yellowtail roll. The roll filled me up pretty quickly in the beginning, which I suppose is a good thing because I barely touched the chicken salad. I ordered the ice cream sorbet again for dessert because you can never go wrong with it. Overall, this place is meeting below my expectations.

The shrimp in the po' boy was not too heavily breaded and the shrimp was tender. I especially LOVED the sweet potato fries that came with my sandwich.

1.0,1/16/2012,"If you like being treated rudely..... then try the Blue Fin.On the recommendation of the concierge at our hotel we went to the Blue Fin for an early lunch.  The place was almost empty when we walked in but the hostess directed us upstairs.  We didn't question this - we should have.  My wife had just had knee surgery a few months ago and the walk up the stairs was difficult but we still complied only to find that the upstairs dining area was more empty than downstairs.  It was also sterile and dark.  We told the host upstairs that we would rather eat downstairs and he shot us a look that obviously told us that he thought that we were just bothersome tourists.  Our best guess was that they were trying to direct us upstairs in hopes of a bigger tab.  Who knows. We took the elevator back down.  Back to the original hostess.  We told her that we would rather eat downstairs.  She, too, seems annoyed.  We asked if we could sit by the front windows (we wanted to watch the activity on Times Square) and she said ""whatever"" (seriously), so we took a high table by the front window.  There was only one other table taken in our area; about six empty tables.  And there we sat, and sat, and sat.  There were waitresses at the bar but no one came over to us and greeted us.  No one brought us menus.  Nothing.  There was one particular waitress standing talking to the bartender who I made direct eye contact with,  she just looked away.  Actually, she just looked right through me as if I didn't exist.After about ten minutes the nasty waitress at the bar finally came over to our table and, without a single word, just dropped two menus on the table and turned to walk away.  No greeting, nothing.  My wife does something when this happens that I find very amusing.  She says 'Thank You' in a very loud voice.  This is exactly what she did which clearly startled the waitress but, instead of invoking a response like ""oh, Thank You"", all we got from her was, as she was walking away, she shot over her shoulder ""you're welcome"".  Seriously??  Nasty and rude?  We were speechless.So, there we were.  A trip upstairs, a trip downstairs, ignored, then treated rudely, and fifteen minutes later we didn't have a drink or even silverwareand a napkinAfter our little sweetheart walked off I looked at my wife, she looked at me, we closed our menus without a word between us and walked out.We walked into the Roxy right next door and was treated wonderfully by friendly and fun staff and the food is really good, albeit expensive (but what isn't in Times Square).I guess that the recession must have had no affect whatsoever on the Blue Fin because they can clearly afford to run off patrons.  It must be nice.This place it is an overpriced tourists trap by day and a hipster club at night.  Avoid it.  There are hundreds of places in the City where you will be treated better, for better food, for less money.  Honestly, try the Roxy instead.  You won't be disappointed.By the way; we read our concierge the riot act when we got back to our hotel.  He was obviously getting free drinks, or dinners, for sending guests to the Blue Fin.  We cautioned him that that might not be a great idea in the future.(PS:  Just in case that nasty waitress reads this............we tip 20%, Hun --- oh well, your loss)",1,0,0,Kevin R.,"Waterford, CT",1,14,0

If you can snag a table by the window do so!  Nothing like socializing, drinking and people watching!  Best seat in the house.  Came here about 4 times during a span of a week but the best part of it all is up next.  TIP!:  Blue Fin - signature drink is no joke.  Dashing turquoise sitting classy in a martini glass and opt the tasteless olives - this one comes with your very own Swedish fish.  This drink literally makes you feel as good as it looks.  In an instance you're revamped in the tropical paradise of Tahiti exhilarated and freshly dipped in.  This drink is completely rejuvenating!  I couldn't get enough of them.. Had to drag my girlfriend back just so she could try it and she had the same reaction! Gentlemen, your lady will LOVE it!As far as the main restaurant, we wined and dined on the upper level.  The atmosphere was sexy and attractive.  Mellow conversations over candle lit tables.  Enhanced for the corporate world and couples head over heels.  The food was absolutely 2 thumbs up stars across the board.  My dish was astounding!!!  I ordered the lobster which was so succulent and divine.  Never in my life have tasted a lobster so perfectly presented and rich.  It comes to you with the works - so flavorful but it looks exactly like a baby lobster minus the shell.  It was almost cute looking but even more so beyond satisfying!!! I definitely recommend trying this if you're willing to drop an exaggerated couple more bucks.  We ordered the sushi as well - bleh - nothing I haven't tasted before.  If anything it was more of a turn off - 2 pieces for how much you say?  Not very worthy.  They serve these small little chocolate cookies in a signature black box for dessert - very fancy schmancy - felt bad to throw it out and it came back home with me all the way to Cali.

This $17 treat included fries and onion rings (I skipped those) and the little bottles of mayonnaise and ketchup which I used up on this one meal.

The server made up prices to build a bill and slap on over a 18 percent tip. Here is an example everyone got drinks at over $12 a pop they weren't cheap. My friend asked for extra olives. At the end of the bill over $329.00 they added it as a side order of mushrooms so that they could charge it to the bill. No charge items aren't programed! It became a side dish.  If that wasn't  enough he added an extra $33.00 entree by mistake?  The manager who's name was Clinton was nice and said he was sorry. He offered me nothing and said I'm sorry many times finally, I suggested he take the automatic 18 percent tip off. We left 15 percent but BEWARE, who wants to have to go to the manager, who has no suggestions..... It was my birthday. We have eaten at Blue Fin before because it a a pretty restaurant near the best broadway theaters. The service was slow even at the bar when I asked the bartender to tell be what wines were available she said red and white. The staff is the worst.

2.0,7/13/2011,"I can't imagine why a restaurant that serves a $31 red snapper on their lunch menu would allow for such slow service.  Naturally, being in the industry, I care not to blame the waiter, although it is entirely possible he had a great deal to do with it.  I leave most of the fault with the chef and his kitchen staff, for a waiter can only bring the food once it is cooked.  I also blame the chef for the less than mediocre meal I feigned enjoyment for.I am all for chef's experimenting with different flavors because I always want to try new combinations, which is why I ordered the tomato salad as a started.  This app consists of red, green and yellow tomatoes, pineapple, watermelon, Manchego cheese and a touch of greens, all laid out atop of dribbled basil...intriguing, eh?  Not once I tasted it.  The ingredients, when sampled on their own are quite delicious, but watermelon in combination with pesto and Manchego cheese creates a flavor so absurd that it reminded me of the way my mouth tastes in the morning after a night of heavy drinking...sorry if that seems harsh, but imagine how I felt being forced to relive that somewhat daily experience.When my snapper finally arrived (finally being the operative word) I was rather disappointing with the look of it alone.  I am no advocate of ""food must look good in order to taste good,"" so I judged not and dove in.  I am familiar with having fish with a crispy skin still attached, in fact I quite like the texture, except this particular fish was so heavily salted that I couldn't help but think it was done so to cover up for the lack of any other flavor.  I quite enjoyed the gnocchi which accompanied the snapper, but was overall dissatisfied in spending so much cash for so little turnout.  My friends and family can vouch for me when I say that I am the first person to spend $200 on a meal for myself if the food is of $200 quality.  This place is a puffed up Broadway tourist trap.I'll give the restaurant points for ambiance - trendy and romantic - and I'm sure I would enjoy buying overpriced martinis on a night out, but ambiance doesn't fill my empty tummy.",2,0,1,Alex P.,"Manhattan, NY",33,7,7

4.0,4/26/2011,"A good late-night meal with friends: I love Blue Fin, which is located right in my home-away-from-home, the W Times Square. Most recently, I had a late-night meal (11 PM) with two friends post-flight from CA, and indulged in their sushi for the first time. YUM. The California and crab rolls were excellent, as was the ebi - perfectly chilled and tender. As the sushi was really an appetizer, I have to tell you the filet mignon with blue cheese and fried onions was also quite good. Feeling a little indulgent, we also tried a trio of desserts (which ended up being four as the server brought out a complimentary chef's amuse of biscotti, chocolate and other sweets.) The gelato is good, as are the sorbets, and the chocolate torte was good but very, very rich - we only took a few small (yet satisfying) bites.Blue Fin also supplies some of the room service available inside the W, so I've tried a number of dishes from here - the steamed shrimp dumplings in bamboo are also quite good. In terms of seating, it really depends what you prefer. I've sat both upstairs (above the street) and downstairs (right on Times Square.) I prefer upstairs - huge curved booths with candles and dark wood everywhere, a pretty hip bar and a piano. If you can sit upstairs and prefer more elegant ambiance, I'd suggest it. If you're looking for a view of Times Square and all the hustle and bustle, downstairs is for you.Our meal for three with drinks, appetizers, dessert and tip was about $300 - not terrible for a meal this great in NY. I've been a number of times for both dinner and breakfast - breakfast is significantly more reasonable in terms of cost, and their fruit plates, bagels and oatmeal are all fresh and fabulous.

I actually really like the decor of the place. I would go back to the bar and grab a drink and hope the bartendar is friendly! hahaThis place pretty much received a 2 star in my books only because I'm very big on SERVICE!GO TO THE BLUE WATER GRILL, better service and food is just as GREAT!

And when you have business lunch you expect some what of decent value single serving platter or dish, which will take you through the rest of the day.Not at Blue Fin apparently. I am not going to order 3 rolls and 5 or 6 sushi spend $80 or so for a casual lunch. No thank you. Take Haru. They have a $25 (or so) mixed sushi and rolls, throw in a miso and you are set.I order 1 roll ($16) and 3 sushis (3*$5). The roll are literally very small, and only six. Small sushi. This place falls to the hands of tourist that are just excited to be in Times Square and eating in a 'cool' place.Was it good? Meh ok, did not rock my world, in the same way that Haru does not rock my world.  However, given the proximity, I go to Haru at least once per week, and am unlikely to choose Blue Fin.

Haha.  But all three of these dishes were EXTREMELY tasteful and delicious!!  I was iffy about the Tuna Tartare because I've ordered it from other places but I didn't feel like it had taste, but this one definitely did.  All the starters raised the bar for the entrees.For the entrees, we had Florida Red Snapper and the Local Striped Bass.  The Red Snapper was cooked well, but the Striped Bass was much better!  But the lobster risotto that the Striped Bass came with was nothing special.  It wasn't very good, actually.  But the sides that the Red Snapper came with (lemon herb gnocchi and portobello mushrooms and jumbo lump crab) was delicious.  The gnocchi was very filling but it was definitely good eating it together with everything else.I'm usually not much of a fish-eating person but I came here after reading such great reviews about the restaurant and it did not disappoint at all.  I definitely want to dine here again, but after I get the money for it.  The bill came out to be about $124, which is on the pricey side but it's doable for an occasion.By the way, one of the busboys spilled water on me and that almost ruined the night because my pants were wet and I had to sit on dry napkins for the remainder of the night.  But I knew it was an accident and I didn't feel it was worth it to ruin the night.  So besides this and my initial ""greeting,"" this was a great dining experience that I'd recommend to family and friends.",1,0,0,Elaine W.,"Jersey City, NJ",133,98,874

3.0,1/26/2011,"My mother and I had a pre-theater dinner here on the advice of our hotel's concierge. The restaurant is in the 47th Street W Hotel but is neither affiliated with nor owned by the W. Blue Fin is yet another pea in the BR Guest Restaurants pod of upscale dining establishments throughout Manhattan.When I entered the restaurant through the hotel, I got that sinking feeling that makes me think a place is rather too big for its britches. I am always wary of a place with too many short-skirted women and darkly-suited men sipping creative cocktails at the bar. It's as if I've walked into a Mad Men episode fast-forwarded to the 21st century. Do you come for the food or to see and be seen?We were seated in the upstairs dining room which is quite large and open and features its own bar. You will have to climb quite a few steps to reach it, though, and I could never be entirely sure if there actually was an elevator for those with disabilities. The din of this dining room can be quite distracting as tables fill and by 7pm, you may be straining to hear the others at your table.I had assumed that a 5:15p reservation would have us finished in enough time to walk the 3 blocks to the theater, but we didn't dot the ""i's"" and cross the ""t's"" on the check until a bit after 7p despite not having ordered appetizers. I felt the service could have been a bit more polished for the look and price of the restaurant. I felt as if there were long stretches where we did not see our waiter. The seared big-eye tuna entree was really quite delicious considering my expectations. The fish was cooked to my request for medium-rare and 4 medallions were laid atop jasmine rice, carrots, snow peas, mushrooms, and water chestnuts ringed with a tangy soy-ginger sauce. The portion was satisfying and well worth the $31. I also recommend their sweet Riesling by the glass. My dessert, a modern take on the s'more (firm chocolate mousse topped with graham cracker and gooey marshmallow with a side of cinnamon ice cream and graham cracker crumbs) was delicious. I would certainly consider Blue Fin if you are looking to dine in the Times Square area as it is convenient to a multitude of theaters and the food is good, but don't set your expectations too high. Unfortunately, I find the BR Guest group of restaurants to be similar to the Stephen Starr empire in Philadelphia - once you get past the flashy decor, there is nothing truly remarkable about the service or the food.",1,0,1,Susanne J.,"Philadelphia, PA",130,286,15

I started with soup and my mom started with a salad and we decided to split two sushi rolls. Our server (whose name I wish I knew, but he never told us) seemed a little put out that we weren't ordering alcohol and were splitting things and tried to convince us to order more sushi, explaining that each roll was only 6 pieces. Thanks for telling us buddy, but we do in fact know what and how much we're ordering. It's plenty. I ran out of water twice and had to flag someone down to refill it. I really hate that.Our soup and salad arrived and were presented beautifully. The lobster bisque was silky, with chunks of seafood and a big puff pastry crouton that presented some textural differences. YUM. My mom polished off her salad so I'm assuming she liked it since she usually eats like a bird.Then we waited. Initially this was good because we were pretty full already. Waited, waited, waited some more! About 30 minutes went by with no sushi or server in sight, but we were enjoying the night and weren't really bothered. Then the unbelievable happened. Our waiter FINALLY stopped by to ask if we wanted dessert or if we were ready for our check. WHAT. My jaw dropped, and my mom turned to him and asked if we could have our dinner before dessert. He started making excuses, swooped out to get our sushi, swooped back in to deliver it, then left us with a plate of sushi but no plates, utensils, soy sauce, and another empty water glass. THANKS. When we were finally able to grab him again he was full of attitude about getting the things we needed, explaining that he had five tables and was really busy.

4.0,5/29/2010,"Times Square, you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and....tourists! Ahh the mighty tourist, with his fanny pack full of NYC pamphlets, wide eyed, bushy tailed, looking for excitement at the crossroad of the world. If you're a true NYer you know that most establishments in the Times Square area are there specifically to draw in the unassuming traveler looking for the essential NY dining experience. At least that was my previous view of the area. On a decent afternoon during ""Fleet Week"", a few co-workers and I headed to the W to try the delicious stylings at Blue Fin. The decor at Blue Fin is superb, almost futuristic, very chic and there to attract and flirt with your senses. But enough of that.. let's get to the nitty gritty.. the food! On the table came oysters, black bass with lobster risotto (special of the day), and sushi. The oysters were fresh, delicately prepared and served on a very fancy tray. They were excellent, twas the first time I had oysters after a terrible oyster incident overseas. It brought me back to my first oyster experience in Sheepshead Bay as a kid. Excellent! The sea bass was hands-down the highlight. Excellently prepared and served on top of warm risotto. I thought the risotto was a little undercooked, but it had lobster in it.. i mean c'mon.. that's like cheating.. putting lobster or bacon on anything automatically makes it stand out. My only issue with the bass was that it was garnished with seasoned tomatoes that didn't really add to the dish, it was unnecessary to say the least. The sashimi was also very fresh and served in a chic fashion.Overall, Blue Fin's execution of various seafaring dishes was excellent. I wouldn't say they are the best purveyors of sushi, but it wasn't bad either.

In the lobby of the W Times Square it couldn't be more convenient for Broadway shows or a reprieve from the masses of Times Square. And true to his restaurant empire the decor, menu and service are all solid. Where Blue Fin diverges from his other eating establishments is price. Blue Fin is in tourist central and priced as such. I expected but was still insulted when I grabbed the drink menu and found wine $12/glass and up and cocktails $14 and up. But that paled in comparison to the food prices. Apps were around $15 and entrees hovered around $30. The cheapest wine offering I could find was $35. So in the end the cheapest wine, a Caesar split between us and 2 entrees no desert was $120.

We could not stop passing around the little cone they came in.Service was very friendly and attentive, and we even got a free espresso (that might have been a mistake... we got two instead of one, but it didn't appear on the bill!).  Despite the location (I avoid Times Square at all costs when I visit NY), I would go back... mainly for the crack-fries.",0,0,0,Lauren D.,"Austin, TX",5,25,2

This was one of the few nice restaurants in Times Square that would accommodate a large group without requiring we order from a pre-fixe menu, which I appreciated. My personal experience was great - they accommodated our large group in a nice section of the restaurant, the service was good, my food was great and the restaurant itself is beautiful. Why 3 stars you ask? Because about 1/2 of our entire group had to send their meals back because they were undercooked. This caused significant time delays and since we were going to see a show after, it caused some unanticipated anxiety in the crunch for time. They kindly took the items off or recooked some of the items and then provided a complimentary dessert for everyone at the table, which was nice. However, we would have just preferred for it to be done right the first time. Also, the live jazz that is supposed to start at 7 was just setting up when we were leaving at 7:55pm.

5.0,2/23/2010,"I can't believe I'm about to say this...but here it goes: Blue Fin, a restaurant in Times Square, is amazing. I know, I know, I know...restaurants in Times Square aren't supposed to be good. But there are a few shining stars among the muck/tourist traps. The design of the restaurant is beautiful--peaceful and calming colors that are a welcome change from everything outside. The staff is very kind, helpful and efficient. They may be the best staff in the area. They offer live music on a nightly basis...with no cover charge. If you hit the time right, it can actually not be too crowded. The Lobster Bisque is delicious. It comes with chopped up shrimp and a puff pastry in the middle. It's creamy, rich and completely full of flavor. The Parmesan Crusted Filet Mignon with creamed spinach and red wine sauce is absolutely to die for. Their steak had so much flavor and character...it may be the best steak that I've had in New York (though my search is far from over).For dessert I had the trio of sorbets (fig-port, coconut, green apple)...the perfect ending to a perfect meal. They are light, full of flavor and not over filling (by this point I could barely take any more food).This place is great. I'd go for a romantic dinner for two or even with a small group of friends...either way I want to share this place with people.",3,1,1,Tony L.,"Manhattan, NY",626,641,599

3.0,2/15/2010,"Came here with a group based upon a recommendation from one of the girls that have been here before. The ambience...very trendy, chic. It is right in the heart of Times Square, which makes it a prime tourist trap. We had one of each roll they had on the menu. I wasn't in a sushi mood, but the presentation was exceptional, but the taste was forgettable. We ordered the crab cakes as a starter and that was delicious. I had the tuna as an entree...and I have to say I was quite disappointed. The tuna was bland and the risotto was undercooked. The accompanying vegetables were good, especially the shiitake mushrooms. The staff is excellent. We were travelling for work and needed 7 separate checks. Our waiter was more than accommodating and extremely pleasant. The chocolate souffle was delicious, especially the gooey chocolate on the inside. The souffle paired up with the vanilla ice cream made a chewy chocolatey treat. For the quality of food, I thought it was pricey. I've had better food for less. I think you're paying more for the location.

SO tasty.Also, though we did not order entrees, they looked delicious and there are also seafood towers, which have assorted oysters, and lobster, and other oceanic delights.  AND, I cannot recommend the tuna tartare highly enough.  My friend and I ordered one as an appetizer, ate 4 sushi rolls and a salad, and then seriously contemplated ordering another one.  Well worth the $15.The bar here is nice too, but it's small, and was packed every time I walked by.  My friend and I came to the restaurant at 8 on a Friday night, though, and we had no problem getting a table, which was excellent.  Overall I was highly pleased with my experience, truly a classy oasis in the middle of the garishness of Times Square.  Also, the decor (and the bite sized rolls) make it a great date spot.  Next time in New York I will definitely be back, even if I have to take the Subway to get there!",2,0,2,Jackie D.,"Berkeley, CA",23,38,0

Under no impression that the Sushi here would be as good as Miriam W reported about Seo, I came for the ambiance that this Times Square overlooking elegant and well designed space offered of which there was zero at Seo closing time or not.I was sad that the live entertainment, which performs on the stairs curiously but not as bad as you might imagine, ended at ten. Our waittress was ebullient ready to take our order at least 4 times before we were ready. The wine list was impressive. Were I not bearing the scars of an alcohol soaked  night out the night prior I would have had to try some of the California reds. Stag's Leap, Opus One, yum!Instead we went with champagne though I found the Tattinger a bit dry for my dehydrated body. While I was pleased to see a Vegetarian roll on the menu, VEGETARIANS TAKE NOTE, there are no vegetarian selections on the entree menu and fish in the soup. I made due with a goat cheese salad which featured three medallions of chevre aside a large bed of arugula that hides beet slices soaked in balsamic vinegarette. You have to toss it around to reapportion the taste of the dressing, no simple task when the cheese or beets are cut so big. My vegetarian roll was fine though sloppily presented with soy sauce spilled on the plate. Dont be deterred by my experience though.

I started with a fresh and tasty heirloom tomato salad with kalamatta olives, arugula, and preserved lemons with shaved parmigiana reggiano. We then selected a few rolls from their sushi menu. I love their sushi and it is better than some of the sushi I've had out in Hawaii (no Sansei). We had the spicy tuna and california rolls and they were really good and fresh. For mains I had Soft Shells crabs with yellow wax beans, tangerines and bing cherries and my wife had Halibut. My portion was two big crabs and they were delicious. My wife liked the Halibut too. For dessert we had the lemon verbena meringue with mixed berries and lemon cream. The meringue was a scrumptious end to a great meal.

I went with the left side: seaweed salad, tuna and yellowtail nigiri (except I had ordered sashimi), and a lobster roll.

I ordered the cod as a main dish. It was so-so.

4.0,7/21/2009,"Dined here on Sunday night for a late restaurant week dinner. The restaurant has a lovely modern decor and makes you forget you are in the middle of the Times Square craziness. The RW menu was very enticing. Appetizers included Tuna Sashimi, Heirloom Tomato Salad and a Soup. 4 of us got the Tuna and it melted in your mouth, it was delicious. 1 had the salad which was also very good. On to entrees, I was happy to see that they offered soft shell crab, which I love. It came out looking almost like a with salad piled with wax beans, fresh cherries and nectarines with 2 crabs on it, not what I expected, BUT it was fabulous, the cherries were heavenly with the crab, I would have never thought it, but fruit paired with some fried soft shell crab is awesome! The other entrees that were ordered were the snapper with a kiwi/mango salsa, also very good. Everything was extremely fresh. As for wine..we definitely wanted wine...there were a couple of suggestions on the RW menu, but we wanted something more interesting than Pinot Grigio and Chardonnay. So we started looking at the wine list and yes it was a bit pricey, until we got to the last page...BIN ENDS! The last page included many bin end bottles that were at a reduced cost, so we ended up with a great 2008 Bodega O. Fournier Torrontés Urban Uco for only $25 a bottle. Great deal, great wine which went lovely with the food. I wish more restaurants posted their bin ends like this. On to dessert most of us opted for the Mocha Panna Cotta...all I can say...O-M-G, it was delicious! Someone also ordered the Lemon Meringue, which they said was good, but the Panna Cotta was the bomb! Service: Our waitress was friendly, she didn't know much about the wine and towards the end sort of disappeared. Granted it was late and it was only us and 1 other table seated on the second floor. All in all she was fine. Regular menu may be on the pricey side, but the RW menu is totally worth it and don't forget to try a bin end wine!",0,0,0,Krista M.,"Kew Gardens, NY",353,719,289

4.0,6/9/2009,"Restaurants in Times Square are guaranteed to be expensive, but usually they cater to tourists who can be easily identified by their reluctance to cross the street when the crossing's good, waiting instead for the official walk signal. Blue Fin aims higher, serving up finer fare in a very stylish space. The modern decor deserves as much attention as the food, especially if you go out into the lobby of the W hotel in which Blue Fin is housed. It has overhead plexiglass structures covered in an inch of running water, with soft lights casting oceanic shadows onto the floor.  Really stunning. The upstairs lobby is even cooler, but deserves description in its own W Hotel review. Anyway, I had various and tasty sushi for lunch after my complimentary bellini.

4.0,4/29/2009,"It was a dark, snowy night, well as dark as it ever gets amid the plethora of blinking strobe light advertisements that we lovingly call Times Square. Winds put the temperature well below 20F, which is practically artic for a Texan like myself- Howdy Y'all. And I was hungry.Thus, Blue Fin gets one star right off the bat for being open, and heated.The atmosphere was nice and relaxing, though the predominance of blue seemed to remind me of just how cold I was. I think I snapped at the lady who asked me for my coat. I get mean when I'm cold.We were seated promptly and our server was adorable, very attentive and helpful. I tend to judge servers and bartenders rather harshly since I have been both for years. Gotta love college. That said, the cosmo I ordered (I know, I know, but when in Rome...) was mediocre for its $14 price tag.On to the food. We started with an assortment of oysters, (which were only $1.25ea on happy hour, down from about $3.50- $4.00ea) and a spicy tuna roll. The oysters were great for the price, but I think I would have been disappointed had it not been happy hour. They were, however, presented beautifully. The spicy tuna roll was just ok. I had just experienced the wonder that is Sushi Yasuda though so sadly, no sushi can ever stack up anymore. We then split the seared ahi over jasmine rice and vegetables. It was a tad over soy-sauced, which I tend to associate, perhaps inappropriately, with an attempt to mask the flavor of aging fish. The rice was amazing, I wish I knew what they used to flavor it.Overall, a tad expensive (I think ours came to about $70, $90 with tip) but a great place to relax and people watch, and this is Times Square, you can't expect a $20 meal. Plus we got the added bonus of learning our fellow diners views on politics and Obama as they chattered loudly the next table over. So for $90 I got fed, entertained, and educated!

5.0,4/6/2009,"I like the B.R. Guest restaurants because you know you'll get great food and very good service. The ambiance and decor here is really classy and despite being in Times Square, if you dine on the upstairs level you don't really notice the hell that exists outside. There was live jazz on the Saturday night that we were here and it was a nice addition.We were here for a birthday and had a group of 7... our meal was a marathon as we didn't leave until around midnight despite a 7:45pm reservation. The staff was flexible... it wasn't a problem that we spent the first 30 mins. of our reservation at the bar having drinks, and since we were there for a birthday our waitress was kind enough to bring out a plate of cupcakes that we brought from Crumbs with some candles for dessert. Our waitress was really helpful throughout the evening, from picking out a selection of oysters to start the night to giving drink suggestions, and also assisting with choices for main dishes as well. We particularly liked the oysters from British Columbia, which were some of the largest I've ever had. Other notable food picks were a special gumbo soup that had a great kick to it, the filet mignon, and all the sushi that we had -- especially the lobster roll and yellowtail roll... both spicy and busting with fresh fish. Everything was presented very nicely as well, which really added to the general experience. The food was complimented by great wine, excellent mixed drinks and a damn good caipirinha.Overall it was a very enjoyable experience, and I'd compare the food to Atlantic Grill on the Upper East Side. Unlike Atlantic Grill, however, Blue Fin is not nearly as pretentious and filled with old money... thus, I'd definitely recommend it for groups and birthdays. Classy and casual - yes, but not snobby or too trendy.

3.0,2/9/2009,"I had an exceptional experience at Blue Fin, but the food didn't have all that much to do with it. I met an old friend whom I hadn't seen in twenty-some years, and I had a delightful time. And I was generally pleased with what I ordered. A tuna tartare starter was fresh and snappy. The minced fish came balled atop a wonton chip. Repeated twice, it looked like M.C. Escher's rendition of a snowman. The plate was streaked with sriracha, and two pieces of under-ripe avocado were balance across the way in green, fatty counterpoint to the tuna scoops. My lobster salad was pretty impressive, to tell the truth: the better part of a chick lobster, cooked properly and chilled, arranged around a mold of chopped salad crowned with a tangle of microgreens. Not at all bad. I don't know how my companion fared with his first course, a caesar that could have been good, fair, or vile, depending on a number of factors. When you haven't seen someone in two decades, it can be awkward to stab into his salad bowl with your fork to see if the dressing came in a gallon jug from Sysco. For my taste, the thing had too much cheese: tectonic plates of what was probably Grana Padano or (worse) Argentine Reggianito covered the romaine like a tin roof. But his ""open faced petit filet sandwich"" was a train wreck. It arrived laden with no fewer than three sheets of what appeared to be processed white cheese singles (the edges were still visible apres broiling). Great chunks of mushrooms jabbed up through the cheese. I think there was some steak in there, too. Next to the amalgam on the plate was what appeared to be a sailor's cap filled with fried yam sticks. Okay, here again I'm being to harsh, since I didn't actually eat any of his food, and I don't care for sweet potato fries as a rule. He groaned when it arrived and ate little of it, so I feel confident that it was pretty bad. Maybe the moral here is that, at a place named after a kind of tuna, you shouldn't order the steak sandwich. On the whole, the service was great, and the prices were commensurate with being a hotel restaurant on Times Square. If you happen to be near Blue Fin and need something to eat, you could do a lot worse--but a stones throw, not to mention a cab ride, in any direction is likely to turn up some more intriguing options.",1,2,1,Troy D.,"Oakland, CA",6,34,2

The kind of place where you might take business clients and see families enjoying a lets-get-away kind of meal. That being said I found the two fish dishes, salmon and halibut both to be enjoyable. It also really stuck out to me how both dishes were very nicely balanced between the fish and the greens. There's nothing too fancy or really out there--it's pretty safe seafood and fish. That being said it's a nice place to relax and chat with friends where everyone can get a pretty innocuous underwater option. I can't attest to their other dishes though the bar downstairs did look like it might be a nice place to stop in with a hott date.

We had a dragon roll and a rainbow roll, and a bottle of saki. The service was excellent, I thought, for a place in a touristic area with no reservations needed. We asked the waiter to recommended a very dry saki, and he found one he said wasn't sweet. We received it, and it sure enough was.  It was still great Saki, so between two of us, we finished the bottle. The bathroom was probably the cleanest bathroom in Times Square. We saw groups of people there who we felt certain were not tourists, which was for some reason really pleasing to us. The sushi is prepared in an open kitchen; and idea which makes so much sense to me.

It was all pretty good, the fish could have been more fresh but the sushi chefs had prepared them nicely. The eel was really yummy. I would probably not order the ceviche again.My date had the filet mignon entree...it looked alright. He ordered it medium well and had it medium rare.

Granted, while the street-facing bar was bustling, the inside was relatively empty at 9:00 p.m., so she could have sat us almost anywhere.Our waiter had a fantastic porn-star mustache, we got a huge kick out of that. Service was good, attentive but semi-invisble. They have a weird fusion-y seafood menu. Without time for a full meal, we decided to share two entrees and some maki.I definitely remember the Sauteed Halibut, because it came with gnocchi and we had to teach Steph how to say ""gnocchi."" This was a great dish, perfectly cooked fish, and the delicious gnocchi mixed well with mushrooms and lump crab meat. MMM.The second entree, I'm not so sure. I want to say we ordered one of the specials, maybe Sea Bass something or other? But I really can't remember. Guess that says something about its quality. Wasn't terrible, but wasn't memorable either, whatever it was.As for our maki: the Yellowtail roll was the best, nice kick and fun crispy wonton chip mixed in, we even asked for a second order of it. Definitely get that roll if you go! The spicy crab roll was ok, nothing too special. We may have gotten another roll, but it wasn't anything special either.On the whole, Blue Fin was a pleasantly satisfying and quick meal. A few hits, a few misses, but nothing terrible. Definitely on the expensive side, so be prepared to shell out some moolah if you want to fill up.I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again, but if you're in the area, pop in for a drink at the bar and get the Yellowtail roll, or have them bring the Sauteed Halibut up to your room!",1,0,1,Albert H.,"New York, NY",162,245,15

The food here simply did not match that. The sushi was so-so (not fresh enough; may have sat in the fridge too long) and the salmon was a little dry.The atmosphere, however, is good for chatting. Blue Fin is very hip with its cool decor, mod dim lights, and jazz music. Usually, ""happening"" restaurants like Blue Fin tend to blast music too loud, but it was at the right volume such that I didn't need to shout or worry about people listening in on our conversation (I came here after a Broadway event with a friend).

I have been there about 6-7 times now on a SUNDAY morning and have enjoyed taking guests there for birthdays, out of town visits, etc. First you start with complimentary coffee, tea, AND (not or) a breakfast cocktail on the house. Bellini? Mimosa? Vox Bloody Mary? They got it. They also offer a basket of lovely breads and croissants as well.The menu is ever changing, but in the winter they had pumpkin spiced pancakes that were to die for. They have a fresh berry belgian waffle with not-too-sweet blend of creme. The lobster eggs benedict is also a treat, and the omelettes  I have seen table view look nice too. Rich, nice presentation, and perfect Sunday-in-a-summer-dress atmosphere. Perfect place to take your grandma, best friend or a date.The kicker? Coffee/tea, breads and croissants, fresh squeezed juice and cocktails, gourmet brunch entree shouldn't set you back more than $40 for two people. Make sure you go SUNDAY because that is the only day this applies. Hope you check it out!",2,1,2,Taeko F.,"New York, NY",13,30,8
2.0,6/18/2007,"We went here for lunch during the week and was immediately turned off by the mess of people pushing through the door.  We had a reservation for 12:30, but didn't get seated until 1:15, with no apology.  I understand this is Times Square and restaurants will inevitably be crowded and busy.  Still, the service was inept and the quality of food didn't save the day (I ordered a few rolls, none were particularly original).I'm guessing Blue Fin is popular because it looks big and serious on the inside.  But know that there are plenty of better seafood/sushi places a few blocks outside of Times Square, that are equally impressive in appearance and far less of a hassle.",2,0,1,Lucy Z.,"Jersey City, NJ",43,210,1
2.0,5/4/2007,"I don't normally eat at hotel restaurants; however, I made an exception in this case as we were returning from a late night Broadway show.  At any rate, the restaurant struck me as quite esthetically nice.  High ceilings and very nicely textured walls.  However, the ambiance of the restaurant was ruined by VERY loud bar patrons.  The restaurant is separated from the bar by what amounts to a suggestion of wall made up of a few flimsy wooden planks!!With regard to the food, we had a couple very decent fish dishes.  I recall my halibut being very good.  Blue Fin's wine menu is impressive as well.  Because the restaurant was fairly empty at 11pm on a Thursday night, we got our dinner in about 10 minutes.  This was nice since we're hungry; however, it didn't help with creating a nice all-around dining experience as I felt rushed the whole meal.  As a side note, I could have given three stars if it wasn't for the noise and rushed service.  If you need a quick, over-priced, late night bit to eat, then Blue Fin is great!  Don't go if you're looking for any kind of semi-quiet dining experience.  The bar looked and SOUNDED like a lot of fun though!",1,0,1,Shawn S.,"San Francisco, CA",12,40,0
2.0,4/15/2007,"BAR ONLY--From the outside, Blue Fin is a blue bubble of fun.  Once inside, the bubble bursts.  Too crowded.  I seriously think that they're breaking fire codes with the number of people they cram into the bar.  The tables are wobbly and the drinks are way too expensive for their size and strength (tiny and weak).  To top it all off, when we wanted to leave, the coat check guy had deserted his post.  This conversation ensued: Friend: There's no one here.Me: (reaching over the half-door)  I'll get em.Friend: You can't do that!Me: Why not?  They're OUR coats.One of the two stars here is for giving me the memory of this conversation.",1,1,0,Christina M.

4.0,3/24/2007,A fun place to visit before goin to one of the shows on Broadway.  I highly recommend their caesar salad.  It is not one of those bottled dressings you would expect but think it is made from scratch...or at least it tastes like it.  They also had a really good halibut...cooked to perfection.  Not many people can cook halibut right as it is such a thick fish you don't want to overcook it.  Their lobster salad is not really a good deal as they just give you a small 1 lb. lobster with some frissee salad and two small claws.  If you get a chance....go next door to the W hotel's lobby and check out the water flowing from the walls and the water pool above your head while you are waiting for the elevator.  Very exotic feeling....wish I can put this in my entrance way of my home....,1,0,2,Mee-stique K.,"San Francisco, CA",69,453,0
3.0,2/24/2007,"After a little shopping on 5th avenue, I headed back to the hotel to get a couple of rolls from Blue Fin, a restaurant in our hotel. I got two rolls that cost $25 total. Let me tell you, first I should have checked the prices, next, how can sushi cost $25 for two rolls?? I got a spicy crab roll, which was fresh crab, less spicy than normal mayo, and green peppers, and it was rolled in tempura flakes. It was quite delicious, but not worth whatever I paid for it. I also got a california roll, which was fresh crab (not fake, real), avocado, and mango. They even serve it with a side of mango sauce. It was ok, but I like more traditional california rolls with masago. The blue fin bar is pretty cool, so, if you are in Times Square and need a place to sit down, check out the bar, but beware of the prices on the sushi.",2,0,1,jessi t.,"VA, VA",3,23,0
2.0,7/20/2006,"Here's the problem with Blue Fin...follow the logic: 1. Blue Fin is a seafood restaurant. This is what it is supposed to do best.2. I enjoy seafood. 3. The highlight of my meal, which included a sushi roll for an appetizer and the halibut for the main course, was the goat cheese gnocchi that came on the side. As for the sushi roll, Blue Fin attempted to jazz up what would have been a decent yellow fin roll by, instead of giving me soy sauce, giving me another brown liquid to dip in, which may as well have been motor oil. If not motor oil, perhaps it was chewing tobacco juice. I don't know. It just wasn't good. The halibut, which seems to be their signature item, was dry, relatively flavorless, and not very flaky.  Is the ambiance nice? I suppose it's ok,  though certainly nothing special. I would be happier eating something half decent in a condemned crack house in alphabet city.",3,2,0,Zack S.,"Brooklyn, NY",23,27,0

The server was very slow and inattentive. Blue Fin has extensive wine menu for those wine connoisseurs but the main courses are very average. The dessert was not very impressive either. They took out the molten chocolate cake (which was the best chocolate cake I tried in the east coast last year) out of the menu. The home made ice cream, especially the banana caramel and Tahitian vanilla bean, is still worth trying.",1,0,0,Fred F.,"Los Angeles, CA",168,291,106
