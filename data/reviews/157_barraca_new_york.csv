4.0,10/25/2018,"I came here for brunch while I was visiting New York. My friend that I was staying with lived in West Village so it was within walking distance. I was solo and decided to sit outside. I got the paella +salad combo and the bottomless sangria. The staff was super helpful in deciding what sangria to choose from and you can mix and match throughout your dining experience. They were also great with refills. I got complimentary olives as well while I was waiting for my salad. The salad was really large and had a great taste to it, however it could do with less dressing. The paella was delicious!! but I was feeling quite full after my salad so I only ate half. Overall this place was really great I would definitely recommend coming here for a lunch/anytime your stomach is feeling empty since you will leave stuffed and happy.",1,0,0,Nicole Y.,"Cupertino, CA",616,377,873

1.0,10/15/2018,"One of the worst dining experiences of my life. Went to brunch with a party of 8 and all started off fine. However, when food was delivered everyone's came but mine. I ordered bread and tomato. Literally, pan con tomate. The burgers came, the appetizers came, the egg dishes came. I asked 'my bread still coming?' Was assured it was on the way. Maybe 20 minutes later I asked again. Then yet again. Nothing. The plates start being cleared of the others at the table. A friend gets up to ask again. Then another friend. I felt bad, so I stayed at my seat. The rest of the food gets cleared. Finally my bread and tomatoes arrive. No apology. No one said anything actually. Put it in front of me and didn't charge after someone joked at the table - this is free, right? I'd expect the manager to come apologize, some sort of explanation. Nothing.And the dish was average. Really disappointed with this experience.",7,1,0,Kristen R.,"Miami, FL",463,25,5

5.0,9/18/2018,Barraca is one of my favorite restaurants in New York City.  They have a really great selection of authentic food and drinks.  The atmosphere is really nice inside the restaurant as well.  The best part about my meal was the sangria.  If you are a big fan of sangria you must try Barraca as they have a great selection of sangria with different flavors with different wines representing different regions of Spain.  Overall I would highly recommend Barraca to anyone looking for a great lunch or dinner in the city.,0,0,0,Max L.,"Doylestown, PA",0,22,0
2.0,9/16/2018,"Two and a half stars. Reasonably good food, but dining out is so much more than just food. Astoundingly incompetent service. No sense of tapas pacing. We requested that our dishes arrive in a specific order. Unfortunately the kitchen sent out our food all at once. The. They took several back, but the pacing was absurdly slow. Multiple requests for drinks, ignored. The kicker was the 18.5% gratuity added to our bill (unusual for a party of two) with a recommendation for an additional gratuity for 18% or 20%. The restaurant removed the gratuity--unapologetic. My recommendation is to try one of the other tapas restaurants in the neighborhood.",0,0,0,Kenneth S.,"New York, NY",1,60,0

2.0,8/27/2018,"Was not too crazy about this place, brunch was tremendously unorganized, staff was running on a skeleton crew during peak hours for bottomless brunch. Due to the lack of staffing the experience wasn't that great, refills were almost impossible to get, actually had to walk up to the bar and request them.The two stars is for the food, which is pretty decent; had steak and eggs which you really can't go wrong with.

1.0,8/18/2018,"This review is for the service we received from the two hostesses we spoke with only. I wish I could provide a review for the drinks and food but unfortunately, we didn't get that far. Stumbled upon this place while walking around the area and thought it looked like a great spot to grab drinks, eat a snack, and maybe meet some friends. It was around 4:30 on a Sunday and the place was completely empty outside, literally not a single person there. Walked up and asked if we could grab a table outside. They said we had to order a meal to sit outside. It's 4:30, we finished brunch not that long ago and definitely not ready for dinner. (I completely understand this if it was packed and everyone is waiting for an outdoor table. It. Was. Empty.) She offered a seat inside if we only wanted drinks. We had our dog so that wasn't an option. The girl then offered if we got a few appetizers she would let us sit. We decided to walk around a bit more to see if there was somewhere else without mandatory food. After a few minutes of walking, I decided I really wanted the sangria and could order a paella to snack on and take home the leftovers if needed so we headed back. Different guy at the host stand. Asked for a table and said two friends might be joining us later. He said everyone in the party must be present. Fine, I get it. We'll take a table for 2 because we weren't completely sure they were coming and I really wanted sangria. He said nope, you already told me there were four so I'm not giving you a table for two. Are you joking?! IT'S COMPLETELY EMPTY, 100% of your tables are open! So we ended up at a great place around the corner called Fiddlesticks with fantastic service. It's a shame because I LOVE paella but wouldn't want to return here if that's the type of service you provide. If there's a manager reading this and can explain this policy, please let me know because your hostesses certainly couldn't and I would like to update my review and give this place a chance.",0,0,0,Caitlyn W.,"New Orleans, LA",221,27,28
1.0,8/15/2018,"I came here for restaurants week with my family for my father's birthday and I was not too pleased. Here's why... Slow service. No baby changing station in the bathroom, they kept forgetting our drink orders, they stated the chicken came with a side and it didn't, chicken was dry but oily tasting, lots of flies in the outdoor seating area, my father's steak was 3/4's fat and napkins were wrapped with our utensils DIRTY. The positives are few, but here they are... sangria was delicious, Colombian bus boy was very attentive, Mercado salad was delicious and stuffed churros were very tasty.",0,0,0,Daph F.,"South Side, Mount Vernon, NY",72,4,0
3.0,8/5/2018,"Came here for happy hour with a few friends at an off time when the place was nearly empty and there was a ton of staff running around. Considering that, we were surprised that no one came over to take our order for a very long time after we were seated, and then only after we asked someone to find our server. Service picked up a little after that but was inconsistent and just kind of confused. Heads up: the rosé sangria (at least the carafe) was mostly ice and tasted so watered down it barely had any flavor (or alcohol, it seemed). We switched to a round of cocktails after that, which were a better deal and really tasty.",1,1,1,Rianna R.,"Manhattan, NY",47,93,150

I had a salad, a steak, and a chocolate mousse for dessert. It was the best steak I've ever had. The food was all delicious, especially paired with the sangria (Mancha was what we ordered).

1.0,8/3/2018,"I've been here a few times, food is decent, nothing to rave about, but it's in a good location and relatively easy to make reservations for large groups so I booked a table for dinner w my GFs. Service seemed friendly at first, one of two orders of apps came quick, the charcuterie board prob another 15min when all the other tapas came. We only ordered the board assuming it would be quick since we were hungry which is what I specifically told the waiter. My friends salad came with cheese and dressing after specifying she's allergic to the cheese and for the dressing on the side. No biggie, bring another. They stood there looking at it, looking at her. She was going to say it's ok.... she can try to shake the shaven cheese off, the waiter was like yea is that ok??Actually the cheese is pretty imbedded in the salad... after another 30 seconds of awkward stares, he's finally offers to bring another. Then they started preparing the table for entrees and the waiter asked us to transfer the apps to our plates. Didn't seem like a big deal right? But did seem odd to tell us to do that ourselves on places that were dirty and in some cases full of mussel shells. Also we're all friends but maybe not the best to ask to transfer to dirty plates if we were going to share later on? So we jokingly said happy to transfer ourselves and then asked for another plate so we could. He seemed annoyed again, every time we asked for something he seemed annoyed. Steak knife for steak? How dare I. They cleared the table and then we waited for dessert. And waited and waited and then I asked the waiter to check and he said ok. But then didn't. Waited some more.  Told him to check again. About 10 min later dessert came. Except we were missing one and one wasn't what we ordered and the churros were still doughy. So I asked about the mistake and the waiter told me the ice cream sandwich I said I ordered didn't exist on the restaurant week menu, insisting there were only two choices churros and mousse. After I reminded him about our exchange when I asked him which he recommended, and my GF reminded him that she had asked about the flavors did he say the menu I saw where I ordered the ice cream was an error. I don't give a shit that there wasn't ice cream and if he had just simply said, I'm so sorry but there actually isn't any, is either the mousse or churros ok? I would have been more than fine. I get stuff happens, slow service, even incompetent service, all ok. What isn't ok is insisting I was wrong and then not apologizing once when they realized their mistake. I'm paying for food and service, not to be treated with disrespect and blamed for someone else's mistakes and  incompetence. I rarely do this but I didn't tip. And I also hope that the owner/manager reads this review as if I owned a place where my servers treated my customers like that I would want to know. You might want to do some training on basic customer service, starting with if you fuck up, apologize to the customer, don't blame them.",2,0,0,Nancy H.,"New York, NY",48,121,135
2.0,8/1/2018,"Monday I went here for restaurant week with a coworker.  We sat outside in an effort to enjoy some Spanish food.  The appetizers were great.  Fresh meat and cheese plate with chorizo, another sausage, prosciutto (or its Spanish equivalent), grapes and toasted bread.  THEN the entree comes out (lobster paella).  It's served in a cast iron skillet (nice touch) but the rice is mush and burned to the bottom with a ring of burned rice around the edge.  Our server gave us some nonsense story that we had to stir it as soon as it came out.  I've had paella at many places including a famous one in Tampa and that wasn't part of the experience at all.  Most important, this ignored the fact that it was burnt already when brought out to us!  In addition, the lobster was in shell and we had to extract it ourselves while flies eagerly visited us.  As part of the paella burning process, the kitchen heated the lobster to a temperature that ruled out holding the claw with bare hands and literally baked the meat to the shell inside the claw.  Pulling it out with a fork was impossible.  It had to be scraped out and we gave up eventually.  As I discovered this, the burned paella got cold.  Add to this the over cooked vegetables and this paella was pure crap.My suspicion is that they prepare the cast iron pans with paella well beforehand and heat them up in the oven without much care or simple stirring when it is ordered.  Lazy cooking.  So to sum up, the uncooked food is good, cooked food is terrible.  Servers were great until they tried telling me I was responsible for their lousy paella.  Own your mistakes and fix them.  That shows far more character.",0,0,0,Dan G.,"Bronx, NY",2,34,11
2.0,7/30/2018,"This place was my favorite brunch place until last Friday, i love the unlimited sangrias with an entree, they are delicious so i was excited to bring my friends for Friday brunch. The waitress gave us the regular menu and also she said they are part of restaurant week and gave us a prefix lunch special menu, one of my friends liked the restaurant week menu but two of us wanted to order from regular menu, our waitress said they don't do that, we all have to order from either their regular menu or restaurant week menu because she said the food wont come at the same time, we told her it was fine with us, but she insisted they don't do that, so then we asked maybe they treat  us like separate customers with separate bills, and please go check  with the manager, so she leaves then comes back just walking slowly looking at other directions and ignoring us  , we had to ask her so what did the manager say? and she goes ""oh noooo they won't do it"" the restaurant had only 3 tables full we could'nt understand this strange policy or her very strange service  and decided to leave, found another really cool place to have brunch...",0,0,0,mehtap g.,"Long Island City, NY",0,3,0
2.0,7/29/2018,"I went with a group of 10 or so, and overall I can say that I didn't really have a good experience. We went with the lunch course where you could choose one of their tapas, entrees, and dessert options. I chose their ahi tuna salad, meat paella, and churros with nutella. We also got their Valencia sangria.The sangrias came pretty quickly, and for someone who doesn't drink often, I have to say it was really good. It had a nice fruit punch flavor and was light, which was good since this was a company lunch. However, afterwards, things went a little downhill. Our tapas took pretty long to come, and I was pretty disappointed by my salad. The tuna was good, but nothing seemed to mesh for me. The peppers were heavily sauteed while the green beans were really raw. The bowl was also pretty small making it pretty hard to mix. I tried some of the Spanish omelette with potato that my coworkers got, and that tasted a lot better.We also waited a very long time for the paellas, which unfortunately while looking good didn't taste so. The chicken was really dry and the paella had this sharp salty flavor that wasn't bad but definitely wasn't good. Additionally, although I think the snails meshed well with the flavors of the paella, personally they weren't for me.The dessert, however, was really good. I didn't think I'd like churros with nutella because the nutella might dominate, but they went really well together. The nutella was really warm, and you could still taste the cinnamon from churro. The churro was also cooked perfectly and really easy to eat.Overall, I'd stick with the brunch / desserts / drinks of this place, because that's what really stood out of for me, and this way you most likely won't have to wait as long.",1,0,0,William G.,"San Francisco, CA",3,108,193

4.0,6/18/2018,Summer nights and sitting outside was such a good feeling and really made the experience at Barraca very nice. It was refreshing to have sangria outside with Spanish tapas for dinner. The potatoes were a great balance between spicy and crunchy bits. My favorite dish by far was the ground beef in the potato balls. SO delicious and a must get. One tip would be to order a few tapas and order 2 servings of paella for every 1 person and even that may be too much.,0,0,0,Angelica C.,"Santa Monica, CA",680,124,216
1.0,6/10/2018,"I've come here several times for bottomless brunch, but my most recent visit really soured my view of this place. As other reviews say, good food and drinks can be ruined by terrible service. My complaint is specifically towards the hostess (waitress was great). When we arrived for brunch, the restaurant was 90% empty. We were seated at a tiny table, and asked if we could move to a bigger one. The hostess (who was frowning the entire time) said in a short and stern manner that ""there were reservations at X table"" and moved us to another table that was just as tiny, just differently shaped. We were all touching elbows and then asked to be moved again, and she finally directed us to a larger table in the dark, backmost corner farthest from the windows and bar (which is not good for bottomless, since it was difficult to get servers' attention to refill our drinks while in the back). It was like she spitefully gave us the worst large table, because there were many large tables near the windows in the light that remained empty during the course of our 1.5 hour stay. Even when we left, the restaurant was 70% empty, so it doesn't make sense that they gave us so much trouble for wanting a larger table. Baracca, keep your customers by having a friendlier hostess who is more accommodating to customer requests--because I know I won't be coming back anytime soon!",1,0,0,Tiffany C.,"Manhattan, NY",502,10,3

However, we spent almost 2 hrs at the restaurant and no such party ever showed up. This made me pretty mad since service is as important as food for me.

Honestly they aren't strict about the time limit on bottomless sangria, and you can switch between about 8 different flavors. I usually order a variety of tapas between friends. The service is kind, although sometimes not the best with English. But they make sure you're taken care of, and don't take offense if you need to flag down a waiter for a refill or extra bread. It's a reasonably priced brunch with a laid back, fun vibe.

First off, do not advertise happy hour as lasting until 7pm if you do not honor happy hour until 7pm. The restaurant was empty and we were  told we could only be seated if we ordered a set amount of tapas. Very negative way to to start off the experience given that just about every table in the restaurant was open!!

I was hoping the food would be good especially since the bartender had said that the owner & chefs were from Spain, however, nothing I ate at Barraca tasted or looked like any of the amazing tapas & paellas I've had through my travels in Spain. This expected since we're in NYC & not Spain but there's no excuse for serving a tiny portion of dry, gummy grilled octopus or an equally lifeless seafood paella that lacked fresh ingredients, flavor and that tasty crispy burnt rice on the bottom of the pan that true paellas are supposed to have.

5.0,4/20/2018,Barraca is one of my all time favorite places to come back to for both brunch and happy hour. Their weekend brunch is unlimited for two hours with a purchase of an entree. A couple of things that make their brunch awesome:- you can switch off in between the different flavors of sangria. Barraca has a wide variety of both red and white sangrias which are pretty much all worth trying. With the brunch option you have a chance to do so!- they have a variety of what foods you can order. They can be either a breakfast or more of a lunch style. One time when I came here for brunch the manager was very accommodating and allowed for us to get 3 tapas and a paella instead of an entree each. Staff is always very nice and helpful. The happy hour is also fantastic here! Certain tapas and sangrias are $6- my all time fave- datiles con bacon. They probably have the best bacon wrapped dates I have ever tried! - the gambas al Jillo were okay. My friend really liked them but I wasn't too crazy about them. They had a lot of flavor but there was still something missing. - the croquetas de jamon were also delicious and served with a spicy mayo sauce ... yum!! - patatas bravas never disappoint! They are always cooked to perfection and the aioli It is served with is to die for!!Favorite sangrias (I am not a fan of sweet drinks so my favorites are the more wine-y rather than sweet ones)- Castilla (red)- Valencia (rose wine - this sounded sweet but the waiter reassured me that It wasn't.

2.0,4/13/2018,"We were craving paella and sangria and thought this place would hit the spot for our craving while we were in town. It was crowded, lively and just seemed happening for a Friday night. The place is much larger than it appears and we got in easily with an Open Table reservation. This place is loud. Real Loud. From the main dining area to the back of the place, you have to yell to speak to the person next or across from you and the servers don't come down to your level so you can hear them either. Sangria - tried the Rioja and the Mancha. The Costco Kirkland sangria has much more flavor and the Mancha was watered down.  We started with the meat and cheese plate. Three meats and 2 cheeses, served with olives, almonds and jelly. We had the manchego and the caña de cabra, along with the jamón Serrano, chorizo ibérico, and sobrasada. This was the best part of our meal. Then it went downhill. We had the bacon wrapped dates - those were not very good. Bacon was mushy and didn't add the crisp to break up the texture. The mussels were steamed well but the broth lacked flavor. There was nothing to dip the bread in besides what seemed like dirty bath water. Their ""aioli"" was flavorless and was more of a warm mayo. As for the main dish, the Paella Negra. Menu said there was clams.. yet we had none. The dish lacked flavor... again. Not seasoned enough. The fish was good, the peppers were nice, but the rest of the dish was just mush. No socarrat or ""crispiness"" breaking up the texture like the crispness that most paella's have from the cooking process.  We told the server at the end of our meal (he disappeared and didn't check on much) and we got an empty ""sorrThis place is more trendy than it is delicious.

1.0,4/8/2018,"I went here to celebrate a friend's birthday last night, and I won't be back. We were a group of eight. We sat down and ordered three carafes of sangria and began to discuss the menu. The waiter returned and asked if we were ready to order, and we said we needed another moment (which is pretty typical). He then asked if ""they"" told us that they needed the table after us, and we said that no one had, so he said ""ok"". We felt that we were being rushed but it didn't make sense as there were a number of open tables and the restaurant has 3 levels. We continued to review the menu and asked him for recommendations and then made our choices. We ordered a variety of tapas, paella's and more drinks. As we were finishing up our paella's, another lady came over and told us that we needed to hurry up because they really needed the table. In all my years of living in NYC, I had never had this happen and we hadn't even gotten the check yet. The waiter brought the check and the same lady came back as we were discussing how we were going to divide it up and asked if it was ready and we said it wasn't. The waiter came back and grabbed the check and the lady came back and told us that we really needed to leave, and I explained to her that no one told us when we arrived or prior to sitting down that there was a time limit so it was rude that we were being treated this way. We didn't even get to have a birthday dessert with our friend!We spoke with the manager when we left who was quite dismissive.

Nothing extraordinary, but the food was good. Service was outstanding. Fast forward to my next brunch of 8 people downstairs (they have two floors). Maybe it's because they had 1 server for the entire bottom floor, but it was atrocious. For one, he was out of basically all the margaritas (but failed to mention until we decided to order them). Then, he would leave and not come back for 15 mins at a time. Our glasses were empty most of the time-- which is not cool when he gives you a hard stop at the end of your ""allotted time.""Not to mention, food was 3/5.There are better places to have brunch in west village, especially at this price point.",2,1,0,Diana G.,"New York, NY",25,61,1

4.0,2/6/2018,"* good for large groups*pro-tip: request where you want to be seated based on the size of your partyFrom the outside, the restaurant looks like there is only one floor to the space, however there is actually two levels (descending downward)! The first level is the moderate noise level with an intimate dining atmosphere (front space), the back space to the first level is also moderate noise but in a more well lit space, the second level (basement) is the biggest space, and brightly lit; you can literally host a family reunion down there if you wanted to, that is how much space there is. I came here one Saturday evening at around 7:45pm in a party of 4 for a birthday dinner. We were seated downstairs, and at the time there was only another table of 14 seated in the same space. I'm not quite sure why they chose to seat us downstairs because we saw plenty of space in the back of the restaurant as we were on the path downward. The basement is definitely geared for large groups because as more groups were seated it got very rowdy.Patatas Bravas (crispy home fries with spicy tomato and aioli sauce): highly recommendGambas al Ajillo (shrimp with olive oil and pepper) - 6 pieces: The table finished this quickly so would recommend - the shrimps are good sized shrimpsCroquetas de Jamon - 2 pieces that can be cut in half for 4 pieces: highly recommendMariscos Paella for 2: this was really good and I enjoyed it much more than Socarrat in terms of flavors! The mussels and calamari were of decent size, but the clams were so small and meager they were pretty much non-existent. The paella for 2 was really portioned for 4, and we were struggling to finish it - I can't even begin to imagine what paella for 4 would look like.The service here was quick and friendly, but what was a bit off-putting was how our waiter handed us our check after we declined dessert. He just put the check on our table before we even asked for it. We had ordered drinks and were looking to sip on them and chat for a bit after dinner. I looked around to see if the reason why they did that was because they ran out of tables downstairs and needed the space, but no that was not the case so what was the rush for?",4,1,3,Victoria X.,"New York, NY",579,617,577

I was with 4 adults and we left a lot of food left over (almost all of the rice in the paella) and most of the desserts and we didn't take any of it home. The seafood paella did not taste like seafood. No flavor as if they threw the seafood on top of it without having it cook a bit in the rice. The rice was half cooked and it was very dry without a bit of oil. That little oily crispy bottom was totally absent. The patatas bravas were overcooked and dried out. The tortilla de patatas was not bad and it was tasty. Every other tapa was dry. The desserts were extremely sweet ,even the Crema Catalana. The churros were great but they were too sweet inside, I had to take out much of the nutella and the dulce de leche to enjoy them.

We joked that the kitchen must be running out of plates. * 20% gratuity automatically added for party of 2 (is this legal?!)Creme Brûlée's top crust was too thick and hard to eat.

Sorry that we walked-in at 1pm-ish on  Saturday without reservations as we(parents) was suddenly in the mood for paella/tapas and my kid was only interested in eggs & potatoes. Where you sat us immediately in a busy restaurant after the manager/host ask ""so where does the princess want to sit - outside (beautiful sunny comfortable 80s) or inside (beautiful comfortable with AC).""  Needless to say my kid picked AC (go figure). But Stephanie was wonderful with her recommendations and understood patiently about my concerns with my picky eaters and over ordering for 2.5 people.

DO try the 15$ all you can drink sangria, which runs up to about 1.5 hour. There are several sangria flavors to choose from and each and every one of them were delicious. We also had a few drinks on-the-house, which was a lovely gesture :) As for the food, the top hit for the table seemed to be the rabbit meat paella and the not-so-loved dish was a vegetarian one - escalivada (roasted eggplant with steamed potato, egg, chickpeas, etc.). the kale flatbread with egg on top was also really good!

5.0,9/10/2017,"This place is excellent not sure why it doesn't have 5 stars. I spent a month in Spain and this place captures all of the most popular Spanish dishes and tapas very well. The croquetas de jamón were creamy in the inside and crunchy on the outside. The aioli side wasn't too thick, which I like. The patatas bravas were the same - fresh and creamy but crunchy with a little kick. The bacon wrapped dates were incredible and there was this hidden tomato paste sauce underneath them that paired very well. The pan con tomate was nothing too exciting, but good (although it's not an exciting dish to begin with). The tortilla española was warm and soft, perfect since I hate when it's dry and dense. We came for brunch so we got a great deal: bottomless sangria for $15. I personally found it a little too sweet, but I'm also partial to drier sangria anyway. The waiters (who were adorable and perfect eye candy but also helpful and knowledgeable) brought us samples of all of their sangria (not all of the cocktails are available for the bottomless special). We digested a bit and then out came our massive paella for five. Epic. This paella was so delicious and fresh. The chefs special that day was rabbit pork and chicken. The rice was creamy like a risotto and the charred lemons gave it a nice punch. Highly recommend this place!",0,0,1,Adam G.,"Long Island City, NY",139,25,2

2.0,8/19/2017,"I've been to Barraca a few times and have mixed feelings. Great food, but service leaves something to be desired. Had I written this review the first time, I might've given it four stars. I thought this place was delicious! - Pan con tomate: I'd pass on this next time; it wasn't bad but I wanted it to be something more. The bread was crunchy and the tomatoes light and refreshing, but I think there are better apps here.- Patatas bravas: loved these! I order patatas bravas almost every time I see it on the menu and these were great. I loved the tomato sauce and aioli combo -- and there's a good sauce to potato ratio. Would order these again.- Coca de Kale: this is the dish I've gotten both times I've come here. It's a ""flatbread"" with kale, cheese and an egg baked into it but I found it to be almost like a breakfast pizza. It's pretty good, but you do have to be in a specific mood to tackle this for brunch.- Bottomless sangria: there are maybe 6-8 different sangrias and I was able to try most of them  ONCE. The second time I came here we were limited to maybe 3-4 options which was disappointing, and had I known I might not've suggested this place.Now, as far as service goes, the first time I came here we sat in the main dining area and had no issues with service. After such a great experience, I recommended this place to my friends and afterwards almost felt embarrassed that I'd talked it up! We had a reservation but still ended up waiting to be seated which was weird because the place wasn't even full. We were taken to the back room and were told that a tiny table that looked like it should seat 2-3 people was meant to seat the 6 of us. Given that the room was practically empty I asked if we could sit at a booth and was told no. The manager on shift overheard the exchange, stepped in and ended up seating us at a larger booth table with no issue. From that point on, the experience just went completely downhill. Someone in my group left to use the restroom and they tried taking his seat away from the table! It was ridiculously difficult to get the attention of our servers with a nearly empty restaurant, and we were told not all of the sangrias were available that day which was a giant bummer as the varied selection was one of the reasons I wanted to come here in the first place. I haven't been back since and with all that NYC has to offer, I probably wouldn't come back unless I hear of any improvements service-wise. The food wasn't spectacular enough to make up for what this place is lacking.",1,0,1,Ashley V.,"Brooklyn, NY",153,150,402

I had traveled to Spain last summer and the apps were so tasty and authentic they transported me back to the yummy tapas  from Madrid and Barcelona! We ordered the patatas bravas that were well seasoned and slightly saucey but delicious! We also got the manchego (which came with almonds, dried fruit toast, and some guava paste), the dates wrapped in bacon/stuffed with blue cheese (bacon was slightly undercooked but still fab), and the ground beef/potato ball which was surprisingly tasty. I also ordered their red wine which was good and the sangria my friend got was not overly sweet- which was good!

Barraca is right around the corner from a place my friends love to brunch (Macondo), but I might drag them here instead next time.I came here in a large group of 10, and we easily secured a reservation. We ordered:- Jamon serrano: pretty typical cured ham that came with yummy pan con tomate- Manchego: mild cured sheep's milk cheese, came with slices of bread, jam, olives, and grapes- Croquetas de jamon: crispiness on the outside gives way to creamy softness dotted with bits of ham. I think we got 4 orders of this?- Pulpo a la plancha: decent octopus, not the most tender I've ever had but the broth it came in (chickpeas, kale, chorizo) was nice and flavorful. Definite crowd pleas.er- Broccoli a la catalana: I thought the broccoli was way too salty and the dish overall offered nothing special outside of adding some greens to the table- Albondigas: lamb meatballs stuffed with goat cheese. Super delicious, though the meatballs were kind of textureless-  Carne a la brasa: cooked to a perfect medium as requested, super tender meat complemented by the flavorful chimichurri sauce- Patatas bravas: standard but good order and a hefty portion.- Tortilla espanola: this was kind of like a Spanish quiche? First time trying it, and I thought it was yummy.- Bombas: the bombbbb(a) - all I want in life is fried balls of mashed potatoes stuffed with ground beef.- Gambas al ajillo - kitchen sent out a complimentary order of garlic shrimp (I guess because we ordered like 20 things), and while the shrimp itself was average the crispy garlic chips were so addictive.Drinks included pitchers of sangria, naturally. The rioja was a far bigger hit at our table than the compostela, which everyone felt was too sweet.I saw some people having paella as I was walking back to our table, and those looked amazing (and huge).

The bartender was very helpful and friendly in answering my questions and making recommendations for me. If you have a selected Spain G&T menu, best believe that's what I will be going for. G&T fans, you'll all know what I mean. I went with the Wint & Lila and Lemon Tonic, garnished with a dehydrated lime and lemon and a cucumber slice, refreshing! I asked the hostess if I could sit outdoors, it was around 4pm and the place was quite empty. She said, ""If you sit at a table, you have to order food"" ... there are many other ways to say it. I did not say I was only having drinks. I'm just trying to move my experience from the bar to an outside table. The hostess left a bitter spot. The first round of drinks took a while to arrive at the table. Other than that, the server and supporting staff outside was super attentive. I ordered some appetizers and I have pros and cons about the food. The lamb meatballs came with four huge well done pieces and four chunks of well roasted eggplant, topped with soft goat cheese and mint in a tomato sauce, which caught me by surprise. I would think spanish beef meatballs would pair well with tomato sauce but not lamb meatballs. I would not have ordered this dish if I knew it came with tomato sauce. The menu description did not clarify that there would be tomato sauce in the dish. The grilled octopus seemed like a chickpeas dish if I did not know what I ordered. Chickpea to Octopus ratio 10:1. Luckily, the sauce on this dish was so good that I just ate it all. The octopus could've been grilled a lot more. The kale absorbed the sauce which was a great component to the dish but wished that balanced out with the amount of chorizo. Would have given 4 stars if someone had bothered to give us or tell us about the happy hour menu, felt like I missed out.",2,1,3,Carrie C.,"Brooklyn, NY",546,336,2421

Because of the large group, I understand service may be a bit slow. Music was beyond loud, so we could barely hear each other. Then, our waitress came to take our orders before we could even look at the menu. Then, our food was brought out within an average amount of time. That's a simple plus for this establishment. I got the bottomless mimosas, one friend got a mojito, and the other got sangria. We did not receive our drinks until all 7 of us had COMPLETELY finished our meals. Then, when we kindly asked to have the order cancelled (before we got our drinks) our waitress was rude, and they were all of a sudden miraculously ready. After finishing 2 regular mimosas, I was given what I can only describe as poison that was literally impossible to drink. I guess it was a specialty mimosa, but it was the most disgusting thing I have ever consumed. After only receiving what I can call 2.34 mimosas, and 2 empanadas,my split of the bill was 30 dollars.

We placed our drink and food order at the same time. I did the bottomless sangria bar- my friend did another cocktail- first drinks took LITERALLY at least 10 min to get to our table. Our waiter wasn't even busy, he was just standing there, walking around, passing us several times while our drinks were being watered down by the bar, and boy were they watered down by the time we got them. The next rounds were okay, and everything seemed to be fine again. But why does a busser come to your table to drop off water and sees dirty plates that we are obviously finished with and just leaves them there? It got to the point where after like 10 min of staff seeing the plates  I put them on the table next to us so we could have some space. Only then were they bussed. Another friend joined us and ordered food and utensils weren't brought out for her, not even a glass for water. She had to grab some from the table next to ours. And then to get dirty looks from another busser reseting that table? Dude, gtfoh, give us what we need and we won't ""mess"" up a table that no one was sitting at anyway.I don't know why I thought the service would get better after starting off pretty bad. I work in this industry so I'm always understanding but the staff that was attending to us needs more training and needs to be more attentive.

3.0,5/29/2017,"I have been here many many times before! I love the food (the bacon wrapped dates are my favorite!) typically I have zero complaints but unfortunately today was a different experience.  We arrived and sat at 12:30; it took 15 minutes to get our first glass of sangria; and then we ordered some tapas.  Our waitress was a sweet girl. She was definitely trying her best. The restaurant got crowded right after we sat and we waited about 20 minutes for a refill. We got our tapas and waited a long time to order our food that we wanted for our meal.  My friends meal came out with sliced cold cut chicken on her grilled chicken salad- but no one came to check on us, so we couldn't mention this to be fixed.  Two of us finished our meals already before we were checked on and mentioned the chicken. The waitress must have been new; because she was so sweet but she had to check with someone else if it was right or not, she told us the manager would change the meal. I was upset because I asked for a manager 30 minutes into our meal when the refills took so long and she said she was too busy.   But this time when she pointed out who the manager was; she had been in the restaurant area for at least 15 minutes and had never come to our table despite our request at least an hour earlier.  When the manager came over I mentioned this, and she said she had many other important things to do aside from talking to customers.  She switched the salad but that took another 30 minutes; we were all done eating so my friend took it to go.  I will say they let us keep drinking sangria he whole time. I Appreciated that.  He manager never checked on us again.. the waitress was trying her best to make up for he sub par things, I think she must have been new and the restaurant got busy. it was my friend's birthday and they brought some truffles after I asked for the sundae; she removed it quickly before my friend returned and told me she already was fixing it. Unfortunately the kitchen brought the  sundae right to the table without letting her put the candle in etc. I made eye contact with our waitress and even she was disappointed.  I saw another manager who seemed so friendly and nice but I couldn't get her attention, and when I asked the waitress if we could speak to her, she told the former manager who my friend happened to over hear the whole conversation.  The first manager told our server to tell us the other manager wasn't there, and didn't even bother coming to the table herself. Overall we ended up getting extended bottomless drink and of course I didn't ask for a discount on the bill since they extended the time but the experience was much worse than prior times I have been.  I love this place! So I'll keep coming back. But the manager was terrible. And I was very unhappy with how she handled things.  I mean, who as a manager, tells a paying customer that they have better things to do than to come and check on the table that had a complaint? And then she never came back again after that one visit where she basically might as well have told us that our money and patronage didn't matter to her at all.  If I wasn't someone who frequents this place; I probably wouldn't come back.",2,0,1,Alison M.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",2,13,9

Nothing worth noting.We had a tortilla española for the table that came with delicious olives and a couple of pan tumacas. The tortilla was a little bit dry and is not for sharing with many people because it's not that big.The simple kale and chorizo omelette which I replace the chorizo for manchego cheese didn't come with the cheese so that's was something unfortunate. The patatas bravas were good but not so much the ""salad"", a sad Boston lettuce.Our friends had the steak and eggs which was a small plate, not that many meat and full of French fries to compensate I guess.Overall is fine but I wouldn't have chosen it if it weren't because I was tired and hungry, picking the only place without people.Not a comeback for sure...",3,1,1,Sebastian K.,"New York, NY",41,373,0

The mimosas come in 5 different flavors believe, and I particularly enjoyed the guava one. But they also have the classic oj one as well! (You can mix it up throughout your meal) We had a huge party and I always get worried about how it will go over, but we did make a reservation, (we just added a few). They didn't have the table ready for us when we arrived, even for the original number, and it took some time for them to just push together three tables that were empty and set already, but maybe there was just some miscommunication. But eventually we were seated- took some time for them to get our drinks to the table after ordering them, but again, we had a large party...that's a lot of mimosa making. I ordered the burger, (but I would suggest being more adventurous- the other food looked amazing) The burger was great but came out well done and I ordered medium rare (that's a pet peeve of mine) and the fries are literally some of the best I've had in a long time. They were very attentive and the server also always had someone come to the table with her and made sure we had everything we needed. Great customer service, and they always seemed to have a smile even when dealing with so many people!

1.0,5/2/2017,"I brought four of my best friends here for dinner. One of my friends cut the inside of her mouth after being served ice cream that had shards of hard, clear plastic in it. She pulled two large shards out of her mouth, and was bleeding. Thankfully, she did not swallow them...We immediately notified our server, who was appropriately horrified, and said he would get the manager right away. Enter Louis. He calmly explained that the shards likely came from the hard plastic containers in which the restaurant stores its ice cream. Without giving any meaningful apology to our friend, he said he would comp one of our carafes of sangria. We let him know that was a completely unacceptable response that was wholly disproportional to what had just occurred. Louis then became very aggressive, and said that he would be willing to do more ""if the injury was more serious and she had to go to the hospital."" His response was truly unbelievable, and it was obvious that he was treating us this way because we were five women asserting ourselves in a situation in which he and his restaurant were at fault. I let him know that I was certain that if we were five men in business suits, he would be doing everything he could to make this right, instead of treating us with so much disrespect, hostility, and condescension. He flipped out and made a huge scene, so clearly we had touched a nerve. We told him that what had happened was a health code violation, and he told us we were wrong and didn't know what we were talking about (it absolutely is, and we filed a complaint). We explained that we are all attorneys, and he yelled, ""Are you threatening me!?"" He also refused to give us the name and contact information of the restaurant's owner (we found it online in about 30 seconds). Louis then cancelled my Open Table reservation after we left (presumably to prevent me from writing a review through that site). There's so much more I could add about the way we were treated at this restaurant, but just thinking about it is making me furious. TLDR: NEVER GO TO BARRACA.",9,1,2,Caitlin S.,"New York, NY",2,2,0

Besides the bland and overpriced food, when my friends and I came here, we found SHARDS of hard clear plastic in our ice cream, which is made by the restaurant. My friend cut her mouth because, who would believe there'd be foreign objects in the food? The manager Louis should have been rightly mortified, but was actually unapologetic, hostile and dismissive and would not take any responsibility for the multiple shards in the dessert. He acknowledged the shards were there and even explained they were likely broken and accidentally got in while they were making the ice cream, but was nonetheless accusatory and aggressive. I'm sure he didn't throw away the batch as he made no assurance about it.

I have never experienced customer service as poor as I had from the manager at Barraca when we found multiple shards of plastic in our dessert. Louis, completely failed to address the problem. He dismissed it by claiming there wasn't a problem since no one was bleeding. No apology and implied that unless someone was in the hospital he would not do anything for us. He only offered to give us free drinks while minimizing the situation. His behavior was absolutely appalling in light of the fact that the food was actually dangerous to consume. Although he claims to have never encountered this issue before in his ""30 years in the industry,"" it was apparent from his attitude that this is either a common occurrence or he did not believe us. His behavior was neither one of an experienced service worker nor that of a mature adult. Shame on Barraca and Louis for this night.If we had been a table of men, he would have at least given us a complimentary meal. When we tried to discuss it with him, he was dismissive and accusatory.

Their tapas are $5 too (both drinks and tapas are smaller versions than what you would get on their regular menu which makes sense for HH) and let me tell you, I have dreams about their bacon wrapped dates and their ham croquettes. I mean, I'm literally wondering as I write this review if I should change my dinner plans tonight to come here... Anyway. So, go for HH. Because you can make a reservation and sit in the restaurant (which has a lovely ambiance and cute decor) and STILL ORDER OFF THE HH menu. Who does this?! Barraca. Because they want you to be happy. Why this place doesn't have a higher star rating is beyond me. You literally can't get a deal like this for such quality alcohol/food ANYWHERE. They also have wine & beer on HH if sangria isn't your thing. (Who are these people??) I've gone for HH & dinner a handful of times. I went once for brunch and I would give that 3-stars, hence the 4-star rating. We had a reservation and were sat in the basement (awful - had no idea it was day time). It was crowded and weird down there and the service was super slow. I didn't think the food was nearly as good and wished I could have just ordered their small plates for brunch! If I could re-do the experience, I would request an upstairs table for brunch.

2.0,2/19/2017,"I'm really conflicted on how to review Barraca- first of all, we were seated right away thanks to our reservation but waited 20+ minutes to have our orders taken. It felt like the waiters were ignoring us and I was very tempted to just leave because of how rude it felt. A man who appeared to be the manager eventually came and took our orders and was very hospitable, but his courtesy just highlighted how rude the waiters were. This was extremely disappointing because Barraca came highly recommended by a close friend and I was excited to bring my parents here when they came to visit New York- I had been craving paella and they hadn't had Spanish food since their trip to Madrid a few months ago. I don't know if it's because we're Asian (I noticed that we were the only Asian patrons in the restaurant), which is the reason one of my Latina friends immediately gave when I told them about this, but either way the service was awful. One waiter walked by, saw our empty water carafe, got new water for the table next to us, and never even stopped at our table despite literally noticing that we were out of water. The manager stopped by when we got our appetizers and was very kind, telling us that we could order more bread we wanted. And yet when my mom requested more bread, the waiter never brought it. Later on I stopped a waiter to ask for more water and made sure to add ""we also asked for more bread but we don't need it anymore"" just to confirm that they had forgotten our order or just blatantly ignored it. I thought the food was pretty good but overall eating here left a very sour taste in my mouth. I wish I had read reviews before going, as I found a number of bad reviews on Open Table after leaving the restaurant. It's sad because their menu is enticing and there's more tapas I would've loved to try but I don't see a point in going back when the service was this horrible. The restaurant wasn't insanely packed and we were very polite- there was no reason we should have had to wait so long to order and definitely no reason to literally be ignored by the staff. I feel awful for taking my parents to a restaurant that treated us this badly. Very disappointing. The manager was truly great but this experienced ruined our night. Honestly, I don't ever write reviews- this is the first time I've ever felt compelled to write one. I've never had such a horrible dining experience in the city. I run a food blog and was planning on coming back to feature Barraca but definitely won't be anymore.",1,0,0,Irene K.,"New York, NY",479,24,63

4.0,2/17/2017,"Came here for my birthday dinner in January on a saturday night, it was packed but luckily my SO made a reservation and they had our table ready for us in the back. It was sort of like booth style but not closed in, we were more close to the other tables. I am a sucker for tapas so this place was my home. We ordered their croquettas and patatas bravas and maaaan are they to die for or what!! The croquettas are my favorite by far, they're stuffed with ham and cheese. Patatas bravas are spicy but the right amount of spice. We also ordered shrimp in garlic sauce, average but the shrimp are really fresh, none of that frozen stuff so I was pleased. We then ordered a pizza that had some sort of fruit on it, not my cup of tea but my boyfriend enjoyed. At the end, the waiters came to my table and sang happy birthday to me, my boyfriend forgot to tell them my birthday which made it hilarious because the waiters paused when it was time to say happy birthday to ____ but they made it work. Nice touch! But they still charged for the birthday dessert which I thought was insane!!!! First restaurant to ever do that, was kind of upset. All in all, still a great experience.",1,1,1,Emanuele M.,"Elizabeth, NJ",28,81,73

Had the eggs Benedict pretty good and filling. Sangrias were great even though I stuck to Valencia. Not a huge sangria fan and I was able to keep up pretty decently.

3.0,11/8/2016,"""Meh, I've experienced better"" but I'll give this place three stars anyway. Barraca is a restaurant that aims to provide authentic Spanish tapas - but for twice the price. I went here after work with a few of my coworkers thinking we'd walk away with a few light bites and some nice drinks for relatively cheap and boy were we wrong. My friends bought a $35 carafe of sangria which they described as very weak. It looked like it too because that thing was mostly ice. By the end of the meal it only had enough liquid to fill 3 glasses all the way (and this is WITH all that ice melting). The food options here weren't very exciting but we went ahead and ordered 2 tapas plates:  Gambas al Ajilo ($14) and Setas Salteadas ($13). Did we just spend $14 on 7 shrimp and a slice of bread?! You bet we did. And that $13 got us one egg on top of thinly sliced mushrooms. I've been to plenty of tapas places in NYC and this one just does not make the cut.

We had two paellas the classic seafood and the Valenciana (chicken and snails). Both were made with authentic Bomba rice and amazing. The service was attentive and prompt, but not stuffy.

So there are tonnes of brunch places in the West village and Baracca is located next to the Mighty Quinn's. So Baracca is great if you like sangrias and you want to people watch in west village. Their unlimited 15$ bottomless sangrias are great for one and half hours (they were very gracious and filled it even past that). They have 5 different flavors to choose from and all of them are great! Would highly recommend Barcelona.Their Brunch food options aren't that many. I got the gambas al ajuilo which was good, nothing remarkable about it.My friends got the huevos con chorizo and the huevos con plato. The chorizo itself was good but the rest of it was A-ok. That being said, their charcuterie board is pretty good for 22$ and must try if possible.There's a construction site in front, but you can't really do anything about it, it's not noisy or loud and there's nothing going on during the weekendsOverall, I'd give this place 3.5 to 4 stars.

We had the garlic shrimp - (flavorful oil don't forget to dip the bread!), patatas bravas, kale salad, and the beef and potato croquets. For the entree, I HIGHLY recommend the skirt steak and egg on top of brussel sprouts. The steak was cooked perfect to my liking of medium rare. For dessert, you need to try the churros if you like semi sweet chocolate and the flan. Everyone at my party had sangria - by far the best sangria for a bottomless brunch place. Tastes like they make it in small batches rather than a vat in the back room.The event planner was very responsive and the waiters and waitresses were awesome. Kudos to them! I would 100% recommend them for your next bottomless brunch party!",3,0,1,Kurt H.,"West Orange, NJ",52,85,195

4.0,7/4/2016,"Back when I lived in West Village, I'd often walk past Barraca's fluorescent blue sign on Greenwich Avenue and wondered if I would make a visit. The restaurant has had a fairly tumultuous history in its short lifespan; in 2013, famed executive chef Jesús Nuñez left the restaurant's helm and in 2015, the restaurant was closed for a brief period of time due to missed tax payments. I wasn't sure what I would find upon my eventual first visit years later, but after a quick skim of the brunch menu and a quick reservation, my friend and I made our way over on a Saturday afternoon.Barraca runs a busy weekend brunch service, which is due in no small part to its bottomless brunch service; even in the middle of the afternoon when we arrived, almost all seats were taken and the atmosphere was bustling. While I can't speak on any of the libations offered here, what I can say is that guests will find an array of the typical tapas plates (available during the evening hours as well) and a solid offering of brunch dishes with notable Spanish skews. The Pan Con Tomate that we started with was pretty standard: toasted bread topped with a light tomato spread, olive oil, and a pinch of salt. An extra punch of garlic would have been appreciated, but it was substantial enough to whet our appetites as we waited for our main dishes.For those that like their pizza-flatbread hybrids, the Coca de Recapte is the dish to order. The crust is that perfect texture of chewy, yet still crisp, and the toppings of pork sausage, onion, eggplant, and roasted red peppers meld perfectly with the melted Manchego cheese. Finished off with a still-runny farm egg, and you have a generous for-one serving, or a great dish to share. As for the Huevos Benedictos, they were the typical eggs benedict with a slightly Spanish skew with the usage of sliced Serrano Ham; skip, and opt for one of the more innovative dishes on the menu.I'm curious to see what other dishes Barraca has to offer during their later hours; they run a generous happy hour, which covers both libations and tapas, and their dinner menu appears to consist of fairly traditional Spanish dishes. At least from what I've tried, however, the dishes are tasty and executed well, and at their price points, makes for quite a gem in the West Village.",11,3,7,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

4.0,6/20/2016,"Solid boozy brunch option a ten minute walk from Union Square. Had a reservation for a party of four on a Sunday, and the place was initially empty but filled up quickly by around 1. We were drawn to the location for its offer of 8 different sangrias (only 7 of which apply to the 1.5 hr bottomless deal) and the Spanish twist on typical brunch dishes. The entrees seemed to be fairly priced, with my omelette at $12. The house salad that comes with the egg dishes was surprisingly great with pickled red onions and arugula! Out of the sangrias my favorite was a wine wine with sake and lemongrass, while my friends enjoyed the rose option. At one point I think our server understood that we were trying to drink all seven varieties, but it was increasingly difficult to flag him down for an order.

The Castillo sangria was well balanced and traditional. I enjoyed discovering a new soup that's better than gazpacho. It comes with eggs and bacon! The pulpo was slightly blackened. I liked the purple potatoes and Paco liked the regular ones. All in all, it was a good lunch at a reasonable price. The bread didn't come with butter. I love butter.

Happily seated ordered several tapas: pan com tomate (not memorable at all), dates w bacon and blue cheese (amazing) and the croquetas de jamon (very good). As a main course we shared thr octopus which was amazingly cooked to perfection and is big enough to be shared if you've had several tapas.

3.0,6/4/2016,"I have to tell you first and foremost - went in with mixed feelings. I am a huge fan of paella (when made well)...The ambiance of the place was cute, romantic, interior wasn't overcrowded by any means. A few cute props on the window made the place look cozy. If you look by the kitchen- ropes are hanging on the walls, for some reason. A little weird, if you ask me. Drinks ... we went for a margarita on the rocks and a jack and ginger. Nothing to write home about, on the verge of being watered down, but not quite.The food. We had the white anchovies with toasted bread as an appetizer and they were actually excellent and that gave me all the hopes for the main course, but alas. I had a seafood paella and the man had the Valenciana. The waiter warned us that they are made from scratch and take about 30 minutes. In my head I am going ""Oh, yay! This will be fabulous!"" No, it wasn't. Tasteless paella, rice needed a bit more time cooking, stale seafood. The Valenciana had roasted peppers and that was a nice touch. Took the leftovers home but didn't bother too much with them. Also didn't want to risk it with the dessert.

We ordered the bacon covered dates which were absolutely delicious, this dish alone makes Barraca worth a visit.  We also ordered the bombas which were basically potato croquettes filled with ground beef served with a very tangy and spicy sauce, also amazing! The vegetarian paella wasn't my favorite but I'm not a huge fan of Paella so I'm a bit biased on that one. The unlimited sangrias: so good especially the white ones (Barcelona?).

Since we were somewhat lazy prior to our arrival, we had some tapas elsewhere (which turned out to be a mistake on my end; shoulda try out Barraca's tapas instead). We weren't super hungry, so we ordered 2 people's worth of Paella Negra to share between the three of us. It was just perfect, perfect, perfect. Don't be fooled by the price; you do get what you're paying for and then some. For $25/person, $50 for the paella, we got so much seafood! I can tell that it's fresh too. The flavor is great; and soon before we knew, we cleaned the pan. With my full stomach, I still made the decision of ordering the dessert (which is a special and isn't on the menu). Flan, mango sorbet, and coconut foam had never tasted so well together. It is so good even though my food baby was ready to pop. It's a must try guys! Ps, sangria is good too.

Everything was delicious, and our server was very attentive.So what warrants the 1-star review? When the baked eggs were around 70% eaten, I took a bite and bit into something hard. It turned out to be a piece of hard, somewhat sharp plastic, around half an inch long. I notified a waitress walking by and she took it from me, apologized, and I assume took it to the back. A moment later, the manager stopped over to apologize. Here is where I was turned off. He said ""I was told what had happened, and I'm sorry. ***But, it was just a small piece of plastic.***"" I'm sorry? Does the fact that it was ""small"" justify it being in your food? That excuse of a sentence ruined it for me. He futher asked if I would like something else. I said no, because we were almost done eating at this point and also because I didn't want to be possibly charged for another dish.We finished up, and when the bill came, sure enough, we were charged for both dishes.

It gets packed here, so you'll likely have to wait regardless of whether you have a reservation or not.Restaurant Week:My dinner experience here during Restaurant Week was better than my brunch experience. We ordered a raw tuna appetizer, which was DELICIOUS - would definitely recommend it. I wasn't familiar with raw fish dishes aside from sushi (which I love), so it was new to me. So glad I tried it. We also got the mariscos paella, which was very good as well. The food was great, but the service was a little slow, although friendly. Note, it can be hard to have a conversation until you get used to yelling, because it gets SO loud in here.Brunch: They have an unlimited sangria option for brunch, which is pretty cool, but it'd be great if their service was a little better. They're very busy, so it can be pretty slow or forgetful at times. I think they should hire more people for their staff, or train them better. We'd ask for more drinks, or a straw, or something, and it'd be forgotten... Not ideal. The sangria is tasty though, and the food was good, especially their flatbreads. They have 8 different sangria options to choose from  (and everyone in your group can order different kinds), so there are many options to suit your tastes. As for the food, I would recommend the Coca de Recapte.I also got a dessert during the brunch - the Churros con Chocolate. They just sounded sooo good. But it was a huge disappointment - the inside wasn't cooked through, and it wasn't the good kind of not-cooked-through (chewy and yummy). It had a mushy gushy texture and not so good taste in the middle. I did NOT enjoy - and I'm not even picky with desserts. And it cost me $9.Also, they have a downstairs area that we were seated in for brunch, which I didn't really like. There are no windows, so no natural light at all.

It's definitely more of a service thing.It's sad that it has become so poorly managed, that the staff gets away with being so obnoxious sometimes. Are they being paid to run wild ? Some of them must be. Last time I came here for happy hour I was told that it ended at 6 pm, but the waiter did not bother to tell us that it was still happening at the bar. He just said that it ends at 6 on Fridays and Saturdays. We ordered from the regular menu, but the waiter was more into it talking to his coworker than taking our order. Fun fact: we tried coming here on a Saturday recently and were told that there was no happy hour. I really don't think these people are being trained at all. Whereas, last time I came here for brunch was a real sh*tshow. For starters, the host was a dick. So much of a rude a-hole that when I asked for his name on my way out he said that it was ""Tatyana."" I later found his name because he loves taking selfies at work for Instagram (how basic), instead of actually sitting people in a timely and politely manner. They also refused to give us the 2 hours of bottomless sangria because we got there at 2:30, but by the time we sat down and were actually served there was about an hour left. I will never forget also, this one time where I tried to get a table when the restaurant was EMPTY! And this pregnant 19 year-old hostess told me that there were no tables because of restaurant week. EMPTY. I had to whip out my phone to show her that there were plenty of tables available. Forget about this place. It's a hot mess now. There was potential. There were chances.

I liked the appetizers much better than the main course which is why I am rating this place a 4.. But that could also be because i probably chose the most boring thing on the menu- the kale and cheese omelette with the patatas bravas. Do yourself a favor and stay away from the omelette as you can make a better one at home half-sleepy. The patatas bravas were really good, we had that as appetizers too and I didn't mind eating them again with the main course- it also helps soak up all the alcohol!

Initially it looked very small upon entering, but they have 2 additional spacious rooms that was able to accommodate all the diners comfortably which was nice. I was also pleasantly surprised by their many choices of exotic sangrias when I went to the bar. Unfortunately the Friday night I  was there they only had 3 offerings. My friends and I ordered carafes of their exotic sounding sangrias only to be disappointed. All of them tasted the same...like water; nothing like the robust description of it on the menu. The food..  Mediocre at best. It was ok. We ordered croquets, bacon wrapped dates, steak w/ chimmichuri sauce, potatoe balls stuffed with meat, lamb ribs and fried artichoke.

Our first visit and it was not the best one.First of all I made a reservation for 2pm brunchGot a sitter for my sonWe were not seating until 2:40pm, waiter took at least 10 minutes to come to our tableWhen he finally greeted us he told us brunch would be over at 4 therefore the Sangria 2 hr lunch would only be for 1 hour although WE WERE SEATED VERY LATE! As well, he said they only had 2 Sangrias to choose from so those 7 Sangrias they advertise, guess what, you cannot even taste them!!!The food came out rather quickly and I have to admit, it was delicious!

4.0,2/28/2016,"My roommate has a theory that the restaurants that have a 3.5 rating on Yelp are the best... And I think she might be right.Came here twice with a group of 8-10 people for boozy brunch on Saturday and I've always had a great time. Great savory brunch menu with a variety of options to satisfy everyone's cravings. Love the fact that they serve multiple types of sangria and that you can switch between several flavors throughout your meal. For $15 for boozy brunch, I'd say that's a steal. Only downside was that I made a reservation for 2pm, and didn't get seated until 40 minutes afterwards. Apparently the people who were at our table before us had been sitting there longer than they had anticipated and they were too nice to kick them out. I would suggest making a reservation closer to when brunch starts to avoid the extra wait (we weren't the only group that had to deal with the same situation).",1,1,0,Vania S.,"New York, NY",383,21,14

There were 4 of us and we definitely felt satisfied by the end of the meal.  For dessert, we ordered the Churros con Chocolate - amazing, wish it came with more!The service was really great, very attentive.

5.0,2/9/2016,"One of the best bottomless brunches in NYC that I've been to, probably because I'm a sucker for sangria. It's the only drink option for the boozy deal but they have eight or so flavors that you can choose from. I'd recommend the Valencia! They seemed to be a little weak on the alcohol, but nothing too drastic. Food choices range from tapas and Spanish-infused egg dishes to burgers and sandwiches. I would highly suggest getting the burger - it was unbelievable, like melt-in-your-mouth amazing. The only bad thing I would say about this place is that it was quite chilly (at least in the downstairs area where we were seated). It was the dead of winter and the air conditioning was blasting - not cool. I don't think it's a reason to knock a full star off of my rating, but something to consider when dressing for the occasion.

However, would love to come back here just for appetizers, because the main course (the only options on the special menu was different paellas) was not to our liking. We are not paella experts, but both of our choices (the seafood and the duck options) were dry and we both barely finished half. As for dessert, we both got the Pan, Chocolate, Aceite & Sal - basically a magical mixture of sweet and salty. Something I cannot resist. My boyfriend, not a huge dessert person, did not finish his, so I helped him out when I was done with mine. This dessert is something I definitely would recommend.

They are pretty close to the starbucks near by. Offered outside seats, Barraca seems to be a great place for an afternoon happy hour. At least, that's what I thought. The whole decoration is very interesting, and pretty. Service: very nice. They served us well.Price: since we had the restaurant week menu, we cannot say much about the price.Food: I had Tortilla De Patatas for Tapas, Paella Del Dia for 2, and vanilla ice cream (they ran out of chocolate in the middle of a Thursday?!)I would say the food is pretty average. My friend was craving for Paella so we  decided to come here. I had real Paella before, and here it is just less impressive to me. Too oil, and meat with rice was not moistured. The meat as bit dry actually...Tortilla De patatas is ...what should i put... mediocre . Very flavorless and pan tomato is not toasted well.I wanted Pan, Chocolate, Aceite&Sal. They told me, they did not have it. Get vanilla ice cream.

3.0,1/28/2016,This place has a pretty nice happy hour deal.  $5 gets you a wide variety of different sangria and appetizer options.  The two drawbacks are that the drinks aren't too strong and the appetizers are immensely tiny.  Me and a friend attempted to share two appetizers but we were just as hungry leaving as we were going in.  I'd say skip the apps and stick with the drinks.  The servers are very attentive and the ambiance/decor makes you feel as if you've travelled to Spain.  I've heard this place has a great bottomless brunch; I'll be back for that!,0,0,0,Chey O.,"Brooklyn, NY",262,176,738
2.0,1/25/2016,"I had an enjoyable experience here with friends over Saturday brunch, but in terms of food quality, price point, and service, it was just okay- not much of a desire to return. We arrived at 11 am and were only one of two parties in the restaurant. Well decorated, chill ambiance, and all around welcoming. Food: I ordered the Huevos Benedictos since Benedict is my usual go-to for brunch- it was a disappointment. While the hollandaise sauce looked promising, it lacked flavor and didn't add anything to the dish. The portion of cured Salmon was so small that it was overpowered by even the poached egg. The english muffin was overly soft such that it had trouble soaking up the egg- too porous-- the texture almost tasted like white bread. My friends also ordered the Coca De Kale, the Coca De Recapte, pancakes with fruit, the French toast, and we had the Pan Con Tomate and the Patatas Bravas to share. The tapas were just okay. The pancake wasn't cooked all the way and there was way too much ricotta on the french toast but other than that, people seemed satisfied with their food. We finished off with churros con chocolate which was probably the best part of the meal though I don't think fried goodness with chocolate and sugar can ever be bad. Now, for the service:Several of my friends ordered the unlimited Sangria. Around the two hour mark, at which point the unlimited Sangria was finished, the servers began to get very impatient with us, despite the fact that there were still many open tables available. In addition to taking away Sangria glasses when a friend went to the restroom, they also cleared her water glass to signal that it was time for us to leave. Considering we had just paid the bill, I thought this was unnecessarily rude. My friends enjoyed the sangria- seemed to be worth the $15 considering the variety and strength of the drinks, but I think that would be the strongest case for going to Barraca above the other brunch spots nearby.",3,1,0,Rosa Y.,"Palo Alto, CA",566,183,271

2.0,1/1/2016,"Our friends decided that this is the place where we were going to spend New Year's eve 2015-16. West Village, corner place, tapas - what could go wrong? Well, the answer is: everything. Starting our reasonably priced ""dinner and dancing pre fix"" we were ushered to the coat check, where I almost had a tray of dishes land on me and my wife (close call, but he held on... somehow). After waiting at the front bar, coat check, back bar we were at our table for 11. Granted, the place was full, and our wait staff was busy, but at least 1 drink took almost an hour (we were still no more than 15 feet from the bar) and 4 reminders. The sangria I had was called Barcelona, and was good. Took a while, but good. We were seated not long after 9, so you'd figure that drinks, two tapas each and main course could not possibly take us to midnight, right? Wrong. There was another table about the same size as ours next to us and they also had the pre fix. There is probably a word limit here so I will get to it: the tapas were fine - I had the shrimp and the duck thing. The shrimp was fine, but not great. The duck was a blintz with meat paste in it (could've been duck) and sauce around it. I'm no stranger to a meat blintz, unfortunately, but this was not good. My friend had the oysters, and said that was very good. Now, for the piece de resistance: our seafood paella for two came in a bowl for 3, and the other side of the table got the same for 4. They mixed them up, but it was an easy fix - we just had to ship a half lobster across the long table with some other shellfish and not so flavorful rice. To say that THE LOBSTER WAS UNDERCOOKED is an understatement. I actually took a picture. I thought the claw was still moving. The shell was still mostly black (a properly cooked lobster is bright red, no need to google it). Ok, my friends knew that I cook lobster fairly regularly, so all eyes were on me. Took it like a champ, although my old shellfish allergy which I though I kicked flared up a bit (iodide, but if properly cooked there is no reaction), although I refused the Benadrill my friend had - it's just undercooked lobster, it went away after 30 minutes or so. Here is the kicker - at 11:50 I noticed no bottle of paid for champagne on our table or any others. Here come the glasses!... to the table next to us!!! Yes, these people forgot New Year's champagne on New Year's eve. I toasted a sangria on NYE 2016!

2.0,12/31/2015,"Food was average at best. Pretty mediocre and bland to be honest---far better tapas can be had in the city. Service was pretty awful. We arrive to a near-empty restaurant and it still takes us five minutes to be seated. Then the waiter forgot to bring us menus. Then we had to ask for water. We ask a simple question about the food---he doesn't know the answer and has to go back and check. Same thing with a question about the drink menu. Then, completely unprompted, he brings us our check but tells us that ""we can still chill there for awhile longer."" It's 10pm on a Friday night, mind you. Then when I put down my card, I'm told they don't accept AMEX (which though acceptable, is still a little bizarre for a West village restaurant). I give him my Visa, and he brings back the check....but with nothing for me to sign with. I ask for a pen, and he rolls his eyes at me! As we're leaving, no one says thank you or goodbye. To the restaurant's defense, the waiter may have been new, but (a) these are basics, restaurant service 101, and (b) if that was the case, they clearly shouldn't have let him serve a table by himself. Still, even if the service wasn't poor, I'd still only give the spot 3 stars at most due to the quality of the food.",0,0,0,Max S.,"Manhattan, NY",4,32,1

Okay back to Barraca. We were seated in the basement which was fine as the ambiance was a little romantic.  Our waiter was nice and chose the perfect sangria for our taste. I stuck with the one that had ginger in it. It was gooood, no like good good. I was expecting it to be a bit watered down, but it wasn't. I had to try the croquettes since reviews raved about them and they were good, however I'm a bit of a croquette snob and was at Vincents Cafe the night before and while Barracas were good they don't hold up to Vincent's. We also had the shrimp which was spicy and pretty good. For my entree I had the flat bread with pork sausage, egg and some other stuff...it was really good.

We were seated in the basement level of the restaurant when we arrived as all three of the floors seemed to be really busy.  The drink special they had was sangria unlimited for $15 and you could choose from a variety of them each time.  The sangria was good and the waiter was pretty attentive so we got drinks as needed.  My husband and I ordered the skirt steaks off the brunch menu and my sister had the burger.  My sisters boyfriend had the paella and we all really enjoyed our food.  The only complaint I had was that the level of the restaurant we were on was so loud we had a hard time hearing each other since it was almost a bar feel.  If you like that type of atmosphere this is a great place with good food!

They sat us next to a column with no head room, ok we'll over look this. The wait staff was very friendly which surprised me because of the door people and hey I hear the food is good: wrong. Very banal, tasteless Eggs Benedict with untoasted toasted english muffin, a tiny bit of salad (hey where is the spanish in this ""spanish"" restaurant?), the desert was rather off, a processed pudding thing with toast, the only good thing about this restaurant was the conversation with my friend.

The place was busy, I understand the rules, after 15 minutes table is lost, standard practice, fine.PROBLEM: Instead of providing a realistic time estimate of when we could be seated, the host commenced to saying we would be seated in 5-10 minutes, every 5-10 minutes for 40 minutes. YOUR ONLY JOB IS TO SEAT PEOPLE. Be professional and DO YOUR JOB. If we lost our table and we now are at the back of the waiting list, say the wait will be 40 minutes so we can grab drinks from the bar or make other plans as the place was full. No one wins by lying.DEAR MANAGEMENT, I do enjoy Barraca and have come several times for dinner and brunch with and without reservations. It would benefit both your patrons and establishment to have a host that can set proper expectations and structure a seating plan for a busy restaurant. Courtesy and professionalism should still be required in the hospitality industry, regardless of your location.IN GENERAL: Food is great, love the brunch and decor is lovely.

The menu is a typical Mexican brunch menu with incredible eggs benedict however the do not offer substitutes so bear that in mind. The atmosphere is pretty buzzing and loud which is the vibe you expect in west village.

Service was excellent as our waiter made sure our sangria glasses were never empty. And the sangria itself was great.My 3 star rating is based on what happened prior to our sitting down. I was in a 4 person group, and 3 of us were there by 1:07 for a 1:00pm reservation. Understandably, we weren't allowed to sit due to policy, which is fine (even though it would have been good customer service to seat us at that point). The key here is that the 2 hour special starts at your reservation time, not when you actually sit. When my whole group was ready to sit, the host had absolutely no sense of urgency to seat us. He just stood there waiting for another hostess to seat us, claiming that he couldn't leave the podium, even though i saw him do just that when I first got there. We were finally seated all the way down in the dark basement even though there were tables upstairs in the light. We asked the hostess that brought us down if we could sit upstairs, but got denied.

3.0,10/4/2015,"I had a brunch with 15 girls at Barraca today. We were seated on time and whisked away downstairs to the basement where they have plenty of seating for large parties. It was a little too dark and loud to my liking. I could barely hear my friends over the chatter of the other large parties, which isn't necessarily the restaurant's fault. However, it does not help to add loud music into the mix.                    On to the food and drinks. I thought there were a lot of interesting dishes on the menu and the prices were quite reasonable. Most of the entrees ranged from $11-13, the Sangrias were all $9. I'm not much of a drinker, so I skipped the $15 unlimited Sangria option.  For appetizers,  I recommend trying the Bacon wrapped dates w/ almond and blue cheese. It's a delicious mix of sweet and savory. As for my entrée, I have to say it was underwhelming. The chorizo was good, but the eggs and patatas bravas were bland. Also have to note that there wasn't much bacon in there. Probably best to exclude it from the dish altogether since it comes with two big pieces of Chorizo.As you probably know already, there's a vast selection of Sangria mixes to choose from. I prefer my drinks to be on the sweet side, so the waiter recommended The Rioja. I thought the service was pretty good for our table. It's a always a bit challenging servicing a large party like ours. They were very patient and we never felt rushed. It took us a while to settle in before we ordered our drinks and food and we hung out for a while after we had finished eating. Overall, I thought it was an okay experience.

I definitely won't return. Although they told us they don't seat parties until everyone had arrived, I watched the host break that policy multiple times... Except for us. Most of us arrived on time, but since it's New York City, two members of our party were inevitably late because their subway train had suspended service. The host told us we couldn't be seated until everyone arrived, which normally I would understand. Except that as we later ate our meal, I watched him seat other parties before everyone had arrived. SO infuriating. If you're going to implement a rule, do it for everyone. Or at least be better at lying. Also unbeknownst to me, bottomless drinks start at the time of your reservation. So not only were we not allowed to be seated, but they were essentially taking drinks that we paid for by cutting into our drinking time. Our two friends arrived 30 minutes late, which meant that our bottomless sangria only lasted an hour and a half. They wouldn't let us order from the bar, either, while we waited. I wouldn't have known about them cutting into our time limit, either, if I hadn't heard someone else ask the host the same question. Barraca is NOT at all transparent about their policies and it felt shady and deceptive to me. When we finally did get seated, they sat us in the BASEMENT. Literally in a dark basement in the corner in a table that was too big for our party. When I complained, the host offered no remedy and told us ""we have service down here."" I told him that I would like to be seated upstairs, since it was bright and felt like a nicer brunch environment than a dingy basement. He acted like he didn't care at all and walked away. Our waiter was very nice, except I swear he only came by two or three times all meal (including the time he took our orders). That is totally unacceptable at a bottomless brunch. Another waiter refilled our drinks more times than our own waiter did.Food was decent, nothing to write home about. The breakfast flatbread was very good and so were the eggs benedict, but the French toast was dry and the steak and eggs came with only one egg. The sangria was also very watery and it wasn't true sangria. I can tell that there hasn't been fruit soaking and they just throw everything together morning-of.Overall, deceptive policies (that they don't enforce for everyone) lead to our group feeling cheated and slighted.

We do understand cockroaches run rampant in this very clean city of ours, but I can't exactly say I've seen a 2 inch monster bug in other restaurants. Our server was very apologetic and asked if we wanted to switch tables. This didn't seem necessary, as the bug was killed, and let's be honest, if there is 1 roach, there are others. We asked if they would comp the carafe of sangria we had ordered and he said it would be up to his manager. Manager, Lorenzo said ""I'm really sorry, but this is New York City."" There was no offer of reconciliation, besides asking us if we wanted to move our table.With that, we paid for (and drank) our Valencia sangria-which was yummy- and left. We took our business elsewhere and had a great time in another restaurant, without incident.",2,2,1,Jessica L.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,3,0

5.0,9/12/2015,"Amazing! Finally, I found the perfect place to eat my food. I have been looking for a Spaniard place where they conserve the flavor from Spain. Barraca is the most amazing, cozy and fantastic Spaniard restaurant. The food is incredible. Especially, the croquettes, octopus ( with MoJo Picon sauce from Canarias Island) something that I couldn't believe, that flavor in NYC. No words to explain! But we got a situation, the manager listened my accent and he got close to the table and ask us if we we were from Spain so then he started to ask about what we think about the food, the texture, the flavor and also that we can be honest with him saying something they could be better. I was honest and I told him this place was the best I ate my food in NYC. He said to us, if we need something to make feel us more comfortable. Just let him know Thanks Jonathan for your hospitality, your way to treat us yesterday and for sure we will be coming back at least once per week. I recommend this place 100%.

2.0,8/31/2015,"First I can say the red sangria was very tasty and just had one glass (so didn't enjoy their 2 hour unlimited sangria) and this is the reason they were upgraded to two stars. I can't say they did anything really wrong, place looks great, service was fine, and the reason we stopped here was because the food we saw at the outside dining looked excellent. Well if you like super greasy oily food then this might be your place. The kale salad had a soup of oil, the super fried potatoes came with a thick frosting of mayonnaise on top of a rich tomato oil on the bottom, and the burger (very juicy) had a slather of mayo or butter all over the roll. This being said if you plan accordingly and decide to try it for yourself, know to council these items out when ordering, you might be able to enjoy your meal here.

4.0,8/28/2015,"I came here a few weeks ago for dinner during Restaurant Week with a friend of mine. I think I actually found this place cruising through Instagram and had it on my mind when going through the list of this summer's participants. I arrived a little ahead of my friend, so I snagged a table on the spacious sidewalk under their charming awning and was seated right at the tail end of happy hour. This place knocks it out of the park for happy hour. $5 for tapas and loads of creative, unique variations of sangria. This is THE place to come for happy hour with your girlfriends. When I read over the happy hour menu I couldn't quite believe my eyes, since usually happy hour only usually includes the stuff you shouldn't even pay full price for.RW definitely either leaves you stuffed or still hungry, but this is was certainly the former. First course was a choice of a tapas, me with the patatas bravas and my friend with the pan con tomate. Both were excellent. The patatas made for an excellent presentation and were delicious, crispy on the outside and soft and tender on the inside, with enough aioli to make it a little more substantial and add flavor, but not too much that the sauce over takes the dish. The pan con tomate was fresh with crisp bread, well balanced flavor on top.For our main, Barraca featured a selection of paella the way I feel paella should be done. It's a let down when a ""seafood"" paella only features shrimp. To me, there should always be a mixture, but I see the single kind so many times that I feel I'm somehow in the minority. So I was elated when I saw the seafood paella with shrimp, clams, mussels, cuttlefish and lobster. It was a hearty portion, with bright yellow saffron rice that had a beautiful slight bit of crisp to it. My friend had the vegetable paella and as she asked, they were kind enough to throw in some shrimp to that as well. What's great is the split pan the paella is served in, allowing a smaller batch of a complicated dish and happier tables of friends who can't agree.For some reason, for the past few weeks, as I write these RW reviews, I struggle to remember dessert. What seems to happen is that the dessert is usually some kind of chocolate mousse, with maybe some bit of cream to accompany it, either in the form of whipped or ice cream. Then again, I've never really had a bad dessert. The inside of the restaurant is charming. Not on the terribly large side, but not a tiny bistro either. Perfect for date night or a catch up dinner with girlfriends. Not unreasonably priced for non-RW either. I'd definitely come back and recommend.",1,0,0,Jen C.,"New York, NY",162,193,165

The service though...I mean I absolutely cannot get over it!When dining out with more than 10 ppl...be prepared to not always get your way. Although I prepared for that, there was absolutely no need. We almost always bet that once the drinks are unlimited for brunch we'll probably only get about 4 drinks in during our allotted time. ON A GOOD NOTE, I may have gotten in one too many. That explains why I lost my keys this day and also the rest of my life. It was a great time...I definitely loved the service. Our waiters were bringing around drinks before we even asked, refilling our waters to make sure we don't get too dehydrated, and asked us if there's anything else that we needed so much that we started to just make sh*t up. YES, I NEED YOU TO TELL OTHER WAITERS HOW TO BE ATTENTIVE BECAUSE YOU'RE ACING THIS TEST. I'm a sucker for great service. To top it off the music was great!

The Tapas are extensive and range in price from $6-20, a lot where more around the $6-12 range and the seafood tapas were on the higher end. The patatas bravas were a super simple dish of home fries with a spicy tomato mayo but was very delicious. Other good small plates were the croquetas, pulpo, and albondigas. They also have great charcuterie options so of course order one of the jamons.

3.0,7/29/2015,"Alright, so, decided to give Barraca another go with a friend for restaurant week. I really wanted them to wow me this time so I could update my review with 4 or 5 stars. I mean, the location is perfect (adorable Greenwich village), the restaurant is big yet moody, and who doesn't love a good glass of wine with paella? Alas, Barraca is doing a lot of things wrong. 3 stars remain.Service: We ordered the restaurant week menu with the wine pairing, except it took 10 minutes after we received our appetizers for the wine to arrive. We had to actually flag down our waiter to remind him we ordered the wine pairing. This is a Wednesday night, by the way. I would be more understanding if it were a Friday, but, come on. Food: The appetizers themselves were good, though my croquetas arrived luke warm and were cold by the time the wine arrived. The valenciana paella was flavorful but the rabbit pieces were very tough and, as another reviewer noted, mostly bone. The seafood paella was also flavorful but BOTH paellas were undercooked! I know it's hard to make a paella that's both tender AND has crunchy bits on the bottom, but Barraca is supposed to be known for its paella mastery. I expected more. The chocolate dessert was very good but the flan was just bland.Overall, I won't be back anytime soon. Maybe for a casual glass of wine if I'm nearby, but that's about it.",2,0,0,Shannon G.,"Brooklyn, NY",213,311,69

French toast is not worth trying - dry, cold, and flavorless, but the savory brunch plates are good. If you can sit outside it is an awesome place to people watch and enjoy the weather.

5.0,7/6/2015,"We went here for brunch with a large group of interns, about 14 of us, and all had excellent reviews. A majority had the bottomless sangria for $15, there were 7 different flavors and each came individualized in your own mason jar glass, making it easy to customize your order and not have to share a pitcher with the table. Each flavor had a variety of ingredients and flavors, displayed in cute jugs over the bar that the waiters would quickly poor from when you were ready for your next. We had heard there was a 2 hour time limit on the deal but we stayed for longer and there were no issues. The decor was spanish with a rustic, nautical feel. The dark wood and bright orange and blue accents were lovely in the summer with the large windows open to the street behind us. For food, we ordered just about everything on the menu and it all looked amazing! The pancakes were decked with bright berries and they did not skimp out on them! Other than the pancakes though, everyone else got savory meals which made up almost the entirety of the brunch menu. The favorite by far was the vegetable flatbread, you could smell it coming from the kitchen and it looked beautiful with the sunny side up egg on top and was quite large for one person (allowing many of us to be able to taste it). I had the huevos con bacon y patatas bravas which was extremely tasty. From the sauce on the potatoes to the crispy bacon to the eggs nicely dressed in greens, the whole thing was a masterpiece. I had such a hard time deciding between that and the kale flatbread, but am glad that I will have to go back to try the other!Only downside was that it took a longgg time to pay as they couldn't do individual checks but that's what happens when you come with a large group I suppose.",1,0,0,Katelyn W.,"Boston, MA",1,26,21

Its slightly disappointing. The quality of the food hasn't changed but I am disappointed in the quantity. The service is still excellent and so is the atmosphere.

We were seated close to a large, loud, likely inebriated group.Now I understand that it's a Saturday, but when the street full of traffic is more quiet than the inside of a restaurant, it's not a good time at all.Since we ordered paella and knew it would take 35-40 minutes, we asked to be moved to an outside table when one opened up. Not an unreasonable request, since at this point we only had water and one glass of sangria on our table.We kindly explained that the large group was really killing our experience, and that we did not want to spend almost an hour listening to women shrieking at each other across the table. While we waited for our food.FIRST our server replies that ""it's way louder outside"" - REALLY, DUDE? Because A) that's rude and B) we just came from outside, we know how loud it is.THEN, after ""checking with the hostess"" he told us that we could move when a table cleared. Fast forward 10 minutes: There are now TWO tables available outside and our server walks by repeatedly, avoiding eye contact. The drunkards are at least ten decibels louder.Minutes later, we are approached by another employee, who asks if everything is ok (manager?). We explain that we have requested to be moved outside and we now see two tables available. He responds with a ""let me go check"" then proceeds to NOT CHECK ANYTHING. We watched this happen.After waiting another 10 minutes, with BOTH of these employees passing our table multiple times, we decide to leave.The restaurant wasn't busy, our request was not unreasonable, and it's a damn shame, because we had been talking about going there all day.

Unfortunately Barraca reinforced all the negative stereotypes I had a about Spanish food before tasting the real thing. Every dish was heavy, greasy, and overloaded with garlic. The ""homemade"" olives were soaked in lemon juice and spongy. The mushrooms topped with a fried egg, were almost impossible to eat -- drowned in oil and burning with garlic. The patatas bravas were grease bombs with a spicy pimenton sauce on the bottom and a garlic ajillo on the top. Just a few bites and my palate was crying for mercy.On the other hand, the sangria was bland and watery. A variety of white and red options are offered, and I had the Mancha.

In fact, someone only came because I had approached the host to send someone. So, word u of advice to Barraca...pay attention to your customers dining alone since we are often there for a reason and are repeat customers often bringing others with us.

So after we left Buddha Nails and Spa(II), I decided to grab a bite before heading to work. Because I'm not super keen on the dining scene of the area I opted to try a walk in as opposed to heading somewhere we're familiar with. Enter Barraca, a restaurant on the corner that looks pretty discreet from outside and was very homy upon entrance. Also, I must note this was in the day at around lunchtime.   Barraca has a very homey Latin feel as evidenced by the decor of exposed bricks and dim lighting. It was 2 days post V-Day so they still had cool little hearts hanging from the ceiling also. We were welcomed by a young lady who greeted us with a smile and seated us promptly. She was very polite and I wish I could recall her name. We were then promptly welcomed by a gentlemen who fully explained the menu; how the ordering works. It was lunch tapas prix fixe and (believe it) my first time dining in such a manner. There were items appealing to me on the menu unavailable (for whatever reason) so we made due.   I ordered us both the ""Sopa De Calabaza"" which consists of butternut squash soup, cumin, and orange. Oh my, it was delicious! My parents are of Haitian descent so I'm quite familiar with squash soup but this took the cake! For entree we had the ""Paella Del Dia"" which was the paella of the day. It was a huge portion which served two. I've never had paella before and it sure was interesting. It consisted of quinoa, shrimp, lobster, and mussels with corn and red peppers. I'm. It a huge seafood buff, however it was very satiating and different. For dessert she opted for the Tres Leches which was so good and I believe I had the Cana de Cabra Cheescake which was deliciously decadent and satiating as well!   My server was very pleasant and I enjoyed the cuisine and prompt service. There's not too much on the menu to choose from which makes it concise as opposed to being overwhelming just to order. The food is satiating.

4.0,3/13/2015,"I was excited when they were getting ready to open a couple years ago because the exterior and décor looked so appealing.   I visited for happy hour and lunch in the first couple months of opening and was really disappointed by the lack of organization and below-average food.  Since I walk by this place almost every day, I used to stare wistfully and wish it had done a better job of making me want to return.  HOWEVER, I had the opportunity to unexpectedly have dinner there this week and WOW, what a tremendous shift.  It's improved 1000% ....I think some people who frequent this area may remember the first few months of it's opening and haven't gone back so they have no idea of the vast improvement.  Barraca changed their chef and manager, and they've done a great job about changing what needed adjustment.   The menu is small and well curated...which is always a hallmark of smart executive-cheffing.  The ingredients were top quality and well selected.  Most of all, super authentic and fairly priced.  The croquetas reminded me of eating in northern Spain, the paella (contrary to what some other reviewers think, it's not burned, the bottom layer that sticks to the pan is a delicacy known as soccarat and it's done on purpose) was very fresh and delicious (which can't be said for 90% of the paellas to be had in Manhattan).  Good, tight, selection of wines and sangrias, cocktails, etc.   If you want a genuine northern-spain style experience, with a little paella thrown in, this is the place.    I hope they let everyone know that there have been changes, for the better.  I have a feeling the locals have no idea.",3,1,1,Estilomina P.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,139,0

The decorating and lighting within the restaurant gives it a cozy affect (which is perfect for this weather right now) but it also still maintains a modern look. The sangria lined up at the bar was a nice visual affect as well. My friends and I ordered the Valencia and Castilla sangria, both red and incredibly good. We each got Corquetas de Jamon and Chorizo for tapas and a plate of the Mariscos paella. The paella was HUGE, could easily split between three people and go in for seconds or thirds - and it was DELICIOUS! Definitely reminded me of my time abroad in Spain, just as good. In general, the overall vibe of this place is really nice - the host and waiters were friendly and welcoming, the other diners within the restaurant were also chill and relaxed, didn't give off that snotty NYC attitude.So happy we went here and I cannot wait to go back and recommend it to other people!",0,0,0,Olivia M.,"New York, NY",0,12,2

It is a fish salad but the romesco dressing and fresh anchovies and tuna together with frisee salad worked so well and the bed of smashed tomato made whole thing to shine. I've never had this Spanish salad and I am very happy that my first was with Barraca. Ensalada de Mercado ($11)- it is a shredded kale salad with a snowy cheese on top. The shredded kale was thinly cut that made so easy to eat. Even those hard leaves were massaged or lightly cooked, the kale is a tough leave but this way made sense. I'll recreate at home.  Bombas ($10/2)- it is different from Japanese croquette, creamy inside and crunchy outside, but it was good. What impressed me was those two dipping sauces. I think blanco one was homemade mayo and the other one was that mayo with some kicks. Pulpo a la Plancha ($16)- these grilled octopus legs were cooked to perfection. It was not chewy, moist and soft. They were well seasoned. It came with small panfried roast potato and they were also good.Carne a la Brasa ($19)- The hanger steak was cooked to perfection. We wanted medium and they were even for delivery. Sadly it was not memorable. If you decide to get this dish and octopus dish, you will ended up with, more than you want of, that potato.

5.0,1/1/2015,"This restaurant is by far one of the BEST Spanish spots in NYC. Aside from the ambiance and decor, the food was amazing. Not really sure why it has such low ratings, but I read some reviews and it seems like there has been a pattern of bad service. Before I get into the details of why I had a wonderful experience here i just wanted to address the fact that the service was impeccable. Not only did our waiter cater to us, but other waiters did as well. There was round the clock service so for service alone I would give 5 stars. Sometimes people walk into a restaurant in a shitty mood and then everything following is bad, perhaps that was the reason as to why certain people felt the service wasn't up to par. Of course if you come on a holiday it may be a little hectic so be patient as you wait 5 minutes to get seated as opposed to the moment you come. Not that big of a deal. Maybe management changed too or maybe they read some of the reviews and decided to work on their service. Regardless it was great and I was just here a week ago.I love their different options for Sangria. We got the Sangria Rioja which is the original kind and even that was so much fresher than I've ever had. It was the perfect balance of ingredients, sometimes sangria can be a lot stronger which doesn't always tastes good. If you want to get drunk than drink wine alone or take shots, but if you want to try a great sangria than come to barraca. We got a pitcher and it was just magical.Jamon Serrano and Monchego Cheese: We ordered both to begin with and boy do they give you your moneys worth. The jamon was really great and they gave you a good amount of slices. It came with a piece of bread with sliced tomatoes kind of like bruschetta which had an amazing flavor. The monchego came with large grapes and nuts. Really great start to our evening. The ""Patatas Bravas"" were phenomenal! In a traditional Spanish recipe they use an alioli sauce which is like a garlic mayo and they mix it with a hot tomato sauce. Barraca's tomato sauce was more like a bbq sauce and its flavor was so good. I've never tasted an order of patatas this way. I was very happy and I typically don't comment on food when I am eating.Everyone was raving about the ""Bombas,"" those really are great as well. They are like croquettes filled with meat, but the Barraca also added that bbq sauce on top which really gave them that impeccable flavor. I was very pleased and wanted more.We ended our meal with an order of the ""Mariscos Paella"" which was probably top 3 out of all of the paellas I've ever eaten. It stands next to my mother in law who uses a her old Spanish family recipe, hers is the best. The second was a paella I cooked at a cooking class in Barcelona with a chef. So yeah... it's pretty up there. I read some of the comments people made about the paella and I just wanted to make a note that no matter where you go every paella is different and everyone has their own recipe. There are countless ways to make it but I must say Barracas just tasted so fresh. I personally love when the rice sticks to the pan, it was a good mix of wet and dry (sometimes people make it too wet and the consistency doesn't always equal good taste). I've never tried a paella with string beans and that really added to the great flavor. Every ingredient in Mariscos balanced the taste and helped give me and my family a wonderful paella experience. I've eaten at some of the top rated Spanish restaurants here in the city. My other favorite spot is Boqueria which is a little pricer but still great. I've been to Socarrat which people say has the best paella. I would have to disagree and say that Barraca's is by far the better paella and additionally you really get your moneys worth on every dish as opposed to a few crumbs for the same price. I also just love that the chef is actually a spaniard. I don't want to hate on other establishments, but I definitely hope that others will have the same spanish experience as i did.

3.0,11/6/2014,"We went to Barraca for dinner with friends last March. I know, it took me forever to complete this review! Luckily I took notes.  It was restaurant week and I'd been craving tapas for awhile. We basically ordered everything on the restaurant week menu since there were six of us. We tried the following items:Tortilla de Patatas - It was good, but lacked a little seasoningPatatas Bravas - I loved the sauceCroquetas de Jamon - Pretty good, not greatGambas al Ajillo - These were really goodDatiles Con Bacon - I heard these are good, but I didn't try these.Bombas - My favorite of the tapas. We also tried the three paellas they offer and the Vegetable paella was my favorite of the three. While I didn't love the food here, it was good. I'm not sure I would go again, but we did enjoy our time there. The atmosphere was good, it was clean and the service was good. They also have a decent sangria selection. I was 9 months pregnant at the time, so I was unable to try it. Those that did, said it was really good.",2,1,2,Irene V.,"New York, NY",406,132,121

We were seated in the back, away from the noise which I rather enjoyed, however because we were in a separate room we were not waited on as frequently as we should have been and our waiter checked out twenty-five minutes early for his break. We sat there waiting for twenty-five more minutes for the short girl to ring us up. Barraca offers a $15 unlimited sangria bar for two hours, I passed, but I had a sip of one that begins with an ""r"", it was good. Now for my meal...first things first they ran out of the burgers...which is dumb. I settled for one of the sandwiches and opted for both the fries and salad as sides. I am huge on good fries and these weren't bad, I didn't want that weird buttery tasting white sauce though. The sandwich had peppers in it, which did absolutely nothing for the sandwich, all it did was give me trouble biting into it. My friends said the churros were good, the custard thing had huge chocolate chunks of what I am assuming are cookies...those were not good, but the custard was alright, pretty sweet.

It's huge so definitely a dish to share. The wait staff was also incredibly friendly and very knowledgable on the menu. They have us some great suggestions.

Male servers were inattentive, rude, and acted like they were doing us a favor by coming to the table. I guess they only work hard for tables of six. Only helpful person was the hard-working woman whom they left to bus tables, and bring things they forgot or were too lazy to bring. She felt bad and kept asking if everything was OK. I asked a waiter for olives at 8:15. Got said olives at 8:55. No one seemed to know what happened to the really-tough-to-make olive order.  My friend arrived and asked for bread. Waiter: ""We don't have bread."" Her: ""What do you mean?"" Waiter: ""We only serve bread with the cheese."" OK, I get it - you want to make more money. So he finally brings some bread after 30 mins (someone must have told him to get to work) and it was stale! FU very much.  We ordered the paella. It arrived 45 mins later and was served like prison food: dried out rice a roni with chunks of chicken and a few pea pods. Burned on the sides, tasteless, sad looking and WTF did I pay $25/per person for? This place is a HUGE rip off, trading on their location. Fool me once.",1,0,1,emma r.,"Chicago, IL",0,32,0
4.0,9/18/2014,"I've been to Barraca 4 times in 6 months so feel I can honestly review them. Firstly the food is amazing - the shrimp, the brocollini, the bravas, the lamb meatballs especially! The first time I came here I walked in with a friend and were seated right away - having been here a few times now I see that was a rarity - they're usually very busy. The lady at the front desk is very professional and always has a smile - which is rare for a NYC restaurant! The atmosphere is great. The last time I dined here was for my boyfriend's birthday and we had to book a late table because of our schedule, so I was worried that not getting there til 10 would mean a lacklustre atmosphere, but the place was still pumping. We were one of the last tables to leave sometime after midnight and didn't feel pushed out. The cocktails are delicious especially the one that has sage in it, can't remember what it's called - although you sometimes have to wait for them. The second time I went here with some girlfriends I had to keep reminding our server about our drinks. The wait staff are good in general, there are a couple that are great, and one or two that aren't so great - it's pretty easy to see who is who.On a whole I would recommend Barraca to anyone wanting excellent tapas and a great night out. There are so many bars around it that if you have to wait for a table you can easily go and get a drink somewhere and come back.

The tapas were average and the paella was terrible. We ordered a vegetarian one and one with chicken. They were both very dry and low in salt.

Forgetting the two spacey hostesses, we ordered and got on with our meal. I ordered the croquetas de jamón which were amazing, she got gambas al ajillo, they looked ok but they had nothing on the croquetas. We ordered a pitcher of Sangria which was nice, fruity and light. (I make a mean Sangria at home do I'm very particular about it). The desserts, nata con fruta for me and brazo gitano for her were also great. Sadly what should have been the highlight of the night was the greatest disappointment! The marisco (seafood) paella was a total fiasco. The rice was undercooked and the seafood dry, almost rubber like. I had many a paella including the real thing in several spots in Spain and this one will definitely go down as one of the worst. I really wanted to like it, I liked everything else in the restaurant!

4.0,7/1/2014,"Although I'm an avid Yelper, I had never heard of this place and stumbled upon it while I was talking a walk around the neighborhood with my friend. Barraca reaffirms my belief that any corner restaurant in the West Village is bound to be standout one. Their extensive collection of creative sangrias was definitely a huge draw--we ordered a refreshing lavender champagne one. However, what blew us away was their ""Negra"" paella. Not only was it visually striking--pitch black arborio rice (served in the warm pan in which it had been cooking) studded with vibrant pieces of seafood and artichoke--but the rice had that perfect crunchy char that you find in bibimbap. Their appetizers were also intriguing although we only had the wild mushrooms with a fried egg--simple in concept but powerfully earthy in flavor. The only complaint that I had was the service. Our waiter was a pompadoured French guy (not stereotyping I promise) who was more obsessed with himself (and basking in the compliments that another table was heaping on him) than serving his tables. He messed up our orders, lingered at the aforementioned table instead of checking up on his other tables, and was too scared to ask politely the other table from smoking in the dining area.

BUT...The sangria happy hour was I think $20 a pitcher and the carafe rather was small. NOT GOOD. Secondly we can only choose 1 of 2 flavors. The first one (don't remember the name) was weak. I told the waiter and he commented that this was not vodka or hard liquor, like I don't know what sangria should taste like and further implying I am a lush. That comment pissed me off, but I coolly let him know that I make Sangria all the time and know what it should taste like. He brought me another one and it was way better (I think Mango was in it) and it was no additional charge. Then I ordered bacon and dates. They first one was great! I ordered another and it was burned. Like to a crisp... why did they bring this to my table? Anyway, I had to send that back. I ordered home fries and while they were ok, they lacked flavor.

4.0,6/25/2014,"IN SHORT: Authentic Spanish tapas and exemplary sangrias combine to make an ideal menu for both brunch and dinner, a feat not easily accomplished by a restaurant. On the weekends, everyone should be able to justify the $15 bottomless sangria, one of the best deals around.THE STORY: Barraca is one of my local favorites whenever I'm craving tapas. The seasonal flatbread is the largest portioned main, with kale, Mahon cheese, caramelized onions, raisins, pinenuts, and a lightly fried farm egg on top in the winter, and a selection of grilled vegetables and goat cheese in the summer. The Patatas Bravas, however, really stand out in the classic tapas repertoire. Think crispy potato home fries with a spicy aioli for the Spanish twist. The Croquetas de Jamon (little bundles of ham croquettes) are also perfectly fried on the outside while hot and creamy on the inside. Barraca's menu consistently shows off unique combinations of Spanish ingredients that I just can't seem to find anywhere else for the price.Now let's talk about the sangria, because I know I'll keep returning to Barraca for this very reason. While I imagine that the quality of sangria is inversely related to a restaurant's offering of bottomless brunch, this is certainly not the case for Barraca. The Sangrio Rioja with red wine, Aperol, guindilla pepper, and cherry liqueur is the restaurant's most popular offering, for very good reason. Simultaneously sweet and spicy, with just the right balance of fruity apple and peach notes that mask any dryness of the wine, many could claim a pitcher of this juice all to themselves. Served just barely chilled, it's a necessary refreshing addition to brunch or dinner.",1,1,1,Ali M.,"New York, NY",31,234,245

Strike 2 We dined at your restaurant a couple of weeks ago and sat outside.  We ordered a number of tapas and plates as well as sangria. Everything was very good and brought out in a timely matter. Overall our dining experience was pleasant except at the end. A server was clearing the table when accidentally he knocked over a full glass of red sangria all over my husband. His shirt and shorts are now ruined. When we arrived back to the table from the bathroom (trying to clean it all up) no one had even attempted to clean up the chair and table which was covered still with fruit, ice and sangria.  I sat the cleaning it up and all they did was bring one glass of sangria over (replacing the one that was knocked over). I find it odd that a restaurant would not even 1) attempt to clean up the mess that was made so the guest could sit back down  2) offer to at least pay for dry cleaning and/or a new shirt and shorts since clearly they are ruined  AND / OR 3) Offer some sort of deduction of bill, a comp of drinks or portion of the bill. I have worked in the service industry before and the way this was handled or rather not handled at all was in poor taste. Believe me, I understand that these things happen and understand that the server was obviously upset (hence not coming back to the table to give us the check or clean up the mess) and would never want to see anyone get in trouble over this. But I would hope that at least an establishment like yours would have offered to attempt to pay for dry cleaning or replacement of the items ruined. Heck, even a dessert sent over would have been a nice gesture. I hope in the future your staff would handle a situation in a better manner.

There were some really weird flavor combinations in the meat-based dish that just didn't do it.2) Service was terrible. There were a handful of tables taken, and they sat us all next to each other. And the table that sat next to us, after we sat, had their orders both taken and delivered first.3) Why restaurant week? And why is this place so expensive?

It's a 2 hour unlimited sangria bar and honestly it tastes so great and goes down so easy you will be in trouble if you don't pace yourself and drink water in between glasses. They're generous, but take care of yourself. The food is amazing. Their Spanish tortilla inspired me again to make one myself and I reminded myself again afterwards as to why I stick to buying them out. The pan tomate was the best I've ever had, better than the ton I had while living in Spain. So fresh, so crispy, so amazingly delicious. This is my favorite brunch spot now, my new obsession.

I had the Eggs Benedict with Serrano Ham.  My eggs were slightly over-cooked and I didn't really enjoy the Serrano Ham.  It didn't do anything for the flavor or texture of the dish.  Next time I'll order something else.  The menu was limited for us because we had the UD Perk, and judging from the rest of the reviews, some of the other menu options would be much more enjoyable.Now, onto the sangria!  They offer about 7 different varieties.  I tried the Valencia and the Riojo.  They were both delicious!  The Riojo was a little on the dry side, so if that's not your thing I wouldn't order it.  The Valencia was very refreshing and packed a punch!  Our servers were friendly and attentive.  We spent the entire two hours hanging out and enjoying our sangria.  No one made us feel rushed or unwelcome.",1,0,0,Maggie H.,"Savannah, GA",119,369,85

For instance, the tables and chairs outside are made of cheap metal and they're always scraping them around to rearrange them as they seat people. Imagine sitting in this fake Spanish Tapas restaurant for 90 minutes and every 20 minutes or so the staff come by and create this screaming metal on concrete sound right next to you for 5-7 minutes. Haha! And the staff do it totally unselfconsciously...I think. It could be passive aggressive because you're thinking, ""Seriously, you need to adjust the placement of those tables and chairs inch by ear piercing careful inch but I had to ask you eight times for silverware for my girlfriend and for some water?""Tapas is definitely their gimmick not their passion, nothing signature or outstanding. And after our first round they didn't ask us if we wanted a second course (we did). But wait! More funny waitstaff hijinks to entertain you before you give up waiting and go looking for your long lost waiter with the fake Spanish accent...the bus staff came by and reset our table but then immediately came back and took all our plates away and put them on the table next to us! Whoops! Ha ha! So rude!Probably a sign, as we ordered the next round after finding a (our?) waiter chilling way in the back of the restaurant and when our food finally came we instantly regretted it. We got the seafood sopas and the mussels were so bad they literally smelled like poop. Really smelled. REALLY smelled. We waited for the waiter to come by to tell him (or anyone for that matter) and then gave up and had to bring it up front to the maître de. I mean people walking by on the sidewalk were holding their noses.They were kind enough to not make us pay for it. Thanks Barraca, so generous and classy. And then must have thought maybe they should do something more after having served four patrons something that smelled like fecal matter because as we were trying to pay and leave they kept asking if I (singular) wanted a free glass of wine. Actually not irredeemable if you avoid the shellfish and you're willing to take periods of your service into your own hands, don't be bashful. A bit overpriced for all that, place probably won't last.-Mark",1,0,0,Mark C.,"New York, NY",54,13,0

We desperately wanted tapas and they had all the staples - from bacon wrapped dates to pan con tomate. Croquetas could have been a little warmer and a bit more moist, and the sangria was a bit sweet.

My friends and I had dinner here last night. We enjoyed a bunch of tapas that we split. The lamb meatballs were spectacular. The bacon wrapped dates were a hit and the grilled calamari was delicious.

4.0,4/30/2014,"Came here for brunch and had a great time; particularly thanks to the assortment of inventive and well-executed sangrias, which are worth returning for in their own right.The brunch menu was relatively small, but everything came out pretty good. The Eggs Benedict comes with poached eggs that are actually *NOT* overcooked, which honestly shocks me, as overcooking eggs seems to be the norm these days. The sausage flatbread (coca de butifarra) was delicious, and big enough for two to split. The patatas bravas are decent breakfast potatoes, but will leave anybody expecting authentic Spanish patatas bravas sorely disappointed. To be fair, most Spanish joints are disappointing there as well. Patatas bravas are the french fries of Spain: everybody's got em, and they're very rarely *bad*, but the truly delicious ones are few and far between.Our server was helpful, funny, and friendly, but service in general was slooooooooow. Probably partly because this place is huge for New York, with roughly a billion tables. I'd recommend ordering another sangria as soon as your first one is brought to you, for instance, because the cups are small and it took us a solid 15-20 minutes for a drink order to be delivered. We asked for salt, pepper, and extra napkins FOUR times, taking upwards of half an hour. That kind of spoiled the experience: it's just disheartening to ask and be told ""of course! I'll be right back with that!"" and then have your server disappear for ten minutes, and then return without any of those things, and then also have that happen three more times. As the salt came in a little bowl of sea salt and the pepper came in a giant grinder we had to give back immediately, obviously they just don't ""do"" salt and pepper, but I kind of wish they'd just told us that, or told us that it would be a while, instead of peppily repeating they'd get that for us in ""just one moment.""Still, excellent sangria and solid food for reasonable prices, good service apart from the speed.",2,0,0,Danny F.,"Seattle, WA",84,107,4

I only wish the potatoes were cut a bit smaller and that the dish was a couple of dollars less (I mean when the entrees are only a couple of bucks more on average, it seems a bit exorbitant). For my main, I had the ""Coca de Kale"" - the most DELECTABLE flatbread I have had to date. The bread was chewy and crispy at the same time and held up well to the finger-licking toppings of kale, Mahon cheese, caramelized onions, and pine nuts.* The whole thing was topped with a farm fresh egg cooked over easy. I usually don't even like runny eggs, but the yolk was delicious as it ran through the flatbread - I could definitely tell they used a quality egg. I was also expecting this at $10 to be a rather small entree, but was pleasantly surprised to see it was as big as a personal pizza and just as filling!But the best thing about Barraca is their SEVEN different kinds of sangria - ALL of which are included in the $15 AYCD option. I only got to sample one, but it was strong and absolutely delicious!The only reason for the one star detraction, was that their service game could've been upped a little. It seemed like we were forever trying to get somebody's attention for a sangria top-up and when we finally did, the drink took longer than we would've liked to arrive.

As we sat down, the waiter was already coming to us to fill up our water glasses. He gave us great recommendations for the food and the sangria. We got the brussel sprouts, croquetas de jamon, and coca de kale. All three was delicious! But if I had to choose a favorite ti would be  croquetas de jamon. The croquetas were so savory and juicy. Hmmm, I'm getting hungry just thinking about how yummy they were! The Sangria was great in terms of how not-so-sweet we wanted it but it was not strong enough. At the end of dinner, we were surprised with complimentary dessert!The ambiance is more on a classy side: It's a really nice venue with candle lit tables and fancy lights for decorations. Definitely a place for a nice romantic dinner date or a classy birthday dinner. Now who really made the customer service exceptional is the manager of the restaurant, Joe. During dinner, he approached us to ask how our experience was. After we told him how great the food was, he offered to take us to a speakeasy that is connected to the restaurant after we were done with dinner. The speakeasy is hidden downstairs. It was playing great music and was dimly lit. Joe introduced us to our server Ana. We told her what kind of drink we want and she made it perfect. I ordered a whiskey and ginger on a not-so-sweet side and my roommate got whiskey and lemon that is a little sweetened. The drinks came out great! And Ana was super friendly.

4.0,3/30/2014,"Courtesy of urbandaddy a group of girlfriends and myself trekked over to this west village tapas location for some yummy brunch and unlimited sangrias. Let's be honest here - who doesn't like unlimited sangria? Even better - sangria in little mason jars with handles. #winAt first glance - you would think it is a small restaurant but a walk around the corner inside and it opens up beautifully into an open space with tables and chairs for more seating arrangements. It was great that we sat in the closed off end because it was less people and not as loud as the front area. They advertise 7 different types of sangria but when we were there our waitress told us they had ran out and there were only a few. The male waiters were definitely better and seemed a lot more fun - they came around more often to refill our cups and even suggested us mixing the sangrias. We were more than happy to oblige. For our brunch options we all chose the steak since it seemed to be the most worth it from our voucher. Most of the other brunch options didn't really have any meat substance in it. I wouldn't mind coming back to order their cheaper brunch entrees and order the unlimited sangria which is $15 (I believe) more. Totally worth it if you are a drinker. We also ordered the patatas bravas as extra munchies with our food. In our opinion the sangria was strong - we felt a great buzz after our 2nd jar.

Why bother?  When bored people who don't really know or love food open restaurants, this is what you get.The food was good but not great, nothing challenging or unusual on the menu.Large quibble: stingy with the bread, even when I asked for more.Small quibbles: The brussels sprouts had a deep layer of alioli on the bottom, that gunked up the otherwise tasty dish.  Weird choice.  And the short rib special was not served hot enough.Decor: innocuouos, nothing spanish or cozy going on. Generic restaurant with small bar.  Weird 20's flapper-jazz music (think of Triplettes of Belleville song) didn't add to the ambiance. Drinks: house cocktail and sangria were delicious, no complaints there, but oddly they could have sold me more alcohol if the server had noticed my drink was empty and offered another.  Don't they want to make money?Hostess: wore too much perfume and I was still smelling it after she left and I was drinking my water.Overall, spent 90 bucks on two drinks and 4 tapas, and left feeling, meh, I've experienced better, and I don't think I'm coming back.",1,0,1,Keith K.,"Brooklyn, NY",21,69,6

The mediterranean noodles, which spanned the base of the paella, reminded me of rice-a-roni (a little salty).  The waiters and other service personnel, even with their thick accents and mediocre English, were extremely accommodating and really helped us enjoy our time at Barraca.  The food and beverages were brought promptly, we were asked often how everything was and our carb-happy friend had received enough bread to 'feed the multitude'.  Thank You Barraca owners and staff, if in the area again I will surely return!",0,1,0,Cristina B.,"Boston, MA",12,34,34

Due to an unexpected turn of events, I moved our reservation from 6:30PM to 5:30PM - which they so kindly accommodated to through a simple phone call.When we got there the place was near empty, except for a couple of people at the bar drinking their sorrows away (probably to get rid of any memory of the shitty food they just had). After we were seated, the first member of their staff that came by our table was friendly and offered us our menus. Two minutes later, a-not-so-friendly, EXTREMELY pushy, waiter came to take our order.When I asked which sangria he recommended, he said ""all of them"". *clap clap clap* What a fantastic answer. It really helped me narrow down my options, bravo sir, thank you! And that pretty much set the precedent for the rest of the night . Even though the RW menu clearly states that each pair gets to choose three tapas, they only honored two, which I thought was a complete rip-off because the entree was only available to be shared between (a minimum of) two people. We ordered the garlic shrimp, and beef/potato bambas, and the seafood paella to share (as if we had a choice) for our entree. I ordered the brulee for dessert and my date asked for the banana bread.The shrimp appetizer was well seasoned, not over or undercooked, perfect salt to shrimp ratio, and served with a couple of slices of bread to dip into the garlic oil sauce the dish was cooked in. The bambas were reminiscent of fried potato and beef balls my boyfriend made for breakfast from a three-step recipe he found on google - definitely nothing to write home about. The seafood paella was so embarrassingly disappointing. Bland, burnt, blah... Pretty much sums up that entire dish. You would think, the FIRST paella that came out of their dinner service would be marinated in rainbow glitter and sprinkled with unicorn tears. False. Even the nice buzz I got from having my alcohol tolerance sink down to the level of a three year old on cough syrup for the first time still didn't make that meal any better.My creme brulee was brunt (which they tried to cover up with blueberries), and the banana bread was so drenched in overly sweet caramel and cream sauce that we just left it there.

The bacon was the right amount of crospy. The home fries were delicious and the garlic aioli was the perfect compliment. My friend tried the tortilla de patatas. I cannot speak first hand to its deliciousness but my friend said it was one of the best tortillas she had ever had :)We tried three different types of Sangria: the red, the Valencia and the Barcelona. Barraca definitely has an option for every palette. I did not love the red, but I am not much of a red sangria lover anyways. The Barcelona was super refreshing and if you are worried about the saffron, dont be! It is not very detectable. I am partial to the Valencia because I generally like grapefruit juice flavors.I would definitely go back to try more food and more sangria! The venue is very cute, and a lot larger than expected. There is a whole back room with another bar. Also, tip: try going to the bathrooms in the back if there is a line in the front!!",0,0,0,Val R.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",27,53,0
4.0,2/22/2014,"I found a $25 brunch deal through Urban Daddy Perks for Barracca, which included 1 entree and bottomless sangria for 5 hours (11am-4pm)!!!  It doesn't get any better than this.I had the Huevos con bacon (eggs any style, potatoes, thick cut bacon).  It was ok.  The bacon was so thick and I should have ordered something else because I prefer thinner cuts of bacon.I had more fun trying the tapas.  My favorite was the Bacon wrapped, blue cheese stuffed dates.  I hemmed and hawed before trying.  There were absolutely incredible!  The perfect mix of salty, savory, sweet, tart.  Then I had the crispy grilled peppers with sea salt, which were lightly charred and sprinkled with just the right amount of sea salt.  I also had the Charcuterie plate which included proscutto, salami among other delicious meats, bread with tomato and olive oil.  The food was very good and I kept stealing glances at the tables next to me to see what they ordered.  The skirt steak looked delicious by the way. Sangria:  De La Mancha was my favorite.  The passion fruit made it sweet, but the limon rum kept it worthy of being called an alcoholic drink.  Sangria can be mistaken for juice if not enough alcohol is added.  But the sangria here kept me wanting more.   I also tried the Rioja, Caranias, and Compostela.Its a nice size restaurant with good service.  Our server Wes checked on us frequently but not to the point of hovering over us.  We didn't feel rushed, but rather encouraged to try more sangria.  We had a 12noon reservation and were among 1 of 3 tables at that time.  By the time we left after 3:30pm, the place was bustling and very loud.  They accommodate large parties.The samba playing over the loudspeaker set the scene for a delicious afternoon.  I think I've found my new brunch spot when looking for a relaxing afternoon with good drinks.",2,0,1,Erin A.,"New York, NY",89,184,73
1.0,2/20/2014,"I had come to barraca previously this summer and had a great experience. Unfortunately my experience tonight has completely changed how I feel about this restaurant. We were told that the wait for a table of two would be 10-15 minutes (we were there at around 8:30) but ended up waiting about 30 minutes. At first this was ok because we got some drinks at the bar while we waited but we didn't know what kind of waiting was in store for us. After being seated, it room a while for the waiter to come over and take a drink order. Then it took even more time for him to take our dinner order...this is when the waiting began. After giving our order for dinner, a couple of other tables for two were seated and these people proceeded to place their order and get their food way before us. It took about 30/45 minutes for us to receive our appetizers which were not complicated. The appetizers were good but then we noticed how long it was taking for the paella to get to us. We waited for about an hour for our main dish to arrive- all while watching the tables around us receive their food well before us. Understood that paella needs to cook but this is what this restaurant serves!We expressed our concerns to the waiter, who was apologetic and we know it's not his fault, but it was still extremely frustrating. Once our paella finally arrived, it was hot but  SO salty. The manager did come over to ""apologize"" but instead of comping something from our bill for their mistake, she gave us pitiful shots as an apology. The way she handled their poor service of getting food out in a timely manner was lame and she should have tried to be more apologetic. Out of principal we didn't drink then. Overall this was one of the most frustrating (and long!) dining experiences that I've ever had. I will never return to this restaurant nor will suggest this as a place for anyone to eat.

4.0,2/2/2014,"The only problem for me with dining in the City is that there are too many fantastic places to choose from.  I'm also not a picky eater at all, so narrowing it down to what I want proves almost impossible.  On my most recent visit, I trusted the Manhattanite I was visiting with to choose a place where we could catch up over amazing food.  Barraca it was.  Easy to find in the West Village, Barraca is located on the corner of Greenwich Ave and Bank St.  As we entered from the cold night, my friend said, ""Oh good, this place has a nice-sized vestibule.""  In other words, it was a great space to pull off hats, mittens, scarves, coats, etc. without knocking someone off their bar stool.  It's a very cozy place but has high ceilings, which keeps you from feeling claustrophobic.  We went for a variety of tapas that night so we could sample the greatest diversity of the menu (although the Paelle descriptions did look amazing enough to warrant another visit when I'm back).  Everything was brought out on wooden slabs, and sometimes one tapa would be alongside another (eg: pan con tomate on the same slab as manchego).  Pan con tomate was one of our favorites despite how simple it was -- I wish we had each ordered an individual portion of that instead of splitting a single order between the two of us; add that to your list when you visit.  Manchego was also tasty.  The tortilla de patatas is another one we both enjoyed.  The potatoes chunks are creamy without being grainy and it's seasoned simply but just right to be good until the last bite.  Things I wouldn't order again were the croquetas de jamon and the setas salteadas.  Taste and texture both didn't do it for me with the croquetas, as I found them to be too bland and more of a ""fall apart with a bite"" where I think the goal was ""melt in your mouth"" texture; I also thought they were a little greasy on the texture as well.  With the setas salteadas, it seemed that the truffle oil overwhelmed the whole dish, drowning out the tastes of the mushrooms, garlic, and parsley in the rest of the dish and giving the whole thing a swimming, oily texture instead of adding a subtle complement.  The ambiance was fantastic for getting together with a friend, and with the seasonal menu options, I would love to visit again in the summer to see what else is on the menu.",2,0,1,Suzanne B.,"Louisville, KY",139,772,633

However, thanks to Pablo's helpful suggestions, we had plenty-o-food coming our way with little knowledge as to how we would have room in our tummies to consume more ... But we made it happen!- carne con bravas (most tender skirt steak I've ever tasted + potatoes + crispy grilled kale- #nomnom) - paella de mariscos (tasty paella with seafood overload) can you say, STUFFED?! seriously bulging tummy by this point. everything was so delicious. honestly if we would have stopped eating after the tapas, I would have been satisfied. the paella (we ordered a portion for ""two"" though the 6 of us couldn't even finish it all) was very well made, very filling, great flavors... The steak was superb. I think next time, we should order less tapas so we could enjoy the main courses a bit more. but I can't complain - we ate enough to feed a small army and I was full for 24 hours.great rest in the west village!!! cozy atmosphere, authentic dishes, friendly staff and a fun time all around! will be back ... :)",0,0,0,Dorine C.,"New York, NY",242,141,216

4.0,1/26/2014,"At first I thought this place was a dinner, until I saw that they sell tapas and paella, Spanish food indeed.I had 4 tapas:1. crab meat on a toast with radish..According to the menu it is a Seasonal Special, and since it is cold outside I thought it was going to be warm, but not, it is a cold tapa. On the other hand the toast was too toasted (almost black), but delicious.2. coca de cetas y chorizo..Seasonal special.. This is basically a flat bread with little pieces of chorizo, mushroom, cheese, some vegetables. It was really good, maybe my favourite one of the 4 I ate.3. albóndigas de Maruno (lamb meatballs)...This is one was in the regular menu. Basically some lamb meatballs, with labne cheese, 4 slices of cucumber, and 2 small roasted carrots. I really liked it, and I found myself thinking that I they would have served me 10 I would have eat them all.4. Canelón de Pato (duck canelone)Last but not least, A good size canelone (4 inched long) stuffed with duck and duck liver, with some manchego cheese on the top, and a nice sauce. Really good too!For dessert I had a Crema Catalana, with was very smooth and tasty, really yummy.Now, the only reason I am not giving this place a 5 star is because:I speak Spanish and I understood all the big fuzz they made when I showed up in this place without a reservation. I was walking around and I saw the place, how am I supposed to now about a reservation?Also, watch out for differences is prices between the menu and the bill.

Entrees: we had paella (veg. & seafood). Both were salty and nearly burnt. Was not appetizing at all. I basically just picked the overcooked seafood off of mine & ate that (leaving the burnt, salty rice alone).Drinks: I tasted both sangrias, but we opted for the pitcher of passion fruit sangria. Awesome! They add wayyyyyy too much ice to the pitcher so request with no ice. Who wants to drink watered down sangria? Not I.Server: very attentive & accommodating.

Once our waiter realized we were done drinking and moving onto water, he completely stopped coming to our table to check on us and our food. We spent over $400 (the tip was included without asking, even though it was only 4 of us, and our waiter definitely was not deserving of a 20% tip) - but what was really bothersome was they charged us for a desert that we didn't order that they had brought out with a candle for the birthday girl.

4.0,7/11/2013,"Over the course of the time (on a more than 2 visits in spite of the check-in number) I have seen Barraca's evolution into what I believe seems to be a more suitable flavor for NY's palate. While its authenticity is unquestionable, during my last visit last night I missed that characteristic bold and intense Spanish flavor that I have heard to be considered salty by many around here. Chef Jesus Nuñez was always  misunderstood in my opinion, at least while he was behind Gastroarte, a fantastic exhibition of reinvented Spanish cuisine in one of the most creative ways I have ever seen. His new project, on a more casual and traditional display, sure keeps the basics of Spanish cuisine; the flavor; the style. You name it. And keep it still nowadays. However, like with other personal emotions in life, the initial excitement has been diluted a little bit. Nevertheless, I will stick to my tip on the first night I went to Barraca back in December: Best Spanish food in New York!. Just refined into ""Among the best ...""Wrapped under a name and scene inspired by traditional farmer's houses from certain regions of Spain, Barraca's team have surely get the fancy look that NY ""should have""; to be attractive to the public, ya know?. Its cool. Vibrant and appealing as many around there. I think you will like it. Get there with your partner. Or your friends, even a group of 6 will be fine. Either situation you are involve in, it will fit perfectly fine. While Barraca's signature dish are the paellas, I have actually not tasted them yet. In part, because I have been there always for dinner and I think that's a heavy dish on that time. But mainly because how to resist to try several versus just one of his dishes. The menu has changed over time, I like seeing that. My friend and I were talking how some restaurants does not change their menu at all, which ultimately makes them a less attractive option. Barraca does not offer right now Spanish Tortilla. But if you see it in the menu in upcoming months, just don't even think twice and order it. Skip the scallop escabeche. I don't think it is escabeche and I was actually quite disappointed. If something about all this writing, besides to be dedicated to all you reading, I also wish to have a real effect for certain things to change. Just a thought. Pulpo (octopus) was okay in one occasion. However, everything else, must order. The lamb. The meatballs. The pear salad. The Brussels sprouts. The eggplant with honey and nuts. The fried cauliflower and the grilled squid. Piquillo peppers filled with oxtail. Incredible. Summarizing, anything should be pretty good. On the same line, among what I have enjoy the most is the sangrias and the cocktails. And special attention to the desserts. Will tell you about that in just a little. Be aware that Sangrias seems to have change over time. Unfortunately to worse. At least The Valencia. The Rioja sangria has been always my favorite. That slight touch of spiciness got me right away. The cocktails are really inspiring and creative. Who can resist to saffron Rum. As for desserts, Chef Jesus was already popular on his unique displays of those little pleasures at the end of a meal that you may wanna skip. Don't do it. Just leave some room and order their Pan perdido. Or even better, their tomato Bizcocho (cake). The latest being a fantastic combination of flavors and texture. A cake that is moist and firm. Without any predominant flavor quite neutral, perfect for the tomato jam underneath. That one sweet and sour, beautifully colorful along with the tomato ice cream. A must order. Like the Lost bread, or pan perdido or what you may know better by Pain perdu. Sophisticated, refreshing, an ice cream feeling on a cake format. Accompanied by drops of sour lemon custard and bitter chocolate splash on a plate to create his infamous Miro canvas inspiration. Eat those drops together to get the point. Wonderful. A few months back, the torrija was quite good. I hope torrija to be offered again soon. The rice pudding wasn't good enough and I should skip  it. I have mixed feelings about the service. From pleasant, to wonderful to upsetting. My complaints are coming from the front of the house exclusively. Once it was quite upsetting. Not last night so they may have fixed it already. The place can get really popular and my impression is that they still need to work out on that department. It will become or it is in fact a serious issue already. All this being said, I do recommend Barraca very much. For many reasons. To name just one: as you have probably get already, Barraca is surely bites of Spain in NY, even if it is been diluted a little bit. Like myself. I may have change over the course of time (said so in the homeland by many) but at the end of the day, I will always proudly be Spanish (said so by the same many, and some others). And Barraca, hopefully will always be as well. I actually think it will.",8,8,9,Laura A.,"Brooklyn, NY",232,344,1232

Our waitress was very sweet but if you're in a rush and haven't dined in a European country where servers take their time (in the hopes that you and your dinner mates are catching up over wine and conversation) then you will get annoyed with the service.  I would definitely go back for the sangria and to try another tapas but maybe during happy hour or when there's another special - was a bit too rich for my blood.  You can't beat the ambiance of sitting outside on a summer night though.,0,0,0,Vinita B.,"East Cambridge, Boston, MA",0,45,0

1.0,6/18/2013,"It looks nice from the outside, but it's all for show.  The food is good (as long as you don't ask for modifications), but the service and overall experience are hideous.   And the menu is ridiculously small for a tapas place (when there should be like 30-40 types of tapas, they had... like 10).  We came on a Tuesday night and sat outside; it turns out everyone was sitting outside, so it looked a lot more popular from the street than it actually is. The evening started on a bad note when our proto-server (not our actual server, but the water server) spilled water over my glass, on the table, and down my lap.  And then didn't offer to get me an extra napkin or anything to wipe up the spill.  Our actual server was nice enough, but the kitchen...I don't know what's going on back there.  We waited 40 minutes for our first set of tapas, but they brought out the order for another table, which we sent back (since it obviously wasn't ours).  We then waited another 15 minutes before we flagged down our waiter, and told him that we still had no food.  He was like, ""But they brought the first set"" -- to which I simply gestured at our empty and sparkling plates.  The icing on the cake was that the table next to ours (they sat down 40 minutes after we did), got food BEFORE we did.  As a customer, that's a real ""f*off, we don't need your business"".  When our food finally started coming out, I was immensely annoyed that the patatas bravas (which I had specified as ""no pork"" like 3 times while we were ordering) had pork in it.  When I asked the runner (before he set the plate on the table) if the dish had pork, he said ""No, no pork.""  But as we ate it, what did we find but...bits of fried pork.  This wasn't a big deal for me, but was a big deal for my friend (who doesn't eat pork).  Anyways, I'm not coming back.  I actually wish we had left during the hour long wait for our food as the service and experience were horrible, even if the food itself was ok.",3,0,0,Olivia L.,"Palo Alto, CA",41,518,152

HOWEVER, we went back a few days ago, spent an inordinate time waiting for anyone to come to the table (it was early, so the front of house staff outnumbered the diners by about 4:1). Then two of the waitstaff had an argument over who was supposed to take care of us- in front of us- while no one took care of us! We tried to order sangria but they had 3 of the 5, and were out of what we wanted. The same with the menu- hubby wanted the lobster paella and that was the one that they didn't have. We asked about a couple of the tapas, again out of them - please note that this was a Thursday night- (Trying to ask any question was difficult as the staff was assiduously avoiding us).

It was the first sign of how bad this experience was going to be. Our server barely apologized before storming off and not returning to take a food or additional drink order for 15 minutes. We finally did get our order in and were delivered our meat and cheese trays fairly quickly, but the rest of our order was totally forgotten. We had to wait over 45 minutes to be served meatballs and langoustines and in the meantime the bussers took away out cheese and meat trays before we had finished eating the food on them. They didn't even ask if we were done, just swooped in and took then away. When we complained to the server, she blamed the kitchen and even the runners for our food for not coming and said the manager was aware but took no ownership herself. The manager, whoever that was, never had the balls to come over and apologize or offer us a comp. after we finished eating the final courses, we sat and waited to ask for the check for another 15 minutes and then even after asking for the check, we then waited another 10 minutes before they took our credit cards. They ended up comping us the last 2 tapas but the damage had long been done and the manager still never came over or said anything as we left. The best is that the server was blaming everyone else in the restaurant for the lousy service, including the fact that they were training new people in the kitchen for their 2nd adjoining restaurant, that will be served out of the same kitchen that Barraca uses. I can tell you with total confidence that they will have a disaster on their hands when they open that 2nd restaurant because despite the food being ok, if the service is this bad already, they will be out of business within the year.",3,1,0,Food S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,14,0

They were fantastic and had a hard time picking my favorite but I think, surprisingly enough, had to be the Tierra one. The black and Seafood were cooked to perfection but I think the reason I like the Tierra one better is because it just had a little more salty flavor (personal preference for me, although not for everyone at the table)-DESSERT: I was so full that I just tasted the COCA DE FRAMBUESA which was light and tasty.

Especially the albondigas (tiny amazing little meatballs)! Overall, service was excellent. Barraca has become one of my new favorite spots in the city...

2.0,2/17/2013,"To summarize, ok food, terrible service, ok drinks, not coming back.  Our reading of the review in NYT and an everlasting quest to find the next great tapas place prompted a visit here.  The menu here is typical New York Spanish tapas place. The jamon selection stands out as we are always reminiscent of the days we spent in Spain and the acorn fed black pig ham. It took us a long time to get our drinks and order food. The wine by the glass was ok.  The venison special was such a bad cut with a huge tendon running through the meat I spat out half the order. Grilled pork belly, I would not have grilled a pork belly, tough skin, tough meat, just not good. Even the chicken liver pate was under salted.  My second drink the white sangria reminds of the fume from  the industrial cleaner I smell at some restaurants. Only interesting thing here was the flat bread dessert. Normally I don't like my fruit cooked, but it's interesting here. For service, our waiter took forever to bring some bread to leave my mouth burn in pain from the spicy pepper.  As we were leaving the coat check girl lost my scarf.  Come on! Can you get anything right!  Definitely not coming back. The best thing here was the jamon pata negra but they didn't make that.",1,0,0,Linda K.,"Hoboken, NJ",80,87,39
2.0,2/15/2013,"Came here for Valentines day and had the prix fixe menu. The food was average, the foie grais wasn't bad and the portions were actually a good size, it's just none of the dishes were great. I liked the short rib and the ham was actually pretty good but nothing spectacular. Maybe it was because it was Valentines day and they were moving dinners all night but I feel like they could have selected a much better variety of food. The overall experience wouldn't have been so bad if our waiter didn't completely forget our 3rd course and then it took a long time for it to come out after we kept reminding him. The place was also incredibly hot in the back area, so now I am eating average meals, with an unresponsive waiter and sweating. I spent a good amount of money and left unhappy. Oh yeah, he brought us the 4th course (desert, which was fried milk and a tiny donut that had a weird taste) without any silverware and rushed away before we could even let him know so we had to take silverware from the empty table next to us. I don't expect to be treated like a king but at least give me some decent treatment if I am spending money in your establishment. My advice is get your waiter game up, try some new dishes and work on the temperature.",1,1,0,Marcos D.,"Union, NJ",161,18,7

2.0,2/14/2013,"The only positive thing I can say about this restaurant is the location on Greenwich Ave and the nice ambiance, although they come off as too trendy and trying to hard. I certainly can't say anything positive when it comes to the food and service/staff.I understand some restaurants have a policy you can't sit down until all have arrived.. But it was not even 6pm and literally the restaurant had all empty tables. Let's just say that I had so many heavy bags including a laptop bag and they still wouldn't let me sit in their empty restaurant. And we were also celebrating my belated birthday..  The unfriendly host told my cousin and I to go to the bar and wait. They don't have a huge bar either. We were staying at the small bar  in an awkward and uncomfortable position and it felt more so when people came by to get a drink.  We decided to be nice and let the others sit down at the bar since they were there for a drink. Food was disappointing. First off the portions of each of the tapas was a joke. One can easily finish it with one bite. It's not one of those restaurants you could share a bunch of tapas and be satisfied. Salt salt salt. Everything was salty especially the paella. What a disappointment! And the pork that we ordered was so tough that we couldn't cut it with a regular knife. And we had a piece of the waiter's attitude when we asked for a better knife.Considering the portions were super tiny, the fact that they were mediocre and that they charge that much is absurd. And trust me I've been to numerous tapas places and you're not supposed to skimp out like that. I'd rather pay a little more for a bigger portion as long as it tastes good. Isn't that what tapas is all about - sharing and good food?",5,1,0,Caroline C.,"Brooklyn, NY",381,311,298

4.0,2/7/2013,"In July of 2012, I became a writer for The Latin Kitchen, an online food and décor website dedicated to the celebration of Latin and Latin American culture and cuisine. Since then, it has been without a doubt my favorite writing venture. I mainly write about recipes and how to decorate your home for the holidays or upcoming events and parties. In one of my recent articles, I featured several Latin chefs, some celebrity and some up and coming. That is when I discovered Barraca, courtesy of Chef Jesus Nunez.Nestled in Greenwich Village, this neighborhood gem is not without its charms. Its corner location and simple lit sign is inviting to outsiders. In other words, it doesn't scream ""COME EAT HERE!"" in big neon lights like some other city restaurants do. I made a reservation for dinner at 6 on a Saturday through Open Table. I have never done it before, or made a reservation online for that matter. I guess I don't trust the Internet and would rather speak to someone in person. In the additional comment box, I added that I was celebrating my four-year anniversary with my boyfriend, Bryan. I did not ask for any kind of discount, special treatment or prime seating, I just stated the occasion. I had no idea that Open Table and Barraca would honor my request by leaps and bounds.Inside, the restaurant is dimly lit. There are tables and chairs as well as booths situated against the wall of windows. With a touch of yellow and green accents throughout the restaurant, the décor evokes a sense of being in Mexico on a relaxing, cool summer night. It is not a huge space, but comfortable enough to fit multiple parties on a busy dinner night.The price is also right, especially for Manhattan. Sangria specials are offered at $10 (I chose the Sangria Penedés, a cava Penedés based sangria with peaches and lavender) and all cocktails are $12. Tapas range from $6-$12 and are ample in size. Bryan and I started out with the stuffed pimiento peppers. After Jesus had chosen this dish as one of his recipes for the holiday article, I immediately knew I had to come to his restaurant to try it out. The dish looked every bit as appealing as the image he had sent. Stuffed with braised oxtail in a sweet, yet spicy sauce, the pepper was so smooth and tender that it melted on my tongue. It was a bit small for an appetizer portion, but then again it was listed under the tapas menu, so it's meant to be paired with more than one dish.We followed up the stuffed peppers with paella, the restaurant's signature dish, (priced at $19-$27 depending on the type of paella you order). Chef Jesus offers six different kinds of paella and he encourages his guests to mix and match as often as they can, so he divided the skillet. Genius! Cooked in the skillet itself, you can select two different kinds of paella for either side of the dish. Once cooked, the paella is brought out to you in the same steaming skillet to maximize flavor and freshness. I chose the Paella Roja de Carabineros, a shrimp and prawn-based paella, while Bryan chose the Paella de Mariscos, chock full of mussels, clams, swordfish and squid. Although I dislike all that good stuff, both versions of paella were excellent. Each portion is enough to leave you feeling satisfied, but not full. Never full.As I tell anyone who waves his or her hand at the dessert menu, ""Didn't your grandma teach you anything? Always save room for dessert."" I followed up my entrée with chocolate filled crème puffs (no longer on the menu as it was a seasonal item, but so chocolaty and delicious), while Bryan selected the Torrija, a traditional Catalonian sweet toast served with cinnamon ice cream. About five minutes later, two of the special desserts for the evening, strawberries and cream and an oven baked cinnamon apple with crème fraiche ice cream, were placed in front of us along with two complimentary glasses of champagne. Completely oblivious to my dinner request, I called the waiter over and politely told him that the dessert order was incorrect. He went on to inform me that they were compliments of the house for our anniversary. So sweet! Had I known that, I would not have ordered two more desserts. However, I am SO thankful that I got to sample four of Barraca's delicious desserts as they encompassed everything I love about Latin sweets. Great ambiance, excellent service (regardless of if you are there for a special occasion or not), and superb food. I can see why Barraca is both a neighborhood gem and a must visit destination for a meal. Nestled in the heart of Greenwich Village, Barraca is like a second home to locals. The perfect place to go for a light lunch, business dinner, or even to grab a few drinks and tapas with some friends. I will most definitely be making a pilgrimage back to Barraca the next time I'm in the village.",0,0,0,Jennifer F.,"Seaford, NY",26,4,0

The thing they really have to fix is the service. It is really overbearing. Too many people coming to the table too often. Filling glasses, taking plates, asking questions. It's one interruption after another. Too much is better than too little, I suppose, but they really have to find the right balance. Service should be attentive but not obtrusive.",1,0,1,Milano S.,"Manhattan, NY",1,9,0

5.0,2/4/2013,"This place is all about passion, and it is about soul, Spanish soul. Everything about Barraca is intense: the flavors, the music, the colors. If you want a meek approach to Spain go elsewhere- you've plenty of uninspired places to choose from. And don't expect to find rigid interpretations or traditional constraints either; although there's plenty of traditional food and drink, what you WILL find here is an ode of the senses to the country and its people. That you may or may not enjoy it is a matter of perspective, but the experience is well worth a try. We went on a tuesday (I recommend going at the beginning of the week) and it was great, aside from one small mistake in an order. Overall, we found it to be a sweet escape into good food, good drinks and a fun atmosphere.I am not going to claim that it is just like going to Spain because, let's be honest, that would be stupid by any measure of the imagination; but, as far as cultural emissaries go, this is an excellent example. If you don't walk away feeling this, then perhaps you're not digging deep enough. I think you should remain open minded about what you think YOU'd like best, but I will say these were highlight items for me: paella de tierra, sepia a la plancha, mollete de cordero, sangria compostela and membrillo & ginebra.I'm the kind of review reader that doesn't like details but prefers a general idea and I never write about negative experiences in restaurants(unless it is truly awful), because why dwell when I can just never go back to the place?All in all, I thought this place was a noble leap into the Spanish soul- food and drink and play.",1,0,0,Grace V.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0
2.0,2/4/2013,"I had high expections for this place, especially since it seems to be doing really well.  I think alcohol is driving their business.  They have an excellent wine list and an even better cocktail/beverage program that is very creative.  The tapas selection is rather small (in comparison to other places) but the portions and prices are just fine.  Most of the tapas we tried were fine, but again given the hype and pedigree of this place I expected more.  The paella and fidejula (not sure of my spelling but it is basically a noodle version of paella) were just okay.  The noodles in this dish are suppossed to be crsipy and ours were mushy and soft, not right at all.  The service was polite and nice but we were a little put off that our waiter kept pushing us to order our paella. I know he was concerned about the time it takes to prepare, but a tapas meal is meant to be slow and relaxing and not rushed.  We did consume three bottles of excellent wine so at least we left feeling good.  I am not saying I would never go back (I  would sit at the bar and graze for a bit, but I wish the bar was much longer) I would not make a reservation and/or consider this a special place to bring friends.",1,0,0,Anthony M.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,14,0
3.0,2/1/2013,"2 for food, 2 for service, 5 for sangriaAfter my friend loved a mortal combat reference in thrillist's promo for barraca, we had to try it. Sadly, I was pretty disappointed with the experience. We went on a Saturday night, were happy how gorgeous of a space Barraca is, and we promptly seated and attended to. Over the course of the evening, we got 4 types of a sangria and a bunch of tapas. The sangria rioja and compostela were amazing, like OMG amazing, and I'm not an OMG-er. The saffron sangria and rose were ok, just above meh. The tapas, though, superduper meh. We got the shrimp and garlic, octopus, mollete de cordero, croquettes, and a few other equally unmemorable dishes. The mollete sandwich was really the only above-average bite, and everything else was very disappointing. Finally, I hate to knock down for service when the problem is over-attentiveness, but this was to such an annoying extreme that I can't help but comment on it. Every five seconds someone's there to refill your water or to ask how you're doing or to suggest some more sangria or dishes or to take away your plate despite the remaining bites or just to chat about what you thought of the dishes they'd recommended and feel awkward that you can't give it the accolades they feel it deserves. I would like to say that over-attentiveness is better than the alternative, but the whole time I wanted to shout enough already, just leave us alone! When you want to go out for a Saturday night dinner, you want to enjoy the people you're with and not have to be interrupted more often than once a minute by a waiter with a question. But overall, Barraca's a beautiful space and I hope the food gets better because I'd love for them to do well.",0,0,0,Adina R.,"Washington, DC",138,145,7

1.0,1/26/2013,"Went to dinner here with another couple on a Friday night and we left disappointed.  We like trying new restaurants, and this being the sister restuarant to Rayuela we expected good things.  However the only good thing we experienced was the taste of the sangria (more on this later).The bad:1 - The service is too much.  The restaurant feels well overstaffed and everyone is in a rush.  Each plate that we had was taken away before it was finished, and we were asked if we wanted any more when a hand was already on it to take it away.  Our wine glasses and sangria glasses were also removed from our table before they were finished.  It seemed as though they were short on plates and glasses and were coming to collect them as quickly as possible.  Although the wait staff was nice, the manner in which they operated set the mood for a dinner which you could not relax at, which is half of the point of eating tapas food anyway, and going on a double date on a Friday night.  All in all, we probably had 5 different people come to our table during the meal, in about 5-10 minute intervals for 2 hours straight.  Oh, and our head server took our final bills while we were still sitting - there was no wait at this point in the night and I find this extremely rude.2 - The tapas were super small and not commensurate with the price.  Our meal for four cost us $300 and we left hungry...sure this is new york, but still, that amount of money should feed your belly.3 - The paella was not very tasty and was mostly rice.  We had the chicken/rabbit paella and that was all bones/cartilage and barely any meat.4 - The cheeses were terrible and quality was akin to what I could have gotten at the local grocery store in shrink wrap.5 - The sangria was tasty - we ordered two pitchers of the first white on the menu.  However, it was mostly ice, and the pitcher filled about 4.5 glasses worth - so not much of a bargain here.6- The spacing of the tables is slightly cramped.  When I got up I had to delicately scoot past the table next to me, which inevitably led to my butt grazing over the top of the nearest table - and I'm not a big/overweight person.All this being said, I will not return here.  The food is nothing to rave about, the service is overwhelming and anxious, and you're going to spend more than what your belly feels is worth.  There are better places in the village, go there.",4,0,0,Derek B.,"New York, NY",7,19,0

As far as drinks are concerned, I tried both the classic red and white sangrias, and they were both really unique.  I usually am more of a red fan, but it was actually a little spicy for my taste so I preferred the white this time around (much sweeter and more up my alley).The one thing that put a damper on my experience here was watching the group at the table next to me devour an incredible looking paella sample.  Next time, I will definitely take the plunge.",4,3,4,Rachael F.,"Manhattan, NY",93,236,46

The restaurant is a fussy eater's delight with enough tapas to satisfy the pickiest piglet in your group. Highlights on the Tapas menu include:-Patatas Bravioli-a hearty standard on any tapas menu--crispy potatoes covered in both a tomato sauce and aioli-Mollete de Cordero--pulled lamb sandwhich (great rich taste--though not for sharing)-Allbondigas--meatballs in a thick vegetable sauce. Other interesting dishes include the coca--a paper thin delicate flat bread-and (for dessert) the bunuelos(dough bites, which tasted like they were made from rice pudding) in chocolate cinnamon sauce. For those who might have noticed that the food became cold far too fast (the chef and owner need to learn how important hot plates are!), or that the sandwich bread with the mollete was a bit too starchy, there is an excellent and complete sangria/cocktail list to keep you happy. Order  the Sangria Compostela (wine/sake/apple-rosemary puree/lemongrass) it's an interesting twist on an old favorite.Barraca, which in spanish is translatable as something of a makeshift/rustic home, takes a chic twist on it's name in decor.

Turquoise chairs and simple farm style napkins add to the charm. yellow lighting sets the mood. ***3.25 stars--great for groups of friends or pre-dinner drinks.  Not great for foodies, special dinners with out of town guests, people who don't love to share. *Note to Customers: ALL the dishes come out as prepared, which can be awkward at dessert time if you are looking forward to ending the night as a selfish little piglet.*Note to Chef:  Master heating your plates before service.

I would recommend if you go with a group of people that everyone orders 2-3 to share.",1,0,0,Ciara S.,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",63,145,35
4.0,12/7/2012,"BOTTOMLINE: Would really recommend for groups (6 or so) as it has a fun factor, reasonable pricepoint, and unique but shareable food/drinks.AMBIANCE: Very nice lively but chill vibe. Spanish chic without being cheesy.  Good bar area to wait before dinner.SERVICE: We had 9p reservations on Thursday for 6 people.  They were able to easily accommodate us when we came early at 8:30p.  The server was attentive - drinks kept flowing and food came on time and well paced.FOOD/DRINKS:  Pretty great cocktail list - my schtick with mixed drinks is that they are too sweet. But not here: creative mixes that didn't overpower the liquor flavor.  The small plates were good - good to share with group of 6 for appetizers, but wouldn't sustain as the main meal.  Ordered 2 paellas and 50% too much food for 6 people - well presented and delicious.  A little on the salty side though.",1,0,1,Christina W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,13,1
3.0,12/6/2012,"underwhelming. i ned to go back when i dont have a cold, but nothing had any flavor. my wife said the same, and she wasnt sick. I'm accustomed to the understated flavors of traditional Spanish food (which this very much is and i love it!) but everything from the wine to the pulpo to the paella needed seasoning. everything also tasted and looked like it had been sitting in the window for 15 minutes. i've eaten fresh paella - ours (we were the 530 seating) looked like last night's warmed over with some fresh stuff sprinkled over the top.",0,0,0,Anthony T.,"New York, NY",0,3,0
3.0,12/6/2012,"Why Come Here? Attractive crowd, hot spot, solid cocktails and sangriaRight Amount for 2: 4 small platesBarraca comes from the team behind trendy LES spots Macondo and Rayuela and has several things going for it. The cocktails and Sangria are phenomenal. The waitstaff is good looking, attentive and friendly (a rare trifecta). The space is dark and sexy and occupies a prime corner location on relatively quiet Greenwich Avenue with plenty of windows to gawk at passersby.These are the qualities some seek out in a restaurant and those are the people Barraca was built for. However, if you're a foodie or Spanish cuisine aficionado, Barraca will leave you disappointed more than pleased. Despite numerous dishes that sounded great on the menu, nothing was executed at an especially high level. We tried something from most categories (except for the flatbreads) and left unimpressed from a food standpoint. Avoid paella, which has to be ordered for at least 2 (at a cost of $50) and neither of the ones we tried were anything special. Below are my thoughts on what we had:Setas Al Ajillo A La Plancha (grilled oyster mushrooms with garlic sauce w/ sausage) The garlic sauce really ties together the firm mushrooms and meaty sausage. Best dish of the night.Pimientos De Piquillo (piquillo peppers stuffed w/ oxtail stew and creamy piquillo sauce) The oxtail had all the richness  you hope for, but the creamy piquillo sauce was more ""creamy"" than ""piquillo.""Mollete De Cordero Con Manchego Y Ali-Oli De Piquillo (sandwich w/ pulled lamb, manchego cheese and a piquillo ali-oli)  This is one of the ""good on paper"" dishes I was talking about. Unfortunately, the bread was too starchy and the lamb was on the fatty side.Paella Negra (squid ink infused rice, artichoke, monkfish, squid, and shrimp with ali-oli)  The assortment of seafood was fresh and well prepared, but it was lacking in spices and the rice just didn't have that crispiness you want in your paella.Paella Con Vegetales (artichoke, snow peas, broccoli, english peas, zucchini, scallions, shitake and garbanzo beans)  This legitimately tasted like rice and vegetables someone would cook up in a cafeteria.",1,0,0,Jay Z.,"Manhattan, NY",156,126,0

3.0,12/3/2012,I had brunch here on Sunday. The place was relatively quiet when compared to Bone Lick Park BBQ next door but I think the unlimited hour of drinks had a lot to do with that.  The atmosphere is nice and the place has  a good feel to it.  I ordered the broken eggs and the breaded deviled eggs stuffed with tuna.  The broken egg dish was ok except the potatoes were anything but crispy as described in the menu.  It tasted fine but I think crispy potatoes would have made it better.  The Deviled eggs were very nice and tasty and nicely presented.  The service was attentive and the overall price of the menu is reasonable but they are competing against some stiff competition on the same block.,0,0,0,Raymond P.,"New York, NY",14,267,29
5.0,11/21/2012,We stopped by this place while recently in W. Village.  I was presently surprised to try 3 of their sangria's and was greeted by very friendly staff.  Made it a point to stop by again recently and found out it was same owners as Macondo on east side.  After trying the food and more sangria I can comfortably say its got best Latin fusion food outside of Yerba Buena on Ave A.  Truly and amazing place with great service and food to match.  Also only Sangria specialty place I've found to this caliber.,3,0,0,Ricardo G.,"Patchogue, NY",0,8,0
4.0,11/21/2012,"Big Fan!! A newcomer from Chef Jesus Nunez along with Hector Sanz and the team that gave us Macondo and Rayuela hits the ground running. Besides the obvious hits on the team of people, food, and drinks I'm a big fan of the space itself. Located on the prime corner of Greenwich and Bank this place gives off a very welcoming, yet sexy feel. These guys pay attention to detail. No corner went overlooked. I also love the huge windows that overlook Greenwich. Starring out at a quintessential New York street to really add to that West Villagey feel.The sangria here is excellent. With five different choices (Yes, I said FIVE CHOICES) you should have no trouble finding one to gulp down. One could even argue that you ought to keep coming back until you've tried them all. I stayed traditional and went with the Rioja. It was delicious and nice and strong! The Boy and I came here because we love Mocando. Everything we tasted was quite good, and also filling for small plates. Standouts were the Tortilla de Patatas and the Huevos Rotas con Panceta, which is basically broken eggs over pork belly... Yes, hello foodgasm!! The Torrija for dessert is equally as amazing.The best part... besides the fact that just writing this review is making my mouth water remembering the food... is that they serve food till 3AM!! So if you find yourself in the West Village with late night munchies, this may be your new favorite spot!",21,11,12,Lissa V.,"New York, NY",565,242,4

5.0,11/2/2012,"For a recently open restaurant, that has been pretty busy and talked about from the get go. This place is terrific. Awesome decor, sort of feels a little western chic, the designer did a great job creating an elegant feeling space while using lots of wood/ raw elements.The cocktail list is very interesting and unique, there is a a huge list of sangrias (who knew sangria was so complex - not me) the one I had was delicious. The menu was great. Tried a few of the tapas dishes which were good, and then  paella. Its amazing that even though each person in the party has to get a paella they let you pick more than one, which are served in beautiful cast iron pans. Great presentation all around. Overall, I did not feel like I was eating at a restaurant that had only been open for a few weeks, but one that had been there for years. Owners and management are amazing, which makes all the difference. Can't wait to see what they have in store for the space next door..Best of luck!!",3,0,0,Julian P.,"Brooklyn, NY",22,17,0
5.0,10/28/2012,"My boyfriend and I were in the city for the day and decided to stop by Barraca one evening to check it out. So glad we decided to!  We didn't realize that the place would be so popping so the wait was an hour and a half and so we decided to hang out at the bar and wait for the seats to clear up. We got seats at the bar within 15 minutes and just had our whole meal at the bar. The bartender was this cute little Asian girl who was ultra friendly and gave us great suggestions on the menu. When we were on the fence on which sangria to get, she gave us a taste of two of them, which was awesome. The grapefruit one she suggested was AMAZINGGGGG and so we got a whole pitcher of it. For the tapas, we got the crispy patatas, croquets, and the clams which were all so flavorful and ridiculously addicting. If only the portions were a little bigger. Then we got the squid ink and seafood paellas which was ridiculously HUGE. Like seriously, the bartender had to clear a section of the bar before setting down the platter because it literally takes up the entire width of the bar. It's definitely a little hard to eat all this at the bar because of this and also because everyone's crowding around you trying to order drinks, but it was definitely worth it over waiting an hour and half. We couldn't even come close to finishing the paella, and my boyfriend can eat a LOT. While we were eating, we saw all these really interesting cocktails being made and so we got curious about what they were. Since my boyfriend was driving back to NJ for us, he had to stop at the sangria but I decided to try out the fig vodka drink and it was CRAZY GOOD. I normally don't like vodka but this should be how vodka is always served. I seriously recommend it. The rim of the cup is lined with this spice and it's so yummy and adds all this flavor to the actual drink. Sucks for my boyfriend he couldn't have any, ha. Anyways, overall amazing service, ambience, food and drinks. We're definitely going to be back when we stop by NYC next time!",11,5,1,Jennifer Y.,"San Diego, CA",5,23,0

4.0,10/21/2012,"Stopped in for a late night dinner, place was packed but we got squeezed into a table in the back. Atmosphere was super loud, we had a party of 8-10 people on either side of us that were drunk and noisy, we couldn't even make conversation. The waiter noticed us glancing around, and was kind enough to move us to a recently opened up table that was perfect. Amazing kind attentive service here, we were greeted and welcomed like regulars and never abandoned. Onto the food...Pitcher of passion fruit sangria, yumm! A little on the sweet side but very tasty.  We ordered two people's worth of the Paella de la Tierra (land animals... Chicken, rabbit, lamb). They also had great sounding seafood choices. Paella was delish, and the portion was more than we could finish, and my date can put away a LOT of food. Had fun, great service, delish food and sangria...

4.0,10/2/2012,"As a big fan of Macondo's and Rayuela I looked forward to what Hector and team would do with Barraca... starting w/ a blank slate and a prime location. Even from outside the restaurant there's a fun high energy radiating from within... inside it's like you've entered a party/dinner in a minimalist space that's only just getting started... seating is  intimate but w/ great people watching sight lines... i have to admit i didn't get to sample as much of the food as I would have liked but I will toast their Sangria's, particularly the Sangria Valencia and Compostela. The food I did have... I enjoyed - Huevos Rotos Con Panceta - ""broken eggs"", Grilled Guernica peppers w/ maldon sea salt, and Prawns sauteed w/ garlic sauce and spices. Yummy!!!!! As it was their first week I suspect they're still getting settled... but I really like the professional but casual and fun vibe...  until I actually make it to Spain, I'll plan on spending more time at  Barraca.",0,0,0,P P.,"Manhattan, NY",1,18,5
1.0,9/29/2012,Hmm. Disappointed. Was so looking forward to Barraca opening for months. We needed a tapas and sangria place in the West Village. But it was way too salty. Salty. Salty. The sangria was bad. Except the La Mancha which was traditional. That's the key word: traditional. Please add some dishes that aren't overly experimental or trendy. Get over it. Add some normal food. I give you 6 months if you don't fix something. Please!!,2,3,1,Billy B.,"New York, NY",68,27,4
