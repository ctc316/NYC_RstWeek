We reserved the 3rd floor private dining room for a very special event, my son was proposing to his girlfriend and we had family in from out of town for the event. The manager confirmed the reservation that morning and had the room completely ready for us on arrival. We had a bit of a delay with our party but the staff were amazing and so responsive to all of our needs.

1.0,12/17/2018,"I've been here a few times and must say the food was good.  But I will say customer service is always a choice I choose over the quality of the food.  I've been trying to get a hold of a gift certificate for the past week and half and have been strung along by the employees telling me they don't know and to call back.  I've called back many times and actually walked into the restaurant thinking it might make it easier.  Nope, the workers gave the same attitude and answer.  Pretty much told me over the phone ""what do you want me tell you, I don't know anything about gift certificates and I guess we don't have any, I can't help you.""  I'm sorry with that attitude I've been dealing within the past week, I will never set foot back in this place.  I was trying to purchase 3 gift certificates for 300 each and now it looks like I'll just go with smith and wollensky, where they actually respect their customers.",0,0,0,Moe D.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0

1.0,12/16/2018,"I had a horrible meal at Greenwich Steakhouse last night. The service was so terrible it ruined our evening. In the course of dining there for around 2 hours we never once were asked how our meal was, if we wanted another round of drinks, and our waters were never refilled. Diners all around us were opening complaining that their food was taking a long time or the waiter never delivered the check. Our drinks came out after our appetizers without any explanation after we waited around 30 minutes for 2 drinks. It was so disappointing as the food we ordered was on par for a good steak house however if I'm ordering a $100 steak I didn't think it's unreasonable to expect a high level of service. At the end of the meal I explained to our waiter that I was upset and he then started an argument with me that he had been working in restaurants for 25 years and knew he was right. In New York City there are so many other GREAT steakhouses, take my advice and skip this one.",1,0,0,Maddy K.,"New York, NY",0,2,0

2.0,12/9/2018,"2.5 stars. Surprised at how many good reviews this place has. I was there yesterday with two of my friends. We were seated immediately, which was great. However it took almost an hour for our food to come out (approx 55 mins). We ordered a porterhouse for two and a tomahawk steak with two sides. When I asked the waiter why it was taking so long 45 mins in, he said it normally takes that long and we should have ordered appetizers for that reason (???). That's just bad customer service. When the steak finally came out, it was medium rare as we'd ordered, which is good. However it lacked flavor. It definitely lacked salt but there was no real flavor. Disappointed over all. Considering we paid over 200 dollars just on food for three. I've been to a decent number of steakhouses. This one was definitely one of the most disappointing ones. Bland food. An hour long wait and mediocre service.",0,0,0,Anup S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0

Ordered the porterhouse for two and it was to die for. Make sure that you're hungry because the portions are big.   The ambiance is really nice.  We sat at the bar until our table was ready, beer was served in a chilled glass, always a great touch.

5.0,11/19/2018,"My girlfriend and I visited on a Sunday night around 830pm. We did not have reservations. We huddled up the front bar and enjoyed the company of our very nice bartender. He kindly made us super good cocktails. We asked our bartender for entree recommendations and he kindly offered his thoughts and suggestions. My gf ordered lemon pepper chicken and I ordered a New York strip sirloin. Our entree orders came fairly quickly. Our food was cooked perfectly and tasted so good. We ordered spinach as a side and it was also very good.I've had many steaks at big name steakhouses in large cities and I'm telling you this is the best tasting steak I've ever had. We continued to order rounds of cocktails and our bartender gladly made tasty drinks for us. We enjoyed his company!The owner also came over to check in during our meal. He is very kind. We were the last couple to leave the restaurant at 11pm (closing) and we got to spend a few minutes chatting with the owner who was very gracious and appreciative of our feedback. It's clear, the restaurant is in good hands under his new leadership!I will definitely recommend this steakhouse to anyone looking for a cute, relaxed, atmosphere and date night. 5 stars easily given.",0,0,0,Andy A.,"Atlanta, GA",5,53,1
5.0,11/8/2018,"The most important part in a restaurant is the food and this didn't disappoint me at all. I thought the seafood tower was amazing with the fried calamari because it wasn't too oily. The porterhouse for two was great as well because it was so tender and brought it to go since it was so good. I had the liner Mac and cheese side which I swear to God was an astonishing combo. Jean Carlo the manager recommended me all of these after a friendly conversation, he was so nice and welcoming that it felt like a hotel, if you're reading this man thank you.

1.0,11/3/2018,"TLDR: overpriced for no reason. Missing half the menu, food subpar, dishes missing key ingredients.I'm not sure why this restaurant has so many 5 star reviews - I rely heavily on yelp to choose restaurants to eat at and this has been the only time I've been let down by the reviews. Not only was the food sub par, but they were missing half the menu items. Not to mention that the service took way too long (despite the fact that our waiter and servers were very nice, which is the only reason I'm giving this place any stars). We ordered the shishito peppers: ""don't have them"", ordered a bottle of wine: ""don't have that one"", ordered the lamb: ""don't have it tonight"". Then, we ordered our appetizers that they apparently did have. The wedge salad came out with no bacon even though we specifically asked what came on the wedge salad and they said bacon. We ordered the burrata and beefsteak tomato salad and it came with cherry tomatoes and no beefsteak tomatoes. When we mentioned that the salads came out with missing/substituted ingredients, they told us ""sorry, we ran out of beefsteak tomatoes, but I'll bring bacon"". They brought us a slab of extremely thick, chewy bacon (not the kind of bacon you want on a chopped salad) and regular tomatoes because they said they were out of beefsteak tomatoes. The main courses came out after an hour and one of our petit filets was very fatty. The capellini that was supposed to have a white wine sauce was just a butter sauce. And the Bolognese with eggplant had no eggplant. I was ready to leave when our salads came out wrong, but we liked our server so we decided to give the entrees a chance. Even though our waiter was still very nice, I wish we hadn't have stayed. P.S. the olives in the martinis were terrible as well.

They really went out of their way to prepare our event exactly the way we wanted, and on very short notice. Obviously the steak is the main event, and Lino the chef is absolutely the best. Very friendly and accommodating. There is no better meat in town, and the seafood was extremely fresh. That was the reason we had our big party on the second floor for 30 people.

1.0,10/12/2018,"Absolutely the worst customer/hospitality service (not a food review)! Contacted the restaurant on 10/11/2018 about a private party (26-30 adults), inquiring about the the  grand private room availability on 10/20/2018, a very nice lady Rebecca took my phone number and name and said someone will call you back in 5-10mins. 4 hours later after no one called back, I called again and got connected to Greta (private event coordinator). First I asked if they have availability, to which she said yes, then I proceeded to explain I really would like to book a private party on 10/20/2018 and I did the initial research on the restaurant's website and aware that they offer private party menus and I would like either to do a custom menu between the ones they offer or do a family style (where I would provide the restaurant the choices of the dishes from their menu ahead of time, so when we arrive we don't have to deal with menus person per person the day of the party) even offered to put down a deposit. To which Greta asked for name, number and email to send me the menus and a credit card authorization. Additionally she asked that when I receive an email to write everything out and she would talk to the chef - the great Chef Victor Chavez (with 30 years of experience).Safe to say I never got her email and called again today 10/12/18 at 6pm. Greta answered and said ""oh you never didn't got the menus?"" I replied no and that the party would be next Saturday and I would really like to finalize my reservation. She asked me to email her, which I did. I sent the email to info@greenwichsteakhouse… and asked to reply back so I know I have the right email and she receives them (picture of the email below). She replied back saying the date is booked. I was shocked and I called the restaurant to speak with her, to which I was told she is already gone for the day and they don't know whether she will be back tomorrow. I emailed her back to make sure there is no miscommunication and perhaps she thinks there are two different parties trying to book for the same date, to which I received a very rude and absolutely inappropriate phone call from  a guy ( claiming to be the owner of the restaurant) yelling at me on the phone saying ""Are you Kristina? What is it you trying to do? Where did you ever hear that you can pre order the food in the restaurant?"". I replied "" Sir, with all due respect - are you aware of my communication with Greta and my request for the private party reservation?"" His reply in a very rude manner was ""Maybe you should come to the restaurant and we can have a drink and discuss"" I asked why he is being rude? To which he said do not call this restaurant again and hung up!Being a New Yorker and having so many amazing restaurants around, I chose Greenwich Steakhouse to celebrate my husbands upcoming 35th Birthday and got the most rudest, nastiest client service. Shame on you the owner of the restaurant whose name was impossible to hear on the phone.

3.0,10/5/2018,"3.5As we approached the restaurant I was surprised at how unassuming the establishment appeared from outside. It was much smaller than I had expected but still elegant and modern.Benny G runs the place, he greeted us and made us feel welcomed while we had to wait for our table to be ready. His charisma was definitely comforting as he finessed the situation. He was very aware that we knew the wait was extra long so he was apologetic and curious. Once we finally got seated it was a debate on whether to order from the restaurant week menu or the regular menu. Entrees: Lamb was the best tasting entree. It was well seasoned, tender, and more meaty than bone.Short Rib Ragu from the restaurant week menu was just ok. The meat was a bitdtry and chunky and it lacked flavor.Chicken Parmesan was cheesy but lacked flavor as well. It was like they forgot the meat needed some spice and just added the pasta and cheese.Mixed Green salad and the Hierloom were both fresh and presented well.Sides:Creamed spinach, Mashed potatoes, Hash browns, and French fries were good compliments to the entrees. The portions were a little enough to spread for our group.Desserts ranked in order of favorites for the birthday lady! 1. Brownie with vanilla ice cream 2. Carrot Cake came in a close second3. Cheese Cake4. Tiramisu rounded out the list.One of the things I love about eating family style is that if your personal dish sucks you can hopefully find a saving grace from another dish. That is was happened here, although my dish was not that great and the parmesan was disappointing, that lamb was a hit, the customer service, and the desserts were able to make up for the shortfalls.",11,2,5,Sheri S.,"Minneapolis, MN",578,580,1880
5.0,9/23/2018,"Woah! That was a damn good dinner! Totally satisfied my steak craving! We haven't had an overall awesome dining experience like this in a long time. From the moment we stepped in, the manager and every staff member treated us like one of their own. Really genuine guys. As for the dinner, we had the Tomahawk ribeye and Cajun ribeye. The Tomahawk was a nice classic seasoning. Nothing over the top nor bland. Just great flavor. The Cajun ribeye was the star. The Cajun rub was nothing over the top nor something you'd get sick of after a while. Great flavor that was nothing too spicy or salty. Added the foie gras a bit late so they added it on top of crostini which was just as great. Lots of it and cooked perfectly. Bone marrow was just as good. The sides were a bit smaller than I'm used to. The creamed spinach was the best I ever had!! Silky, creamy and savory flavor.  The truffle fries could've been better. A bit limp and not as crunchy. Ended the meal with Tiramisu which was great. Not dry and great flavor profile. Neither bitter or too dark of the cocoa. Definitely my top 2 best steak I've ever had.

5.0,9/4/2018,"I had the best dining experience in NYC to date at Greenwich Steakhouse when i visited the three-story restaurant with a few friends. Every single meal from appetizer to dessert was delicious, and we all left the restaurant in great spirits.For starters, I enjoyed the Pan Fried Calamari which is my go-to appetizer at any restaurant. Here it was fried to perfection and not too chewy. The Thick Cut Smoked Bacon, my friends and I shared, was my first time eating bacon cut so thick. It had the same delicious taste but looked like small pieces of steak. Every bite was washed down with the Pretty Woman cocktail which was poured with fresh blueberries. I was floored by the perfectly seasoned flavor of the Porterhouse Steak for Two or Three. I never tasted a steak so good. It was cut into easily shareable pieces that quickly disappeared because my friends and I all shared the same sentiment. For dinner, we also enjoyed the Baked Chicken Parmiagiana which I initially thought was pizza by the way it was plated. Taking my first bite I realized it was a juicy piece of chicken layered in the finest sauce and cheese. I do recommend diving into your meal and savoring the flavors altogether. My tastebuds enjoyed the blended flavors of the meaty Baked Rigatoni Bolognese and Roasted Salmon with Spinach.Lastly for dessert I had The Hot Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream. Again, Greenwich Steakhouse led me to believe this was the best vanilla ice cream I ever had. So rich in flavor and smooth in texture.All-around 10 out of 10. If you have a chance, dine any one of the beautifully designed dining rooms at Greenwich Steakhouse.

The salad and calamari were filling but I saved room for the outstanding Porterhouse Steak for 2. Both sides of the exorbitant sized steak were very tender and was one of the most delicious meals I've ever had along with the surprisingly good cream spinach.

We were seated upstairs, so unfortunately I don't think the atmosphere was as nice or elegant as it might have been in the other room. However, the food and the service made up for the lack of ambience. From the beginning, the bartenders were very helpful with the drinks and suggested a nice bottle of wine. For dinner, I had the baked clams, the filet mignon and brussel sprouts, and the chocolate lava cake. My friend had the fried calamari, filet mignon with mashed potatoes, and the cheesecake. Out of the appetizers, we both like the fried calamari but were a little underwhelmed with the baked clams which were more stuffing than clam. The real star of the meal was the filet mignon - THIS WAS UNREAL. Reminded me why it's worth going to a steakhouse. The sides weren't that good, but again the steak could come by itself and still be amazing. Lastly, we both enjoyed our desserts - the chocolate lava cake was extremely tiny (but it is restaurant week) but quite delicious.Overall, it was a good experience with excellent steak and good service.

My friends ordered the baked clams as an appetizer. Fried calamari was your typical fried calamari, no complaints there. But the baked clams were disappointing (only reason I deducted a star). There were shell remnants and overall had a terrible sour taste that made it difficult to eat. Filet Mignon was cooked to perfection and extremely filling. Highly recommend the creamed spinach as well. We topped off dinner with their delicious desserts: cheesecake, tiramisu, and chocolate lava cake with ice cream.

The pasta that it was served on was stuck together and when pulled apart was raw with flour dusting.

We had calamari (good) and crab cake (THE BEST) to start of. Then both had medium rare filet mignon which was one of the best I've had in the city, great quality and perfectly cooked. The deserts were good but we don't go to a steakhouse for desert. The people and service was top notch, from the hostess, bartender, waiter and the manager Benny who was on top of everything.

2.0,8/4/2018,"We were really looking forward to the restaurant week menu at the steakhouse, but were sorely disappointed. You DO NOT get the actual menu items. The restaurant week dishes, though called the same, are a completely different thing. For example, though we ordered the filet minion, we 100% got a piece of sirloin. It was so obvious, and there was no apology. The salmon was not the double cut, but rather a thin piece with soggy skin and a weird grey-ish sauce. Overall it was very disappointing and not worth the money. Totally short changed all restaurant week goers.",0,0,0,Eliana A.,"Berkeley, CA",9,5,0
2.0,8/3/2018,"My husband and I were here for New York restaurant week. Ordered bacon and clam for appetizer, bone in strip/garlic mashed potato and short rib ragu/Brussels sprouts for main, cheesecake and lava cake for dessert. I have to admit steak was good, but not good enough compared to other steakhouse restaurants in the city. Appetizers and desserts were okay, did not wow me though. The garlic mashed potato did not taste any garlic in it, and Brussels sprouts were soggy. My husband and I were so disappointed at short rib ragu, it was basically few tiny pieces of short rib beef in a flavorless tomato based pasta. I felt it was a waste to cook short rib ragu this way, and the pasta tasted like a food court pasta from a mall. If this was all, I would still give 3 stars. But I also ordered a drink which never came, when I asked for the check I found out this drink was included, so I told them I never got the drink, the waiter did not even apologize for it, all he said was he will check and get me a new receipt. During the whole dinner, the waiter only came once to check up on us, and when we told him that we were disappointed at short rib ragu, he just left without saying anything. We weren't even giving him attitude or complaining, it was because he asked us, so we said the truth, and he just left????? I don't think this is how they should react in a fine dining restaurant, or at least trying to be like a fine dining place. Overall, disappointed experience.",0,0,0,Fay L.,"Newark, NJ",2,9,36

Our waiter was very attentive and followed all the rules of a traditional gentleman: pulling out my chair, putting a napkin on my lap, and putting me first in everything. I personally love that!The food was superb. Delicious and cooked to perfection. My only suggestion would be for the chef to let the steaks rest before bringing them out. The plates were extremely hot and looked a bit sloppy with the juices still sitting on them and spattering with heat. Otherwise very nice.I think I would have only given 4 stars until I met the owner. He was very kind and wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. He asked about our stay in NYC and then bought us drinks.

5.0,7/30/2018,"ITEMS:Restaurant Week Review:I ordered the calamari, filet mignon with fries, and the chocolate lava cake. Everything tasted fabulous and the dishes were timed perfectly. The calamari was top quality and went perfectly with the marinara sauce. The filet mignon was flavorful, juicy and one of the best steaks I've had. The 10oz was pretty filling so I decided to take the rest home. The chocolate lava cake was my favorite item. It came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and the two complimented each other sooo well. AMBIANCEAbsolutely beautiful. I was seated upstairs in their large room in the booth. Very romantic or great for a small group. Light classical music in the background and dark lighting.

5.0,7/29/2018,"I recently visited this steakhouse for the first time with a group of friends; all of them big fans of steak. As we waited for our full party to arrive we enjoyed some well made beverages downstairs at the bar. When are group was complete we headed upstairs past a glass wall where you could peak right into the kitchen. We ordered some starters. Calamari, crab cake, baked clams, blistered shishito peppers and some incredibly thick cut bacon! The bacon was probably some of the best thick cut bacon I've ever had! The shishito peppers not overly salted like most places. I'd recommend any and all of those apps. As we moved on to dinner we ordered a veal shank parmigiana which you could cut through like butter with a dull knife and with one hand. That's how tender it was. We also had a bone in strip and Cajun rib eye. The beef quality here is amazing and the care they take in preparing it creates an impeccable steak!

Wait time for food and drinks are not bad expecting that you are getting the best. Excellent service! My friend was still talking about it the day after. FOOD: serving size is more than I expected. The FOOD, tasted really good. I had baked clams for appetizer that was seasoned well you won't have that sea taste(don't really know the term for it). My friend had the bacon which was cooked perfectly and is very good. We both have filet mignon which was cooked the way we wanted it. Their steak was tender and juicy, with or without the steak sauce it's very good. Then we both have desserts, my friend had tiramisu and I had the lava cake.

Our Waiters and ushers were really attentive and were constantly refilling our waters and making sure we were okay. The only downer about it was that I had thought we reserved the ""PRIVATE"" dining room which is the 3rd floor to ourselves  but people were coming up to use the bathroom (co-gender) and that was fine with us but the lock on the bathroom was broken and wouldn't lock properly, so while we were eating we experienced other people accidentally opening the doors while someone was in there. That was kinda awkward.

3.0,6/25/2018,"3.5 stars.Wanting to try a nice steak dinner I opted for this place with my husband for a ""date night.""RESERVATIONS - I was able to make reservations online about a week in advance so it wasn't that crowded at 6:30 pm.  Most people started coming in closer to 7:30 or later.ATMOSPHERE: There are 3 main areas to the restaurant.  There is the outside where it's a patio that is pretty casual, then there is the downstairs inside with the bar and more casual tables.  Then the upstairs (where I assume the people with reservations sit) is a nice white table cloth room with dim lighting.  The upper level is for private events.The atmosphere is almost a mix between an older steakhouse and a nice French restaurant.  It has these white tablecloths with blue velvet chairs so it seems pretty nice but it doesn't have that trendy, modern atmosphere that I prefer for date nights.  The service is very good although when you go early the waiters tend to stand around and I feel stared at.FOOD: Coming here for the steak we were debating between the tomahawk and the cajun.  Almost everyone on yelp recommends the cajun so we decided to get the 24 oz to share and then splurged and got 2 sides.CAJUN RIBEYE - we ordered it medium rare and it definitely was cooked correctly.  The inside was warm and pink with the center being almost red.  It comes sliced and sizzling on this tilted platter with the bone and the complementary bone marrow to eat with the steak.  For a ribeye it was marbled in some areas but then there were other areas that were a bit dry.  I was expecting all of the meat to be moist and tender but the edges were a little dry and charred (perhaps that's how they cook it).  In addition there were some parts that were a bit tough.  I did enjoy the bone marrow though.  It just wasn't the best ribeye or steak I've ever had. At $59, it's not cheap, but it's not ridiculous especially considering you can share it between 2 people and be full.TRUFFLE FRIES - the fries were pretty good, not an overwhelming truffle taste but enough to feel you're getting a truffle fry.  The only thing I disliked about the fries were that they were this really dark color with the skin still on them.  I prefer the lighter colored fries, with no skin, with a crisp, fresh taste to them.  These kind of reminded me of five guys fries.  My husband thought they were fine but I think it's a preference thing.BRUSSEL SPROUTS - the Brussel sprouts weren't roasted, which I refer with crispy outer shells (these are probably healthier).  The bacon was a nice addition and it was a cheap side compared to the other veggie options.Overall, we enjoyed our night with great service and overall A-OK food, but I can't say that I am a fan or that I would come back or recommend for best steak.",6,2,3,Brittany T.,"Manhattan, NY",1379,808,1533
5.0,6/11/2018,"Uptown vibes in a downtown location. My boyfriend picked this place for a recent date night - I'd never heard of it before, but it had glowing reviews everywhere I looked, so was very excited to try it. The steakhouse is located in a converted townhouse, with multiple stories - the ground floor appears to be more casual, with a TV playing whatever game is on, the second floor was more elegant with several tables, and I imagine there's probably another floor for private group events. We ordered the crab cakes, porterhouse for two, roasted mushrooms, and grilled asparagus to share. Everything was fantastic, but the steak was clearly the star. Cooked perfectly with an amazing flavorful sear all around, and no chewy/gristly parts that I've found in other steakhouses (only other place to have done this is Minetta Tavern's cote de bouef). For dessert, we split the tiramisu and the waiter brought us complimentary glasses of port and limoncello on the house to enjoy after the meal as well. Tiramisu was enormous and delicious - one of the better ones I've had, and I'm not generally a fan of the dish.Service was super friendly and attentive throughout, but not intrusive.The restaurant was completely empty through our entire meal, despite having some great cooking and service.

I had such a great time dining here, would recommend to everyone and I would absolutely come back again. For appetizers, I had the Tuna tartar, broiled lobster, and seafood tower.  The tuna tartar was super butter, the fish was fresh and you can tell it's high quality. I also preferred the broiled lobster over the chilled lobster on the seafood tower; the flavor is different and I enjoyed the charred taste of the broiled lobster.P.S. - ORDER THE TIRAMISU!!

Our host would not leave us alone at the table and it was as though he was performing as a stand up or something. Truly bizarre behavior bordering on the racist, calling us bro over and over, insinuating he understood people like us; I was pretty uncomfortable until the effects of the red wine kicked in. The dining hall on the middle floor was tastefully decorated and had suitable jazz music playing ambiently; unfortunately, this was drowned out by the loud EDM playing both upstairs in the club room and downstairs at the bar. There are many other steakhouses in the city where we could have gone for a bachelor party without having to feel like the first black people to go out to a classy dinner for a special occasion.

We literally threw the dice on this one and upon arriving, we didn't think we would have regrets. We were greeted with a warm welcoming and genuine smiles. They led us to a dining table on the second floor ( I came to find out they have 3 floors in total). According to my friend who went and used the bathroom, the penthouse dining room is amazing and ""super fancy"", decked out with both a chandelier and fireplace, in the middle of a wine cellar. Unfortunately for me, I didn't have to use the bathroom. The decor was nice on our floor, I thought the wallpaper/projector like decor was weird. (You have to see it, I can't even describe it). Anyways. Service was literally five stars. They all worked as a team and was on point for everything. My main server was the bomb. We ordered a few cocktails, pretty tasty but if you get it on the rocks, they add a lot of ice for that Bramble cocktail. That was the only disappointment. We ordered whiskey sours and they were $20 each. Appetizers: shrimp cocktails and east coast oysters. The shrimp was a bit tough but edible and the oysters were great...except for one. That one oysters was spoiled and reeked really bad. We didn't complain and I had already ate it before I noticed anything and was just praying for a good health the next day. Entrees/sides: one filet mignon each and we shared an order or asparagus, mashed potatoes and cream spinach. I ordered my steak medium rare and it was a medium well on the outsides with a rare in the middle. It was weird but some parts were juicy. The sides were on the smaller size and that alone was disappointing. Each steak came with a piece of bone marrow that was tasty. The mash was good but not great. The creamed spinach lacked flavor but did meet the description of having a creamy texture. And the asparagus was super forgettable. We both split the bill of almost 175 each. Pretty expensive, not a mind blowing dinner but we weren't crying. I wouldn't go out of my way to return but glad I at least tried it. Thank you guys for the flawless service.

5.0,3/1/2018,"Came here with a friend to celebrate a birthday. First time coming here and it's only because we were looking for a new place to try. It was a Wednesday evening and the restaurant was still pretty slow around 6:30pm. The bar is located at the first floor, and they have seating on the 2nd and 3rd floor as well.Food:- Yellow Fin Tuna Tartare -$18 - fresh fish, and the guac is a nice touch. I usually go for the thick cut smoked bacon in any steakhouse, but wanted to try something ""lighter"". It wasn't the best I ever had, but it's a great way to start off the meal.- 24oz Cajun Ribeye -  Most steakhouses offer sauce for your steaks at an additional cost. Greenwich steakhouse does too, but with the cajun ribeye, it's flavorful enough where you don't even need it! The steak was cooked perfectly and delicious. The awesome part is it comes with a side of bone marrow too! - Sides: I got the Roasted Mushrooms ($12) and Hashed Browns ($11)- compared to some steakhouses, I would say they're pretty generous with the sides. Pretty large portion and well priced. The mushrooms were a bit bland, but it did work well with the flavor of the cajun ribeye. The hashed browns were awesome and I would definitely order that again.Service was excellent as the waiters were pretty attentive and always ready to refill my water. Even the managers (or owner?) kept coming by to make sure everything was cooked to our liking and making sure we were enjoying our evening. The only downside was in the beginning when I only wanted regular tap water. Ended up being charged $10 for a fancy bottle of water which I really didn't need. I guess my fault for not clarifying.

Usually this is a major turn-off for me, but the meal was delicious, and for an early Valentine's dinner, the atmosphere was perfect. Got the tomahawk steak and the porterhouse medium rare, which comes with free bone marrow, and ordered the creamed spinach and baked clams on the side. Finished the meal with the chocolate lava cake. The tomahawk was the star of the show, fatty and tender. The chocolate lava cake could have been more lava-ey, but who am I to complain. Even the bread rolls at the start with soft butter were delicious. Fabulous place for an occasion.5 stars!!!!!",3,0,3,Bonnie G.,"New York, NY",171,592,1029

I can say with some certainty, we left well satisfied, stuffed and excited to come back soon!From the beginning the experience was everything you expect, we were greeted cordially by the manager of the restaurant, Benny, who showed us to our table and took a short bit to introduce himself further and the crew that would be taking care of us. The modern feel of the place was refreshing (not that we don't love Lugers more rustic feel!) and the staff was on point all evening to take care of us. My water never reached the half way mark without being refilled! From the appetizers (all of which we tasted were excellent, clams were especially wonderful, really hit all the flavors and textures you'd want when eating baked clams) to the entrees, the quality of food being served to us was superb. Each person in my group had a different choice of steak, but, we each got a piece of each others to make sure no one missed out! My veal was perfectly rare and seasoned well, and the surprise gem of the meal were the brussel sprouts.Benny came up to our table towards the end of our meal to check in and see how everything was, and sat down to chat and offer a glass of wine on him. My group was incredibly impressed by the hospitality at the Greenwich Steakhouse, particularly the manager Benny, he was a great host to my party and made the experience all the better.We will definitely be back!",0,0,0,Anthony C.,"Brooklyn, NY",377,3,0
5.0,2/3/2018,"I really want to like Greenwich Steakhouse. The Cajun Ribeye is great: marinated and juicy, tender  and comes out sizzling in a pool of Cajun spiced butter. It's satisfying and delicious. Sent with a side of bone marrow, too- this is a steak to put on a list to try. Not too impressed with the bread. Pretty standard with a LOT of butter. And, the sides are average. Creamed spinach lacked oomph. The hashbrowns (with chopped green pepper and onion) were cold inside, a bit greasy. They tasted alright but did not wow me for 12 dollars. Edit: this is how attentive Benny is here- he noticed my review and addressed it while I was still in the restaurant. Instead of getting defensive he took it in, asked for more feedback and committed to improving. This kind of customer service is exemplary and more than made up for the sides.The staff were all fantastic, especially the intelligent and elegant hostess.

5.0,1/27/2018,"What a delicious experience from start to end!!! We started the evening with drinks, I love whiskey sours with egg whites, it wasn't on the menu but the bartender was eager to fulfill my request. They also use Luxardo cherries instead of the disgusting fake red 40 filled maraschino cherries which to me already means your drinks are 5 Star! Next we had shrimp cocktail, our waiter Chris said there was only 4 to an order...well there colossal so one per person for our 4 person party was perfect. They came with cocktail sauce and a mysterious yet delicious green sauce.Now on to our meals...I order the bone in New York strip medium rare...delish!! Bone in means more flavor and this steak needed no accompanying sauces for flavor it was already there! For the table we ordered garlic mashed potatoes, Brussels sprouts with bacon, mushrooms and onions, onion rings, and truffle fries...yes we went a little crazy...but it was all worth it!!! The sides are for sharing so everyone got a nice tasting of each. Our wine for dinner was the 2014 Aymara Reserva Cab Sauv from Argentina, stood up well to the steaks but was an each drink on its own.Our server Chris did a great job in making sure our dining experience was pleasurable. He was quick to ask if everything was to our liking and quick to get whatever we needed.Now for the owner Benny...why can't every restaurant owner make you feel as special as Ben y does???!!

Host and bar were pleasant and friendly, and bread basket was good, but it was downhill from there. Service was slow in arriving, and came back after 15 min to ask again what we had ordered (without explanation - would it be late? Had he not entered it in yet?).  Then more long waits. Food finally arrived, but filet was undercooked so we sent it back. Received same exact steak plate back, now cooked longer. Bone marrow appetizer arrived congealed and lacked any seasoning (only time I've ever left bone marrow uneaten in my life!). Then had to request side order of béarnaise twice, and it arrived cold and congealed so had to send it back and request a third time so it was finally pourable.  No acknowledgement or apology from service or any staff on long waits or repeated mistakes. Nobody checked in.Normally I would give a restaurant a pass on poor service on a single night...but for  the high price point AND the sloppy food execution as well AND lack of awareness by front of house.",0,0,0,Rky L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,62,31

At first glance the yellow awning makes the place look tres casual but once you are inside there are velvet bar chairs and exemplary service from the staff that make this experience 5/5 on this Saturday night.I got a tour of the little three story restaurant which has little embellishments everywhere that make the place more upscale. There are only two restrooms in the whole place, one on the first floor and one on the third. The third floor accommodates large parties of people. The first floor is more casual and has the big ten championship on play at the moment.I love that this steak comes with marrow. The steak is great and seasoned well but could use a little condiment. The marrow does help fatten up and smooth out the steak. The creamed spinach is fresh and although I mostly can't stand it it is a popular side. The hash is also good.Overall the food was great but the service was even better. We got a free glass of wine and plenty of jovial compliments and smiles all around.

It might have been too much food for a normal couple :) Portion sizes were so generous and the presentation of the food was beautiful. But we really have to give credit to the entire waitstaff for the memorable night. Everything was so thoughtful and perfectly executed - for example, two people brought our beers over and poured them into chilled glasses at the same time.

This was that occasion and I didn't want to disappoint my grandmother who is old school and doesn't believe in being vegan. I love her so when in Rome. I told her I would break it for the entree only. I was very surprised when the staff was so kind and helped put several Plant based dishes for me. Then it was time to make my grandmother happy so they ordered several cuts of meat for the table. I sampled a few pieces to make her happy. When I'm forced to eat meat. I hope it's here. It was amazing. The manager Benny was so understanding and helpful. I have not always had the same treatment at other places. Thank you Greenwich Steakhouse. I will be back. Don't tell anyone.

5.0,10/7/2017,"Cannot say enough positive things. Food was excellent, loved the ambiance (very very impressed with the decor, flatware, all gorgeous) and the staff is beyond incredible. My date and I were looking for something to eat impromptu and we walked past Greenwhich Steakhouse and he noticed the TV at the bar (so he could watch the game of course). The manager was extremely welcoming and kind, happy to have us seated at the bar for dinner and immediately changed the channel and spoke with us through the night. The bar tender might be the winner though. He is absolutely adorable - very welcoming, knowledgeable and friendly. He goes over and above to provide attention to all his patrons. When I come back (not 'if' this is absolutely a 'when') I might just decide to sit at the bar again to interact with him. Truly wonderful experience.

We each had different cuts of steak and they were all great, but I think my tomahawk ribeye was the best of the evening.  We generally don't go back to the same restaurant twice in Manhattan because there is so much to sample from, but I'm sure we'll be back here on our next trip!",1,0,1,Bruce W.,"Torrance, CA",0,10,0

4.0,8/13/2017,"Rocked up here at 8 on a Friday night having picked up a reservation 15 minutes previously. The place was pretty empty inside, but had 5 of the 8 or so tables outside occupied. It's so great to be able to eat outside in New York during summer, and the live music across the street was a delightful addition to the ambience. Shishito peppers were plentiful and grilled nicely, although a prefer mine with a little more seasoning. We followed that up with a chopped house salad and the 48 oz porterhouse - a monster of a steak which was charred beautifully on the outside to a crisp crust, yet remained medium rare internally. The truffle fries were a little wilted and sad, and didn't have much in the way of truffle flavor though. Washed down with a couple of glasses of wonderful Bordeaux, the meal felt good. Just a couple of tweaks needed to make this a great steakhouse for the neighborhood - and a dessert menu would be great.

5.0,7/1/2017,"You Say Porterhouse I Say POWERHOUSE!!!I dined here for my sister's birthday a few short months after the restaurant opened so I called Greenwich Steakhouse ahead of time and asked them to please make the evening extra special because I adore my sister. They made a few suggestions that didn't necessarily suit my sister's personality so I was concerned that they were not going to be able to please her but boy was I wrong!!First of all, the ambience on the second floor dining room is absolutely beautiful!!! The luxurious navy blue seats and the fresh white tablecloths are perfect compliments to each other.Secondly the food is off the chart DELICIOUS!!! Make sure ur hungry when you go because I insist that you go with a group and that you share some appetizers including the bacon which is to die for, the crab cake, and the Caesar salad. All of these items are very reasonably priced and well worth the money. Trust me!!!! As for the main course, I had the Ribeye which was the size of my entire plate and it was cooked to perfection. I had originally ordered the Cajun Ribeye because I enjoy Cajun spices and I like a bit of heat but it was wayyyy toooo salty for consumption and our waiter, Benny, insisted on removing it and bringing me something else to make me happy.  Nice customer service.Thirdly, the wait staff was exceptional. There was always someone nearby to cater to our needs. We never had to wait for assistance. Now back to it being my sister's birthday--at the end of our very extraordinary meal, I wasn't sure that Benny remembered that I had requested a special cake for the end of the meal because I couldn't confirm it prior because she was with me. So just as I was about to inquire, he winked at me so I knew that my plan was in play. Then 5 minutes later a bunch of waiters came out with the appropriate amount of carrot cake and a candle and they all sang to my sis and served us all birthday cake. Shortly after that they served us a glass of champagne with floating strawberries. Shortly after that they served us some of the BEST COFFEE I ever had in my life and I've traveled to Hawaii and lastly they brought out a few glasses of aged port and guess what!!!! Everything that I listed starting with the carrot cake was complimentary!!!! This place was simply outstanding in all areas!!! I will definitely return there and I highly recommend it to all!!!

We did order the roasted mushrooms, they were delicious too. The staff is extremely attentive, experience and super friendly.  Customer service is as superb as the steak. We highly recommend this steakhouse if you are serious about a eating a great steak. It is worth every dollar!! We are not big fans of a thick cut steak but we were completely sold when we ate it.

5.0,6/28/2017,"I haven't written a review in years, but had to for this place. This may have been the most amazing all-around restaurant experience I have had in quite some time. It was my birthday yesterday, and I went with my parents, had a reservation for 7PM. Unbeknownst to me, there are tables on the sidewalk (the location is amazing and the weather was phenomenal), but we could not procure one in time. In the meantime, the host/maitre'd Benny, gave us a seat next to the bar while we waited for an outside table to open up. While we were waiting, he regaled us with his kindness, background on the restaurant, and other great stories. After getting our drinks exactly right (both my parents can have difficult drink orders), he sent out a bevy of items on the house, including oysters and shishito peppers. All of the appetizers, including the shrimp cocktail, were great. He then sent us free champagne for my birthday. As the outside diners took a while, he made sure that we were taken care of at every turn, not hesitating to accommodate any requests. He then took us outside once one of the tables opened up. The services was incredibly prompt and on point, and I got the cajun ribeye (terrific), my dad got the lamb chops (some of the best he's had he said), and my mom got a filet that she could not stop raving about. The grilled asparagus was good, and the truffle fries were delicious. Lastly, when we asked for the check, he brought out a piece of cake and four limoncello shots on the house (he took one with us!). Needless to say, he made the dinner unforgettable. The space itself is beautiful, as it seems to be a converted townhouse, and there is a private room on the 3rd floor for private parties for up to 30 people. One of the most hospitable people I have ever met, and one of the most pleasant and delicious meals I have ever had. I can't say enough about the place and its staff. They really do go the extra mile to make sure you are enjoying yourself and your food, and that goes an incredibly long way in my opinion. Eat here, I promise you won't regret it.

Turned out that we picked the right place to go. Thought it would be packed in a Sunday night. Surprisingly, there were only a few parties, which was good for us because we like quiet places. We sat in the second floor. Everything at the restaurant was super comfy and fancy. The waiter was super nice, he treated us like we were premium customers. So, we had a little talk with the waiter and realized that this place just opened recently, which was very impressive because it seemed like they really know how to run a restaurant good. We then ordered a tons of food, started with the red wine, then the oysters, bacon, Cajun ribeyes, foie gras, and creamed spinach. The bacon came with three huge pieces, wouldn't recommend it for small parties. The Cajun ribeyes was really good too. It was juicy, savory, and chewy. The price was also acceptable. The total was 158 and we gave them 22% tips. Overall, this place is a must try. If I could give them a 6 stars I would. I would definitely come back again.",1,0,0,Emma L.,"Jamaica, NY",114,31,47

5.0,5/27/2017,"Greenwich Steakhouse overall score: 89Greenwich Steakhouse is a newly opened French-inspired steak joint in the West Village. Chef Victor Chavez helped open Smith & Wollensky, and is a 30yr veteran chef from there. He tried retirement, but decided that he wanted to be back in the game. As such, he opened Greenwich Steakhouse.Flavor: 8Cajun Rib Eye: 10/10I'm starting with the best steak first. This baby was cooked to a perfect medium rare from end to end with an awesome savory crust on the edges.But the hint of cumin in the Cajun rub really sets this baby off as the best steak in the joint.The spicy oil at the bottom of the place is reminiscent of the delicious sauce you get with the cumin lamb noodles at Xian Famous Foods, which I love.When you come here, this is the steak to get. Chef Victor just absolutely nails it.48oz Porterhouse: 8/10This is nice and thick, and really goes great with the marrow butter sauce addition.There was some grey banding since this is such a thick cut of steak, but nothing was dried out.48oz Tomahawk Rib Eye: 6/10Unfortunately this was a bit overcooked for our liking. Some parts were dry as a result, but the flavor was still nice.Choice of Cuts & Quality Available: 9All the meat here come from Strassburger, a great supplier. Chef Victor dry ages them for three weeks in-house to develop a bit more flavor for his guests. There are several sizes of the four major cuts available.Portion Size & Plating: 9Portions here are pretty big. The plating is on the nicer side with steel pans being used as serving vessels.Price: 10The prices are on par with midtown NYC steakhouses.Bar: 7The bar is a short stretch on the first floor with some seats along the window for people watching.It's on a nice stretch of Greenwich Ave in the village too, so likely will be a good spot for nightlife.Cocktails are nice, particularly the Great Kills.Specials and Other Meats: 9The waiter read us some specials that were not on the menu. We tried one of them, a shredded Brussels sprout salad. I thought it could use some more dressing, but it was tasty.For alternative meats, they offer a nice variety: veal, chicken and lamb. Perhaps a pork chop would round it out. We tried the lamb and it was incredible. So nicely seasoned and flavorful.Apps, Sides & Desserts: 8This is the best thick cut bacon I've ever had. It was about a half inch thick, and each order comes with three massive slabs. We cut them each in half since we had a table of six.The fries are pretty good as well:The marrow is overkill. If you are eating steaks here, each cut will come with some roasted bone marrow, so no need to go for the app. Here are three delicious boats of bone meat though:Creamed spinach was also nice:As well as the hash browns:For dessert, we went with the ice cream tartufo:Creme brulee:And chocolate cake:All were good, but my favorite was the creme brulee.Seafood Selection: 10We tried the seafood tower, which comes with oysters, king crab, shrimp, lobster and lumb crab meat.The shrimp were massive! For entree items, they offer tuna, halibut, lobster, sole and salmon.  Branzino was on special as well. That's a serious variety!Service: 10The staff here is all top notch. The guys are pure gentlemen and it doesn't surprise me that Chef Victor would staff his joint with such people. The table breads are served from a basket at the outset.Ambiance: 9They've done an awesome job with the space here. The main dining room is on the second floor and boasts elegant chairs and a bright space. Very different from other steak joints.The third floor has a huge table for parties, and holds about 8000 bottles of wine in elegant glass-windowed rooms flanking each side.",39,18,30,JohnnyPrimeC.

The bar area is a wonderful place to ""get the evening started"". The service was absolutely first-class. However, it was the food that makes this place our new favorite steakhouse! The appetizers (crab cakes and the special grilled octopus) were extraordinary. I do not exaggerate when I state that these were the best crab cakes I have EVER had!!! The grilled octopus was perfectly done (not overcooked and dry) and delicious. Then the real stars of the evening arrived...Porterhouse for 2 and Tomahawk ribeye for 2. They were out of this world! Huge slabs of the tastiest meat on the bone cooked to (medium rare) perfection. We went whole hog and had foie gras and bone marrow in addition to béarnaise and au poivre sauce. Truly these were the absolute best steaks that my friend and I have had in NYC. The creamed spinach and home fries were most worthy companions to the steaks. We had several bottles of a fine Lalande de Pomerol in addition to pre-dinner drinks. We were in heaven by the end of the meal!!! I cannot rave enough about this new ""find"" of ours. The staff and manager, Benny, couldn't have been nicer to us. We look forward to returning many, many times!!! Bravo to the team at Greenwich Steakhouse...you have a real winner of a restaurant!!!",1,0,2,Keith T.,"New York, NY",137,6,0
5.0,4/1/2017,Nice change to the typical steakhouse scene. Beautiful and bright decor. Perfectly cooked dry aged steaks. I had the tomahawk ribeye complimented with bone marrow and truffle French fries.  Staff was attentive but not obtrusive.

5.0,3/30/2017,"In a city with a plethora of Steakhouses, Greenwich Steakhouse might very well be my new favorite. For starters, the service and food were top notch. I had an amazing bone in rib-eye, that was cooked a perfect medium rare and dry aged to perfection. It also came with a side of delicious bone marrow at no extra charge. What made my experience complete and most memorable was a visit from Chef and owner Victor Chavez, to see how dinner was going. Quite honestly, I was caught off guard, LOL. But it proves that there are not any egos at this Steakhouse. The restaurant is beautifully decorated with all your Steakhouse favorites on the menu. I will definitely be returning soon. Job well done Greenwich Steakhouse.",0,0,1,Greg G.,"New York, NY",22,25,29
5.0,3/27/2017,"This is a steakhouse that doesn't look like any other.  From the lit fireplaces to the brightly lit dining room, the restaurant is stunning - and then there's the food.  From start to finish my family and I were impressed.  The steaks were cooked to perfection, the cocktails were standout and even the dessert was memorable.

5.0,3/17/2017,"Beautiful new space and concept in a great location. Excellent food, wonderful service, accommodating staff. This place only opened recently, and it seems to be doing everything right. Often, when restaurants are new they sometimes stumble finding their footing. Not Greenwich Steakhouse. Everything aspect of the meal was perfectly prepared and served. An outstanding meal. I would recommend it to everyone.",0,0,1,Jarrod H.,"ASTORIA, NY",6,6,0
5.0,3/14/2017,"This is the 21st-century take on a classic steakhouse. I came on a weekday for a client dinner and as soon as I walked in, the staff greeted me and my guest like family. The atmosphere is very modern yet has a classic French twist. I had the Dover sole which was the best cut of fish I've had in a while. My client had the bone-in ribeye and he said it was delicious as well. Throughout the evening the staff was adamant on making sure we were enjoying our night and we surely did. Benny, The general manager, gave us a thorough review of the top wine selections and even directed us in making the right choice. Thank you Greenwich Steakhouse for an amazing dinner and I will definitely be back soon!",2,0,1,Alfred C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",57,3,11

1.0,3/12/2017,"Went there last night for the first and last time. Staff was overly friendly and courteous but took till food was served that it's all for show. They all oversold everything as if they are working on commission.the $13 Greenwich salad consisted of a handful of lettuce a few pieces of marinated mushrooms and when split -shared it was about 2 tablespoons . The dressing was nice not great. Shared another Ap of Octopus which was overpriced consisted of 2 tentacles tasty but not great, nor when served did anyone offer to plate it.Steak was overaged tasted sour/spoiled undercooked And not that tender. The waiter offered several sauces which I took him up on but never appeared. The truffle fries had no taste of truffle but were good. The sautéed spinach was put on the table and never served and required server all requests for spoons to serve. My friend had to ask for his second glass of wine two times. Overall a terrible place will never survive and that's a benefit to others . None ever came by to ask how food was, except when trying to sell dessert.

4.0,3/9/2017,"Just beautiful inside, very friendly and knowledgeable waitstaff. Cocktails and the steak itself was delicious , I requested black and blue and they delivered! Just a  tweak or two  are needed and I'm sure they will straighten them out. The Wedge salad needs help- it wasn't a wedge, and there wasn't much salad! Just a few leaves of slightly wilted, probably pre dressed lettuce was brought to us and it was disappointing. For premuim pricing this salad needs making over. Hoping to hear soon it has been!",1,0,2,Katy H.,"New York, NY",86,31,1

5.0,3/7/2017,Just what the Village needed. My husband and I came in for drinks and dinner and to check out this jewel of a restaurant. The Ribeye is by far the best I've had in a long time. And the shishito peppers app is great. The decor is gorgeous classy but sleek and modern. The staff was very welcoming and make you feel at home. Our waiter Manny was very curious and knolwledable.

5.0,3/6/2017,"Came here to celebrate my husband's birthday. The space is just beautiful, and perfect for a special occasion.We started with the grated brussel sprouts with toasted almonds, pecorino, and olive oil. Just delicious, and the order was large enough for us to share.I ordered the filet mignon and my husband ordered the 24oz. ribeye. Both were cooked as we requested(medium/rare for me,and medium for him). For sides, we had the rosemary fries and the mushrooms. Both terrific.The meal was very good, and the only possible criticism i have is that the filet mignon was too salty. After dinner, I learned that I could have requested that it be served without the salt.Service was very attenteive, but not annoying. Everyone was extremely pleasant and Greenwich Steakhouse is a very welcome addition to our neighborhood. I wish them lots a luck.Susan",0,0,2,Susan L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0
5.0,3/2/2017,"There's no shortage of incredible steakhouses in New York City, and Greenwich Steakhouse is one that definitely stands out from the rest! From the moment you walk in, the breathtaking decor is certainly a sight for sore eyes! Greenwich is one of those places that will always be seen as a classic, but still has modern flair. The hostess was very friendly, and the service was attentive and extremely professional. Customer service is just as important as the food an establishment serves, and Greenwich was spot on. Speaking of food, it was incredible! I suggest bringing some friends along so you can taste all the dishes! It's the perfect place for a romantic date, or when you want to have something out of the ordinary. I'll be back!",0,0,2,Bethel Hailu D.,"Manhattan, NY",14,28,35

5.0,2/24/2017,Legendary Chef Victor Chavez is back and better than ever with a slight spin on the classic American steakhouse. Instead of the usual dark ambiance of the classic steakhouse Greenwich Steakhouse provides a colorful clean look. The fireplaces and the colorful décor create a chic vibe like no other Manhattan steakhouse. Perfect for the trendy Greenwich Village. The food was incredible but as expected from Chef Chavez. The staff is incredibly friendly and they make you feel like you are eating a meal in the comfort of your home.
