The food was pretty good, but I am an eggs Benedict CONNOISEUR! It was not the best I've had but pretty good. LOTS of alcohol options if you want to do bottomless. Not really a place for kids but if you feel crazy take em. Nice location. Overall very nice and pretty spot with great food!PS I dropped my knife and they immediately replaced it.

Our waiter, Jared, was awesome right from the start and he only got better as he helped us decide on what to order. I have ridiculous allium allergy issues and he went above and beyond to make sure I would be able to eat something! He was attentive and really seemed to care that we were having a good time. The food was delicious, especially the beet chips, which are a work of art! But, everything was wonderful and I was able to enjoy my meal without fearing there was hidden garlic or onion. Highly recommend!!",0,0,0,Gene-Manuel W.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,5,1
5.0,4/11/2019,"My daughter had her wedding party for about 100 guests . Everything went smoothly . The helpers ( under David's supervision) were  actually helpful. The food was good, especially octopus, heard good things about gnocchi with mushrooms- but never had a chance to try. The drinks were pretty good, as well. The most important in  Bobo is  it's unique atmosphere and  inner energetics,  so you feel serene  and festive  at the same time. As we mostly tried  refreshments, I will definitely come for a more substantial meal and will keep you posted. Special thanks to David - his professionalism and charisma are outstanding!

5.0,4/6/2019,"Oh my goodness. Everything's good here! Octopus, filet mignon, and chicken liver were my top favs!The steak was so perfectly cooked and it was very juicy, I was not disappointed! It has a very peppery coating which was a little bit intense but the flavor was so good.The chicken liver had a sweetness to it that I liked. We were all fighting for the dish. Beet chips were good but I don't think it's really worth it. The salmon entree was a bit more rare than I'd like so I'd say it was my least favorite although it was tasty. The salmon tartare however was delish! The bleu cheese from the cheese board was sooo creamy, I'd get it again and again! The Malbec was my favorite wine, definitely get the bottle. The atmosphere is very cute, good for a date night or out with friends and the service was friendly and attentive. I would definitely recommend it and return!",1,1,1,Annie C.,"Flushing, NY",105,61,188

5.0,4/2/2019,Absolutely excellent restaurant on all fronts.  I was curious as to what this place would be like because I had heard good things but then also saw a lower than expected rating on Yelp.  No idea why because this place was outstanding for us last night.  Five of us went here to celebrate a friend's engagement-- they immediately brought out champagne for us upon seating and the service was top notch throughout.  The place itself is super charming.  Feels like you are eating in a beautiful french home.  The cocktails and food was also superb.  I had the crispy skin salmon and it was delicious.  We will certainly be back -- especially to enjoy the garden rooftop during the warmer months.,0,0,0,Amelia M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,13,0

While we were searching where to go, we went to there web site which never mentioned that they have only pre-fixed menu that day ( we never go for prefixed one, cause it usually garbage), so once we get to the BOBO, we were forced to order from valetines dinner menu. For starters we ordered octopus, which was good and my husband enjoyed it, I got scallop tartar which was one note taste with too much oil, it needed some acidity and some herbs to elevate the flavor. As far as I know it also should go with some rey bread/chips which were not there .For the main course I got salmon, which was a bright light in the darkness.

4.0,2/9/2019,"My friend found this cozy French restaurant for a get together dinner. The restaurant has two levels. The first level is the bar, so it's quite noisy and cold during the winter. The second level is much quieter with dim lighting.I ordered the homemade potato gnocchi that came with cremini & maitake mushrooms in a porcini-cognac cream. I wasn't expecting to have such good gnocchi here. The texture was very soft and pillowy. I liked the extra crunch from the fried cremini mushrooms. I wish they gave more maitaki mushrooms though. For the group we shared some fries, which could have been more crisp, and a plum tarte du jour. The waiter kept on saying the tart was too small to share for our group of five, but when it came out the slice was huge and easily shareable. Although I had more than my share of bites because the crust was so tasty. I would come back just for the gnocchi and plum tarte.",13,7,12,Jocelyn K.,"Jersey City, NJ",479,885,4955

3.0,2/1/2019,"Better than 3 but less than a 4. Came here with a group of friends for restaurant week.  For our first course we ordered soup, salad and steak tartare. Steak tartare was the table favorite and was delicious . For entree our server highly recommended the BOBO cassoulet. We got that and the health conscious in the group got the trout. The cassoulet was definitely a disappointment after all that was said, it didn't match our expectation. It was too dry and not what we expected a stew dish to be. We followed this my a round dessert - chocolate mousse was delicious though not very light and the lemon tart was too lemony for our liking.

Once my friends arrived we were taken upstairs to this charming oversized living room/parlor floor where David, the General Manager sat us. David throughout our entire dining experience made sure we were all well taken care of. I told him I actually live in the area and had never been in and I must say I can't wait to come back!  Our helpful and knowledgable Waitress, Diana was super attentive and friendly and she too checked on us constantly to make sure we had everything we needed. All in all the entire staff was the nicest and the food was top notch, each dish we ordered was super delicious. The only negative was that we were so stuffed from all the food we ordered and my friends had to catch a train back to new jersey that I missed out on having a birthday desert!  But I do plan on going back to treat myself to one of their amazing deserts!  I highly recommend Bobo.",0,0,0,Eileen M.,"Manhattan, NY",47,31,0

5.0,12/5/2018,"My partner and I were meeting friends for dinner in the West Village of NYC.  It was raining and we just wanted to get out of the rain.  So when we found our friends, we were walking and we saw the sign for Bobo's and we just like, ""Ah screw it, let's get a drink there for now and figure out what we want to get for dinner."".  We sat at the bar first and got drinks.  The bartender was very nice, making conversation with us.  We ordered the beet chips. They were perfectly salted and crispy.  It was happy hour so it was cheaper.  After about an hour and a half, we decided to stay for dinner and moved to a table.  We got about 5 dishes and shared them family style, including the gnocchi, chicken, octopus, and lamb shoulder.  My partner got a salad.  Everything was delicious.  We were really happy with what we got.  We also got dessert at the end.  I had ice cream.  My friend got the special pumpkin tart.  My other friend got the chocolate mousse.  It was a great ending to a great dessert.  Even my partner noted after wards that the food was really good, and he's usually critical of most restaurants.  The ambience is very casual with dim lighting.  You can hold a conversation with your dinner buddies.  The place is kinda small so it fills up fast.  I think we would return for sure next time we're back east.",0,0,0,Anne F.,"Tucson, AZ",3,95,139

As soon as we walked down the few steps into the bar area, I felt like I was walking into the coziest old house with beautiful Xmas lighting against an old time brick and wood backdrop. We had reservation for upstairs but told hostess my son would be late and they happily led us to an intimate table in bar area and assured us we were welcome to take our time and order while waiting for my son. They were incredibly friendly, patient and helpful and we finally decided to just stay in bar after son came and they helped us move to bigger table. Our waitress, Maura, was the sweetest friendliest most helpful person I've ever encountered and made our experience awesome. Ordered grilled octopus and gnocchi to start and later chicken and salmon and we were in heaven over every bite including the drinks.

A quick chat with the manager though and our experience turned around quickly, as he made sure to get our food out ASAP and added multiple side dishes to try and compensate for the trouble. To boot, they gave us an extra desert and a round of desert wines to cap off the evening.

3.0,12/3/2018,"BOBO is a small unique restaurant in West Village. We chose this restaurant because we wanted somewhere that was good but aesthetically pleasing. My review is grounded in the following four grading criteria:Experience: The restaurant is very cute. You enter through a small door to a first floor bar. The restaurant is upstairs and is beautifully decorated with natural and organic items.Service: The service was very good to excellent. It is very telling that everyone has been trained and well versed in service. I will note the tempo and deliverence of the service is shy of perfect.Food: The food is where the restaurant lost one star. I ordered the steak and my friend, the chicken. For the steak, there is nothing particularly interesting or outstanding on the steak. It was just okay. The chicken was very salty and mediocre. Price: The price is where the restaurant lost its second star. It was overly pricey for the quality of food.TL/DR: Beautiful restaurant with over priced food.

Our server tried to be attentive, but in general the service was quite slow.For example, we ordered two coffees that did not arrive until after our appetizer and after our entrees arrived. Our server did check on the coffees once but it still took long to arrive. (Coffees are usually pretty easy to put together) Once we received our entrees, both were a little lukewarm.

We ordered the pastry basket to share which had fluffy croissants - normal, chocolate, and apple! The jam was also very delicious.

Perfect date or family spot. Very friendly staff, paid close attention to us, never had an empty water glass. Got the pastry basket, wow! Must get! The jam and butter alone are worth the $10. Then the pastries are just bonus. My entree was a fancy French dish I couldn't possibly say (I blame my high school). The meurette en cocotte. A smaller dish compared to the burger that my partner got. I'd likely not order it again. Flavor profile was limited, a bit too greasy and salted. Also got the duck fat potatoes. More like potato chips. They were okay. Again limited in flavor. One other small issue was a bathroom was very close to were I was eating and let's just say, the circulation wasn't the best.

5.0,10/27/2018,"Bobo is a place in our neighborhood that we had ""written off"" as a place where beautiful people go, and where we didn't belong.  We were wrong.  And the food is terrific.  Drinks are ridiculously underpriced and big and strong.  We had a bunch of small plates (panisse, octopus, brandade croquettes, terrine), and one big one (cassoulet, a special.  Maybe the best restaurant version we've ever had), and then a cheese plate for dessert.  Every single item was wonderful.  Some of the dishes (the terrine, the  brandade croquettes), fit right into the ""homestyle,"" or ""farmhouse""  French theme of the place.  I wish there were more:  beef  bourginon instead of steak,  poule a pot instead of roast chicken, but that has more to do with what I'd like than what the place is.  Service was real sweet too.  It's another one of those places:  be nice to the server, the server will take REAL good care of you.    We waited too long to go.  Next time will be much sooner",0,0,0,Norman H.,"New York, NY",101,75,0

When I got the bill, I was certainly taken back by the total, but in the end, I left thinking I'd come back, so I guess I rounded up my 3.5 stars to 4. Aesthetics, ambiance, plates, utensils, glasses, menu - were all on point. Food was honestly delicious too, but each item was about $2-3 more expensive than what they really should have been. I guess I should've expected the total to come out as such, since this is in West Village...but if you don't appreciate the holistic dining experience, I'm not sure you will feel entirely justified.Regardless, everything we ordered was fabulous, and here's what we ordered:Appetizers - Beet chips, heirloom tomato salad, croquettes Main - Seared hanger steak, homemade potato gnocchiSide - Fries (of course)I would recommend all!",0,0,0,Lisa L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",385,62,678

The watermelon tomato appetizer was super yummy and I was slightly less impressed by the cheese plate, but it was still pretty good.

Be warned though - the portions are tiny, but thankfully the mousse was generous. Also, wine has to come upstairs from the bar, which was unfortunate because the bar was so backed up we had finished our meal before our second glasses arrived even though we had ordered while eating the appetizers so we ended up canceling it.

5.0,8/2/2018,"Not sure why this restaurant doesn't have 5 stars. Bobo is a French country chic restaurant space tucked away into an unassuming corner building in the West Village. It is exactly what I have always envisioned my future European summer house to look like... exposed wooden beams, vintage tile (or wallpaper that looks like tile, whatever), and an intimate dining space in a rooftop garden - with perfect dim lighting, of course. When it comes to ambiance, I really am not sure what else you can ask for.The food is top notch. The portions are small, but don't let that deter you because each dish is jam-packed with flavor... simple but so good. My BF and I decided to try a few apps here since we weren't starving (shocker). What we ordered:A perfect dozen of oysters - shucked very well (not a ton of shell like you can expect at some other places) and obviously fresh, served with mignonette and lemon as they should be.The brandade croquettes - salted cod croquettes served on top of a  black olive tapenade that will honestly rock your world. My BF was hesitant that I wouldn't like this, but this dish was perfectly executed. I'd love to try to recreate this at home one day, but Bobo really knocked this one out of the park.The salmon tartare - so, so good. Served up with chili oil and basil... simple but delicious. Just wish we had some more bread to accompany this at the time, but we gobbled it up anyway.The wine selection was awesome, but we came in with Sancerre on our mind. It was served chilled to perfection and paired very nicely with the dishes we ordered to share.Our server was friendly and knowledgeable on the menu, and even went out of her way to find my BF a pear-flavored after-dinner liquor that he was looking for (traditionally served with sugar in France, and sipped slowly). They didn't have the exact kind he asked for, but we definitely appreciated that she looked for this. It was definitely an unexpected request from our end, but our server really did deliver.Reservations were super easy - made ressos on OpenTable for a Saturday night and once we arrived, we waited less than 10 minutes to be seated in the garden area. I'll definitely be making reservations (and requesting seats in the gorgeous garden area again) for the near future. I'd love to try the entrees and dessert.5 stars for Bobo!

We had a family style dinner party and the menu selected by my friends was just perfect for everyone.  Special thanks to our server Jonathan and the host that night for making sure all 15 of us were fed and had a good night.  Jonathan is a sweetheart for going above and beyond with the service and even playing In My Feelings by Drake at the end of the night as per my request : )",0,0,0,Tugba A.,"Weehawken, NJ",16,9,11
5.0,7/8/2018,"Second annual Birthday trip here and what a wonderful experience once again. Restaurant has been recently refreshed with a new decor, making it feel as though you were dining in someone's lovely country house in Provence. Starting with the stellar friendly service from Christian in the lower, rathskeller vibe bar, nice mix of bespoke cocktails and a lovely wine selection. The Happy prices (5pm-7pm) are so reasonable as to be jaw dropping, particularly for the West Village, and there is a nice selection of small plates and bar bites to nibble on. Upstairs there are two areas, one outside/patio dining room, with a new glass ceiling that opens the whole place up and an indoor area with two restored vintage (non working) fireplaces and tasteful, modern/classic decor. Mark or Cat and a variety of food runners and others provide casual, but pristine service and have an incredibly thorough knowledge of the food, not only ingredients but preparation style and the type of meal you will experience. We had the cod croquettes with olive tapenade and chickpea fritters for apps, salmon with cucumber creme fraiche and fluke with faro special and an apricot tart and rhubarb bread pudding for dessert. All quite reasonable for this level of food and service. A lovely rose and pinot noir accompanied. We will definitely be back. Cannot recommend highly enough!",0,0,0,C M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,12,57

I mean, who doesn't love brunch? From our ceremony to send-off, the staff at Bobo made sure that we and our guests were well taken care of and it was such an incredible relief to know they were taking care of all the details for us (and Bobo was also very accommodating for some of our guests with dietary restrictions and helped us with options for them, including kosher, halal, vegan, and celiac needs).

Aside from the cuteness, their Happy Hour is what attracted me to the place the most: $6.00 rose', champs or wine, to name a few.  The daily Happy Hour is from 5-7pm, which is unheard of for this city, so kudos to this place.  I tried the cod croquets and it was delicious.  The tapenade with the croquets was an unexpected pairing, but it worked. The portion was a bit small, only 3 croquets.  My only reasoning would be because it's cod.  The only downfall about this place is when my friend ordered a hamburger, they forgot the bacon and onions.  Instead of taking back the burger, they brought her bacon and raw onions.  In the menu, the onions are caramelized.  Aside from the bump, I would go back here for brunch and dine upstairs.  I would be on the regular for Happy Hour, especially if I'm in this area and want a drink before dinner or a refreshing rose' after walking around the village.",0,0,0,Sonia Mae B.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",145,90,196

3.0,4/15/2018,"Bobo = very French.  Cute country French aesthetic with white washed brick walls, bistro tables, and general decor.  Food is very good, leans toward French style, and has rather small portions - especially for the price.I ended up at Bobo for a late lunch with two others on a Saturday.  We caught the tail end of their brunch service at 3pm.  Cocktails were lovely with typical brunch classics (mimosa, Bloody Mary) as well as some other additions like aperol spritz - all for about $12.  Coffee was good and strong with free refills.Two of us had the beet salad.  I was impressed at how many beets there actually were topped with a handful of micro greens; however, this was not a salad that would have been enough for me as a meal.  We did order the chick pea fritters ""panisse"" which were a hearty side and helped fill me with the salad.The rabbit terrine came as a block served with sliced baguette and homemade pickled veggies.  Very good, but make sure you know what it is before ordering... not everyone's cup of tea.Service was attentive and friendly, everything tasted good, and decor was comfortable.  I do agree prices were a bit high for the portion sizes (even for NYC), but I suppose that's French cooking.",6,1,4,Stephanie L.,"Rahway, NJ",367,261,1294

4.0,3/4/2018,"Finally got to try Bobo for brunch. I pass by this restaurant all the time and see the big sign but never went until today.

The manager was so nice and accommodating and offered to seat us at our table even though our party wasn't complete. This is a + since most NYC restaurants will not seat you unless your party is complete. Ambiance: You can tell from all the pictures I posted on this review that I loved the decor and ambiance. It's so stinkin' cute!! So much French flair and country chic. Great lighting too on the patio!Service: Our server was very good and attentive. He's on point from giving us good suggestions to refilling our water and drinks. Food: I had the lamb shoulders and polenta and it was so delicious!! I could eat that every day! Also tried my friend's Croque Madame and it was heavenly! From the presentation to the actual taste, the food was on point! Bobo is a great place for brunch.

4.0,2/11/2018,"I'm familiar with Bobo, having been there once for a quiet dinner session with coworkers, but I've wanted to check it out for a brunch session today, and I'll base my review mostly on that. Even if it was pouring rain outside, I was determined to see what a French restaurant like Bobo can do for me this Sunday morning. The restaurant is a part of a network owned by Casa Nela, providing excellent European style cuisine mixed in with local NY flavors/ingredients, and Bobo's ""sister restaurants"" are Claudette (also French/Provençal), and Rosemary's (Italian), all located in West Village/Greenwich Village, even down the street close by in W 10th St, how convenient! Felt confused a bit since the entrance happened to be in the lower level, but the maître helped me out and gladly directed me to my table upstairs. A well lit dining room was what I've saw, glad to experience it, with some French relics (maps of France/Belgium, a few paintings, bottles), and a bar on the other end of the room, although not as decked out as the ground level.My waitress gladly received my selections, and I've felt welcomed that she was genuinely interested, hurray! French food isn't necessarily easy for vegans/vegetarians to fully embrace, but I've managed to start with a chicory and kale salad for my appetizer/first plate, then move on to a French version of buttermilk pancakes (Crêpes au babeurre), and pensive about dessert. Started off with a latte for a drink, it's nothing too special, but other patrons I sat next to enjoyed their Bloody Mary and other cocktails. My chicory and kale salad was just what I was seeking for that morning/early PM: generous amount of oil, small hints of citrus, crunchy walnuts, and leafy greens, sadly didn't finish it, but I was delighted. Some time later, for my real brunch/petit dejeuner, a coin flip between pain perdu (French version of French toast), and crêpes au babeurre (French buttermilk pancakes) led me to have pancakes, and I was pleased to have that when it arrived on the table. Beautifully arranged pancakes, topped with heavy whipped cream, fresh blueberries, and maple syrup on side. A bit heavy on calories, but it was my best plate on the menu for then! Some time later, I've mentioned to my waitress I was interested in having chocolate mousse, and behold, it arrived in a glass cup, adorned with wafers. Thick, creamy mousse, a chocolate lover's delight! I'm glad it was chilled vs heated, even if it's a cold time of year. Would feel appropriate to have it on dinner vs brunch. Too bad I was at my limit for today, and couldn't finish it. Presented my check, and pleased with the service, and bid farewell to the staff. Overall, Bobo's a intimate place to enjoy a great arrangement of French/French inspired food in West Village, offers a lovely environment if you're there for dinner (dim lights), or a well lit room to have brunch with your friends. Delighted to be there, hope to return for dinner/another brunch!",0,0,0,Jeffrey D.,"Fort Lee, NJ",38,86,3788
4.0,2/9/2018,"Tonight was the last day for winter Restaurant Week and i decided to drop in with coworkers for dinner. This place isn't far from the train station, and with the giant sign on the outside made it pretty easy to spot as well. This place from the outside, just looks like a regular brick house...And once you go in, it's actually very cute....Like you just walked into a granny's country home...But dimmly lite and thoroughly comfortable..We had no reservation but they seated us anyways and was very accomdating from beginning to end of our whole dinning experience. My group of three started off on the first floor, but after I toured the second floor, my companions decided to move upstairs. So we swapped server, and floors...lolBut for some reason happy hour is only on the first floor, even though there's a small bar set up upstairs as well.Ally was our server this evening on the second floor. Her recommendations were spot on, and she was genuine in her service, not that panagent smile and wave routine when it comes to most servers....With the forced smile and no real concerns if you actually liked your food. This was the biggest highlight for me during this whole Restaurant Week period while trying different restaurants.I loved their baked oysters, the Salmon entree, and the chocolate mouse dessert.The baked oysters came with five pieces and we loved it so much we wanted to order more on its own. And we were told that Individual order would be $18 for the same amount, when the raw oysters are $18 for 6 pieces.I did the math and just reordered another prefix from the Restaurant Week menu lolThe salmon....Was one of the best I've had and I just loved the crispy charred skin, slightly seared golden exterior and the sashimi like inside of the fish...That preserved the fatty omega3 from the fish....I wasn't a fan of the vingery lentils that it was paired with...But that salmon can do no wrong....It was juicy...Not dry at all like most restaurants. Love it so much I had it twice lolThe chocolate moose was so rich and decadent...It was divine...They paired it with these triangular waffler liked cookies (but it's actually more like thin crepes forming each cookie)...Crunchy shaved chocolate curls and sprinkled some powdered sugar for contrast...Had two orders of it too..lol",3,1,1,Jessica Z.,"Queens, NY",258,191,1999

4.0,1/25/2018,"This review is for drinks only (but clearly, I need to check out the food). Bobo is a cute place in the West Village and a solid spot for day-into-night drinks on the weekend. I've been here twice now, both times unexpectedly - and am glad to have stumbled upon it the first time around. When Bar Sardine (and every other bar on W 10th St) was full on a Saturday at 4:30pm, my bf and I popped into Bobo instead. It wasn't too busy and we easily grabbed a couple seats at the bar. The decor is very cute and cozy. Good vibe, good date spot. The place was packed by the time we left, around 8pm.Neither the bartender nor the other waitstaff we dealt with were particularly friendly - the reason why I knocked off a star. But on the flip side, Bobo offers a 7-days-a-week HH from 5-7pm! Best thing eva. Basically ordered one (two? three?) too many Epice drinks, which is a scrumptious mix of tequila, st. germain, jalapeño, cucumber + lime with a chili rim. Um, yes please. I started with the old fashioned, which I could have def done without. We also ordered the beet chips, which were fine minus the fact that they were doused in oil (yes, fine...deep fried). But they come out glistening in a really unappetizing way. And the greasiness doesn't make it tastier. So, I would def skip those next time.P.S. Do yourself a favor and put your name down at Bar Sardine next door about an hour before you want to eat. Down many epices at Bobo and then go to Bar Sardine and order the Fedora burger with a side of fries. Possibly maybe the best combo ever.

All in all they did reimburse me for my dry cleaning and I do appreciate the fact they did. Old review: It is very unfortunate that my view of this lovely place has changed. I had another dinner where a waiter spilled ketchup all over my arm and shirt. It was quite strange as he didn't apologize and walked away. No one came to help me clean it up nor did they tell me what the substance was until I asked (as I worried it would stain). I had to go to the restroom and clean up, no one admitted what happened, no one apologized for it and nothing was even offered as an apology. I was horrified and couldn't even have dessert following this strange experience. Then the bill showed up and nothing was removed nor modified due to this experience, I asked for the manager. The manager showed up after the bill was paid and didn't know anything about it, no one told him about the incident. He said he was very sorry and offered to pay for my dry cleaning. Fair enough, that was a reasonable thing to offer! I had the shirt cleaned and emailed the manager with the receipt for $8 and never heard back.

Upon asking they lead us to the garden area since the outdoor side is closed for construction. Service in general was great. They are attentive and super friendly. We ordered an appetizer (mussels and clams) which was fresh and delicious, and also two entrees (chicken and sea bass). Sea bass was cooked nicely - crispy on the outside and super soft inside with a hint of truffle oil. Chicken was not so good. It was salty (I had to ask my friend if i was being over sensitive) - not the chicken itself but the gnocchi and the sauce that came with it. Midway eating the chicken I bit into something crunchy and it was a tiny piece of an oyster shell.. They apologized and offered an complementary dessert which was really yummy. I like the atmosphere but the salty chicken and biting into an oyster part - I was feeling uncomfortable about it considering how much the food was. I'd defly go back for happy hour though!!",0,0,0,Claire L.,"Manhattan, NY",2,31,32
3.0,6/3/2017,"Disappointing experience at a restaurant that was one of our favorites in our neighborhood. Went here last night with two friends visiting from the U.K. We thought it would be a fun spot because you can wander between rooms and feel like you're  having A different experience- bar downstairs for cocktails, dinner in the upstairs dining room and then we were planning to do cocktails at the upstairs bar afterward. It took so long to receive our main course we managed to finish a bottle of Pinot Noir between our starters and before the main course came. We then sat with empty glasses while the waiter seemed to avoid coming over - not sure if it was his fault for not firing the food in time or if the kitchen was backed up, but either way I would have expected an apology for the extremely long wait. By this point the restaurant had slowed down but it still took an unreasonable amount of time to receive dessert menus and to get our dessert order. By this point the small upstairs bar had closed and we were so disappointed with service and bored with the wait times that we skipped coffee. Overall a disappointing experience for a place we had been to three times in the 6 weeks prior and really enjoyed.",0,0,0,Molly C.,"District of Columbia, DC",8,42,39

Our waiter was wonderful -- took the time to really answer our questions about each dish and, rather than just a simple answer to which wine would be best, brought out a couple options for us to try ourselves.

1.0,3/13/2017,"My husband and I chose Bobo for an after-work cocktail and oysters, and thought we might stay for dinner if the start went well. Needless to say, it went poorly. The cocktails we ordered were light on alcohol and meh on flavor, but the reason for the one-star review is that we got one very smelly, disgusting oyster--and at least one other borderline one. We ended up eating one or two other oysters that tasted questionable, but these two (out of a dozen ordered) were inedible. Had one of us eaten the smelly one, he would have gotten very ill. As it was, my husband did have the disgusting oyster in his mouth before realizing it was rancid and spat it out. The manager was very kind and gave us the second half-dozen oysters and an additional cocktail for free, but I'm sticking with a one-star review because it's inexcusable to be serving fresh oysters and to have kitchen staff not taking their total freshness with the utmost seriousness. The health consequences otherwise can be severe, and free cocktails don't make up for that. I hope the management will re-train their kitchen staff to spare future incidents like this.",1,0,0,Jeff G.,"Manhattan, NY",1,28,8

You could tell that he loves his job by his positive attitude during a stressful evening.Now, a well deserved 1 star for Bobo. First off, how dare they call themselves a French restaurant when they don't greet you in French, have a wait staff that can speak French to the customers, and lack basic French cuisine? I have NEVER left a restaurant before finishing my meal. We were served MOLDY bread. Yes, I repeat, MOLDY bread from this OVERPRICED ""FRENCH"" restaurant. Does no one check the items they are cooking? Who puts slices of bread down to be toasted and not even notice the mold growing on it? What kind of chef allows moldy toast to be served in a $$ restaurant. Was I at McDonalds? We were prepared to spend good money to eat here. If they're serving moldy bread then how fresh is anything else? The escargot came out warm like it had been sitting around under a heat lamp waiting to be served. The next problem is the GM. What a joke. He ran around like a chicken with his head cut off.  Bad management. Bad customer service. If a restaurant isn't busy there's a problem. The bus boy said they had a rare busy night and everyone was stressed. You could literally cut the tension in the room with a knife. The wait staff was doing their best, but we were not going to stay and continue to eat at our own risk.

The tables were a bit tight and at first I felt like we were on a triple date with the people on either side but we quickly settled in. The waiter was very good and he could make someone crave a rubber tire with the way he explained each dish. He let us sample some wines and wasn't too pushy. We started off with the foie gras which was delicious. I got the scallops over leek risotto and my friend had the salmon. Now  my dinner was fantastic and I finished ever last bite, but my friends Salmon was out of this world! I'm a chef and I was in awe. Every bite a crunch to it from the peppercorn crust and there so much flavor from a light sauce. She ordered it medium rare which to me is the most cooked salmon should be and it came out perfect.

They asked 'which one'. We went with medium rare but should have said rare. The peppercorn sauce was completely a dud. Not only were there no 'peppercorns' (not necessary), but the sauce had absolutely no taste and no zest. The fries that came with the dish were soggy. The sides of wild mushrooms (nothing special) and roasted brussels sprouts with bacon (very good) were a nice addition.  Two glasses of wine and two beer.  On the whole, the evening was nice; the food nondescript; and the cost on the high side.

The menu looked very appealing and presentation of the dishing a was elegant.  I enjoyed my winter soup appetizer, and roasted sea bass with pea shoot purée special entrée was satisfying but lacked finish. I believe an addition of lemon or something acidic would have made it a truly complete dish. Service was generally great at the senior level (gents in the grey suits, and the host). Our waiter was pleasant, but unfortunately didn't completely have command of the specials. There were two events that diminished this dining experienceFirst, our waiter was not attentive enough to notice that our entrées were extremely late (30mins) in arriving. We had to catch the attention of a gentleman clearing a neighboring table to alert the staff to the situation. Our waiter did come to apologize for the delay and offered us some sparkling wine. Secondly, we had to wait 10 mins and subsequently go help the staff find out coats. I am not sure why it was so difficult for the lady managing the coats to locate the coats as the ticket marker matched the hanger number. It looked like the coats were stored in very haphazard manner. I hope they team works on organizing the space and process to ensure efficient service to future guests. I really wanted to love Bobo, but unfortunately this experience missed the mark. I have high hopes for an amazing time when I return.",2,0,0,Vikram M.,"Baltimore, MD",0,9,7
5.0,1/18/2016,"Celebrated a friend's b-day here, last Saturday night.  The first level has a bar/seating area: a mix of trendiness and rustic (bare bulbs, brick walls, wooden chairs, sleek bar).  The upstairs dining room is cozily posh: copper tabletops, velvet banquettes, candle-filled fireplace, bookshelves.  Also upstairs, a smaller bar creates another seating area.  Beyond that is their heated solarium.       The bar staff was efficiently friendly, and after 2 bottles of wine, we moved to our candlelit table upstairs.  Our ""theatrical"" waiter, Mark, was brightly attentive.  Water always full, great bread, intuitive service.  Young jazz singer, Melanie, did great work with her pianist!     We shared these perfect appetizers: escargot, foie gras, steak tartare, charred octopus.  For dinner, I had a sublime cassoulet--exactly as the recipe should be--and perfect against a winter's night.  Beignets for dessert!       The next day, I called to find out when their singer would perform again.  The reservationist wasn't sure, so she transferred me to the maître d'.  Despite a busy mealtime, he graciously offered to find out and call me back.  A half hour later, his suave voice gave me the information I wanted.  Talk about ""above and beyond"" the call of duty!  That was amazingly nice.  With or without the singing, I'll be back sooner to enjoy the great food and ambiance.",0,0,0,Lew L.,"New York, NY",0,22,14

The ambiance is great, the food is absolutely delicious, and the staff is lovely (they practically tripped over themselves to make sure we were comfortable, happy with our meals, and having a good time). The first time, my husband and I went to celebrate his birthday. I had the Salade Bobo, which was very fresh, and he had the soup du jour, which is very flavorful. I had the bouillabaisse  and he had the duck. Both were delicious, and the server did a wonderful job with his wine pairing suggestions. Last night, we went with my parents for my birthday, and we have been raving ever since. I had, of course, the Salade Bobo, while ""the boys"" had the escargot. My mom ordered the scallops, which were great, my dad and husband both ordered the special of the night -- duck cassoulet -- which was to die for, and I had the halibut.

In my group of four, we entered about 10:30 (on a Friday night, without reservation no less.) So out of sheer luck, we snagged a nice table on the bottom level. I communicated to the server, that we were there for the music. He promised to get us a table above where the music was being played.We ordered food, and drinks (which we were told would be brought to us upstairs.) Fifteen minutes later, we were hurried upstairs where a table awaited us. It took a while for drinks, and food to reach us (there was apparently miscommunication between the wait staff.) The group was hungry, and so our first round of drinks was comped, and we were brought a free plate of ravioli. All in all, they hooked us up.

5.0,10/19/2015,"Ack. I hate writing 5-star reviews. The internet has pried open all the lovely secrets of the West Village and now I'm just expediting the process.  But I've made a pact recently to make peace with the 1-percenters and zombies who can't get their f#%&-ing noses out of their cel phones. There, I said it.  So here goes : Bobo is one of the great West Village restaurants. Even though it occupies a well-traveled corner of the Village it still feels very speak-easy-ish ; equal parts sexy, cool and bawdy - where people look at each other wondering if you're in on the secret and, by the way, who's that famous guy over there?  Staffed by top notch servers who could easily work at the best restaurants, you feel like they've chosen to make Bobo home.  Overseeing all this is the MC who reminds me of a young Joel Grey and runs the place a lot like his own cabaret. That's Michael.  And he takes his food very seriously.  His menu is genius - with an emphasis on big, savory flavors with a wine list to match. The menu changes every couple of months and it never disappoints. Yes, it's a little pricey...but not overly, and it's a good kind of expensive -- where you don't feel like a rube the next morning.

The food was terrific.  The side of Brussels sprouts with bacon was well worth it, and there were some nice wines by the glass.  The only complaint -- I felt a little rushed. I would still come back.

We ordered a two course dinner (according to the host a quick bite - more about his not so great manners later). The starters were ok - oysters natural and the steak tartare, however the bread really bad....Main course was a strange version of bouillabaisse- loads of pickled onions and half raw unidentifiable vegetables... Combined with one prawn, three over cocked scallops and a few mussels... the alleged lobster bisque also not good... One would expect more for a $32 main. The other main course was a risotto with scallops - nothing noteworthy and again pretty pricy even for the neighborhood...While we were dining the host came up and - in my opinion - rather rude told the women next table that she should enjoy her one drink but normally this was only for diners... Perhaps understandable in a full restaurant - but not this early and almost empty. So in short - next time (if that happens)  I  will definitely focus on the happy hour oyster bar down stair - as again the atmosphere was super even for our little bite (ending up being a very unsatisfactory full 200usd dinner).",0,0,0,Karin S.,"New York, NY",0,1,0

The beignets were perfect, fluffy, powdered-sugar frosted, fried doughballs of goodness that came with a little chocolate dipping sauce. Supreme. The Mars Bara had a very rich flavor with a very rich side of salted caramel ice cream which almost melted immediately and nearly impossible to scoop up without licking the plate (didn't do that, but was tempted).

4.0,3/10/2015,"Such a cute little restaurant!  Bobo is is decorated exactly as you would expect an old brownstone in the village to look.  Its very warm and inviting, and not at all pretentious.  There is a nice bar area downstairs to grab a drink, and a few tables as well.  We sat upstairs which is even more charming. The front of the house service was very accommodating and helpful.  The service the remainder of the evening was attentive but not overbearing.  The food was wonderful.  I split a pear salad with my friend and it had a very unique and tasty mustard dressing.  Next I got the risotto with scallops, which were excellent. It comes with 4 good sized scallops on just the right amount of risotto.  I feel like some people would complain about portion size but in my opinion this is what a portion should be in a restaurant.  Based on the price, it was plenty.  The scallops and risotto were both cooked perfectly. The only downside to our meal was the soup special.  My friend ordered it as her entree and it was overwhelmingly salty.  When they realized she hadn't touched it, they asked if everything was ok and she told them.  They offered her something else but she declined.  Most restaurants would just be done with it, but they brought us out 2 complimentary desserts which were great (trio of sorbets and a candy bar dessert.)  Not only that, but they removed the soup form the bill.  I feel this shows they take pride in their food and want to put out only the best.  Slip ups happen and they did what they should to fix it. I definitely recommend coming to this restaurant.  It's got a lot of charm, the food's good and would be great for a date night or a girl's dinner.  I'll definitely be coming back!",1,1,2,Amanda B.,"Hoboken, NJ",16,22,1

Out of nowhere, Michelle (the manager) came over and pulled me and my wife to the side and moved us to a very comfortable place upstairs.  He was clearly paying attention to the developing ""situation"". He refilled our wine and apologized sincerely for that tables behavior.  Fortunately, he moved us to Cindy's bar who we adore and had a fantastic finish to the evening.  Thanks to Michelle, a classy and thoughtful gentlemen who truly cares about his customers.  This place is a gem and we will certainly visit again soon.",0,0,0,Brian P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,13,0

3.0,2/17/2015,"Came here for Valentine's Price Fixe dinner, 110 per person.  Service was mostly excellent, food was just decent.  Not worth the high cost.It's a common theme among reviews -- the decor and service outstrip the actual food.  Not very memorable.  When there are other great options for the same price or less, I would not recommend Bobo.Minor positives:Each table had a mini-vase with some real flowers.  A nice touch for Valentine's.Noise level in general was on the low side.Minor negatives:Each table had white paper covering the tablecloth, which looks decidedly tacky. This does not go unnoticed.The silverware was not matched up to our courses - e.g., when entrees came we had no silverware.  This normally doesn't deserve a second thought, but we were a late evening reservation (10pm) on a night wherein every patron is ordering from one price fixe menu...Bar area:Waited a bit for our 10pm reservation, which is perfectly fine as we talked and ordered a cocktail. Bar seemed busy: there was a bit of a wait before our cocktail orders were taken.Cocktails were prepared well, ours were shaken till the ice cubes became tiny granules; all went down smooth.Decor:Decor was quite nice, as expected.  We were seated on the upper floor by the stairs (which was a good thing because it felt like a corner and was quieter).Service:Aside from very minor things mentioned above, service was excellent and attentive.  One empirical way to measure this is the number of courteous people visiting your table.  About 7-8 different people came by our table throughout the course of the night:Maitre d' - seated usBartender from the bar - brought our drinksWaitress - a no-nonsense young woman who warmed up once we engaged her in conversationSommelier - recommended a nice bottle, reasonably priced, based on our preferencesVarious staff (some repeated) - brought the bread, oyster soup, appetizers, entrees, dessert; check; and similarly for clearing the aboveOur wine glasses were kept filled, similarly with our water.Appetizer:Oyster soup in a demitasse (espresso cup) - the best part of the meal, light and delicious.First courses:Saffron Risotto with Langoustines (lobster)Escabèche FlukeBoth were tasty and otherwise unremarkable.Entrees:Pan Roasted Atlantic Halibut - not a very succulent fish and this was no different, but the texture was nice.  The butternut squash was quite yummy.Tournedos de Filet Mignon - pretty good, not spectacular.  This is not a steakhouse, so no surprise.  Temperature was correct, but parts of it were too chewy.  The pommes boulangère (French style oven-cooked potatoes) was a pleasant surprise.Dessert:Barre de Fromage Pour Deux (Cheesecake bar) - as tasty as cheesecake would normally be.  I am slightly disappointed they didn't offer something more interesting, but I knew ahead of time what the selection would be so I can't complain.And lastly, a minor point - the music. The 80s and 90s selections are great and all, but it didn't fit the decor nor the cuisine.  And as none of it was romantic, it did not fit the evening.",1,0,0,Wei Alex X.,"New York, NY",872,13,46

I received a VM from a staff member saying he wanted to speak with me about my reservation. When I called back, I was told there was no reason for me to have received that voice mail. I called again the next day to make sure, and spoke with a different staff member who said the same thing and that unless I got a call back, to not worry about it. Then, I received a call from the restaurant later in the day, but no voice message. When I called back I was put on hold and then directed to Alex, who I suppose works in event planning. He explained to me that there was a higher priced pre-fixe menu for that day and that if I wanted to pay $50, he would send me a contract. He was extremely rude on the phone, and when I said no thank you he said ""ok bye."" Did not ask if I wanted a different reservation or anything cordial.

3.0,11/30/2014,"My guess is that you're paying for the realestate here, not the talents of a top chef. There may  be a way to select menu items on par with Bobo's splendid and varied decors- rustic at the downstairs bar; bright & white in the enclosed terrace, and subdued in the turn of the last century main room.  But we didn't find it:* the winter squash/pumpkin soup with toasted pumpkin seeds and cardamom was complex, luxurious, and beautifully presented with double contrasting and pungent drizzles.  But why was it served nearly room temp, with just  a touch of warmth at bottom?  Was it because we were 1st seating and it hadn't heated thru yet?  Perhaps it's best eaten room temp, to better discern each flavor.  That's the ad lib I came up with for my guest, but more of a silver lining than truth.  * bouillabaisse- broth was great, tho light or no Pernod, if you expect that.  Not a substantial portion for this dish (try Aqua Grill--wow--and for the same$) but a soup bowlful. The sea food, Except for the clams, was uniformly sad. 3 tiny mussels, one of which was cooked to vanishing.   Chefs don't let plates like that leave the kitchen. I do get it that its in fashion for veggie components to be served less cooked these days. But potatoes, too? Sea Scallops were slivered.  And priced north of $30. * Lamb shank (special)- $34- top 2/3 was cooked to dry on its way to shoe leather bc you could see the ""water line"" on it, above which our portion protruded during the long cooking.  Another 'penalty' (1st portion served from the top?) for reserving at 6, rather than 8?  Dinner service is dinner service and needs to be nearly  uniform quality throughout.  Another restaurant on the same short block makes a thoroughly succulent lamb shank daily, priced one third less, and they don't even have gas service, only electric!Service, including seaters, was more than proficient if somewhat chatty leaning towards Standup/goofy.Early Michael Jackson music piped intoa beautiful room with chandelier & fireplaceto accompany French food?  Either someone hasn't thought about the overall guest experience here or has let their hand off the steering wheel. $110 with tip.

5.0,7/4/2014,"I've been to Bobo four times, and it's only gotten better with each visit. I've enjoyed Rosemary's (it's sister restaurant down the block) on a few different occasions, and while planning our wedding last summer, my fiancé and I were interested in having them cater the event. I met with the Event Manager at Bobo to discuss this possibility, and she mentioned they do cocktail-style weddings at Bobo. In a matter of minutes, I fell in love with the charm and eclectic décor of this wonderful ""gem"" of a restaurant. We went back for dinner the following night to test out the food and service. Our watermelon and burrata salad (I believe a special for the evening) was one of the most delicious dishes we've ever tried. And the fish we ordered was cooked to perfection. The ""orange creamsicle"" cocktail we tried was outrageously good. We finished off the meal with a slice of carrot cake, which, much like the rest of the meal, was truly amazing. While dining, we did not share that we were considering the venue for our wedding, since we wanted an authentic, un-biased experience. The service was really wonderful and helped seal the deal for booking our wedding at Bobo. In the months leading up our wedding, I returned twice to eat--once for brunch in the back garden with two girlfriends (try the stuffed French toast--OMG!), and another time for a casual dinner with my dad (the tuna tartar and ""mars bar"" dessert are a must!). Both times, the food and service were truly wonderful, but what made the planning process so painless, and months leading up to the big event fly by was the attentiveness, expertise and professionalism of Bobo's Event Manager, who helped us with every single detail, many of which, I'm sure exceed her formal job description. Our cocktail-style reception was for 125 people just under a month ago and we are still getting phone calls, texts, and emails about what an amazing night it was. If you are looking for an untraditional wedding reception in the heart of the West Village, this is it. I could go on at length about how perfect every detail was, but I will just list a few of my favorite highlights that made the night truly everything we could have hoped for. From the time the first guest walked through the door (our ceremony was held nearby at Jefferson Market Garden, also recommended by the Event Manager), the service was nothing less than IMPECCABLE. Empty glasses and plates were cleared immediately, and no guest was ever without a full drink in their hand. The food was incredible, and we were able to select 10 different hors d'oeuvres to serve over the course of two hours. These amazingly delicious bite-sized appetizers were accompanied by several beautiful cheese spreads, hummus platters, caponata and crostini, crudités, and the show-stopper: the most unbelievable raw bar ever (oysters, shrimp, crab claws and lobster tails). Since we had to do a buyout of the restaurant, our guests were welcomed throughout the three floors of the old townhouse, and on each level, the service, food and drinks were perfectly coordinated, organized and executed. The passed savory items were followed by three different types of wedding cake (carrot, chocolate raspberry, and lemon curd with buttercream), three passed desserts (the ""mars bar,"" mini Nutella ice cream sandwiches, and mini seasonal fruit tarts), beautiful platters of fresh berries, coffee service, and our favorite part of all...""drunk munchies"" later in the evening, consisting of mini lobster rolls, sliders, and fresh cut French fries served in a cone. Another highlight of the wedding reception was the Cigar Bar set up on the upper level deck off of the private dining room. Between this more intimate space, the buzzing dance floor on the bar level of the restaurant, the quiet garden in the rear, and the formal dining room, there was a comfortable and suitable space for each and every party guest ranging in ages 18-87. I really can't say enough about what a perfect event it was. I wish I could relive this night all over again. We will certainly be back for brunch and dinner, and Bobo will always remind us of such a special night.",1,0,1,Lauren S.,"New York, NY",0,5,0

4.0,6/18/2014,"It's really more like 4.5 stars. As one of my favorite date spots, Bobo never disappoints. The downstairs area is pretty loud so I was happy when we were seated upstairs (although not on the comfy looking booth in the corner which would have been more private). After ordering a bottle of wine, we started with one of the nightly specials--a black squid ink linguini, which I really didn't love. It was way too salty for me. As a waiter (he seemed super young so I'm guessing he was new/training) was clearing our appetizer, he dropped the silverware and shattered our water glasses, spilling water all over the table. My boyfriend and I were having such a wonderful time that it honestly didn't faze us one bit. I got a little water on my shirt but we weren't soaked or anything. Our main waiter came over and apologized profusely and let us know that we would get the ravioli appetizer on the house. I could talk about this ravioli all night. It's in a delicious mushroom broth with Parmesan cheese sprinkled over and is one of my favorite dishes on the menu, so we felt lucky that they picked that. As if they hadn't been accommodating enough, the manager came over and moved us to a different table--the corner one we originally wanted! If this isn't incredible service, I don't know what is. I ordered the rabbit pappardelle as an entree and wasn't too crazy about it. It was tasty, but nothing special or memorable about it so I probably wouldn't order it again. My boyfriend's sea scallops risotto was incredible--the scallops seared perfectly and the risotto nice and creamy. We had a long dinner and never felt rushed. I agree with the other reviews that it's more of a date spot than anything else because of the lighting, but it would work for catching up with a few friends too! The bill came to about $150 before tax (bottle of wine, 1 appetizer, and 2 entrees).",2,0,0,Naima R.,"New York, NY",86,64,7

However, my friend ordered a glass of the L'Ostal Cazes, 'Estibals', Minervois 2011 which she did not enjoy. But since she ordered it she felt obliged to finish her glass. When we had finished our wine, Kim asked us if we liked the wine. I had told her I loved mine and proceeded to order another. My friend mentioned that she hated hers.

2.0,4/8/2014,"Ambience  Vibrant West Village restaurant with a ground level bar and a main dining room upstairs. It has a candle-lit romantic type of atmosphere.  I would recommend it for a ""first date"".  The only downside is the noise level.  It is a bit high but perhaps it is a good thing.  The tables are close to one another so the noise could prohibit any ""nosy neighbors"" from listening in on your conversation.  The crowd was different.  It ranged from local ""west villagers"" to romantic gay couples. In general the place has a very typical west village venue.  Food The food was average. Menu is somewhat American-French or French-American or French-French or American-American or...  You get my meaning, I'm not really sure what it was.  I really can't remember anything that caught my taste bud's attention.  Nor can I remember anything that I could complain about, so average as it is!  Service This part of my review will be the longest.   So, just to let you know I was in a great mood that day. It wasn't one of my ""lunar"" days if you know what I mean.  We arrived 15 min earlier than our reservation time.  The host went upstairs to check and see if our table was ready.  Then we had a ""magic act"", he just disappeared!  He returned after some time didn't say anything to us then he left again, very odd.  We were standing in a waiting area and really didn't know what to do. After some time I had to ask the second hostess if we should grab a drink while we waiting.   Little did we know at that time that the female hostess was the only accommodating person in a whole place.  She let us know that our table would be ready in a few min so we definitely had time to grab some beverages at the bar.  Now for our next adventure.  It took a while to get the bartenders attention.  I had a feeling that we just didn't fit in with the crowd so, he decided to literally ignore us.  Eventually ""His Majesty the Bartender"" served us our drinks. Of course at that moment our table was ready so we had to rush to close the tab and go to the main dining room.  But wait there's more! :) Again I will tell you I was in a great mood as was my dinner companion.  The server was a nice guy, didn't have an attitude but he still needed some training on how to do his job.  We were waiting for him to take our order for the wine first then our food.  However because of his ""style"" we ended up ordering everything at the same time. This is acceptable but it shouldn't be  because we had to get  the waiters attention.  I really hate to have to do this, it brings tension to the entire evening.  I can understand this happening if a place was busy or understaffed but this particular evening it wasn't the case.  I don't think I need to say anymore.  The service at Bobo is very far from being good.Conclusion As you can see my ""service"" section took over.   I try to make my opinion about restaurants based on its food and its ambiance.  Both of those factors weren't bad but service, it  just screwed the whole experience. Honestly there's not even one reason I can think of  to come back to this place.  Sorry, buy that's the way of feel.  May be it was just a bad  ""staff shift day"".  Whatever the case I have no desire to give Bobo  a second chance.",1,0,0,Anna M.,"New York, NY",2,13,1

4.0,2/20/2014,"I almost can't believe that I ate at Bobo last night for the first time!  I've easily walked past this place over a hundred times and I've been meaning to try it for ages.There is a certain type of restaurant ambiance that I gravitate toward when it comes to dates and/or small group dinners -  cozy and intimate (without being claustrophobic), lively (without having to scream back and forth with your fellow diners), and candlelit.  The right lighting is key.  Too dark, and it feels like I'm dining in an underground cavern and/or living in the midst of a natural disaster a la Hurricane Sandy; too light, and I feel like I'm having lunch in Midtown and need to finish up my entire meal in under half an hour.  Bobo's date-night and small-group-dinner ambiance is spot-on.  I walked in from the cold winter's night and it felt like, ""Ah.  Yes.  This is nice.  Let's stay a while.""I started with a dirty vodka martini and it tasted quite different than I'm used to.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't really for me either.  My friends had the same reaction to their gin martinis.  Then we moved onto bottles of red wine for the rest of the meal.I had the sea scallop risotto (my waiter's recommendation) and it was spot-on.  I cleaned the plate.  We had an assortment of cheeses for dessert which were really good as well.Our waiter was good - attentive without being overbearing.  Two friends joined our group of 4 about halfway through the meal, and the waitstaff seated them at our table without making an issue out of it, even though one of them only ordered water and a side dish.It's not cheap but not prohibitively expensive - entrees are around $30 +/-.  Our bill was quite expensive, but that should be attributed to the amount of alcohol that we put back, not the food.Final Verdict: I would come back again.  I wasn't FLOORED by it, but it was overall very good.",2,0,1,Meredith R.,"New York, NY",378,86,3
1.0,1/27/2014,"I've never written a Yelp review, but unfortunately had an experience worth mentioning. Our food was delicious, unfortunately the meal was a bad experience for a special occasion:Made a reservation for four ppl for 7pm Saturday night meal with my 75 year old parents who were visiting from out of town. I specifically mentioned to the reservationist (the week prior) that my father has very poor hearing, and requested as quiet a table as possible. She kindly said 'no problem, we have noted it'. Upon arrival, we were sat in the back room, next to a rowdy, 15 person BACHELORETTE party!!! I kindly asked to be moved, as they were extremely celebratory and loud. The manager came by ten minutes later and said, in front of our entire table ""sorry, we can't move you, why doesn't ""he"" (pointing at my father and not addressing him directly) sit in the corner so he can hear you better?"". My father was completely embarrassed, i felt horrible, and no one on the staff did anything to try to improve the experience. It is totally understandable that restaurants get busy and noisy on Saturday nights, but it makes no sense that a request to at least sit somewhere more intimate, is met by seating us next to a bachelorette party- and then embarrassing my poor parents with their response!!

The food was also great - we had the farm omelette and the egg white fritatta and both were hot, fluffy and generously sized. The brussels sprouts w bacon were also cooked perfectly and delicious.

1.0,1/3/2014,"This is an open letter I sent via email to Bobo NYC founder Carlos Suarez. I haven't received a response yet, but when I do, I'll post it here. ==Carlos --I'm writing regarding my experience at Bobo NYC this New Years Eve. I'm not looking for anything in return, I just think as the owner of the business, you should be aware of the dismal experience many customers had that night. After extensive research, I booked a table for my girlfriend and me for the 9 p.m seating. The Maître d' said there were two options: The dining room and the garden room. I chose the latter because she said it was quaint, romantic and had a nice view of the band -- her favorite. Come New Years Eve, my girlfriend and I were very excited to eat at the restaurant. When we arrived, we were greeted by a very kind hostess who took our coats and gave us festive gear. She took us to our table -- a nice two-top in the center of the dining room. I wasn't sure whether this was the garden or not, but we were both happy with the charming environment and friendly waitress. Then, perhaps ten minutes after we sat down, the hostess came back and apologized because she accidentally sat us in the wrong place. Apparently, we weren't sitting in the garden room. Instead of finding a way to make it work, she just hauled us across the restaurant in front of all the patrons to what felt like the discount club -- not a good way to kick off a $150 meal. The room was dimly lit (not in a romantic way), freezing cold and had no view of the jazz band, let alone any ability to hear it. Our new table was also adjacent to the waiter station. And the wait staff in that room felt like the 'B' squad. Our waiter in particular, whose name we didn't catch because he never introduced himself, seemed drunk. He spoke in some sort of fake French accent and seemed generally disinterested in serving us. Honestly, it felt like diner-level service at a high-end restaurant. The meal started off with stale slices of bread and cold butter with a little sea salt on top. That was fine -- but certainly not the introduction we were expecting. It all went down hill from there. The amuse-bouche, for the most part, was not good. In particular, the oysters with little mushrooms weren't fresh -- they tasted extremely fishy. Not tasting good is one thing since it's subjective, but fresh ingredients is a given to me (especially when it comes to shellfish). The following course, which was a hamachi crudo I believe, suffered from a similar problem. The yellowtail tuna just didn't taste fresh -- it was room temperature and oddly fishy. And the orange sauce that accompanied it was plain bitter. The next courses followed in a similar manner. My slow-poached egg appetizer was tepid in temperature and served atop an odd, mushy mushroom sauce. Worse, the lobster in my girlfriend's lobster raviolo was rubbery to the point where it wasn't edible. The main courses were disappointing as well. I ordered the venison wellington, which came out on a piping hot plate, but completely cold (which generally says one thing: microwave). I asked if they could heat it up, and within seconds another, slightly warmer dish came out. Everything on the dish was completely flavorless and tasted like it was reheated at least one time. My girlfriend's turbot was also strange in that it was a tiny, apparently overcooked piece of fish served on a gargantuan plate of white beans. To us, though, what really added insult to injury was the waitstaff seemed to be put out by helping us. For example, when they brought new courses, they would just shove plates out of the way, leaving them on the table. They also made no effort to reorganize the table, or even center the new plates in front of us. At no point did anyone take the time to say what we'd be eating or ask how the experience was. I felt embarrassed I chose Bobo as a restaurant to bring my girlfriend on a special night like New Years Eve. And honestly, I felt cheated to have spent $420 -- a significant sum of money for me -- on what felt like second-rate food served by people who weren't interested in being there or about the wellness of the customers.

Bobo is a nice, chill place to have a relaxing dinner no matter what your age (or if you're a parent.) Nothing amazing, but absolutely enjoyable.We were meeting friends there one night and showed up a bit early. We killed some time at the bar, enjoying some excellent cocktails, and striking up a conversation with the friendly bartender. It's always nice to see restaurant staff who seem to enjoy their job, and that was definitely our experience.  Even though it was a crowded Friday night we still managed to get seated on the roof under the enclosed canopy, which made for a charming evening. The food was good. I had the Steak Au Poivre which I enjoyed, but there was really nothing outstanding about it. The best part of the meal was the dessert. You should try to save room.When we were comparing notes on the way out one debate was over the bathroom. My opinion was that it was amazingly ugly (it had this weird black and gold animal wallpaper... with gold swans or ducks or something for the faucet.) It was ridiculous.

2.0,6/27/2013,"Brunch at Bobo is average at best. I went around noon on a Sunday and it was pretty empty. We were seated against the windows and I sat on the cushioned bench. I suggest they take the time to clean those cushions because they were covered with crumbs and I saw some stains. That's gross. Since we were pressed for time, I didn't make a fuss about it. I ordered the scrambled eggs and asked if I could substitute the toast for mixed greens since I'm trying to stay away from crap filled bread. Server told me that I could. My eggs were standard and the mixed greens were just plain with no vinaigrette. Had to ask for some balsamic vinegar. Anyway, what really loses Bobo a extra star is the fact that when the bill came I was informed that i couldn't sub out the toast (you know well after I ate all my food) so I was charged $4 dollars for a small amount of lettuce!

4.0,5/15/2013,"We went in for dinner last night after friends were raving about how amazing everything was. We got there a little early and planned to have a drink at the bar. We ordered a bottle of wine and the tuna tartare. They have a fairly small (but nice) wine list. The tuna was great quality but had little to no flavor. My boyfriend liked the cucumber wasabi side that came with it.When our table was finally ready, we moved upstairs. The decor is very well done. It really is a perfect date spot. Our server was delightful and brought us a bottle of sparkling water to start. He was very helpful with helping us make decisions about what to order. We started with the steak tartare and the escargot. Steak tartare was one of the best I've ever had, and is a much larger portion than I was expecting. The escargot however, is served on a puff pastry and even though it had great flavor, I didn't like the dish overall. Entrees we shared the pork cheeks and scallop risotto. Both needed salt. Both were average, nothing to write home about.All in all, I gave 4 stars because the decor and the service were great. Food wasn't exceptional but it definitely wasn't bad.

The restaurant, though located in the bustling West Village, has a peaceful and calm character to it, and is beautifully laid out. Perhaps most distinctively, it has that quality that so few NYC restaurants are able to achieve- that of making you feel like you've somehow escaped NYC. We sat in the back ""greenhouse-ish"" area, and the combination of being able to see more than a few feet above you, plush greenery, and tealights makes for a romantic and serene evening.  The food is a bit on the pricey side, but its VERY good.

It wasnt crowded and we waited a good 20 minutes to just get our drinks.  We were also famished and it took another 20 for our food to come, so that was not a great mix.One note on the menu - no substitutions so if you want goat cheese in your omelet instead of cheddar like I did, no can do.All in all, great space to go to for drinks, but otherwise maybe pick someplace else.",1,0,0,Fiona J.,"Manhattan, NY",105,48,0

The meat is sweet and sumptuous!  The fact that I'm still thinking about the lobster 3 days after says everything about how I feel.  Definitely the best lobster I have had in a very long time.Dessert:  I got the assorted sorbet.  The 3 flavors are corcord grape, peppermint, and maybe pina colada (?).  What a huge disappointment!  The flavors are so artificial.  I might as well eat a bag of candies.  I would have given Bobo a 5 star if it was not for the dessert.",0,0,0,John R.,"Redondo Beach, CA",3,13,2

The downstairs is very dark and small and has a nice bar that looks like it would be a good place to have a drink and a snack at some evening.  There were a few tables down there, too, but we were taken upstairs to what I would assume is the main dining room.  The place is an old house, and it's still somewhat decorated like one.  It felt like we were in a library, or even better: in the movie CLUE.  Everything was dimly light, but not too dark, and there was a great comfortable feel to the whole place.  Our waitress came right over, after we had chit-chatted with the hostess a bit just as we sat.  We ordered drinks, which came quickly, and then after some menu specials and explanations, we ordered dinner.  There was a large table sitting next to us who had ordered some things that apparently weren't on the menu.  As we were ordering, we saw delicious looking crab cakes go by, but we couldn't find them on the menu.  After we ordered, the hostess came by and presented us with a big plateful of crab cakes!  She said she saw us admiring them as they went by so gave us some to try, free of charge.  That was great!  I love a place where the staff actually seems to want you to have a nice time, a good meal, and this is that kind of place!For appetizers, most people got the Bobo salad (Bibb lettuce, Chioggia beets, herbed goat cheese, walnuts, shallot vinaigrette $12), but I, of course, got the Steak Tartare (Hand-cut certified Angus beef, capers, cornichon & quail egg, house made potato chips $15) since it's my favorite thing.  The salads were all enjoyed.  My steak tartare was actually really good and flavorful.  There was a hint of mustard in it that really added flavor.  My only complainant is that the quail egg was overcooked.  Well, it was cooked.  That's not how it should've been.  Should've been super raw/runny so that I could mix it all in with the raw beef (yum), but it was cooked through.  Other than that, delicious.For entree, I got the Scallops (Pumpkin seed crusted scallops, braised spaghetti squash, ginger carrot sauce).  They were just okay.  The scallops were cooked decently, but only 3 for $29?  And the sauce was a tad weird.  The ginger carrot sauce was too sweet in my opinion.  The dish was good, but not great.  Two people got the Steak au Poivre (Certified Angus beef NY strip steak, homemade fries, green peppercorn sauce $29) , which looked amazing. I tasted the fries, and they were very well fried and seasoned.  Someone got the chicken (Organic chicken breast, potato purée, caramelized shallots, scallion salad $25) and liked it a lot, and the other diner got the Bass (Ratatouille, green beans, roasted garlic & yellow tomato coulis $28).  I thought the portions were pretty good on all the entrees but my scallops.  We had a few desserts, but now I can't remember what they were.  I do think we all enjoyed them though!  All through dinner, our waitress was very attentive and friendly.  Checked in on us, replenished drinks, and was just very friendly.  The hostess also came back a few times to chat.  Even the busboys were friendly!  I just loved the whole staff.  I think this place would be a great date place, and if I lived in the city I'd probably come here somewhat often.  I think I'd like to sit at the bar and have some steak tartare, but request a raw egg. :)",1,0,0,Castine H.,"Arvada, CO",135,100,94

And indifferent attention to service and wine selection not so appealing either.  The food itself is quite good and if you have the right crowd, as i did recently, maybe the rest of the issues disappear in the moment...  But i must say as a not so 'hot' restaurant, they really need to get their act together.",1,0,0,cel l.,"New York, NY",5,16,0

The service here is surprisingly not great - when we arrived the hostess was chatting away with a waiter and barely acknowledged us. Once we got up to the private room, things got better. The waitress in charge of us was great, but she did get a lot of orders wrong. I want to give her the benefit of the doubt though, since she may have been new - she was very nice.The food was good, but didn't blow my mind. We had the peekytoe crab salad (both avocado and crab did not taste particularly fresh). I had the steak au poivre which was quite good.

4.0,6/20/2012,"It had literally been four years since I last dined at Bobo.  And, to be honest, I was perfectly content never returning.  It's not that I didn't love the space; actually, I can still picture that incredibly charming, 2nd floor dining room in my head.  And, come to think of it, the service we received was just fine.  But it was the actual menu and its food that I found to be lacking.  And completely random.  Randumb?Since I will be away for D's baby shower - taking place this coming weekend (coincidentally, at Bobo) - we decided to meet up for brunch this past Sunday.  Bobo was chosen so that D could get an idea of what the space would look and feel like during her brunch event. Having arrived a few minutes prior to D, I chose to use my time wisely.  I ponied up to the bar and ordered a ""Breakfast Margarita"":  Milagro Tequila, Combier (orange liqueur), and orange marmalade were vigorously shaken together, then poured in to a grapefruit salt-rimmed glass over perfect ice cubes.  Between delicious sips, I noted that, while perusing the brunch offerings, the menu appeared drastically and positively different from my last visit...Since D had made the reservation under her name - and she's hosting her baby shower there next weekend - we were greeted akin to Hollywood royalty by Bobo's adorable manager, who promptly showed us to our two-top on the exposed 2nd floor terrace. After we sat down, our water glasses were filled and we received brunch menus.  ""D, this is stunning.  Are you having the shower al-fresco?""  She nodded.  ""Wow!  Well, indoor or out, you cannot go wrong.  I'm so bummed to be away next weekend.""With a plethora of sweet and savory items to choose from, D and I ultimately decided to split two plates:   French Toast Soldiers, and the English Cheddar Farm Omelette. French Toast Soldiers:  Brioche French toast ""fingers"" were topped with crumbly oatmeal streusel and accompanied by fresh strawberries, blueberries, and warm maple syrup.A buttery, slightly crisp exterior gave way to a moist, almost creamy interior.  The streusel crumble added a delightful texture to what was already the perfect French toast.D and I loved Bobo's fun, unique, and easily-sharable spin on this breakfast classic! English Cheddar Farm Omelette:  Although the menu described this particular omelette as having ""roasted tomatoes, basil, and English Cheddar,"" what we actually received could not have been more different.  There was not a trace of cheddar cheese, and the ""basil,"" it turns out, was pesto.  Undressed field greens (yawn) and two thin slices of naked baguette (untoasted, not buttered) accompanied.  OK, so I get that the above description sounds negative, boring, and misleading but, trust me, this omelette could not have been more delightful!  The egg portion, itself, was creamy and soft, not overcooked and tough.  The interior, composed of fragrant pesto and melted tomatoes, packed a powerful punch that was full of robust flavor.  Upon first glance, I was disappointed that we only received two thin slices of baguette.  Had the server not walked away so quickly, I would have asked for more.  However, the portion was actually sufficient, because it would have been a shame for bread to act as anything other than an edible utensil to push the eggs atop my fork.  To mask the the flavor and perfect texture of this omelette would have been a sin.  Seriously.  ...Bobo, it turns out, was an absolute delight.  And so much different from my previous meal, 4-years ago.  From the outstanding ""Breakfast Margarita,"" service, charming interior and exterior spaces...to our lovely meal...I look forward to returning.  Very soon (...though, unfortunately, not for D's baby shower).Oh, but wait!  Here's some cool information for any of you out there who are looking to host an event:  Bobo has a $35 prix-fixe brunch that is extended to large parties!  D informed me that this is the route she's going for her shower this weekend.  With most restaurants in Manhattan charging upwards of $60+ per guest, brunch at Bobo is a steal!  And a delicious one, at that.",3,0,0,Lindsay F.,"New York, NY",376,277,184

There was no waiter assigned to us, we had to go to the hostess to ask to take our order after 30 mins of waiting.

5.0,4/20/2012,"Last night I dined with a very dear friend of mine at this sophisticated spot slightly after 8 pm-it was not difficult to get a reservation on OpenTable only 2 hours before.  It was an premier evening-after dinner I went to Flute Bar in Gramercy and then the Bunker Club in Meatpacking, which were both very enjoyable on this moderately warm spring evening, warm enough that I could wear red shorts and fishnets with a blousy top and blazer with Brooklyn-style edgy jewelry.  However, the 1.5 hours spent at dinner were the highlight of the evening because of the company, and yes, the food and drinks.  Bobo is the perfect modern take on traditional fare, with enough French influence to keep me happy and enough healthy guilt-free dishes on the menu to feed the model crowd.  Somehow they make guilt-free incredibly luxurious since everything I tasted was basted in the most incredible sauces.I started with Dem Apples as an aperitif-it was divine.  Mezcal always reminds me of that worm in Cancun when I was 21...typical New York City cocktail-small but pungent, a bit sweet and sour, just the way I like it.  Then my companion and I discussed international politics over their special oxtail appetizer-it was fantastic.  The cheese was thinly sliced and the meat was perfectly melt in your mouth.  The gnocchi was a nice touch as well-very creative preparation.  Then I had the seared striped bass, which was outstanding.  Frankly, I didn't think the fennel taste was very strong, but the fish was perfectly crisped on the underside and the coulis was the perfect compliment to the fish.  I also had a bite of my companion's duck and it was absolutely amazing.We decided to skip dessert in honor of slim summer waistlines.  But I did enjoy a delightful peppermint tea to finish off the meal while I discussed a new love interest in the District-we had to look at pictures, of course, and the restaurant is not so formal that that was inappropriate.  Overall, I would recommend this place for dates, political / business meetings, a night out with the guys or girlfriends, and other such social events but not really for the under 18 crowd.  It oozes sexy a bit too much for the youngsters.",1,0,0,Sonali C.,"Brooklyn, NY",835,14,0

Now for the downside: The service was unbelievably bad.  First, when we were at the bar waiting for our party, it was difficult to get one of the bartenders attention to order drinks As well as followup drinks.  We met with the sommelier to see if he could give us advice on the wine - he did not listen to our table's qualifications, was not helpful and just plain strange.  When we opted to continue with our delicious cocktails instead of wine, we were persona non grata to our waiter.  He barely checked in with us, it was near impossible to get him to come by for additional drinks or even the check.  The orders came out at all uneven times and there were some mistakes.  The dinner dragged in so long bc of the bad service we did not even think about desserts- we did not know how much longer it could be.  I had eaten here a year ago and had a much more positive experience- its changed and not for the good!",0,0,0,Melissa C.,"Manhattan, NY",14,117,50

We didn't enjoy the experience and actually both felt a bit ill after.The location is beautifully decorated and that's what drew us to it originally. The menu (prefix) varied between fish and meat in a french style. The appetizer course was small bits that didn't accompany each other well. Ceviche with lettuce, foie gras, and salmon with cream cheese. The salmon was really simple and tasted like Philadelphia. They gave grenadine and champagne, which is a very cheap French cocktail. Then we got a crab cake - again kind of mediocre. Tasted like frozen. The main course was the biggest disappointment - a choice of fish or beef. I always feel that potatoes as a side are a let down. There are so many better sides like whole grains to substitute. The fish dish was better, lighter and well cooked. But there were lots of potatoes. The beef dish was covered in beefy gravy that obscured the natural flavor. There were too many mashed potatoes and mixed with the gravy there were no longer any acute flavors.The dessert was a simple mousse with a peanut treat. The best part were the fresh raspberries, but I'm not a mousse fan in general. And to top it off they lost our coats and we were waiting for a while to find them.

Only if your date is easily impressed. Recently, however, Bobo has been overhyped and has been much less enjoyable then in the past. Bobo has become a hit or miss spot. One of the spots where sometimes you have a good server, other times you don't. Sometimes the food taste good, other times not so much.The last time I went here we ordered a nice bottle of wine. It took 30 minutes for waitress to bring over the bottle. She didn't even over a taste first, but rather poured it into both glasses. We quickly finished the pour and she never noticed! We finally had to point it out to get another glass. After the bottle was finished, she didn't tell us either, thus delaying maximum alcohol consumption.The waitress also forgot to bring out our food and our entrees came out cold. Both plates had to be returned and the waitress immediately began giving us an attitude. When the entrees came back, both were not good. My tofu dish (wasn't in the mood for meat) was paired with a very bland and boring sauce. The vegetables were also bland.Overall, this place is going to be a hit or miss.

Look at that hair cut! That top - what was I thinking??!!"" or ""Who let me out of the house in those pants??""  First year NYC me is the same thing... not a clue about the restaurant/bar scene, ha, so cute and naive. Those were the days before I read reviews on NY Mag and Zagat and (gasp!) did not even have a Yelp account yet. Subscribed to Tasting Table... ha nope, not a chance. Knew what the Eater Heatmap was and what was on it... ha, OK now that's just funny. So when I went on a date and the guy asked if I wanted to go to Bobo, I was like ""sure, cool, great.""

2.0,10/12/2011,"A very long overdue review of what used to be in my Top 5 favorite restaurants in NYC.You know, prior to May 6, 2011 I would have given Bobo 4, maybe even 5 stars.  It was a special place for special occasions and they always treated me well.  In return, I've treated them very well with frequent visits, no complaints, well tipped staff, recommendations to friends and colleagues.This was my at least 12th, maybe 14th trip to Bobo in the last few years.  It was my birthday (and they knew that), so I thought it would be nice for me and the (now ex) girlfriend to spend a romantic dinner at one of our favorite restaurants.  And no, Bobo wasn't the reason for the break-up.Usually, Bobo is spot on with service.  This night however, they had their new PR agency in the garden and they were wining and bending over backwards and the expense of their paying customers to please these people.  The table next to ours waiting 45 minutes for WATER.  We waited 40 minutes for them to clear the mains off the table.  It was pathetic, truly pathetic.  And, on top of it - they were bowing down to an agency that they probably paid incredible sums of money to.  Sadly, when questioned about the level of service, all the staff could do is blame the PR agency.Worst of all, the PR agency recommended removing the most popular (at least by my standards) appetizer on the menu.  Bad decision to start.Anyway, not to bore you all - so goes the tale of NYC restaurants ... the service is always the first thing to go.  Good luck Bobo, you'll be missed.",1,0,0,Arif R.,"Manhattan, NY",139,15,0

3.0,7/24/2011,"I LOVE Bobo's courtyard for happy hour - and their happy hour rose and $1 oysters are both fabulous...however, after they now charge for the sauces with oysters, and mistakenly brought me 3 large platters for which they charged me, then the waiter or manager spilling the vinagrette all over my new outfit (and not even noticing, and he continuously spilled on me..), I was somewhat turned off...that said, if you don't mind paying $7 for rose and feel like having some oysters, still a GORGEOUS happy hour spot...On this visit however, we came for brunch. After painstaking attempts to get a collective decision on a brunch locale, we finally chose bobo, who while yes, needed a credit card to hold a spot for 9 people (about half did, half didnt, so i cant say thats a HUGE strike against them), they were pretty nice about the fluctuating reservation number the day of.  They did have us wait for our entire party to arrive prior to seating us, which didn't make that much sense when we were finally seated in the bar area, so its not as though the space had been occupied, or there were any reason to have us wait for everyone to arrive other than to hope we ordered additional drinks at the bar...The one thing that struck me as slightly annoying was that I was debating between carafes of two different bloody marys, both of which sounded delicious.  Many restaurants have outright offered me to sample their bloody mix, even when I'm not ordering them (i.e. at night time), upon hearing that i hope to try one in the future.  For this reason, and the fact I was getting an entire carafe for myself, I figured it wouldnt be too difficult to give a tiny (i.e. half a shot glass or less, no liquor obviously) sample of the two, so that i could decide which to order.  Apparently that was a problem, and the bartender didnt have any ""mixed."" (wtf, as i ordered a carafe, i'd think its not like they're hard to mix...isnt the mix already made??? it appeared so when we were sitting at the bar...)After I explained how it was just slightly risky should I hate the one I order (she described the ho chi that you're breathing fire, but i love spicy bloodies, so figured this COULD be a good thing...or bad).  She asked if i wanted to do a glass first ($10 vs. $25)..to which I said that wouldnt be too efficient.  I ended up winging it with the ho chi mary, which was great, but would have been nice to at least ensure that prior to ordering the entire carafe...plus who knows if the bobo mary was even better!Waitress wasn't super attentive, but others were frequently filling our water glasses....i do wish our table had been upstairs as i've now dined in the bar area twice and yet to see the dining room other than walking past to the courtyard :(  Also 20% auto grat, but maybe thats standard and its gone up everywhere from the routine 18%...but do wish service had been better for $20...and that our table hadn't been so cramped...and that they had somewhere to put purses, as unless you put it on the floor or are on the booth side, you need to put it in your lap since there's no where to hang them on the chairs.  Oh, and waitress also cropped a friend entirely out of one of the photos she took of our party.Everyone seemed to like their food, although one friend did say that the griddled cheese wasnt as good as she'd hoped..and something negative about the fries.  2 salad eaters were pleased, and I believe the eggs benedict (?) or an omelette were also a success.  The rose (which i assume is the same as the happy hour one, a local rose), was also extremely popular.Ho chi mary, great...now just must return for the bobo mary! if only they'd let me sample each...",1,0,0,Danielle J.,"West Village, Manhattan, NY",213,572,10

Right up front - I have to say that everything EXCELLENT - beyond our expectations. As my husband has spent many years in very high-end fine dining circles, he's an honest and discerning critic - and even he was WOW'ed by the food, the wine list and for the most part the service.We shared two starters - the Caesar Salad which was fine, and the Steak Tartare which was melt-in-your-mouth-and-soul wonderful! For Entrees I had the Salmon served on a bed of cucumber, cauliflower and sumptuous greens. It was cooked to perfection and was clearly fresh, fresh, fresh - just the right summery touch of spices and a generous portion. If I have any pet peeve about fine dining, it's the silly little servings that many places give you - makes no sense. NOT so with BOBO - I was well satisfied. My husband had the Handmade Potato Gnocchi with roasted mushrooms, ramp greens and  sprinkled with pecorino . . .  unbelievably good! They were soft and light, with a wonderfully rich flavor without being heavy or doughy. We wound up sharing both our Entrees. For dessert - my husband had the Walnut Cake which was lovely and home-made grainy, with fresh walnuts  and berries on the side. I had a Chocolate dessert (the name escapes me) - that was like a dark chocolate mousse/pudding with tiny chocolate speckles sprinkled on top and a tablespoon of just made whipped cream/fraiche on top. The chocolate dessert was both of our favorites - warranting a future visit JUST FOR THE DESSERT.Our Waiter was great - and other support staff was very attentive. We had a thoroughly enjoyable early evening and took our time with our bottle of wine and meal, really savoring the entire experience.Was refreshing to finally get what we paid for - be fully satiated both in the belly and soul when we left.

1.0,6/26/2011,"I recently went to Bobo in the West Village for their Happy Hour Specials and was extremely unhappy with their service and the ""after-math"" of my visit.  I would love to hear if anyone else has had a similar experience... so please comment...My friends and I were wooed here by the $1 Happy Hour Oysters, but after my visit, I will not go again.First I will say, they have a limited selection of happy hour drinks available -- from my recollection, the choices include Pilsner ~$5, Rose (terrible) and Red/White wine - ~$6-$7. The $1 oysters were a deal, however, I will say, it may or may not have led to my demise at the end of the night. But, I can't blame it just on the oysters because I did have a few other food items from their Happy Hour Menu...We ordered the following from their menu ...    1.5 dozen oysters    Tuna tartare on a chip    Fried oysters    Lobster risotto ballsAfter I walked out of that place, perhaps 1-2 hours afterwards, my stomach started feeling funny... and surprise, it wasn't only me. My friend and I started to have symptoms of a ""churning stomach""  ... and without saying it so directly, you can guess what would eventually follow. Though some people may argue that food poisoning occurs 8 or more hours after ingestion, according to the FDA, onset of food poisoning can occur within 1 to 6 hours (e.g. vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, etc). I will say, one of our friends walked away unscathed - so it could be a fluke (note:  our friend didn't have the Pilsner, but had all the other foods). I will ignore commenting on the service because that is less important, in my opinion.Unfortunately for us, what we expected to be a beautiful evening of Happy Hour Drinks and Appetizers at Bobo -- was less than beautiful.  Note: Perhaps, we had an off day (it happens), but all I have to say is ""Buyer Beware"".  I can not comment on the rest of the food offered here, only the drinks and food that I had (i.e. Pilsner, $1 oysters, Tuna tartare on a chip, Fried Oyster, Lobster ball).

I ordered the coco Burger, a veggie burger made with organic grains and tofu.

The scallop crudo was probably the least memorable, but only because the arancini and the salad were so delicious. For our entrees, we had the duck entree and the bouillabaisse special. Both were fantastic. Additionally, the waiter misunderstood that we wanted the duck entree (rather than the crispy duck salad), so he had put in an order for the crispy duck salad, which he let us have since it was already prepared.

Entree was an unseasoned fried chicken breast atop a tasteless mush of risotto. There was supposed to be sausage. There was no sausage. Maybe it was in the same place as the Leek?I tried to save the night with a cocktail. Another fail. Watery, weak and lacking in any flavor.

3.0,2/2/2011,"so i had to knock off a star because of the really sketchy billing incident which i detail below....yay i'm a fan! really i am - im a sucker for obscure entrances but honestly there's a sign on the fence that says ""Bobo"" that I spotted across the street and it was pretty obvious you had to descend a few steps to get into the restaurant.... so i didn't really think it was hard to find at all... bobo is situated in a charming townhouse - the bottom level has the bar and tables for walk-ins, second floor is the main dining room and kitchen, and 3rd floor is a private parties. super cute and cozy spot, the bar floor was very casual sparse like a bohemian cafe - bartender was awesome and the drinks were pretty delish!  Sticky Fingers (Buffalo Trace, apples, honey, sassafras, ginger beer) and Dulcinea (Hine-H vsop, saffron, rhum orange, bubbles) were my faves and my colleagues liked the chili-infused tequila based ones Stealth Margarita or Smoke & Mirrors.  Cocktails wise i felt like Bobo was similar to Employees Only but a lil more casual and sans the mario mustachesSecond floor is elegant but funky- if i had a batty bachelorette aunt (kinda like Miss Havisham but not run down) who lived in a townhouse, i think this would be it.  Food I thought was pretty fantastic and unique. 'Bacon, Egg, & Cereal' with leek, guanciale was a bit weird, tried it to try it but probably pass next time. The Pork Ribs rubbed with sugar and spice were fantastic, Potato Gnocchi with mushrooms, rosemary, pistachio was hearty. I never got to try the Fried pickles b/c everyone gobbled it up before the plate got passed to me... must try next time!  For mains, 6 out of 7 in my party went for the Duck Breast with date purée, hazelnuts, parsnips, chorizo - so tender so juicy and the flavors were intensely wonderful. We also got all the sides I liked the Brussels Sprouts & Pork and the Endive & RadicchioDessert - that carrot cake is super rich and sweet and dense. could only eat half of it but was a damn good half. They also had these adorable mini ice cream sandwiches *** Only issue - sketchy billing!  Basically we ordered a couple $40 bottles of wine and they charged us for the $80 bottles instead, which was pretty sneaky.  Their response ""but we presented you with the bottle"" honestly unless you are a sommelier who really checks properly?  so i am still unsure whether they served us the cheaper or more $$$ bottle of wine... but after complaining they deducted the extra wine charge off BUT KEPT the 20% gratuity charged on the incorrect, more expensive total!  i mean it was a work dinner so maybe they thought as its expensed who would care ... basically shady shady shadyso be cautious - make sure you check your bill and drink orders - but otherwise still i would recommend bobo for friends, big groups, work dinners, dates - plus happy hour (until 7pm i t hink cocktails are $10 each and burger is $10 too?)",2,0,2,Jen J.,"Tiburon, CA",114,250,54

4.0,1/28/2011,"I visited this place w/ NYC Yelp's Ryan Robbins and her husband Greg last night and was very pleased with the experience.  The atmosphere was lovely (it would be the perfect place to take a date b/c it was intimate and cozy), the staff was first rate, and the food was good.  I saw some post on Yelp that this place was pretentious, but I disagree. The staff did seem a bit too formal, but I think they were just trying to provide a special experience.  APPETIZERWe shared an appetizer of Poutine.  If you haven't had this before, it's a Canadian dish that's basically just french fries covered with brown gravy and cheese curds.  The version at Bobo was adequate, but it wasn't the best I've had.  The fries were larger than I've had before (think potato wedges), but they were battered and fried, which was odd to me. In other words, I could have done without the batter.  On a positive note, the brown gravy and cheese curds that accompanied the dish were yummy, and the portion size was just right for our group of four.MAIN COURSEEveryone at the table ordered the Bobo burger, which was amazing!  The ground beef was cooked to perfection (I ordered mine medium rare), and the burger just melted in my mouth.  On the menu, the burgers were paired with french fries, but since we already had the Poutine, we asked to substitute Brussels sprouts for the fries, which they gladly did at no extra change.  The Brussels sprouts, which were cooked with ham, were delicious! I'm definitely glad we made that change!DRINKSI ordered a jalapeño-infused margarita ($13).  It was just okay, and it wasn't very strong.  Greg ordered a draft beer, which is what I wish I had ordred.Would I return to Bobo?  Sure!!

He also ensured one of the apps we ordered - that typically serves three - added a fourth piece since there were four of us.We shared the crab cakes, fried pickles and deviled eggs (a special that night).  Would definitely order the crab cakes again.  I had the tile fish and thought it was really good.  We ordered a carrot cake dessert that was also heavy on the caramel and rich and delicious.Open to go back for cocktails or dinner.",0,0,0,Julie S.,"New York, NY",2,68,0

2.0,1/14/2011,"2.5. I hate to do this, but after finally grabbing a bite to eat I have to lower my rating of Bobo. Bobo was one of my go-to's for happy hour this summer due to the lovely little garden out back that made you feel like you had stepped out of the city for a moment. I hadn't been back until recently. After stopping in a couple places nearby and finding long waits, we ducked in to Bobo and were able to grab a table down in the bar area. We weren't starving but needed to eat something. My date was interested in the roasted quail app and we decided to also split the burger. We were split on the roasted quail app- my date really enjoyed it, even the greens it was on. I only tried a bite, but my major problem was that it was served roasted on the bone, which would have been ok except it is so dark in the restaurant that it made it very hard to see (and the bones aren't large). So trying to maneuver my way around the bone and ending up with bone in my bite anyways turned me off quickly. The burger was just average. Neither bad nor great. Unfortunately the french fries did not live up to my ""french fry connoisseur' standards. Many of the larger ones didn't seem to be entirely cooked. The glass of Cabernet I had was good. I've always liked the wines I have had at Bobo (loved the rose they offered all summer long).

Service was almost non-existent but they were more than happy to add 20% gratuity to the bill. After a 5 minute discussion with the manager he finally relented and took the $6 fee off the check for tap water.

2.0,10/25/2010,"Based on the look of the place I was excited about the food. Bobo is a very good looking restaurant, impeccably decorated but cosy and comfortable. And the friendly bar man downstairs made us amaaaaaaazing non-alcoholic cocktails (not something I normally do but we were hungover) which filled me full of hope for an evening of yumminess.But the food and service in the restaurant let us down. We chose the $60 tasting menu and the starters were pretty good. I especially enjoyed the squash soup which had toasted marshmallows in it. Weird, but it worked. The crab cakes were also good and the devilled egg was OK, but I found the beet salad a bit bland. My husband polished it off though, so maybe that's just me being fussy.So we were still contented at this point and eager to sample the main courses. And then we waited, and waited, and went to the bathroom in the hope they might arrive, and then waited some more. It was a good 45 minutes. Just as we asked the waitress where our food might be, it arrived from where it had evidently been sitting in the kitchen for a while - it very quickly went cold. By the time we switched plates mid meal (we had the tasting menu so had to try each others food) the sirloin was stone cold, as was the potato puree it was sitting on. It still tasted OK but wasn't anything like as exciting as I'd hoped. The other main meal was Bass in a broth with canellini beans and baby carrots. The fish was well cooked but the sauce and vegetables were uninspiring. But I was still hopeful about dessert - which also took a long time to come, increasing my anticipation. But, oh no, another disappointment! The rice pudding in a glass was rather tasty although rice pudding always reminds me a bit of school canteens and I rushed through it to get on to the lemongrass pannacotta. Yum  - or so I thought. Boo. It was HORRIBLE. I think the chef thought by removing the sugar from the pannacotta but serving it with a berry compote it would be more inventive and interesting. But it simply didn't taste very nice, and although it might have made an OK starter, it certainly didn't fulfill my idea of a dessert.It's a shame because we are searching for places to take my parents when they come to NY at Christmas from England. We thought at first glance that Bobo might be just right. But now we will definitely look for somewhere else. This was a disappointing dining experience with a high price tag.

To start, the fried oysters are AWESOME...make it happen...and get a bunch, I was really sad when i had none left. Also tried the egg with truffle cream, was good, tasted like truffle in a hamburger bun so how bad can that be? The Ahi tuna was a good bite, lots of avocado on a little puff pastry.  For our main course, the scallops were good, didn't love the sauce that came on the plate, but they were cooked perfectly and a nice light dish. The burger is SO GOOD! Loved the addition of the fried leeks, really juicy...would go back for this! Now the duck...had heard some big things about this duck and it actually lived up to the hype. Very crispy skin (like almost peking duck crispy), great sauce, well cooked...heavy dish, but delicious! Until this point I was pretty thrilled with the meal. But then came the Bruleed Cheese Cake which was by far the WORST dessert I've ever eaten. It was made with goat cheese, so it just tasted off and topped with gross cooked plums.

Every dish is lovingly crafted from artisinal cheeses, locally-grown produce, and delicious humanly raised meats. It makes it all the better than the owner, Carlos Suarez, quit finance (""a lack of values"" he said) to open this restaurant. We arrived just a few minutes later for our 7:45 reservation, and an older gentleman led us up the painted wood stairs lined with flickering candles to a romantic dining room. The handcrafted quality of the restaurant shines through even in the decor. Fashioned from what was obviously a townhouse at some point, the dining room is romantically lit, with bookshelves stocked with old tomes, heavy draperies, and candles everywhere. We hit a hiccup when our waiter forgot to provide us with a wine list, but he apologized when he realized 10 minutes later and was quickly back to take our order of an artisinal and biodynamic malbec. There was also a short list of cocktails, bottled and draft beers, and aperitifs. I hardly noticed the less than stellar service because he was so friendly, and even made me laugh a few times. We provided the waiter with a coupon from Blackboard eats, and received in return a plate of fig leaf wraps with brown rice and a sweet sauce, and three ""shooters"" of pepper and zucchini infused non-alcoholic drink. They have a long list of canapes that comes in singles for about $3 a piece, so you can mix and match. The star of the night was the duck breast with chorizo that my boyfriend ordered - it was an eyes-rolling-back-my-head moment. My brook trout wasn't the best I've ever had, unfortunately. And at one point I had to pull a small bone out of my mouth. Yuck. However, you must order something from the dessert menu. We had a trio of ice cream sandwich sliders: gingerbread-oatmeal-raisin cookies with a mildly fruity ice cream, chocolate with what I think was a cookies and cream ice cream, and and a classic chocolate chip ice cream sandwich. We made a huge mess, but since they put down paper on the tables instead of white cloth, I didn't feel so bad. As we left we noticed that the downstairs bar was booming. And it looks like you can order some food at the stand up tables by the window as well. A word on the prices - they are very reasonable. I was suprised that the bill wasn't more, given that we ordered so much, and the quality of the restaurant. Add in the fact that all ingredients are local and organic, well it's practically a steal.

It's due more to the ironic contradiction that is this restaurant.Part of the decor here includes those vintage light bulbs. You know, the exposed-filament ones that look super-cool, but are super non-green (see more here: nytimes.com/2010/06/08/n…).

First, the pavilion in the back is beautiful. On a nice summer day, this is the best place to be for a nice meal with friends. A year ago my friend celebrated her 30th bday here and we had such a good time with good food, beautiful weather and lots of drinks. Recently, I organized a group dinner for my co-workers and reserved the pavilion outside once again, but with threatening thundershowers, the team at Bobo did a great job arranging all 19 of us in the dining room. We were a little squished, but we made the best of it. And for a pre-fixe dinner, we had a great menu selection which satisfied 19 very different palettes. The ahi tuna was really good, so good, I only got one.  I had the trout for my entree, and it was good, but I was envious of the pork chop some of the others ordered. A huge slap of perfectly cooked juicy chop - I have to get my own next time.  Desserts were great, we fought to finish each others plates. We also had a drink at the downstairs bar after dinner, which is so cute. I had the london calling which has muddled cucumber (my new favorite in a drink), lemon and rhubarb - so good!",2,0,1,Kitty B.,"Copenhagen, Denmark",144,150,65

I don't know if it was because we came 10 minuets early but we somehow scored the corner table which was fantastic real estate. Everything put on the table was delish. The service is really where they lost 1.5-2 stars. The waitress wasn't rude per say, but she wasn't exactly friendly either.  And I was trying to engage her, really; asking suggestions etc. To be honest she seemed high. The food also took a good 10-15 minuets too long to come out for each course.Hey, a girls gotta eat.... and while she could eat your food all the livelong day, it wouldn't kill you to pick the service up a notch or two.",0,1,0,Jessica M.,"New York, NY",1,9,0

4.0,5/12/2010,"The first time I went to Bobo it was when my fiancee(girlfriend at the time) were visiting my old stomping ground the West Village. We came across bobo by chance and had one of the best times ever in the city. The food was beautiful, small portions mind you, but the taste was exquisite. We started with a lovely pea soup shooter which was to die for and continued with a beet and arugula appetizer. It was very fresh and delicious. My lovely had the skate and I had the short ribs. Both were very well cooked and quite enjoyable. It was funny we were sitting in the lovely garden in the back and it started to drizzle. Our waiter immediately came over and asked us if we would like to move. We enjoyed the rain for a minute and then was seated in booth by the front window. We finished our mean with a flourless chocolate creation and were on our way content and happy. We went back for a quick drink a year later before other dinner reservation and sat at the bar upstairs. We had a really nice time and enjoyed some small bites and a few cocktails.

4.0,4/28/2010,"Note that I am writing this review four weeks after I went so please excuse the lack of gastronomic details as the memory is not what it once was.....Our friend Andrew, formally of Anella in Greenpoint, BK, had recently started working at Bobo so I thought that it might be a good idea for Hubby and I to go there for dinner just to say hi.  I had always heard the food was great at Bobo, so this gave us a really good reason to go.  The only reservation I could get was for 6:30, which turned out to be the best thing.We get there a tad bit early since the movie we had seen let out earlier that I had anticipated.  Unfortunately Andrew worked brunch that day and we missed him by an hour.   So much for the initial reason for going.  The first thing i noticed upon walking into Bobo was the turntable spinning vintage 60's jazz, I was instantly in love.  Our hostess took us up two flights to our table in what seemed to be the covered back balcony.  the room was really well done and so comfortable.  We were literally the only customers in the restaurant at this time.  I loved it.  What started out as a whim was turning into an impromptu scene from a cliche romantic movie where you rent out the entire place for just the two of you.Our server was exceptionally well versed in not only the menu but also the wine selection to go with the meal.  Hubby was feeling jovial so we went with a rose champagne for the evening.  Unfortunately as I had mentioned earlier this was four weeks ago and I can not really remember the menu that we had but, I do remember the emotions and the happiness that great food always gives me.  I also remember Hubby saying that I hadn't been that gushy about a restaurant in a very long time, so apparently I very much enjoyed it.  Another thing that i do remember about the evening is how great the service was.  Our server was so friendly and attentive without being in our faces.   Now for the reason why I didn't give it a 5 star since I loved it so much.  To be truthful it has nothing to do with Bobo itself, but the clientele that started coming in towards the end of our meal. One table that was near us was obviously Park Ave. snobs that were ""slumming it"" in the West Village as they were so condescending and dismissive to the server, it was a bit shocking how rude and ill mannered people can be.  The wife especially so with a lot of sighing and eye rolling.  Then there were three other tables with what could only be described as douche bags that were trying to impress their respective dates that were very obviously out of their league. They were loud, obnoxious and had no sense of propriety for being in a fine dining establishment.  One of the ""gentlemen"" kept flashing his uber expensive over sized watch that I'm surprised his date wasn't blinded by the reflection of it's gaudiness.  For me the people that frequent a restaurant is just as important to the atmosphere as the decor and if it wasn't for the excellent service and food that we just had I would not be going back to Bobo due to the people that were dining there.  Saying that, I will most definitely be going back to Bobo, but only at 6:30 as to avoid the douche bag patrol and the condescending, over entitled crowd that seems to go there during the peak hours.",0,0,0,John T.,"Maplewood, NJ",90,58,6
4.0,4/20/2010,"Since opening in 2008, Bobo, the chic townhouse restaurant at West 10th and 7th Avenue operated by Carlos Suarez, has been a veritable ""revolving door"" for its executive chefs. When I first dined at the restaurant, the kitchen was run by Nicolas Cantrel (Bagatelle); later followed with a brief, yet disappointing appearance by Jared Stafford-Hill (Hearth). Bobo is now being fronted by Chef Patrick Connolly of Radius fame in Boston where he won a James Beard Award. The chef has changed the menu from its original French format to a more flexible New American mainstay. This Saturday night, Blanca, my wine expert and connoisseur, and I walked into our 9:30 reservation and entered the dim sub-street level basement to a complete frenzy of activity. The bar scene was in full swing as servers carefully meandered around guests drinking merrily mixed in randomly with those waiting to dine, being careful not to knock over any cocktails on the way. The hostess was quite busy, but handled the mania well as we waited just ten minutes to be seated. Walking up to the stairs to the first level main dining room, the ""too loud to be romantic"" but charming room is adorned with spacious tables and a fireplace lit with candles, and the space is decked with the usual appropriate antiques and other ""tchotchkes"", beaded chandeliers, reproductions of classic paintings on the walls and bookshelves stocked with barely interesting and obscure authors. We were given some nice fresh artisanal bread and some real top notch olive oil. To drink, I chose the signature ""Bobo"" cocktail ($12) of Prosecco, Aperol, Lillet and Orange Juice. It was bright, refreshing and reminded me of the beverages I enjoyed sitting in the cafes of Rome on warm summer afternoons. Blanca ordered a carafe of the 2007 Volver La Manch Tempranillo from Spain ($29). I always trust Blanca to select an excellent wine and she lived up to her reputation. Tempranillo, sourced from vineyards averaging 40 years of age has a dense, saturated purple color with fragrant aromas of mineral, scorched earth, and blackberry. The wine has a big core of fruit with enough structure to provide a blunt, but smooth drinking distinctive taste, and enough acidity to keep it all lively. Our superb and enthusiastic server Mark guided us well thru the courses and spent a lot of time with us as we decided on our meal. For starters, I chose a duo of canapés from their ""For The Table"" selection. The first was a mediocre Fried Oyster ($3) with Tartar Sauce and Celery Salt. The second canapé, though, was stellar; an Ahi Tuna with Avocado and Cilantro ($4). It was ultra fresh and just ""zinged"" my palate with bursting flavor. Blanca wisely chose the hand cut Beef Carpaccio with Watercress, Honey, Chili Oil and pecorino ($15). The beef was pleasantly sliced a bit thicker than your standard carpaccio and gave the dish fantastic texture to round out this well seasoned delight. There was a lengthy wait for our entrees, but the atmosphere kept us entertained as we got to enjoy the room filled with well dressed couples and small party groups reveling into the night. Our entrees were just great. Blanca had the Wild Striped Bass with Arugula, Baby Squash and Olive Puree ($26). It was flaky tender and the puree complemented the savory fish perfectly. My sliced Duck Breast ($29) was served a nicely cooked medium and was accompanied by two contrasting sauces; a lovely sweet date puree with hazelnuts and a satisfying minced chorizo and parsnip spread. They both elevated the duck to a sublime level of excellence. For dessert, Blanca and I shared the Butterscotch Pudding with Cocoa Nibs and Fresh Whipped Cream ($12). We both thought it tasted just divine, but sadly, we did not get much of that desired butterscotch flavor at all, which was deflating to say the least. Still, it was a yummy dessert. Two stars for the food, another two for the great service and ambience. I want to return soon to have drinks in their new top floor lounge which is now only open for private events.

4.0,4/12/2010,"LOVE the design and decor of this place. It was exactly my taste - eclectic, imaginative, mix of old and new! Def geared toward the younger design minded working crowd I would say. We went for brunch, made a reservation on open-table. The staff was very nice although we did get a little confused at having two waiters, or maybe we didn't? The bread plate brought out was great - with bread, fruit and cinnamon rolls. We didn't love the bloody mary but some of the other drinks were good. After reading reviews I was a bit worried about the food - however we all thought our meals were great, no one was unhappy. Most of us went for the more standard choices on the menu but everything was interesting and very good. The grilled cheese was a bit strange, served on large thick pieces of bread - couldn't really eat as a sand which - more like bread with cheese and greens. Prices are a little high, if i made as much money as my friends with financial and consulting salaries I feel like this would be a normal brunch place and a great bar to hang out at later in the night.

3.0,2/15/2010,"The wife and I had a romantic Valentine's Eve dinner at Bobo. We had a very nice experience, and found the service and food to be generally good. We were in the first seating, at 6 o'clock, which may explain why our experience was not plagued with the service issues that other Yelpers have mentioned.We actually showed up about 20 minutes early because we'd been walking around the cold & windy West Village and were hoping to have a drink and thaw out. We initially had trouble figuring out where the restaurant was, since there's no sign. We eventually noticed the stairwell leading down, and found ourselves in the bar area. It turned out they were about to have their had their pre-dinner staff meeting, but they let us hang out in the warmth.The bartender showed up for work while we were waiting, and quickly got us set up with drinks. Dale DeGroff would approve of his mixology skills--he used correct technique to check my wife's ""bobo"" cocktail for balance and stocked his bar with small bottles of soda. The bar area itself is pretty cool, with vinyl records spinning and charming mismatched furniture. A few minutes after getting our drinks, we noticed some other people being seated, so we let the hostess know we were ready. The walk up to the 2nd floor felt mildly treacherous with drinks in hand, but it was worth it, as the upstairs dining room is incredibly charming. We were seated at one of the corner tables on the street side of the building, which meant we had a relatively private spot from which to observe the room. It was initially a bit cold by the window, but they eventually got the heat going at the right level and the rest of our meal was quite comfortable. We skipped the ""Appetizers"" section of the menu but rocked out on the ""For the table"" section of canapes. Here's what I remember:* Crispy Pickles & Crab Dip--one of the highlights of the entire meal! The pickles were battered & fried cornichons, and the dip was big chunks of tasty crab atop a bed of what appeared to be ketchup and mayo. Not haute cuisine, but really really good.* BLT--no bread, just pulled pork and smoked tomatoes in a lettuce cup. Tasty!* Chicken liver toast--I didn't try it, but my wife seemed happy with it.* Wedgette--Just ok. Maybe a little too much blue cheese dressing.* Squash soup--served in espresso cups, and topped with marshmallows, this was a cute idea, but the soup itself was not very good. Skip it.For her entree, my wife had the brook trout. It was good but not mind-altering. I had the duck breast and it was served medium rare, which is how I like it, but it was odd that they didn't ask. The accompaniments almost kinda worked, but somehow failed to provide much spark. We shared the butterscotch pudding with cacao nibs for dessert (by ""shared"" I mean my wife got to taste it, heh). The pudding came in a champagne coupe and was topped with a dense layer of nibs and a dollop of whipped cream. At first, I was put off by the nibs, but then I realized that if I scooped through all the components, my spoon would have a well-balanced bite: the bitter crunchiness of the nibs was a good foil for the sweet smoothness of the pudding, and the whipped cream kept it from feeling too heavy. While this was an interesting dessert, I ultimately felt like I would've preferred a crumble of bittersweet chocolate to actual nibs--they were too much like eating coarsely ground coffee beans.The wine at Bobo was underwhelming, focusing on reliable value brands sold at non-value prices. As an example, I had a glass of the Dr. Loosen ""Dr. L"" riesling with the canapes and it was fine, but I can literally find it by the bottle for less than what they were charging by the glass. The Cloudline Pinot Noir was less egregiously overpriced, but again we're talking like something approaching 5x retail markup.They definitely were maximizing the number of diners they could accommodate that night--we saw them insert and rearrange tables several times during our meal. If you don't get here early, you may well find yourself bumping elbows. I dithered between 3 and 4 stars, but after I thought about value, I ended up going with 3, because Bobo's food didn't quite match the prices (even for NYC). I do like the setting, and my suggestion would be to stick to the things that seem to work best by dropping in early-ish at the bar to get a cocktail and some crispy pickles before going out on the town.",1,0,0,James K.,"Menlo Park, CA",46,117,11

We also had a side of the Mac and Cheese to share which was very tasty and not overwhelmingly cheesy. The waitress did not have it together that afternoon as she took a long time to take our order. Then she brought a side of bacon instead of the Mac and Cheese. We also asked for coffee to be brought with the eggs but she forgot that as well. It took quite a while to get the coffee and when it arrived we were more than half way through the meal.I thought about giving two stars due to the service but would not want to discourage anyone from enjoying the food.

Taking almost half an hour before taking our order (and returning 10 minutes later to inform us that they'd ""sold out"" of our selected wine) is a bit of a faux pas; as is charging a cover for water, in the name of a charity that our waitress could not recall the name of. Food took quite some time to arrive - when it did, it was delicious - but the pacing was a bit uneven. All the while, we were unable to get any attention from the servers. The tricks that usually work - waving hands, desperately trying to make eye contact, clearing your throat, exclaiming ""sir"" or ""ma'am"", even making semi-inappropriate animal noises - none of these were able to get service, even the bill at the end of our meal!The food was actually quite good - I started with the Lobster and Crab salad, which was light and meaty. A garnish of arugula didn't do all that much for the dish, but the shellfish was top notch, and the presentation excellent (including some delicious hummus spread on toast). My main, the Beef Shortrib with Frites was fantastic: delicious and soft meat (juicy and flaking at the touch of a fork) with crunchy, salty fries. Really, really good. Haricots Verts, served with brown butter and garlic, were also a winner.Setting was cool and funky - great lighting and thoughtful, witty decorations.

5.0,11/21/2009,"My last meal during my secret Veteran's Day trip to NYC and my Big Apple hostess couldn't have brought me to a more hip or tasty brunch spot. I see a lot of reviews for dinner where people were not that pleased, but their brunch was absolutely delicious and the ambiance is impeccable. I wanted to get every item listed on the brunch menu, and you know that is always a good sign where there are just too many things you want to try. Good thing I went with company so we could try several dishes. The egg dishes (BLTE, and Benedict) were great, but the gnocchi with smoked salmon and fried egg was the winner! The fruit and pastry plate that came out before the main dishes was quite a nice treat and satisfied our sweet tooths before and after our savory mains. You have to enter Bobo from below street level, which of course adds to its cool factor, but once you get inside you will be blown away by the decor and the music (the record player is downstairs). Bobo is named after the children of wealthy Americans who chose to leave their privileged lifestyle and become bobos, or the bohemian bourgeoisie, and the restaurant represents a bobo's design aesthetic. 5 stars for the food, vibe, location, service, decor, and of course, the history lesson.",1,1,1,Lauren K.,"Woodland Hills, CA",284,203,2

2.0,11/12/2009,"I've been to Bobo before, when they first opened and remembered having a pleasant experience.This time, it wasn't so great.  Food was decent, but service was terrible.  Our waitress took forever to take our order and didn't even bring us bread.  When we asked for it, she wasn't apologetic or anything!  She was just like,""Sure,"" and brought it to us with out any bread plates!  Plus, our entrees took over half an hour to come out.  The worst part of the meal was the dessert.  Since it was our friend's birthday, we ended up ordering a dessert for her since we were all full but wanted to have a candle for her anyway.  We asked the waitress for one dessert, but instead she brought us out with two and the one that we didn't order had a candle on it.  We assumed that she sent us an extra dessert since we waited so long for our meal but no, when we go our bill, she charged us for both!  Ugh.. never ever again.",1,0,0,Joyce C.,"New York, NY",10,3,0
3.0,10/16/2009,"I had Bobo for my Bday dinner last night.  How cool was it to enter the the restaurant through the basement entrance of a townhouse. The first thing I noticed was a record player with a big Kool and the Gang record laid out.  As far as I knew, the record player and record were just for decoration...As we walked up the stairs to the main dining room, the Kool and the Gang record started playing. At that point I knew it would be a good night (the people reading this who know me know why). Food was good. My wife had the burger and I had the trout. I especially liked the way the trout was simply prepared. The skin was crunchy and  the fish was delicate. It was seasoned well. The fish was topped with a  mix of purslane (like a lettuce), asparagus, mint and almonds. Everything was really fresh. We had the Chocolate cake for dessert. Love when they put sea salt with chocolate. Great mix of salty and sweet. In addition to the food, I enjoyed a nice cocktail. The Fordham Beefeater, which included st. germain, dry sherry, cucumber and celery bitters, was sophisticated, not too sweet or too dry. We also liked the wide variety of wines available by the carafe.The restaurant is loyal to reducing their carbon footprint so this statement was added to the menu...""In an effort to limit our carbon footprint we serve purified water and charge $1/guest."" I found this to be unnecessary. Charge me 25 cents or even more for my drink, my entree, my side and dessert, but do you really need to add $2 to the meal to purify some of the best water around?I applaud that they source ingredients from local farms whenever possible. The freshness came through in the food. Service was friendly and attentive enough.I gave Bobo three stars because I reserve higher ratings for ""once in a lifetime""  experiences. Though this was an enjoyable, It does not hit that level for me. After dining, I cross referenced with Zagat... they have plenty of company with their 21 rating.  Hopefully they can get the ranking up a little higher next year.",1,0,1,Jay M.,"New York, NY",234,109,90

4.0,6/26/2009,"This is a great place to take clients.  It is a brownstone (with a very hidden front door) and the top floor is reserved for private parties.  I was lucky enough to go as a guest, and they served wine and champagne on the balcony.  It was a bit cramped for 12, and there wasn't much a view, but it was quaint and nice nonetheless. They circulated small bites like fried oysters duing the cocktail hour.  Then we went into the dining room where they had preplanned our tasting menu.  Each dish was paired with a wine tasting as well. 1st course was their tuna tartar - this was DELICIOUS.  The cucumbers had a fresh pickled taste and nice crunch, the avocado was creamy and lent just enough richness to make it indulgent, and there  was enough acid in the fresh tuna.  It was also studded with some tempura crunchies that gave it just the right touch in texture and flavor.  This was paired with a fresh crisp white wine.Next course was the sea scallops on pea shoots and freshly shucked peas flavored with thick cut bacon.  I could definitely appreciate the bacon flavor, but the scallops were a little overcooked.  The serving was 2 huge scallops, which was generous considering it was just a tasting.  This was paired with a rose.Then came the Pistchio Crusted Duck on date puree.  This was delicious. The duck was cooked just right and the skin browned enough so that it wasn't too fatty.  The puree it was on was subtly sweet and the parsnips still had some crunch to it kind of like bamboo shoots.  It sounds weird, but it tasted great. There were probably 4-5 small slices of duck - a healthy serving.  This was paired with a red.Later came the American Wagyu Sirloin paired with another red.  This was also delicious.  Just enough crust on the sirloin, still juicy and flavorful.  The vegetables were absolutely delicious.  Portion was on the large side. At this point I was getting really full and a little tipsy.  I couldn't finish but I really wanted to.  Then they brought out an assortment of desserts to share-  a Panna Cotta, an Apple Crisp and the Chocolate Pudding.  These were all pretty amazing.  Especially the chocolate pudding - it has some sort of nut brittle in it that was amazing. I didn't even think it tasted like chocolate pudding...there was something very dulce de leche about it. Definitely get this!I would definitely go back.

Bobo doen't even have the same chef anymore!  If you read it, it's for reading pleasure only.New review:  drinking circa 2009.  And away we go!Sometimes it's 4 pm on a Wednesday and you're having a Ladies of Leisure day. It starts with a stroll through Highline Park, continues with a sneak peek at the new Jane Hotel Bar, and you find yourself in the West Village, simply PARCHED from all that WALKING!  You are two classy ladies; you need two classy pre-gym cocktails.  Bobo is the perfect place for fancy daytime drinks.  Though the bar is semi-subterranean, plenty of light comes in so you feel less like a sad daytime drinker and more like an awesome daytime drinker.  The cocktail list is creative and varied, and your drinks are expertly made. The twist on the classic Negroni is crisp and refreshing, and the original Fordham cocktail is light, cucumbery, and delicious.  After scanning the snacks board, your eyes alight on something called ""Marrow Tots,"" and hardly a word needs to be spoken.  Could bite-sized balls of batter deep fried in BONE MARROW possibly not be amazing?  The answer is no, they could not not be amazing, by which I mean they are amazing.  You follow?  Chicken liver toasts also arrive, and are a veritable texture party in your mouth.  This Ladies of Leisure thing...I was pretty much born for it.",12,10,9,Becca S.,"Brooklyn, NY",264,300,69

Always wondered what it'd be like to eat here... and then finally, last night, I had the unique pleasure to have the worst date of my life paired with rather delicious food.The upstairs is gorgeous. Great mood lighting--- a very romantic candle at every table. Perfect for a date... Unfortunately, this dude totally struck out, hard.Why was the date really bad? Because he called me a fatlady. Not even jokingly. Funny thing was he demanded to know how much I weighed and then mulled over that number with a ""really!? You carry it very well. You're the heaviest girl I've ever dated.""Wow. Before he dropped that bomb he gave me the worst compliment ever that made no sense, ""Haha, you're like the azn Paris Hilton!""WHAT THE FUCK?!  So here's what the fuqqin' fatty Hilton ate:  first an amuse bouche of bruschetta because this guy was actually very well connected, good. Next I had fucking incredible sweetbreads muthafuqqer. And I'm fucking glad it was one of the more pricey items on the concise and the very deliberate nuovo Italia  menu. It was beautifully plated, I ooooh'd and ahhh'd over how they looked like perfect little fried islands--- like Ponza. The batter and sauce brought out the flavor of the offal in a way that coaxed out the creamier notes. His app was the fried oysters. They were playfully served on top of the shell which had a dollap of tarter like sauce on the bottom. You could also dip them in the seasoned salt mixture underneath the shells--- really satisfying, classy Coney Island.  Then I had the monkfish, he offered me some of his scallops and I think I was wayyy too drunk to let him have a taste of either of my dishes. AWESOME, feast your face, Q.  His scallops were good, oversalted up the ying-yang, but smooth and slippery in the middle, such wonderful texture. My dish was really, really salty, but super delicious--- plus, it just gave me more incentive to drink (negronis, of course).

I feel like I was at a beautiful brownstone that had been decorated during the Victoria era with a contemporary flair. The wait staff was very attentive and was very knowledgeable about the menu. They gave us something that resembled an egg cream shot with pine nuts on top to awaken our palate, as a complementary creation from the chef. None of my friends liked it. I didn't find the shot to be particularly delicious but found the texture and taste to be unique and interesting. It was nothing I had ever tried before. It was something very unique to start our meal. We had several dishes but one dish that I can't seem to forget was the gnocchi. It achieved a perfect medium between firmness and softness. I liked that the dish wasn't particularly mushy. The sauce was very creamy and everyone at the table agreed that the gnocchi dish was the best they ever had. Ever since that dining experience at Bobo, my friends and I have been trying gnocchi at quite a few places. However, nothing has come up to par with the gnocchi dish at Bobo.

One of the other yelpers claims they are fried in duck and chicken fat. Mmmmmmm.Oh and last but not least, it was a wonderful atmosphere.  It seems like  Bobo would make for a particularly welcoming place on a cold winter night.  The music is loud (not too loud, but loud enough to create real atmosphere) and ecclectic, the candles and the lighting makes for a very cozy, friendly, warm feeling.  Im looking forward to going back.

The burger, served with gruyere and fennel, is also something to come back for.  Juicy, high quality beef patty.  Cheese.  Pickled fennel.  Those crispy little onion bits.  'Nuff said.The rest of the menu consisted of meats, fishes, and rich sides.  Take their French fries, for example: canola oil-poached, then deep-fried in a mixture of chicken and duck fat - according to the waiter, they're amazing, but we decided to spare our arteries this time around.  They also had a couple of enticing fish dishes, and a pork sandwich that I might try next time.  Leave behind any illusion that you're going to eat a light, healthy (or vegetarian) meal, and you should be pleased with the new offerings at Bobo.  Now that I've stated the good news, as a responsible yelper, I feel it's my duty to report the bad.  Three words sum up my biggest complaint: $4 tap water.  That's right.  When our bill came, we were shocked to find out that the carafes of tap water, so generously used by the waiter to refill our glasses all night, ended on our receipt as ""4 water charge"".  We were happy enough with the price of our meal to let it slide, but this bugs me! It's not enough to keep me from coming back, but making a customer feel duped is offense enough to lower my rating to 3 stars.  Next time, I'll definitely be inquiring about the price of my (non-bottled) drinks!** It should be noted that Bobo has a separate dining area upstairs from the bar where I ate, which I have yet to experience.  It is apparently fancier, with different menu offerings.  Other yelpers?  Any reviews?",3,0,2,Briana R.,"NY, NY",52,49,26

We basically threw money at the kitchen and said ""we have faith, give us your best"". And we were less than impressed. I will give them that they have some charming real estate, and that the decorations are pretty cool. I like the huge chandeliers, although less so the upside down trumpets with candles jammed in the mouthpiece, which sit on most tables. You get the scene. The staff is terrific. They, plus the real estate and west village location are the reason for the two stars. But the clientele is sort of brutal. You get the sense that its a crowd that lives to be seen, all dressed up in ""hipster rich"", sitting stiffly while listening to Van Morrison on the LP stereo system.  And since Bobo is REALLY hard to find (no sign out front) everyone is feeling pretty special, like they're in on the secret. I had high hopes, and they were dashed. Probably would have given three stars if it weren't for the price and the high starting expectations.Advice to Bobo: make the food taste great or this clientele will leave you for the next hot, hip, secretive spot. And your website reeks of pretension.",0,0,0,Alexa B.,"New York, NY",9,110,3
2.0,7/22/2008,"I would give this place a 2.5Sorry to bust the 4-star mood- I go out for food, not for pretty little chandeliers and antique looking chairs. Ideally, I would like both. This place is all charm, from the easy-to-miss doorway, to the color of the walls. Charming. Cute. Cool, perhaps. But that's it. The food cannot back up the ambiance. My friend had dinner reservations for her birthday. Our pretentious waitress was very attentive, but the food was all quite bland, from beginning to end. The foie gras had no flavor, and no one's dishes screamed ""I'm worth this much"". I dunno, maybe it was a bad night...Next time I'll stick to the bar.",2,0,1,Monica C.,"New York, NY",6,9,0
5.0,7/7/2008,"What a lovely place, hidden below the ground floor in the heart of west village.   Bobo was a little tricky to find, which kinda adds to its charm; once inside, you feel a great sense of warmth and coziness, where you can sit down and take a breather away from the hustle and bustle of the new york night life.   I ordered an amazing lamb dish paired with a beautiful bottle of red.  My gf, as always, ordered the fish (albino salmon), which i found kinda bland, but she enjoyed it very much.  The hazelnut chocolate cake for dessert was divine.  There are great cougars at the bar if you are so inclined, as noted so elegantly by our resident new yorker friend.   Would definitely love to come back to the bar for the drinks, I'll leave the cougars for my friend.",4,4,3,Mike K.,"Pasadena, CA",14,42,0

5.0,6/20/2008,"Great drinks, followed by amazing food.  Sometimes it can be a bit difficult to get in, as it's still pretty popular, but it's not impossible like it was a year ago.Also, in response to some of the reviews below, this place has matured (in a good way) A LOT since it first opened.  The first time I went (right after it opened), Bobo was replete with snotty hostesses, poor service and so-so food.  I almost never went back.  But I am so glad I did.****This place is adorable inside, with a little vestibule, a nice long downstairs speakeasy-style bar, and candles everywhere.  The tables downstairs are romantic and dark, if a little cramped.  The upstairs is like your rich best friend's dining room, if your rich best friend lives in the Dakota, or Sutton Place, or somewhere similar.  Even when it's busy, you can usually find a space at the upstairs bar (where you can eat a full dinner, too).  And the outside garden patio is, I think, one of the best in the city (maybe the absolute best, if you don't care about view).  The whole restaurant is chic enough to be romantic and make you feel slightly fancy, but not in a cloying, stilted, we're-way-too-cool-for-you way.  You can go in jeans and a t-shirt (even if you're not Brad Pitt) and eat like a ravenous hamster (if you've ever seen a hamster eat, you know what I mean) and relax with a great meal.Oh, and the best part? the music downstairs is not played through an iPod, or someone's Mac, or even a CD player...it's LP's all the way, baby.  Can you say Velvet Underground?  (the other best part: tea-light candles on the stairs -- love that!  though I fear some poor girl's dress will one day catch fire and my fun will be over...)",1,1,0,Brett M.,"San Francisco, CA",7,36,0

4.0,5/27/2008,"Bo for Bohemian - Bo for Bourgeoisie - and maybe BO for bonding moments, of which I will explain in this very mixed review I have of this place.First, we had this place recommended by our hotel concierge, but then after reading Yelp reviews, I was afraid of the outcome - some of what has been mentioned below did, in fact, occur - but strangely I can't rip on this place in overall score.let me try to explain.we tried to make a reservation last minute for an impromptu anniversary dinner - nothing was available, they were booked until very late.  But just to be pushy, we stopped by the restaurant in hopes of a cancellation, and the place was empty.  Somehow they squeezed us in.....  :)Our first bonding was with our waitress, who was attentive, and offered some great ideas for wine and entrees - she was beautiful and very easy to joke around with - the wine suggestion was sublime, and we were off to a great experience.  So much for the 'bad service' comments of other Yelpers.  OK, we didn't see our waitress again at our table until the check came.....score one for my fellow reviewersOur next bonding was with the couple next to us - mostly because I caught that the woman accidentally kicked someone at the adjoining table.  Not enough to bond over - not until the recipient of the accidental kick complained that he needed a better table and got up mid meal to move elsewhere.  We got to giggle that it was her fault (and we got to see the Bourgeoisie part, apparently).Final bonding was with customers at other tables as they laughed at the manager who managed to walk through the restaurant unaware that the bottle of sparkling wine he had cradled on his shoulder was spewing like a fountain on everyone he passed, including me.  Coincidentally he was headed to the Bourgeois table...So why the hell am I giving 4 stars?Well, the service overall was great - even though our waitress moved on, we felt unignored thanks to her runner.  The food was BANG ON.  and the Bohemian feel of the old brownstone with the back patio dining made us flash back to a similar joint in Buenos Aires that we frequented several times back in January.  Even the manager was very apologetic, so I can't fault him for a mistake.and I have some great goofy stories surrounding a fantastic meal, great wine, good conversation, and laughing moments.  Question: what else do you really want from an evening out??",1,0,1,Barney B.,"San Diego, CA",255,1007,0
4.0,5/19/2008,"Went on a Saturday night. I'm not a food person per se but I like interesting food that tastes good and it interests me to try creative restaurants. I got this recommendation from a friend who works at Blue Ribbon so the source was good. I have to say I haven't had a dinner this good in a long, long time. I ordered skate, something that I've never seen on a menu and it was beautifully cooked and mouth watering. For an appetizer I ordered cold pea soup with lobster. Understandably I was skeptical about that but it was one of the most interesting and delicious soups I've ever had. The decor was eclectic and interesting, the location was great, the service was passable, hence the 4 stars but the overall experience was fantastic. The one thing that was a little bothersome was changing the reservation. A few days before our dinner I found out we needed to add 1 to our party of 3 but it was impossible to get a yes answer the first few times I called, their opentable reservation system wasn't working and when I finally got an answer it was no. So I called back and explained everything and they agreed to add our fourth but it was harder than it should have been.",0,0,0,Roger G.,"San Francisco, CA",0,38,2

4.0,3/9/2008,"I wasn't surprised to read the complaints about the service here because that's perhaps my only complaint about this charming, eclectic, underground little spot on West 10th.  I remember much hype about this place when it first opened, but it faded from my mind until last night. I was brought there with a group of friends for a nightcap and the welcoming feel of the place kept our party going strong for a quite a while.I settled on the delicious Bobo's Mead - a tangy concoction of gin, lime, and lavender infused honey.  Yes, it was as good at it sounds.  All three times.  As for the service, it wasn't bad, per se, just strangely cold - particularly considering that the place had such a warm aura around it.    But regardless, it made for good drinks and a nice place to park on a chilly Saturday night.  I'm definitely a fan - can't wait to try the food!",15,7,10,Sam P.,"New York, NY",1869,875,636
4.0,1/25/2008,"Contrary to the other reviews on here - I had fantastic service. Went on a Wednesday, reservations were for 8:30 PM. The restaurant is on the corner of 10th and 7th Ave (a little hard to find as the main entrance is not street level, rather you have to walk down a flight of stairs to get into the restaurant - there is a bar on the ground floor and also seating for dinner patrons - I don't recommend having dinner downstairs as there are a lot of folks sitting at the bar. You will also miss the best part of the restaurant which is the interior and the upstairs dining room, which is fabulous. We were seated immediately - absolutely no wait. The main dining room is beautiful. It's a long room with great chandeliers (I have a thing for chandeliers). The walls are a beautiful robin's blue. Overall the effect is that of someone's home - (albeit a really nice home). It's warm and inviting, beautiful ambiance with a candle on every table, which they blow out once the person is done dinner. Most of the seating is two seaters, but there were two (I think) larger tables for large parties. The room was full of diners, great lighting, ambiance, patrons were mostly in deep conversation. Its definitely a stylish, slightly older crowd.. we may have been the youngest people in the room (and trust, I'm not young.. ) Started with oysters and they were really fresh, (had a bad experience at Morimoto), my main course was fish - decent and good but not particularly inspired. In general, the menu is pretty straightforward. Some reviews on Citysearch mentioned the $1 charge for water - so the real deal is there is a $1 charge for water which they filter on site - you can get either sparkling or flat BUT before anyone get's offended for a charge for water, they don't serve any bottled water. The water is really, really clean tasting. The front of the menu says something about environmental stuff but that's why they apparently charge for water.Phenomenal service. The maitre'd stopped by a few times during dinner to check in. The waiter was really attentive, knew the menu inside out and gave excellent recommendations from food/wine pairings to whether to have port or cordial to pair with dessert. He was also really cute! Spitting image of this Japanese actor.After dinner - went downstairs for drinks - and had the most amazing cocktails concoted by the australian bartender. Can't remember his name but want to say it's Soren? You can tell him what type of base you want and he'll whip up something custom for you. He made this crazy, elaborate drink with eggs and juice and vodka.. it was crazy, tasted like fruit juice yet wasn't at all sweet. The long and short of it - I have to tell you his cocktails were better than the ones I've had at Little Branch and Milk and Honey.I definitely plan on going back - Four stars for the ambiance, interior and great service.",2,0,1,Angela G.,"New York, NY",43,46,0
2.0,11/6/2007,"New York = small spaces. I get it.  I love it. I especially love when I walk into a restaurant that makes a wonderful use of its small space, with a eccentric country-like feel and small chandeliers that make you feel that you are in the lovely living room of your slightly crazy aunt.My love ends there. The service was awful.  We were seated literally two inches behind another party - I ended up sharing my bar stool with another person that I did not come with.  Our cocktails were forgotten, and we had seven, yes seven(!) different waiters throughout the 75 minutes we spent there. I even saw them seat a random couple next to another couple at a four top table.All of this is easily forgotten in my book at a new restaurant if the food - of course the real reason I go any where - lives up to the buzz...  The verdict: just mediocre.  My friend and I sat at the chef's table which I think is their last-minute seating but entitled us to several little gratis dishes from the chef.  Free dishes prepared by the chef would have normally made my night - but not if every dish was bland and tasteless.  It wasn't terrible but simply not up to New York standards.  The scallops were bland, the amuse bouche tasted like plain macaroni, and the bouillabaisse was served cold (albeit because they didn't bring a fork until 10 minutes after the dish had been served).  Two stars to the interior designer. Wait until they get their act together and perhaps try the pasta.  I won't be returning in the near future.",2,0,1,Pavitra G.,"London, United Kingdom",9,11,0

The table we sat at was obviously impromptu because they way overbooked.I would have been ok with all of this if the food was good, but it wasn't.  I have the chicken, bland and greasy, while my gf had the pork, bland and greasy.  Pretty obviously Im not going back any time soon.",1,2,1,Matt H.,"NY, NY",87,44,0
