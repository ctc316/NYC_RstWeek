4.0,3/27/2019,Had a good dining experience at Cafe Centro.   Had the special and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Prices are average and around the same as u would find at other establishments in the area.  Dining area isn't loud and easy to hold an enjoyable conversation.,0,0,0,Diana C.,"Manhattan, NY",16,151,144
4.0,2/23/2019,I've been coming here for a long time. Always a good visit. The food is always wonderful and service great. The Beef Bourginon was phenomenal. The beef is short rib and it was so tender. Halibut was good too. Only slight hiccup was the side Brussels sprouts. Very delicious with the honey and sunflower seeds but it was  greasy. Apparently they fry it.,1,0,1,david l.,"Brooklyn, NY",70,441,1255
5.0,2/13/2019,"Love Cafe Centro food and service as well as the atmosphere. Very healthy and always change up the food items. Never a bad meal, always top notch. Great place to take clients for business lunches and dinners. Bar is a bit too tight",0,0,0,Richard E.,"Atlanta, GA",8,13,12
4.0,12/27/2018,"Food and service were fabulous, even though the service can be a bit slow, we enjoyed sitting there for a couple of hours and taking in the atmosphere on a cold winter night.  Also loved that it wasn't crowded and that their space is large and comfortable.  Everything we had was great, from the appetizers to the drinks.  The oysters were excellent, just as good as my favorite places in Maine!  I was impressed!  Love that they're located right by Grand Central so that we could hop on the train to head home when we were done visiting.  And I think the prices were in line with what you would expect at a fine restaurant in NYC.  Another HUGE plus was that we didn't have to wait for a table.  All the other places we had stopped at nearby were booked, small and crowded (also to be expected on a Saturday night), so I was SO grateful that they were able to accommodate us with a nice experience and a great meal to celebrate my son's engagement in NYC!",0,0,0,Violet R.,"Philipstown, NY",97,551,460
4.0,11/15/2018,"Beautiful atmosphere for dinner with great food. All food was served with elegance. The menu does not have denotations for gluten free items but our server was very helpful. We had dinner at 7pm and the scallops and lobster were already sold out, which I found strange. Nonetheless, they have a menu that is 3 courses for $42 which is quite reasonable! I ordered the mixed greens salad as an appetizer and my friends ordered the lobster bisque, roasted butternut squash soup, and the french onion soups. They enjoyed the soups but my salad was very small for $14. For dinner, I ordered the lobster risotto (which was seafood risotto because they ran out of lobster) but was very good. It was a small portion though. My friends enjoyed the chicken milanese (large portion) and the sea bass. For dessert, my friends enjoyed the carrot cake. For people with gluten allergies, they had creme brulee and fruit for dessert. Overall we had a great meal with slow service but it allowed us time to chat for a while!",1,0,0,Lindsey D.,"New York, NY",397,204,105
1.0,10/30/2018,"A nice environment, have taken clients a few times. This last time, the service was terrible. A place with these price points can't afford this.

5.0,10/10/2018,"Soooo good! I went here with my dad and we opted for the prix fixe menu. I ordered escargots, fish, and red velvet cake. My dad ordered octopus, duck duo, and an orange cream mousse. Everything was delicious! Including the complimentary bread. Service was very good. My dad wasn't sure about a red wine and the waiter brought a little sample for him to try. Very laid back atmosphere, so once we were done with our food we were (happily) ignored until we flagged down the waiter for the check.",0,0,0,Christine X.,"Manhattan, NY",385,110,51

4.0,7/19/2018,"There are several nice places in the Grand Central area. But I picked up my husband from work and he'd mentioned coming here for Dinner- so I can't even take the credit for Centro. After-work crowd takes over their outdoor patio during Happy Hour but we had karma on our side and in we went. Centro stands out for multiple reasons. For one, it's (probably) the only French restaurant in the area (and no- I don't consider Maison Kayser a 'restaurant'). And then, the food itself, has interesting combinations and presentation. This place is sprawling. Entrance leads to a small seating area, Bar next on right, then it opens to another dining area, plus a bigger seating area towards the middle. This section, gives you a front seat to their glass-enclosed kitchen. They're actually ahead of the Restaurant Week game as our server, Ideal brought out regular menus as well as their NYC Restaurant Week- also (which doesn't start til July 23rd). I decided on it, while hubby went for the regular items. But for $42, 3-Course Dinner Menu, it won me over. Centro takes on French food differently. Salade Niçoise had flavorful ingredients, a super light dressing with an interesting black olive tapenade. But what got me real good was the Pea/Butter Sauce at the bottom of my 2nd course Salmon Roulade. Honestly- I wish I had a spoon to eat that sucker. While hubby enjoyed his roasted chicken with Mashed and Asparagus on the side. Hubby had a glass of a Château D'Arcins while I had the Hummingbird Margarita that was excellent! I liked Centro a lot and offers a nice twist to French food. Dining here isn't overpriced but it's not dirt cheap either. Just come for the food experience. Loved the attention to detail. And oh yeah...the food is spectacular! I liked my experience- if and when I pick up hubby again from work, I wouldn't rule Centro out.",26,13,23,Mercedes C.,"Bronx, NY",92,882,6216

Great interesting cocktails, accompanied by a delightful tasting menu @42 beans that was rather diverse and filling.Okay sidenote anyone who know me........knows I have a Supa soft spot for octopus.........and Theirs Baby was ""Lit"" as the babies say today.

1.0,6/8/2018,"Great place to go if you have 4 hours to spare for a ""quick"" business lunch, don't mind getting served the wrong drinks 3 times, first glass of rose was room temperature, asked by your same waiter 3 times what you ordered to drink again, served the wrong meal 2 times, asked by your waiter separately what you ordered to eat again, still brought the wrong meals in the end but decided to eat what wAs brought to us as we were starving after 2 hours of waiting. He kept apologizing that he was having a bad day which we have all have had and can appreciate but the fact that management didn't step in and try to rectify the situation in any way is truly appalling. At one point three tables were simultaneously going through something similar to us with this guy and tables all around us were screaming to us that our meal should be comped as they watched our meal unfold. Nope. Not so much. $150, 4 hours later, a wArm first glass of rose  and the wrong meal later we completed our meal without so much as an apology. Not sure how this place survives catering to business people in this neighborhood. Good thing they have a solid location or they would be SOOL!",0,0,0,A A.,"New York, NY",113,54,6
4.0,5/2/2018,"I have never been disappointed eating here. The food is competently prepared and sometimes innovative. In my opinion what makes this very busy and frequently noisy place special is the service. Example: I arrived early today for my reservation. They did not tell me to come back. They let me wait sitting down outside the main dining areaand came with an iced glass of water without asking. Yes, it is pricey, but the experience is worth it.",0,0,0,Norma R.,"East Brunswick, NJ",8,8,0

3.0,4/13/2018,"A conveniently located spot to dine, close to GCT transportation hub.  Lunch generally works well, with prompt service and a calm, professional feel in the large dining room.  The food is predictable, and the salads are often good.  Dinner is another story - despite the attractive dining room and comfortable seating, the underwhelming dinner menu does not compete with other NYC restaurants and is overpriced -- with steep mark-ups from lunch.  The service at dinner is down a notch from lunch, and seems rushed and haphazard, with bouts of quick service followed by long pauses.  The chicken Milanese was without flavor recently, although the onion soup was fine.  In summary, go here for a business lunch but find a more imaginative choice for dinner.",0,0,0,Jon K.,"New York, NY",0,3,0
4.0,3/1/2018,Had a work dinner here. There are rooms that can be rented out for such events. The food was good and so was the wine. I had the salmon over lentils with a mustard sauce. The salmon was cooked well... soft of the inside and crispy on the outside. For dessert we had New York style cheese cake with fresh strawberries. Ah-mazing!! The cheesecake was so soft and creamy. Service was great as well! Would probably come back to try more of the menu!,1,0,0,Elizabeth L.,"New York, NY",22,113,308
3.0,2/9/2018,"We went here for restaurant week. The restaurant is huge, nice atmosphere, not too fancy, and the service is great. While the plate presentation was pretty, the food was either bland (beet carpaccio salad) or far too salty (branzino). The salad was undressed, just slices of beets with raw walnuts and some arugula. The branzino dish was cooked perfectly and came with shrimp and hush puppies, but the only flavor the dish had was salt and far too much of it (maybe in the broth?). The dessert (lemon verbena panna cotta) was tasty, but nothing to write home about. The fresh baguette they bring to the table is very good though. I would not go back, but was not upset that we went.",0,0,0,Jennie A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,160,3
4.0,1/27/2018,"Had dinner with friends for Restaurant Week. The ambiance was great; low noise so we could hear ourselves converse. Our appetizer , mushroom soup was very tasty.

2.0,1/26/2018,Subpar. Came for restaurant week and the food did not taste fresh. Everything was just mediocre and definitely not worth the price. Services was good though.,0,0,0,Ana Maria R.,"Warren, NJ",1,26,2
3.0,1/13/2018,"Underwhelming restaurant week experience. Came here for lunch with co-workers and service was extremely slow. For restaurant week, I chose the salmon crudo (appetizer), duck confit (main), and homemade cookies (dessert). Food was average/unexciting and portions were small, but the dishes were well presented and unique. Expensive for what it is outside of the restaurant week menu. However, the interior is very comfortable and modern, spacious with tables spaced far enough apart. It is good for groups where you can easily carry on a private conversation without the restaurant being too noisy. Based on our one experience, server was not as attentive as needed and with the price tag of the dishes, would not necessarily come back.",1,0,0,Syyu C.,"Manhattan, NY",567,274,1485
3.0,12/28/2017,Nothing outstanding - but one of the better food/value lunch options in the area. The service is attentive and the room is attractive. Café Centro is a reasonable business lunch option if you don't want too spend too much.,0,0,0,Alan L.,"Cranford, NJ",27,436,405
4.0,12/14/2017,"When I arrived the bar was pretty packed and happening. We had a corporate dinner 12/7/17 in their private dinning room, which is across the bar. The private dining room felt pretty insulated from the bar noise. The service was very good and they were all very nice. They promptly refilled our wine/beer throughout the evening. For my entree I picked the salmon and lentils. I really liked the flavor of the lentils, but the salmon could have used more seasoning. I tried the fries that came with others' steak dinner and I loved that their fries are salty. The dessert options had cream, but they were very accommodating. They offered me fruit or sorbet: raspberry, mango and one other flavor I can't remember at the moment. I picked raspberry and it was wonderful! It was very rich and creamy.",1,0,0,Maureen B.,"Dallas, TX",86,70,136
4.0,12/8/2017,"This is one of New York City's headquarters for business breakfasts, lunch and after work cocktails especially during the warmer months with crowds of folks gathering on the patio and sidewalk for after work cocktails. Everyone I know professionally has started a morning here. It's a great power breakfast spot, convenient to Grand Central located off the main lobby of the Met Life Building. The food is solid and traditional American, although the atmosphere in this large space is reminiscent of a Paris brasserie with a lot of polished wood and glass. There's a small Bar which seats about 12 people -- convenient for after work and waiting for your train.  The roaring fire inside is a homey amenity.   I think Cafe Centro understands its market well and delivers flawlessly with wonderful breakfast and lunch and happy hour gathering spots, even if it's food is nothing special.",1,0,0,Joseph P.,"New York, NY",33,446,499
1.0,11/15/2017,"I would never come here again. I understand that their main clientele are older white men/people, but don't make this lone, ebony woman feel uncomfortable. I sat down at the bar, bartender Greg, gave me a head nod. Waited five minutes that asked...in this exact way..."" what do ya want?"" How could I know when a menu wasn't presented? I ordered a glass of Sancerre and 6 oysters. The total came out to $40.83. Wasn't even offered a glass of water. The two older white ladies were given water and I also quickly observed the nicer and softer tone used for them. I also noticed how he was almost babying them, being very attentive. The vibe was weird. Besides the service, I would never return. You pay so much for oysters that had a sh*tload if broken shells in them. Go to Docks oyster bar & grill. They're located near this dump place and the service is spot on. I also spent more money at Docks but would return any day because the service and quality of food was waaaay better!",3,1,1,Wesleyan T.,"Brooklyn, NY",445,354,29
4.0,10/22/2017,"We celebrated the hubs birthday (belated) and Cafe Centro graciously allowed us to use an expired coupon.It was a quiet Saturday night, not the usual hustle of M-F midtown.We had the Chateaubriand for 2 which was cooked perfectly.David, a manager, went over the top with wines and service. When I asked for a taste of a specific wine by the glass, he brought his top 3 favorites that he recommended for our dish.We were made to feel special, taken cared of, there was a candle in our desert, receiving service like this is few and far between these days. Hubs gushed the whole way home.The reason I am taking a star away is due to other employees. While in the ladies room, there were several untidy female employees in blue jackets cursing, swearing, screeching, leaving hangers and other various items in the sink that I threw in the trash myself..although I am assuming they were employees of Cafe Centro, I do not know this for a fact. I also saw a lovely dark haired hostess later in the evening feverishly cleaning/restocking the ladies room, so I'm thinking the cursing untidy blue jacket females is perhaps an isolated incident? All in all, a lovely evening, thank you Cafe Centro, we will return.",0,0,0,Jillian C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,74,7
4.0,10/17/2017,"Came here during restaurant week. Classy, beautiful indoor seating, more casual outdoor seating. Food is delicious. Service could use some touch-ups.The complimentary bread was warm and super fluffy on the inside. There were several spread options that came with the bread, but the herb butter was some of the best I've ever had. The crab boulettes were soft and flavorful. The crispy octopus was perfectly cooked and left me wanting more of it. The duck was tender, juicy, and one of the better portioned items on their menu. The petit filet mignon was just that, petite! Definitely could have used a bigger cut. But it was cooked well and paired even better with a fluffy green mashed potato side. I'm not really sure what the potatoes were made with but it had lovely hints of pesto flavor. The berry napoleons were a sweet, clean way to end our meal.Service was spotty. They were very nice when we could manage to flag them down. It took a long time to be able to order or get our glasses refilled.Overall, I would recommend this place for a nice meal if you don't mind shelling out for typically small portions and on-and-off service.",0,0,1,Vanessa W.,"New York, NY",472,142,337

2.0,8/13/2017,We had dinner here for restaurant week special. The indoor seating is spacious and comfortable. The outside was loud and therefore we opted for indoor. The food was average and cold by the time we received it. The quantity of food was average. Service was average as well. I wouldn't recommend spending your dollars here.

The salmon crudo appetizer was solid. The sauces are very good and dominated the flavor of the dish. I really enjoyed the branzino. It is one of my favorite fishes. The skin was seared very well and crispy. The meat was excellent as expected. For dessert, there was an assortment, of miniature cookies, brownies, muffins, and coconut/ peanut butter clusters. The muffins were my favorite.I also looked at the main menu. It was pricey so I am not sure i would eat here when it is not Restaurant Week.

We waited over 20 minutes for dessert, the Chocolate Molten Cake, which includes vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce. The waitress comes back and asks if we want the check, we reply we are waiting for the dessert. She became flustered and was upset it wasn't brought out yet.

1.0,6/27/2017,"If you enjoy fine dining, don't go to Cafe Centro.  I made the mistake of ordering the beef bourguignon at Cafe Centro this evening. I forgot my rule for eating at Cafe Centro --- to only order entrees that I know have to be cooked right then and there, without much effort (e.g. steak, hamburger).  The beef bourguignon was cold, and I mean COLD.  It was clearly just removed from the refrigerator and an unsuccessful attempt made to heat it up.  I told the waiter and requested that it be heated.  Shortly thereafter, when it arrived back to the table, it was only lukewarm.  The waiter wanted to take it back again.  But at that point, I didn't feel comfortable about sending it back again.  But I told the waiter that it was disappointing.  I requested a container to take it home.  This was not my first bad experience at Cafe Centro either.  In fact, I only go to this restaurant twice a year to meet friends who work across the street.    Otherwise, I would not eat there again.  I don't recommend it. For such an expensive restaurant, I don't think I've ever had a good meal (always either cold or too salty or something else), unless it was a steak or burger that had to be cooked without much effort.",0,0,1,Bridget C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0
3.0,6/23/2017,Came here after work with my family.  You can't beat the location for those traveling to or from grand central. The restaurant is on the block with outdoor seating which provides prime people watching views.  We opted for the 3 course prix fix menu. We had everything on the menu between the whole family and the food was pretty good. The speck salad was decent as was the calamari ( could have had more flavor and was a bit chewy).   The mussel pasta was good but very rich and creamy which wasn't expected. The steak was very well liked. I had the monkfish which was good as well. The dessert was my favorite - dark chocolate bread pudding - it was fantastic. The waitress was very nice but overall the kitchen was just too slow. We were there for over 2 hours and my parents missed two of the trains they hoped they could make.  When I walked by the kitchen I could see they were just very slow and unprepared for the volume. I would possibly come back but will keep in mind this is by no means a quick meal before catching a train.,0,0,1,Jessica B.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",241,235,626
5.0,5/19/2017,"Excellent food, service and value.  We went with another couple for dinner.  All our meals were delicious: roast chicken, mussels & fries, petit filet, and scallops.  The ""moules frites"" portion was enormous, enough for 2.  The filet was not so petit and had a scrumptious sauce.  Prices were reasonable for NYC, and service was efficient and friendly.  Lots of choices on the menu.  Another plus -- at 6:30 on a weeknight, the restaurant inside was very conducive to conversation.  When in NYC, we will definitely return.",0,0,0,Randy K.,"Bradenton, FL",0,335,2
4.0,5/18/2017,Convienent place for lunch with ample seating. Price is moderate for New York. This place gets very loud due to the open design so conversations are difficult when it's crowded.

3.0,3/9/2017,Cafe Centro is perfect for a business lunch. The restaurant is typically bustling during the lunch rush  so I'd recommend reservations but the hostess can usually fit you in with a short wait.The food is decent and it comes out piping hot from the kitchen in less than 5 minutes. I had the salmon with potatoes and parsnip purée. The potatoes and parsnip are more of a garnish than sides. Definitely order a side salad or fries because the salmon isn't enough to satisfy a hearty appetite. I washed down the entree with a goblet of the flavored iced tea. It's not sweetened but it's really good. Try it!,1,0,1,Kelechi O.,"Manhattan, NY",188,82,288

2.0,2/5/2017,"A fine dining restaurant run under a restaurant group only means trouble. I chose this place as the  Bae's first restaurant week experience. The menu looked a-ok and I wanted to wine and dine in a spot that was relatively quiet.The restaurant on a Tuesday is empty. Practically no one is dining in and that should raise your first red flag. I tried the below.Salmon TartareSalmon on top of cucumbers drizzled with zest. Nothing too fancy and nothing to boast about.Filet Mignon Typical restaurants over cook your medium rare steak. Here at Cafe Centro, they surely under cook it. I was disappointed when I noticed after having eaten a few bites it was 100% red. I had to send it back to the kitchen to have it cooked again. Sigh. Also the steak could have been better off without the barbecue-esque sauce. The fruit purée was enough. Clearly not a sauce-y girl but the steak was surrounded by sauce making it almost impossible to even taste the quality of the meat. Tarte du PommeFancy French wording for apple pie. Damn. I was fooled upon receiving an apple tart. Easily a replicate from the one I got at Old Country Buffet when I was 10. Grrr. Food was just a disappointment. Service on the other hand was interesting. I guess management has been crackling down as even the manager came over to serve us our dessert as he muttered to the server that the desserts were sitting out for a while. Haha.

2.0,12/8/2016,"Café Centro and Beer Bar are under the same company group except Café Centro is the fancier dining option serving more French and Mediterranean food. But quite frankly, I think the food and service at Beer Bar is a lot better.  I came to Café Centro for both lunch and dinner and each time it was a different experience. One time I came here for dinner with some friends and our waiter was sort of eavesdropping into our conversation. He also chuckled at some comments we made. That's just plain outright rude because no one asked for his opinion. But the whole night, I just felt he was acting weird and awkward around us and didn't make us feel comfortable. Food-wise, the grilled salmon was just alright. I've had better and given the sub-par experience I had that night, I told myself never to come back for dinner. Then with my lunch experience, we only came because Beer Bar was closed for a private event (darn!). So I sucked it up and decided to give Café Centro a second try. While the service was a lot better, the food was quite disappointing.  I ended up getting the pre-fixe lunch and I ended up choosing the Whitefish Beignets as apps and Homemade Pasta with meat ragu as main entrée. The Whitefish Beignets was probably the most disappointing. It was fried, yes, but something about the whitefish meat they used tasted real funky. The consistency of the whitefish was not what I was expecting. I was expecting something more flaky but they made them into like mashed up meat balls.  The pasta was a little better but I wasn't entirely thrilled with it either.  Sad to say but their baguettes was probably the only thing I enjoyed. If you really want French food, Café Centro might actually disappoint you. I'd say go to the Beer Bar for much better food and service.",1,0,0,Rowena Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",480,1179,549

4.0,11/2/2016,"I've dined at Cafe Centro many times and it never disappoints.  I like the upscale decor, the comfortable booths and well spaced tables, the wall of windows, the open kitchen and the amiable wait staff.  The food is always fresh and well prepared, and while it may not be groundbreaking, I am always quite satisfied.  Yesterday I celebrated there with a friend for her birthday.  We both ordered cocktails from the menu that were tasty and well balanced.  While enjoying our drinks we were served their signature baguette with butter which is chewy and satisfying.  For dinner my friend ordered the roast chicken with mashed potatoes and I ordered the Moroccan Lamb Tagine.  Her chicken was very moist and perfectly done and the mashed potatoes were straightforward and very good.  My lamb tagine had a good amount of tender, flavorful lamb accompanied by couscous, carrots and zucchini and enrobed in a delicious, well-spiced sauce.  For me, this is the Cafe's signature dish and I order it almost every time I dine there.  For dessert we shared the apple tart tatin with maple ice cream.  It was to die for-really.You'll be happy with Cafe Centro if you like good food, good service, and a gracious atmosphere.  You can linger and never feel pressured.  I am happy to spend a bit more for the luxurious experience.",0,0,0,Beverly K.,"Fort Lee, NJ",0,6,0

3.0,9/29/2016,"I like the location of Cafe Centro and it is alway very busy, but lately it hasn't been fully on the mark.  My main point is that for the price you pay, on the high side even for midtown, you would think that things would be closer to perfect than they have been the past few times.Today, I had to send a dish back because it was too cold - I don't mean just warm, I mean cold.  Granted that the air conditioning was blowing right down on me and on the food, even my first few bites let me know that this was not heated all the way through, or had sat out too long not under the heat lamps.  And, fish, sea bass in my case, isn't much good cold unless you are talking tuna/salmon salad or sushi.I will say that the manager saw me looking for our waiter (who seemed to disappear for long periods of time) and did immediately get my dish back to be heated fully - they even replaced one of the filets that I had tried to eat.That all said, I will come back and do enjoy the food here, but I can't give it a higher rating because when you think of the price versus quality, you want more.",0,0,0,K M.,"Westford, MA",0,121,21

The bread was excellent. Chicken Caesar salad was good sized portion and had fresh rotisserie chicken.  Crab cake lunch was one medium sized cake, which was not enough for a meal.  It looks like an appetizer portion.Left us plenty of room for dessert, coffee, cappuccino and petit fours sampler.  We asked the lunch to be split for sharing among 2 people and it wasn't.

I was really pleased with the duck. It was a bigger serving than I expected, with crispy skin and moist meat. The cherry sauce is excellent too--not as sweet as you might expect. It was served with mashed potatoes and perfect baby vegetables, done just past the point of crunchiness but before mushiness. A great entree.The steak tartare was nice as well. My wife had chicken. I didn't try it, but it looked nice enough. The fries it came with were good. Cocktails are good, but nothing you can't make at home, and they're pretty pricey at $13-15. That's typical for the area, but they should be a little more interesting for that much. 24oz draft beers at $10.50 are a better deal, but the options are limited.The main thing is that the food and service were excellent.",1,1,0,Paul E.,"Bronx, NY",11,32,0

I had a crab cake that was bound with corn flake bread crumbs.  It was primarily lump crab, which is nice (and hence the $31 price tag), but felt like it needed more flavor and texture (note, I did not really do more than brush a bit of the butter sauce I asked for on the side).  The broccoli rabe was too salty, but edible.  My friend's steak looked very done - though not sure what level of cooking he asked for.  The spinach it laid on was VERY done, that's for sure.The best dish - the order of thick cut French fries.

Service-wise, the maitre-d and servers knew us by name considering we came here so often. It's just around the corner from my express bus home, so the convience factor was always a big part of my decision to come here for a decent glass of wine and a perfect medium rare ribeye steak. One of my other favorites that I order all the time is the seared foie gras with a fruit compote variation, which  during my visits has ranged from a poached pear to a macerated berry of sorts...devine!!I've never had a bad experience while dining at Cafe Centro, with the exception of once during dining in our party of four each of us ordered the ribeye steak, mine medium rare and the others medium well. Each of the girls glaring at me saying, 'why would you get your steak medium rare.' I had to school them on the best temp for a steak. The server came with our steaks and forgot the placing of each and I ended up with one of the medium well steaks. The girl eating my steak was umming and ahhing and did not want to switch back to her medium well. So, yet again another medium rare convert. Cafe Centro is a pretty decent restaurant within the Grand Central area, that provides a vast menu with comparable prices and quick service if you're trying to catch the 7:45pm train to Saugerties or from whence you came.

1.0,6/24/2014,I went there for a business breakfast meeting with a reservation. The food was fine and delivered in a timely basis. My complaint has to do with the fact they decided to overcharge me and say that my poached eggs with juice and coffee didn't meet the complete breakfast criteria. No explanation so they broke out coffee at $5 a piece and another $6 a piece for juice. I went back to point this out and had to negotiate with the manager who acted like she was doing me a huge favor by taking $10 off. Perhaps some don't care because you are on an expense account but the principle of overcharging is unacceptable and deceptive. Plus I shouldn't have to haggle over what is clearly stated on the menu and was confirmed by the server when I placed my order.

5.0,8/21/2013,"My girlfriends and I brought our boyfriends here for a triple date during summer restaurant week. At $38 for 3 course dinner, everything was excellent and we all enjoyed our dishes. I started with the poelee de champignons, which was excellent. The mushrooms were perfectly cooked, the sauce was amazing, and the puff pastry was a nice touch, though the bottom one got too soggy from the sauce. Most of us had the mushrooms, while a couple others had the pate, which they enjoyed. I had the duck entree, with celeriac puree and cranberry sauce. It was delicious. The duck was perfectly cooked and the celeriac was smooth, albeit a tiny bit runny. The cranberry sauce was a very good accompaniment, though the actual pieces of cranberries were too tart for my taste. My boyfriend had the lobster pasta, which was extremely flavorful and the lobster wasn't overcooked at all. For dessert, we split 50/50 on the roasted peach dessert and the strawberry dessert. Both desserts had fruit, a small cake, and some sort of ice cream. The shining star of the roasted peach dessert was the almond cake. It was moist, chewy, and very flavorful.The service was great. I had originally booked for an outdoor table without my girlfriends' input, so when we arrived and requested an indoor table, the hostess was very happy to change it and got us a table right away. We got a table by the fireplace, which felt very private because it was it's own section from the rest of the restaurant and we were the only ones seated there. The waiter was very polite and charming, and spoke French, which is a bonus for me because I love a French restaurant where I can actually practice my French from college.The atmosphere was lovely. It's dim, but not dark, and intimate. Very romantic feel and good for any date, whether it's single, double, or triple in our case.

2.0,7/4/2013,"I wish Anne B. had written her review before I came here, because I was very similarly disappointed. (Then again, I don't know if anything would've swayed me from pursuing magret de canard). I had perused all of the French menus and this was the only place that had magret de canard for winter restaurant week, so off we went. I was really hoping for authentic French food because I was taking N. to eat French food for the first time. Nope. I don't know if he was actually pleased with the food or simply pretending to be for my sake, but I was deeply distressed. I don't even remember most of what we got because it was so unremarkable; I only remember from the pictures. I had gotten a terrine for the appetizer, and I usually adore terrines. It was decent, but nowhere near as flavorful and fresh-tasting as it's supposed to be. (Then again, should I really be holding French standards to all the French food I try?) N got a French onion soup because he really likes them, but I feel like I've had comparable soup at Applebee's. The magret de canard was medium rare, as I had asked, but it tasted rather lackluster. Our desserts were similarly pedestrian. I don't think the ambiance is that cruise-ship like; it is reminiscent of some Parisian upper-end restaurants that I've been to. The service was polite and minimal (but fine). I was not pleased with the baguette, but then again, I have absurd standards for bread. Thankfully, I went to Petrossian the next week and had incredible magret de canard in a salad. Whew. (I hadn't known that that was considered French because it didn't show up in the search ... oh well). I just feel so bad that N didn't get to have a good French food experience.

3.0,6/30/2012,"What started off as a good-bye happy hour ended into a full on dinner with ok-good food and just mediocre service. My friend was leaving the great 212 for Baltimore and needed to say goodbye in this area- naturally, I thought of Beer Bar.  I also remembered how Beer Bar is full on one note people- finance guys in light blue collared shirts.  Since I was wearing a printed maxi dress, we decided to just grab a table at Cafe Centro- outdoors and 'round the corner from Beer Bar (the same restaurant- if you didn't know).Our waitress was really patient with us as we waited for our fourth to arrive (4 girls at 6pm ish- it wasn't hard to get a table).  We didn't really order any drinks.. one of us ordered a Blue Moon, but she wasn't stellar with the waters.  I don't know why they didn't refill our plastic cups, but our waitress instead brought us cup after cup..kinda inefficient. But ok. We ordered:1) the Yellofin Tuna Burger - 2 of my friends got this. I didn't try it at all but they seemed to like it. It was big and looked juicy. Came with sweet potato fries- which I tried a bit. These were done well.. but I am also more partial to regular fries. One of my friends just go the side of fries alone- which came with some kind of green relish, strangely. The size of this side (the fries) was on the larger size, so definitely feel free to share. $172) I ordered the moule frites- this was actually pretty good.  It was $17 on the outdoor menu they gave us (presumably at hard core dinner time it's $21), and was actually a huge pot of mussels. You get to choose between 3 sauces - the marinere (classic white white, garlic, parsley), a beer-basedm bacon and another tomato-based one (don't recall the third). I went with the first- it was pretty good!  Had a lot of butter and garlic- I wish it was a bit more infused with white wine. It came with two garlicy pieces of garlic bread, and a tower of yummy, skinny, regular fries that were pretty alright. They could have been more seasoned but eh I can't complain.This places ultimately gets 3 stars, despite good mussels because the service was less than par. Our waitress wasn't the best at picking up plates (not that I would be either but I ain't a waitress because I know i'd suck at it!), refilling waters...granted I know it was busy, but still. The big no no was that she mischarged us multiple times and had a slight attitude about it. We split the bill four ways- 2 on card, the rest in cash.  She charged my friend's card twice, and then when we she rang, she didn't accurately split the difference and was huffing and puffing a bit about it. When we asked her to do it again, she refuted a bit then realized we were right. We did give her the right amount of tip- but that was mildly annoying. Needless to say, I no longer work in finance so now find the Beer Bar crowd a bit obnoxious. I find that the food overall at Cafe Centro is overpriced but eh.. it 's a crowd pleaser enough for me since I like my mussels.

3.0,2/12/2012,"We were really excited to try out lunch at Cafe Centro for restaurant week this year, but were a little disappointed.  I completely agree with Justin B.'s account that the interior looks like a cruise ship.  It's a little bizarre, but no matter, it was packed at 1:15 on a weekday so it had to be worth it.  Off the restaurant week menu they were out of the crab soup, so supplemented it with their lobster bisque.  This is the strangest lobster bisque I've had.  Typically it is a thick soup with nice chunks of lobster.  Well they got the chunks of lobster right (and well cooked at that), but the soup was a little thin, and there were other chunks in there...carrots and celery!  Ok, so I guess that's cool if you want to do your own thing and not be constrained by the typical preparation of lobster bisque, but I wasn't that thrilled.  Maybe I'm a bisque snob, but the chunks of vegetables seemed to cheapen the soup and it became less of a bisque and more of a lobster soup (not even chowder because it was too thin...maybe manhattan style chowder).  Anyway, long diatribe aside, the lobster was great, but if you're a traditional bisque fan, you'll find this offputting.  Now for the entree.  I got the filet mignon.  It came with potatoes and green beans.  It was all good.  Not great, though.  The meat was very tender, so they had that going for them, but my rare steak was less red then the medium rare steak of my dining mate.  Also, the flavors tasted exactly like when I sear up a filet at home without adding any flavoring to it.  The sauce was good, but a little sparse.  The potatoes didn't taste of the caliber of such an expensive restaurant.  I don't know, everything was decent, and of course I ate it all, but I was not blown away by any means.  For dessert, a chocolate torte.  Meh. I love me some chocolate, but this just a really cakey brownie.  Not rich enough to be called a torte, and not worth ordering again.  The caramel ice cream was good, but that's probably thanks to the ice cream company they bought the pint from.  Yes, for the price, I'd say I got a $25 meal for sure.  But I was in no way wowed and would never pay full price for any menu item if the quality of food I had is indicative of what they normally serve.  If they were skimping because it was restaurant week, well they should've been more careful because they didn't entice me to come back.",1,0,1,Anne Marie B.,"Manhattan, NY",134,425,3

I needn't have worried. It WAS perfect, and the evening felt like a special occasion in every way.Cafe Centro is a *little* far from the theater district, but not impossibly so. We walked to dinner from our hotel on 44th between 6th and Broadway. We arrived early for a 5:30 dinner reservation and while the bar entry area was pretty crowded, the restaurant was nearly empty. We were promptly seated and our waiter, complete with French accent, attended to us, bringing me a cosmopolitan tout suite! Cafe Centro offers a reasonably priced prix fixe menu (which they also allow you to order from a la carte), but I was too enamored with items from the regular menu to select it. For our appetizers, I chose the foie gras terrine with rhubarb and toasted brioche, and it was divine. My husband had a dish of near perfection: red and golden beets with Vermont goat cheese and Belgium endive. We were both completely delighted. For our main courses, I chose lobster risotto (delicious!) and he chose salmon, which he said was perfectly cooked (he's a connoisseur). We shared a chocolate souffle for dessert, which took quite some time (the waiter told us 20 minutes, but it took a half hour), but we had enough time to walk to the theater. When they brought the dessert, there was a candle in a decorative raspberry, as I had mentioned it was my husband's birthday on Open Table when I made the reservation. I was very pleased with this little touch of thoughtfulness. It made the evening even more special! I would definitely put Cafe Centro on your list of special-occasion restaurants in New York City.

2.0,6/12/2011,"I had a huge craving for lobster during lunch the other week. Since my co-workers were taking me out for my last week in the office, it was between this place and Bryant Park Grill for a lobster roll. I really wish we would have been able to get a table at Bryant Park Grill. The lobster club sandwich here was a bit of a let down. Aside from the fact that this place looks like you're eating inside a cruise ship, it's your typical Midtown East executive eatery. I was bored from walking in the door. Let's just say, that is definitely not my scene. I'm sure it was made painfully obvious from the pair of chucks on my feet and skinny black jeans. Maybe not the right apparel to wear if you want to blend in here. To match the bland decor, people and service, the food fit right in. I don't think I was impressed by any of the plates on our table. My sandwich was devoid of pretty much any flavor at all. Maybe the avocado was just really overpowering, or the lobster meat wasn't prepared well. Regardless, it was a disappointment. The hassle of eating it (considering it wasn't well put together) was borderline frustrating, considering there wasn't much pay off with the taste. My co-worker got the lunch omelet, which really looked like it came from a fast food restaurant, french fries included. I was almost stunned to think that item cost almost $20. All in all, I guess I'm just not the clientele they are trying to pursue, so I don't feel bad for not liking my experience here.

2.0,1/21/2011,"If you think that you can get a quick bite at the bar of the restaurant (not the Beer Garden) after work and before catching the Metro Rail, do think twice about going to Café Centro. On January 20 evening, it took 45-60 minutes for our order of seafood platter and combination platter to arrive - and it's not even Restaurant Week.The restaurant should have been more upfront that it cannot handle such volume and informed us that the bar food could not be delivered in a timely manner! At around 730pm, or after waiting for close to 45 minutes for our bar food to appear, the manager gave the most snippy apology, implying that a customer at the Café should know better that it takes time for the food to arrive. First he claimed that the order only came through his system after 7pm. However, our bar tab showed otherwise. Our second order of the combination platter was placed at 652pm; the order for the seafood platter was placed at least 5-10 minutes earlier. Then he pointed out that the restaurant was very busy and said something akin to the fact that the long delay was because the kitchen had two orders of seafood platter ahead of us. There perished my assumption that the restaurant business is about getting food to the customer in a timely manner. The two platters finally make its appearance and the manager did take it off the tab. I would have to say the only saving grace is the very gracious and efficient bartender who was serving us.",0,0,0,Dawn M.,"New York, NY",0,2,0
4.0,12/21/2010,The food here has always been good when I am here. Service can sometimes use some help.  The fillet minion was very good.  They also has a champagne sorbet during the summer that was very good.I should mention that cost is not an issue for me.  The prices ate a little more on the expensive side.,0,0,0,Ted S.,"Norwalk, CT",15,54,56
4.0,11/22/2010,"Why yes, you may take my coat. Yes please - feel free to laugh at my jokes, top up my glass of water and make me feel important in front of my client. Yes, I'll have the $29 prix fixe with the butternut squash soup and the braised beef entree - and why don't you get us some oysters for the table. (Wait - this is all going on the company tab, right?)Relatively expensive and flamboyant enough to be called fancy - for a MetLife building restaurant, anyway. The food was delicious - perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth. Every item on the sparse prix-fixe menu was near-perfect. And the service was great. The perfect place to charm a colleague over a semi-upscale, all-business lunch. They won't rush you, but make a reservation beforehand to make sure you can get a table. I'd pick this place anyday - as long as I could expense the tab.",2,3,0,Chita B.,"Philadelphia, PA",49,130,56
3.0,11/5/2010,"My company paid for lunch, otherwise I would probably never come here.I think $24 for a salad is pretty appalling. Oh to live like the rich and simply throw money at lettuce. I got the prixe-fixe which for $29 includes an appetizer, entree, and dessert. Appetizer was a warm vermont goat cheese salad, which was bland. For the entree I got the 10 oz steak which comes with fries and a bernaise sauce. This was actually good. Dessert was a pumpkin tarte, not bad.I don't know what kind of bread people are talking about here. If it's the baguette, I didn't think it was all that.

5.0,3/5/2010,"We took a client there for lunch so thankfully, I didn't have to pay for my share because it's pricey!BUT, the food is awesome.  I try to limit myself to one piece of bread but the butter was SO good that I ate three instead.  (Yes, the BUTTER was so good - extra creamy or something.)  I started with the butternut squash soup.  It was unlike any butternut squash soup I'd ever had before as it came with tiny pieces of apple and creme fresh.  It worked.  For my entree, I had the lobster salad.  I ate the lobster in the tiniest pieces possible because I didn't want to finish. (the portion was generous) And it came with avocado.  Avocado + lobster = Meri is happy.  Our client ordered mussels and although I didn't try them, they came with pomme frites and she generously shared them with the rest of us.  SO good.  Crispy but not greasy at all.  And they remained hot throughout our entire meal.  We left it to the client as to whether she wanted to have dessert and she said 'no'.  I think she was just bashful and was waiting for one of us to say that we wanted something, but no one did.  I'm willing to bet the dessert was fabulous as well though.Our waiter was adorable and very attentive.  It was a very long lunch and the restaurant was practically empty when we left.  Each member of the staff we passed as we walked out thanked us and told us to have a great day.  Fine service indeed.  It's not a romantic type of atmosphere, not would I go there for a 'girl's night out'.  But for a business lunch - ""Woohoo!  As good as it gets!""",2,0,0,Meri S.,"New York, NY",50,137,0
5.0,2/23/2010,"Great Moules Mariniere, (mussels in a butter, garlic, fresh thyme, white wine & cream sauce),  some of the best I have had.  Extremely fresh, don't know if they were P.E.I.  or not.  I didn't ask, but they were stupendously plump, slightly sweet and the broth could aptly be described as ""the other"" nectar of the gods!  The price-point was on-point, for $19 you were served at least forty (and maybe 45) mussels.  I know because I ate about 12 - 15, shared with five others and STILL had a carry-out bag with about 20 mussels (and ALL that velvety broth).  The broth made it through lunch, but the mussels were devoured the next day...and since there was about 1/4 cup of broth remaining, I bought a nice crusty petit pain to finish if off for dinner.  :-)The mussels were served with ""frites,"" and I'll admit that I've never been to Belgium, but I don't think these were tradtional frites.  They were hot, but tasted like those American ""seasoned"" fries (what IS that anyway?) that pop-up on menus all over the place.  I only ate a few and took none of the potatoes wiith me.  On the redemptive side, I was able to enjoy an ice cold Hoegaarden to accompany my meal.  Now, THAT, I know is how the Belgians do it.  I highly recomment this restaurant.  Additionally, our server was impressively attentive--always a nice touch.",0,0,0,Lola S.,"Washington, DC",2,7,0
3.0,10/29/2009,"Festive place, good food. I recommend the butternut squash soup, the tuna tartare, and the assorted cookies for dessert.

3.0,6/2/2009,"Café Centro is a expense account kind of restaurant.  Not in the way that it's special and expensive, but in the way that it is expensive and fine.  The food is good (my staples are the nicoise salad and the lobster sandwich) but they have nice fish entrees, too.  Expect salads and main courses to be in the low- to mid-20s range.  The iced tea and lemonades are both very good and come in giant glasses.  The bread - they'll bring a baguette, some yummy rolls and French butter - is also quite good.",2,0,1,Katie Z.,"Pelham, NY",95,216,9

4.0,7/23/2008,"(keep in mind: review based on Restaurant Week experience) 3.5 stars seem appropriate for Cafe Centro. The atmosphere is a dim glow devoid of music, full of indistinct business suit voices. Tables are close but arranged so they don't feel crowded. The chef and staff display their handywork inside the glass kitchen. Reservation for three at 7p on a Tuesday. Bread came in a bow with butter chopped from its stick, still in the wrapper, along with a garlic butter spread. Ordered a glass of Chianti ($8) and waited patiently for the first course: seared scallop with whipped english peas and prosciutto. The whipped peas were bright and delicious, and the scallop carried just a hint of smoke in its sweet carmelized edges. It was a while before the entrees came, just long enough for frustration to set in as other aromas passed by tauntingly. While waiting, discussion drifted from band to free show to not so free upcoming show.  At one point, friend J. said she would drag friend V. to see Conor Oberst. Simultaneously, the waiter was refilling glasses of water at our table. According to V., protests of repulsion from both V. and me elicited an excellent smirk from the waiter. And for that, Cafe Centro can legitimately have that last half a star for a whole four. At least Cafe Centro wasn't hustling or shunning their Restaurant Week customers. When the filet of beef turrnedos arrived, the wait seemed worth it. It came with vidalia onions and potato tatin-- a really good pairing of starch and sweet soft crunch. The lobster (extra $7) and beef were both excellent with the bordelaise sauce (brown sauce made with red wine).  Several [waiters/manager] asked how our meal was within about three minutes of its arrival. Too soon, fellas. Dessert was a tasty finish: apricot tiramisu with mixed berries. In other words, a tiramisu with apricot sauce, a strawberry, a blackberry, and a blueberry. Simple and simply good. Three prix-fixe meals, two glasses of wine, and two additional lobster surf and turfs came out to $147. The meal was really good but not monumentally memorable. Cafe Centro is very cordial and considerate even to its RW diners, which was appreciated. Although I probably wouldn't go back, I'm glad to have gone.",2,0,0,Erin C.,"Moorestown, NJ",136,555,89

4.0,2/7/2007,"i came here with six other coworkers for lunch last september. we requested to sit outside, and we found ourselves pretty much underneath the vanderbilt overpass. the place is really large and consists of an expansive indoor area w/an open kitchen, an outdoor bar on vanderbilt ave, and the outdoor seating on 45th between lex & vanderbilt (where we were) our server was really efficient and took our drink orders right away. he also brought a loaf of fresh crusty french bread along with our menus. unfortunately, the bread wasn't warm --- but we were really hungry, so we demolished it along with the fresh butter it came with. for my entre, i ordered the tuna steak ($27), cooked rare. my coworkers had other items on the menu including roast chicken ($22), filet mignon w/fries ($35), and the tuna nicoise salad (~$15). our entrees took quite a while to arrive and we polished off another loaf of bread during that interval. the food proved to be worth the wait. the portions, though, on the small side, were quite tasty. my tuna steak came lightly seared (just the way i like it), and wasn't fishy at all. the lime dressing drizzled on it was a nice addition to the salty peppery crust. it came perched atop some fresh vegetables. my coworker's filet was also really good, though it only came with about seven steak fries. considering the price of the entre, i think that they could have afforded to have given us another potato. since we were on the company tab, we ordered coffee and desserts as well. my coworker & i split the molten chocolate cake ($8). it was delicious --- warm, fudgey, gooey, and topped with a small scoop of creamy vanilla gelato. well worth the extra calories. overall, this was a good place for lunch. i don't know if i would come again, given the relatively high prices, but we'll see.",1,0,1,Sonia C.,"Jupiter, FL",408,864,61
