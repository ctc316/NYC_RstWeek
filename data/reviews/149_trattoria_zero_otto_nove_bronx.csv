2.0,4/29/2019,When they first open the restaurant. The quality was excellent the quality of the food has dropped down 75%. The pasta was dry with not much Pasta sauce. the waiter was very rude and annoying. My friends were not as pleased as I highly had recommended this place. We spent over $300. We will never return or recommend this place. We will find another Italian Restaurant. I imagine those that goes the first time when I go back,0,0,0,Eunice M.,"Bronx, NY",0,2,0

3.0,4/15/2019,"Hate to have to lower my rating for this restaurant I once loved. Came here last night to be extremely disappointed by the service. It was almost impossible to get any attention from the waiters, and they seemed annoyed and confused when we wanted to order our food after sitting unattended for 20 minutes. Once we finished our appetizers, a waiter gave us dessert menus before we even received our entrees. We also watched as one server kept putting his fingers in his ear - at that point we decided to leave before our entrees arrived. Very upset to see this place be brought down by bad service.",0,0,0,Christina B.,"Bronx, New York, NY",253,9,4
5.0,4/11/2019,"I have been here a few times now, I especially love the atmosphere and decorations. You feel like you are in Italy! The food is good and they always have interesting and different specials. We had the calamari to start and I loved that it was sautéed and now fried! The bread that comes with the meal is very good and includes focaccia. For a meal I had seafood risotto and it was tasty. It's not the best Italian food I've ever had but a solid place to go on Arthur Ave with a great vibe!",0,0,0,Mary S.,"Queens, NY",214,20,11
2.0,4/7/2019,"Very unimpressed by this place. We joined the wait list through yelp and still had to wait 20 minutes for a table because they didn't really acknowledge that. The service is super fast because they want to get you out real quick. The food was okay. I really wanted to try the butternut squash pizza with truffle oil and mushrooms because it sounded really good but it was not. My boyfriend got the pancetta pizza and it was oily and not that great. As far as the wine, they don't really have a large selection. Basically, keep walking and find a better place in the area.",1,0,0,Marci A.,"Manhattan, NY",60,366,210
1.0,4/5/2019,"Dont come here if you want to have quality time. I came here around 6pm on Friday. Rushed through entire meal. They tried to take my place twice when Im not done eating. Third time - im like take it. I asked chocolate mousse to be cut in half, waiter snatches knief from next empty table and cuts in half with fork, smooshing half of mousse. NO JOKE. After bill is paid, they came to take unsigned receipt and brought it back. Then they do get out stare. Im like - they must be super busy and have absolutely no empty table. Entire front section is empty. I was out by 7:02pm. Food wasnt bad, but so as all the other italian restaurant in this area. If you want civilized and quality time, DO NOT COME HERE.",0,0,0,Jinn C.,"New York, NY",0,75,61
4.0,3/31/2019,"The pizza is definitely very top quality--a friend and I came here for lunch over the weekend, and that was a good time to go (was able to get a seat w/o a reservation). The margherita pizza was extremely good. We also ordered some mussels (big and delicious!) and stuffed pepper with other roasted veggies. The service was--okay. I can see what some of the other Yelpers are saying. The staff/management were a bit difficult to track down (re: asking about food restrictions, for example)--but once they were available, all was okay. I can imagine during a particularly busy time, it may even a little more hectic. But the pizza alone is worth the trip out to Arthur Ave to check out--it was truly delicious. And the environment has an open feel to it--really enjoyed that, as well.",0,0,0,Mel G.,"Bronx, NY",134,2127,0
4.0,3/31/2019,"The nagatives first: I had reserved a table through Yelp and we still had to wait 20 minutes for our table. Not sure it actually did anything for us. The food took an hour to prepare and they didnt refill our bread basket (maybe they dont do that there?) Also, the drinks were only ok. I ordered the Americano Negroni off the dinner menu (it was disgusting, tasted like Pine-sol. Everyone else at my table tasted it and agreed it was gross) so I asked to return the drink and get something else. The server, while overall very nice, was taken aback by my request and made me feel bad for sending the drink back which I did not like. He brought me the bar menu which ended up not even having my original drink on it (Americano Negroni), so it made me wonder if maybe they took it off the bar menu because it was gross... Everyone else liked their drinks but agreed that they were only OK, not spectacular. The next drink I ordered barely had any alcohol in it. So.... definitely dont come here for the mix drinks.Now for the positives: the food was fantastic! The bread and olive oil they serve while you're waiting is phenomenal. The focaccia was my favorite, but dipping the other in the olive oil sprinkled with some salt and pepper, ohhhhh man so good. 3 of us ordered pizza, I ordered the Margherita pizza. It was so delicious and the servings are pretty big. I took half of it home because I couldn't finish it all (although my dad ate his whole pizza so they're not SO big). One of the girls ordered pasta and another ordered the pear salad (as an entree, 2 others got it as appetizers) Everyone loved their food. Very flavorful, fresh, and delicious. Also the ambiance of the place is very nice and quaint (even though we all had to yell to hear each other talk lol). Summary: food was delicious, drinks were only ok, service was decent but not great. I would definitely go back but only for the food and maybe a bit earlier when it's less crowded.",0,0,0,Jaclyn L.,"New York, NY",134,33,8

3.0,3/24/2019,"I'm very torn about this review. Food was delicious. Ambiance was great. Service was weird. Our waiter was great reading off the specials then once we ordered we never saw him again. Other people dropped off our food. There was at least a 10 minute wait between our appetizers and entrees. We also never got our brussels sprouts, but the people delivering our food said they couldn't give it to us until they asked our waiter. We were never asked how the food was. I had a glass of wine at the beginning of the meal, was never offered another glass and our water was only refilled when we waved someone over. We had to flag down people who walked by to get our bill and to go containers--none which were our waiter. The waiter did drop off our bill, but wouldn't make eye contact with us when doing so. I should note our waiter was in the dining room the whole time, mostly talking to the hostess, and probably saw we were annoyed. With all the good options on Arthur Ave, I will likely try something else next time.",0,0,0,Becca R.,"New York, NY",133,18,14

3.0,3/3/2019,"I am very sad to update my review and lower it by so much. Honestly a major factor this time, as was an issue noted in my last review was the service which was once again very poor. It seemed like the staff were upset to get us additional drink refills or some extra cheese. The entrées also left a lot to be desired. The beef short ribs were somehow a bit tough and the cavatelli were bland. The chicken dish I had which is pictured was pretty good but needed some extra cheese and for sure had way to much tomato on top. The pasta dish pictured was also good but just nothing great.After trying this places a few times i have come to a clear conclusion. The pizza is absolutely phenomenal. We had a margarita today was tremendous even while the entrées were just average. I highly suggest making this a go to lunch spot just for pizzas, but if you are looking for a great meal, there are better options in the area",0,0,0,Nick D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",113,66,58

5.0,2/6/2019,"Amazing Italian restaurant right in the heart of the Bronx, just down the street from the Botanical Gardens! My first time in the Bronx and wasn't disappointed at all, this place rivals any top Italian place that I've been to, and has the ambiance to go with it!Between the four of us we got a sausage/cheese pizza, ratatore pasta, and calamari & mussels. All were amazingly good and even though I had my doubts about whether this would fill us up, was totally stuffed the rest of the day. Highly recommend coming to check this place out, drinks are somewhat generic but come for the food!!",5,1,2,Ryan R.,"Omaha, NE",28,210,65
5.0,1/29/2019,"We were on our way to the botanical gardens and wanted to grab lunch before our visit. Since we went on a Saturday during the holiday season, I wasn't surprised there was a bit of a wait. The 30-45 minutes was actually the perfect amount of time to explore the other shops and bakeries in the Little Italy of the Bronx. Even though they usually close at 2:30, they stayed open later to accommodate us along with others who were seated for late lunch. Between the four of us, we split the calamari (heads up, this appetizer is not fried), a pizza, and two pastas. We ordered the radiatore from the daily specials and it was absolutely phenomenal. The pasta was handmade and presented in foil, served piping hot. I can't recall which pizza we had, but based on the crust, I'm sure they're all fantastic.Would love to go back and try some more of their dishes!",0,0,0,Marci P.,"Omaha, NE",275,162,409
5.0,1/27/2019,"One of my AA fav's.  The ambiance is great especially sitting upstairs but the rails as you feel like your overlooking a palazzo in Italy. The drinks are well made and can be creative, many topped off with prosecco. The bread flies to the table once seated along with a nice bottle of EVVO to soak up.  I can't say enough good things about the bread, wherever you go on AA your in bread heaven.For staters, try the special grilled Octopus, we also had the mozz and tomato salad.  For entrees there were several great pasta dishes around the table that set off ooos and ahhhs.  One pasta dish prepared in a tinfoil tent which I thought was pretty cool. I had the special Mediterranean Sea bass with clams in a light (and great for bread dipping) sauce steamed in tin foil as well.Dessert was a beautiful piece of Italian cheesecake with just a touch of candied fruit found throughout- perfect!  There was also a sweet and crunchy cannoli that we all shared along side a few capaccinos.Lastly, let me add that our waiter Limo  was really great, attentive, knew the menu to a tee and did a great job exploring all of the specials.  This is my go to place on Arthur Ave and after several years of dinners here it was finally time to write this long overdue review. Update: 1/26/19 - another amazing meal. Shout out to Limo and his cousin behind the bar!  Best in class service, great food, great ambiance at ZON.  This is what all restaurant should be!",0,0,0,Adam K.,"Long Island, NY",193,234,265

5.0,1/5/2019,"I am a girl with intense borough pride. Having grown up in Queens, my home and my life were both subjected to MUCH boroughism by my Manhattan-dwelling comrades. My favorite places are all in Queens. But like all good little NYC urbanites ought to, I try to experience life in other boroughs. Like the liberal arts kid that I am, I thrift in Brooklyn; Like a good little musical theatre nerd, I see shows in Manhattan; like a lot of people, I don't really care for Staten Island. But the Bronx? Just wait.First, let's talk generally about Arthur Avenue. For those of you who are as unfamiliar as I once was, Arthur Avenue is the hub of Little Italy. Walking down the street you can smell crackling breads, biting espresso, fresh mozzarella. Its a fantastic area I wish I had known about sooner. I made the trek over to the Bronx's Little Italy I did not regret it.But the highlight of my lazy, gluttonous tryst with Arthur Avenue? Trattoria Zero Otto Nove. My mouth is salivating just REMEMBERING the food I ate here. The pizza was paper thin and perfectly sauced, but it wasn't even the main event! I ordered 2 pasta dishes in addition to my small pizza (as well as a healthy helping of free bread) and honestly, if I wasn't in public I would have licked my plate clean. Even the atmosphere was lovely. Lofty stone ceilings, cozy round tables, and a wonderful staff. I would come here again, even if it means temporarily betraying my favorite borough.",0,0,0,Isabelle H.,"Queens, NY",189,20,5
2.0,1/4/2019,"Let me start off by saying I've been to this restaurant multiple times as the food is amazing - only reason why this review gets two stars instead of one is the food. We come here, party of seven for my dads birthday. Food is good - until someone in my party finds a bug in her water. We call the waiter and tell him there's bug in her water. He immediately retorts ""oh it might of of been from somewhere in the air *he points up* (haha). Not once he apologized, not once. He continued to tell us how the bug definitely flew in the glass of water - MIND YOU, THE BUG ISNT A FLYING BUG - we ask to speak to the manager. The manager repeated said story of said terrestrial bug flying in the cup. But he re-assured us he's going to make my dads birthday special. Fifteen minutes later, he arrives with a some pizza dough with Nutella smeared on (and powder sugar - oh joy!). Needles to say, these people do not know how to provide service.

Let's not forget that the speakers weren't working which is the only reason we came here for the infamous happy birthday song the ply bec it's my dad birthday. Oh and to top it off their plate are stupid expensive and all you're getting is 1 single item.

1.0,12/21/2018,"I was very disappointed with the service this time around. I have been to this restaurant before and was very pleased with both the service and the meal. This time was different. Not only was my party passed around more than once to more than one waiter-but 4 different men were waiting on us at any given time. Other tables around mine were being served in a timely manner and without having to ask questions about their orders, I found myself having to do all the work myself. It felt like we were an inconvenience and the unprofessionalism was appalling. The wait staff showed zero interest in trying to please us, but instead passed around an infant child and ignored even the simplest requests (such as taking our drink order or giving us the check). This would not have been an issue during the dinner rush because understandably the volume in the restaurant would have been high, however we were one of the first parties to arrive right at 4:30 and didn't leave until 7.

I didn't get their seating arrangement. If we come in first, they should sit us in the front, not the dungeon in the back. The service was lackluster and I can't even begin to tell you about the food. I ordered the chicken parmigiana and it tasted like a slice of pizza and it was burnt. It didn't even come with pasta! What Italian place doesn't serve pasta with their chicken parmigiana?!  My son ordered the seafood salad and that was burnt too, my husband ordered the cavatelli and it tasted like cigarette smoke and it tasted old too.

Reportedly the 089 name reflects the area code for Sicily. IDK. I don't' know. I don't KARE. This place is perhaps the best eatery I have ever set foot into and I've been to dine on several continents. I ordered a grilled pear and greens salad that was outstanding.

2.0,11/4/2018,"I'm really torn about this place because, on one hand, the food was quite good but, on the other hand, the service was absolutely terrible.My husband and I live in the area and have heard consistently good things about Zero Otto Nove so we finally made our way over there today for lunch. Things were off as soon as we stepped inside. Most of the front was empty with the exception of a small family so we figured we would be seated right away. Instead, we had to wait until a table opened up in the back of the restaurant which seemed strange but we assumed that maybe there was a party coming in. So we get seated, wait a minute for water that gets slammed on our table by a rather disgruntled waiter. Ok, we think maybe he is having a bad day. The tables around us are all families and we hear them being read the specials, having the menu explained, etc. while we wait, and wait, and wait for our waiter to come by our table. When he finally shows up, he didn't introduce himself, explain the specials, ask if we had any questions, nothing! We went ahead an ordered, our waiter leaves and then another waiter slammed down a basket of bread on our table. Seems like everyone is having a bad day! We got our pizza very quickly which was appreciated and it was delicious! Totally lived up to the hype. We got the Diavola with fresh mozzarella and spicy sopressata. Our mozzarella caprese came out shortly thereafter which was also quite good - fresh mozzarella from Casa Della Mozzarella down the street, canelini bean salad, tomato, and roasted red pepper. The food was really very good! Not that the waiters would know this because they never came to the table again to see if everything was ok or if we needed anything. The next time a waiter came to the table was to snatch the pizza plate off the table when it was empty. We were finally asked if everything was ok when our waiter came by to take our plates and refill my water glass that had been empty for most of the meal! We just asked for the check because, by this time, we just wanted to leave. Waiter said nothing when he dropped off the check nor when he returned it, nor when we passed him to leave - not a ""thank you"" or a ""have a good day"" - nothing!When we left, we saw that there were now people being seated in the front and there wasn't a party or anything going on there so I have no idea why we couldn't sit there when we first came in!So, was the food good. Yes, it was. The pizza was absolutely delicious. However, the service was so appaling that I will never come back here again - which is a shame because I live not far from here. I loved the food and the aesthetic of the restaurant , it would be a great regular date night place but the service just completely ruined it.

I couldn't even eat it. The eggplant was thick and undercooked and the veal was thin and dry.  I was very surprised as this restaurant came highly recommended.  My husband had spaghetti with calamari and it was dry because there wasn't enough sauce over the dense spaghetti.  I would never go back.

He's really acclimated, especially to Arthur Avenue, & took us on a walk down to find a place to eat. He'd never been to this particular restaurant. Walking in, the wafting of coal oven pizza warmly welcomed us. As it had just opened, we were seated immediately. The specials sounded amazing, so we started with the bracciole (a rarity in FL) It was just enough for us to each enjoy a taste. Without getting into specifics, this is not a pasta joint. Pizza was great, but the food ..... simply amazing. I had the short rib special & it was the best I have ever had. Tender. Tasty. Moist. 4 huge short ribs, & I nearly ate them all. My daughter has the chicken cutlet but wasn't used to something so much better than parm! Son had pasta forno & cleaned the plate. Dessert? Oh yes. Cream puffs. Nutella pizza. Everything was delicioso! The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because the waiter never took our drink order.

My personal favorite was the dramatic response to a request for an extra plate ""you want another one?????"" Was whined at us.

Little Italy is quite concentrated, and it seems like the whole of Arthur Avenue and surrounds is full of good Italian restaurants. The person who brought me here says that there's so much competition that basically anything that's still open is probably pretty good. As we walked, a promoter tried to get us to come into another restaurant. There was a wait at Zero Otto Nove when we arrived, so we sat at the bar; we were told 30 minutes, but it was more like 15. Then a table opened up in the dining area. Apparently there used to be a piano somehow strung up in the dining room, which is no longer there, but the dining area is still cozy without being overly packed-in. I've started feeling clumsy when I eat out in downtown Manhattan, because it's so hard to fit through the tables to get to my seat. That wasn't a problem here. We ordered a Margherita pizza and a Mafalde con Broccoli di Rapa. Both were delicious. After the plentiful bread and olive oil that came as an appetizer, we couldn't finish the pasta, and it made a delicious lunch the next day.

The quality of the food outweighed the waiter's attitude that night, so we decided to give it another shot. This time both the food and the waiter (different waiter)were awful. We waited for at least 30 min to get the salad, and another 40 min to get our entrees. The food was rushed, wasn't cooked well enough, and it was abruptly dropped on the table by the waiter before he rushed to serve another table. We were looking around to find him and ask for utensils and pepper but he disappeared, so we had to ask the busboy to help. He didn't come back during our meal to check if we needed something. When we asked for the bill, he also threw the bill fold on the table and kept walking without saying anything. We felt very disappointed with this robotic impersonable level of service we received as guests. The place is a little pricy, we don't mind the price as long as we get a good level of service.

First encounter as I walked in. and waited for my friend to park, was a family whose son had just graduated from Fordham, however the father was drunk. He kept loudly rambling on and on (actual graduate wasn't there, I wonder why). Front desk girls kept talking to him, which egged him on and was very obnoxious. Finally they were seated, not sure why it was before us. Finally brought to a table and given the menu. I asked what the specials were today. They wouldn't tell me. I asked can you tell me because I would like to know BEFORE I look at the menu. Why should I go through the menu when I might want a special? They still would not tell me several minutes later. I flag down somebody else and pressure them. Finally get the information.I decided that I wanted to get the rigatoni with butternut squash purée, however wanted meat on the side. I was told that that was not possible. Why is that not possible? ""The kitchen won't allow it."" Well why? ""Because it might make the dish taste different."" Well that's what I want. No, we can't do it. Waiter finally said I could have shrimp on the side. I don't want shrimp. I meanwhile order wine and an appetizer, polpette (meatballs) with polenta. Wine was warm and appetizer was lukewarm. I sent wine back and was given another lukewarm glass.Meanwhile tried another waiter going by and asked what kind of meat I can get with the pasta. This waiter said chicken. I said what about beef. He said no, he couldn't do that. I asked for the manager. The first waiter comes back. I said are you the manager? He says yes, which I don't believe because he had the same outfit on as the other waiters and looked to be in his 20s. He said he could absolutely not add beef,  I would have to get another entrée. I said I don't want that much meat. He said that he couldn't do it.My friend meanwhile ordered escarole and bean soup which he stated was watery and bland, with San Pellegrino water. Water arrived in a generic bottle that looked like it it was a grocery store brand.So I ordered the rigatoni to go, we packed our bags and finished the night at Morrone's pastry shop two doors down, where at least I got a decent cappuccino and tart.This place is out of control!",1,3,0,M L.,"New Haven, CT",2,5,3

The crust was thin, the fresh mozzarella, tomato and basil was delicious. For an entree I ordered one of the specials, the beer braised short ribs with roasted red and yellow peppers. The meat was tender, the sauce was amazing though I could only eat a little because we were stuffed from the bread and pizza so I took the rest home and it was even more delicious as leftovers. My friend also ordered one of the specials, pasta with green pea puree and radicchio which she said was good. We were too stuffed for dessert but it looked like they had a nice selection.

Wowza. I had the ink pasta with scallops and my partner had the chicken parm. The chicken was delicious. It was breaded chicken with a kind of bruschetta mix on top.

It feels like you are entering a secluded grotto or hidden cave and then the room opens up to gorgeous high ceilings. Loved it. The blueberry pomegranate cocktail was also a plus. Would definitely recommend/ and/or go again.,0,0,0,Esther K.,"Montauk, NY",34,30,5

My whole branzino was good, but could have been WAY less boney. There were so many bones that it wasn't as enjoyable to eat...the fish was tender though and flakey. I just wish I didn't have to compete with bones...otherwise really good! The ambiance was very nice. It's almost shocking how big the place was. Loved the rustic Italian vibe.

4.0,4/18/2018,"This is a review after my 2nd time eating there.  This time I sat at the bar to eat and although the bartender makes for a great waiter never again will I sit there. The level of people gawking while they wait to be seated is obnoxious while you're eating.  It's a very rustic Italian place with terracotta-esque wall decor, wall murals and a cute little old Fiat usually out front.  They have cute little bathrooms which however only accommodate 1 at a time but are cute nonetheless.  There's highchairs for the kiddies and there's  upstairs and downstairs seating in the main dining room.  Kitchen closes for dinner prep so be mindful of that if you go.  Food wise no real complaints, the pizza is great, cocktails are yummy if not pricey and the dessert is delish (I tried the tiramisu and cannoli) and the service is good as well.  In summary go and try something in the BX.  Arthur Ave is buzzing constantly and is still very old school Italian with markets and restaurants. Show the Bronx some love.  There's limited street parking but there are a few lots available.",11,4,9,Chevon B.,"Yonkers, NY",263,79,285

4.0,4/14/2018,"Arthur Avenue is a slightly more authentic tourist trap compared to ""Little Italy"" (check the demographics there lately?) or other neighborhoods around the country that rely on a manufactured aura of authenticity and ethnic nostalgia to draw in crowds, often with food. (For a trenchant critique of this discourse, see the political scientist Adolph Reed's ""Three Tremes,"" a devastating critique of David Snorefest Simon's Treme show: nonsite.org/editorial/th…) But what the hell -- even if you know it's marketing, it can be fun, and it can be tasty, and Zero Otto Nove (ZON) had plenty of all three. This is a cut above the white tablecloth stuff along the rest of Arthur Avenue, and it's not coasting on reputation like some of those places. Yes, there's still some Italian restaurant pageantry, but the list of specials is thankfully kept to a minimum (versus the 15-point list at some places I've been to.) Pizza is to die for. You can split it with a party, in our case 3, as it's six slices, and use it as an appetizer. We also had short rib (problematic price to portions ratio, srsly), calamari (bleh, my pallette [sp] is too used to breaded covering), and meatballs (UNBELIEVABLE but also bad P2P). For entree, I had a cavatelli (tomato sauce, basil), which was too conservative a choice on my part. I was really craving tomato-ish stuff, but frankly, I could have made this at home, and you should branch out to the more unusual stuff. I definitely couldn't have done the pasta, though, which was delicious. One minor problem: the stuff comes out way too scorching hot. It took me 15 minutes before I could really plow in; by the time I did, the 20 minute countdown your stomach does before it realizes it's ""getting full"" had only 5 minutes left. Ugh! That made it a struggle to get down and eating the cannoli for dessert really hard. Cannoli is dyno-mite, by the way.It's uneven, and the P2P is not good, but the good stuff (pizza, meatballs, pasta itself) warrants a visit, for sure!!!",2,1,2,Merlin C.,"Manhattan, NY",274,608,74

5.0,3/8/2018,Delicious homemade pasta ! Run don't walk !!!One of my favorites on Arthur Avenue.  I have tried most of the restaurants here  but the food at zero Otto Nove  trumps all.It's truly a slice of heaven. When you first walk in there's a Narrow path and then transformed into  mini  Italian courtyard with high ceilings. You really feel like you're in a special place. We always sit upstairs which I prefer. It's a little quieter up Stairs so you overlook the diners below. You can only order what's available on the menu but they can make exceptions. The chef here is by  far the best and the homemade pasta is scrumptious. There's always an item for everyone to enjoy. Well worth the prices and the wait. The staff is good and accommodating. I wouldn't say exceptionally friendly but I have no complaints.  Parking is not too difficult so plan ahead with a big party.

I will go on the record as to saying I like the Manhattan location better for many reasons but this place didn't disappoint too much at all. I enjoyed the apps, pizza and pasta. The main meal I didn't care for too much I got the chicken scarpiello. Chicken was a bit undercooked for me.

We ordered a Margherita pizza as an appetizer, and it was perfect. Crispy but somehow still soft, saucy (but not overly), and covered in amazing mozzarella from the local Casa della Mozzarella. I talked about it for days after.Not really many vegetarian options, but I ended up getting the Antipasto Salernitano Caldo as my entree, which had stuffed peppers, eggplant, zucchini, and cauliflower, and it was delicious.

He said 1 didn't work and brought back the bill all on 1 card w/o asking us first. I think they just didn't want to pay the credit card fee for 2 cards for a small'ish bill. You're supposed to let someone know if their card doesn't work and ask for another card or form of payment.  This place is not Italian. They are Albanian or something. I don't care either way but it's not what I expect from a so called authentic Arthur Ave restaurant in terms of service (unfriendly and unwelcoming, ambience (isn't any) and food (bland).Food:The pizza was lukewarm. It was soggy, not crispy and chewy - the crust was underdone. We got a pizza that was like a plain pie but w/ arugula. I forget the name. It was bland. I poured olive oil and salt on it. The side of broccoli rabe was ok. A little overcooked and bland also. My pinot noir was $9 and tasteless and odorless. Bread served w/ olive oil - wish it was served warm.

5.0,12/19/2017,"My friend just moved into the area. That's a win/win situation right there. I get to visit some amazing restaurants and I also have a friend in the area for good company. We visited Trattoria Zero Otto Nove for a little belated birthday dinner and apparently so did everyone else. This place is like the capital of birthday restaurant's in the Bronx. There were so many birthdays the night that I went it would be easier to tell you how many tables didn't have a birthday, or at least didn't announce it. I was unfamiliar with the Paul Anka birthday song as it was a little before my time but now I heard it so much I can't get it out of my head. Thanks for that one! The atmosphere is super cute. It's moderately loud on a packed evening with chatter from the tables and there's a variety of background music playing at a low volume. The lighting is relatively dim and romantic. Definitely a cool place to take a date. The service was legit. Our server explained all the dishes to us and even made recommendations. We trusted in him with some of our choices and he was so spot on. He stopped by frequently to make sure everything was okay and that we were happy with our dishes and boy were we happy!The bread is so good, soft crusty and super fresh. I ended up eating the whole thing. I honestly just could not resist. For our appetizer we went with the calimari which wasn't served the typical deep fried way. It was sauteed in a sauce and served with greens. The texture was good and the sauce was flavorful. It went well with my glass of chardonnay. For our main course my friend had the short ribs and she let me taste them. They were out of this world! Amazing flavor and tender too. She told me they were the best short ribs she'd ever had in her life. I went with the seafood platter which was presented very nicely with peppers. The shrimp were huge, the scallops were nicely toasted yet soft in the middle. The squid was a little chewy but hey it happens. All items are served ala cart so there are no side dishes so we ordered a serving of rigatoni ala vodka to share. The sauce was phenomenal. It was tangy but also salty and slightly sweet with a hint of cheese and super creamy. If they bottled that sauce up and sold it, I would definitely buy it! The portions were great so we were quite satisfied with our meal but managed to save a little room to share a dessert. We got the tiramisu and it was also delicious with very rich flavors. I have nothing bad to say about this place, our dining experience was top notch and I will most certainly be back. Oh one last thing.... ""Did you have a happy birthday?

The bar area is a narrow passageway that everyone uses. We had to stand by the wall and be squished by parties being seated. But we were having some delicious wine so it was ok. We finally got a table after more than an hour. We were seated by the pizza oven - we watched the pies fly out at a good pace. The space is cute - faux Italian houses and a high ceiling which really makes the space work. Our waiter was great and gave us some suggestions. We started with the la riccardo Pizza. OMG it was amazing. Thin crust, nicely charred, butternut squash purée, pancetta and a smoked mozzarella. It was so good I wanted t keep eating it.  We had a seafood risotto - also amazing. Rice was moist and delicious and the seafood was cooked perfectly. The Ragu salernitano was a hearty meat sauce with a large meatball (yum) pork skin braciola, beef braciola and a sausage.

I am admittedly unfamiliar with the Bronx. It may as well be Mars to this Queens girl. But, I will gladly concede that when it comes to authentic, quality Italian food, the Bronx has Queens beat.I can't say enough about how lovely the dining area is! It's a cavernous, open space with sky high ceilings. It's been carefully decorated to recreate the feel of an Italian piazza, with makeshift windows adorning the walls and plenty of candlelight to give it a particularly warm, romantic feel. We loved all the attention to detail and think their efforts were well worth the end result.Our server was wonderful. While I cannot remember his name, I can't say enough good things about the service he provided which was attentive without being overly intrusive. We ordered a Margherita pizza with anchovies to start. Everything about it was wonderful. Perfect start to our meal. Our server suggested an off the menu item for my husband, who wanted a seafood pasta. The linguine came in a lovely sauce made of seafood stock and a touch of cream, heavily adorned with a perfectly cooked medley of seafood. Also fabulous!My meal, a hanger steak topped with mixed mushrooms, cherry peppers, arugala and parmesan was my least favorite part of our meal. I found my steak to be chewy and didn't much enjoy all the acidity from the cherry peppers, nor was I fond of the mushrooms used. Make no mistake though; these were matters of my own preference. This meal would have made many others quite happy, but was just not suited to my palate. If I could do it over, I'd have ordered the sauteed veal with fava beans and dry ricotta.

I should have gone to my favorite spot Antonio's Trattoria. Let's just say our waiter wasn't friendly at all. The food was just basic. It's wasn't bad but it wasn't worth the wait nor the price. My pasta was hard and when I told the waiter he said this is what ""al Dente"" is. I told him that the pasta was undercooked and not al dente.

5.0,10/13/2017,"La Riccardo (a pizza with squash sauce).This was recommended, and I am glad we had it. Great thin crust with chewy-and-crusty in one. The toppings are a little salty (prosciutto), so carefully choose your sides and the main. I wish I had a glass of dry white wine (but a glass of Pellegrino was just as excellent).Squid ink pasta.Excellent flavor. I avoid garlic whenever possible (because of the smell - it was a lunch!), but this is a dish that cannot do without it (and the chili pepper, of course). Dry white wine is a must (again I almost bit my nail for not having alcoholic beverage - again, it was a Friday lunch). Another must have.Profiterole.Italian cream puffs with chocolatey sauce on top. Real custard. Slightly crusty on the outside, buttery and chewy on the inside. Inhale the harmony of this olfactory joy, and then take a bite - it will get your five senses busy.

Once it was in my mouth I knew right away that it wasn't the knife. I suspect that a Valyrian Steel blade would have served me better, but my teeth were no match for this veal.

4.0,8/29/2017,"Stopped here for lunch on my first trip to Arthur Avenue and I did not regret my choice of restaurant.  To start we had the zuppa di vongole ($13 - Mediterranean clams w/cherry tomatoes & fresh lime) which was served with plenty of bread to sop up all of the clam juice.  For mains I had linguini alla puttanesca ($15 - tomato sauce, black olives, capers & anchovies) and my fella had the short rib special.  We had this meal about 7 months ago and he is still talking about how good his short ribs were, and he is not one to talk about food much.  He said it was one of the best meals of his life.  So I guess I am recomending ordering the short ribs if they are a special on your visit.  The linguini puttanesca was very good, if you are not a fan of anchovies I recommend asking them to leave them out of the dish, but i like eating this dish the traditional way so I powered through the anchovies.  The over all vibe of the restaurant is fairly cheesy as the walls are painted to look like you are eating in a town square in Italy, but some times cheesy is okay by me.",9,2,5,Bloss C.,"Jersey City, NJ",778,1102,2586
4.0,8/28/2017,"I came here for dinner on a Saturday night with my husband for the first time a few weeks ago. I thought the food was quite good, but I was disappointed because we thought they had fettuccine alfredo with truffles, based on many photos we had seen by other restaurant reviewers. We ordered a margherita pizza, clams, an arugula salad, and a pasta dish (don't remember the name of it but it had a red sauce and it had eggs and I believe sausage or another cured meat). I am only giving this restaurant 3 stars because we thought the service wasn't the best, and also because of the location of our table (a high traffic area). I also didn't like that the specials were not printed on paper because it was loud in the restaurant and we couldn't hear and remember everything the waiter had recited to us. After we got our appetizers, the rest of our food took awhile to come to the table. We weren't sure if the servers forgot about us, were just too busy, or if they were waiting for us to finish the appetizers. Regardless of the reason, I think they should have checked in with us because it seemed like they just forgot, so we just asked another server walking by about our food which he then brought to us.

I came here one evening to enjoy dinner with a friend. We waited not even a full minute before we were led to our seats.

I ordered Pollo capriccioso and my friend ordered a margherita pizza with a salad. As we waited for our food to come out we enjoyed the fresh bread.

The desserts were delicious.  I had the tiramisu, which was great.  The food,  however,  was disappointing.  The spicy meatballs appetizer's sauce tasted just like Chef Boyardee. My sister's dinner special of shrimp and mussels pasta was tasty but some shrimp were not properly cleaned and some had tails.  My husband had the Ragu Salernitano, which he said was good, but I thought should have had a side choice for the price.  A side of pasta or salad would've been good.  Finally,  I was not happy with the B restaurant grade.  I chose to ignore it but once at home I checked their record.  It seems quality has been declining.  This can only be blamed on management.  Quality standards should be met for the price being charged.  I won't return until I see that efforts for improvement are made.

3.0,8/9/2017,"Some of the pastas here are excellent - and things you don't often on other menus.  One in particular which is very good is malfade - the long fettuccine type with rippled edges, with chick pea and pancetta. I had the whole bronzino which was excellent, but it had way too much ""sauce"" - tomatoes and things, etc.  I'd have preferred it plainly grilled or broiled with just EVOO and lemon juice.  In general the food is fresh and nicely done, not gloppy or terribly over seasoned.  tiramisu looked good from what I can on another table - but we opted for desserts at the pastry Marrone pastry shop next door.  Service here is very good - professional and friendly. The wine list marginal, but prices are reasonable. Wish they had more good southern Italian selections by glass or bottle.   I never understand why most Italian restaurants - which are essentially red sauce places, and Southern in style, serve that insipid Pinot Grigio rather than a simple Orvietto or Greco di Tufo. My guess is they go for recognition factor over quality - they could sell the better stuff at the same price and make out better in margin - and people I think would enjoy them better.  All in all this is one of the better Arthur Ave places.",0,0,0,Pete M.,"New York, NY",234,360,142

5.0,7/26/2017,"I have been coming to Trattoria Zero Otto Nove a few times a year for the last few years while working at Fordham down the road and it never disappoints. This most recent visit was no different. This past Sunday, with a group of 8, we were seated right away around 7:15pm and greeted with terrific service by two different wait staff members who worked fluidly together. The environment of Otto Nove is pretty casual, and feels very Italian grotto-esque, with a high-brow bar space in the front, and a rock-formed and nicely decorated back dining room. We started with some wine, a red and a white, from their lovely wine list. The red had just enough tannin and great full body Italian flavor. I only tasted the white, but it seemed to have just enough power, yet enough refreshment to fit a summer evening.For food, we had two openers: the meatballs and two of the burrata specials. I really enjoyed the meatballs and how they played with the rough tomato sauce and delicious polenta. Burrata was a bit of a let-down and I probably wouldn't order it again. For my primary, I ordered the linguini al Nero di Seppia e Calamari with spicy black squid ink. The flavors were terrific and full, pasta was well-made, and the calamari and whitefish were prepared deliciously. I would've like it lightened up a little bit more, but otherwise it was great.

We arrived on Arthur Avenue in a complete deluge of rain.  It took approximately 20 minutes of circling around the area to find a parking space 4 blocks away from Trattoria Zero Otto Nove. Finally, we arrived wet, but happy to be at Trattoria Zero Otto Nove.  It was 2:33pm.  We were prompted told, ""Sorry we are closed for lunch."" by the smiling woman at the front.  She said, ""So sorry but you are 3 minutes late for lunch"".  We tried to explain we didn't know that they were closing for lunch and we had drove all the way from Manhattan to eat there in the pouring rain. She did not budge. Then I asked to speak with the manager, thinking someone reasonable would understand our situation.  The smiling woman said, ""Sure, I will get the manager.""  30 seconds later, a very brutally, stern woman, stood in front of us and said, ""There is no manager on duty, and we are closed for lunch.  I cannot make ANY EXCEPTIONS.  IF I MAKE AN EXCEPTION FOR YOU I WILL HAVE TO MAKE AN EXCEPTION FOR EVERYONE!""  I said, there is no one else here asking to be seated for lunch.""  She said in no uncertain terms, ""NO!"" Really,.....had we come 3 minutes earlier we would have been seated!  ""NO EXCEPTIONS!""   In the pouring rain!

(CHECK!)  The flavor, though...  They tasted like they were braised (or maybe just ""dressed""?) in a cheap, off-the-shelf jarred sauce.  There was absolutely no complexity in the flavor.  No real seasoning.  Just soft meat with cheap sweet pepper sauce spooned on top.  Umm... No.  (*sigh*)My boyfriend got the ""Mixed Grill"" plate.  It looked beautiful and I tried a piece of each meat.  Everything had that charred flavor, which was nice.  The prime complaint was that, he requested ""Medium"" in wellness.  Everything was ""Well Done"".  He would have sent it back, but we had a Yankee/Red Sox game to get to by 7:05 that night, so we didn't have time to wait.  (*sigh*)The Tiramisu was very light and airy, and the Hazelnut Gelato was very creamy.  Espresso was well brewed.  In general, it wasn't ""Bad"".  But we left the restaurant having the same conversation we have 90% of the time we leave restaurants; ""Why do we bother going out?!?  We're too food-snobby!""   (*sigh*)",2,3,0,Janine P.,"Staten Island, NY",104,56,67

5.0,5/3/2017,"After hearing about how good the pizza was here, my husband and I knew we had to come. We have been wanting to check out Arthur Avenue and the Bronx's Little Italy for a while, so we decided to include this while we were exploring. We arrived 15 minutes before it opened on a Sunday and there were already people waiting to get in. By the time the place opened, there was a line down the block to get in. Keep this in mind when coming! They brought everyone in and took everyone's names and after an out 5 minutes, started seating everyone. My husband and I had looked at the menu outside, so we already knew what we wanted to order. As soon as the server came we ordered: capricciosa and the caprese. Our food came out REALLY fast! The pizza's were incredible. The flavors were unbelievable. The sauce was perfect, the dough of the pizza was perfectly flavored and a little chewy, a little crispy, totally delicious. The ingredients used were fresh and tasty. As we were eating, we scoped out the other table's food and everything looked absolutely amazing. The pastas looked incredible, the other pizzas looked phenomenal, the appetizers looked to die for. There is not a single questions that we will be back to try everything else. This place is old school Italian that has been slightly modernized. I felt like I was back in Rome from when I studied abroad with the delicious home style Italian food that was served at this place.

The basil leaves are old too. I always keep a pot of basil and other herbs on the kitchen counter at home - so I know pretty leaves are easy to have.

4.0,4/7/2017,"Bronx's Elite Coal OvenEntering Zero Otto Nove (089) feels like walking into a cave. You start at a staging area-like bar where you wait for your guide, then through a narrow hallway you finally get to a region that opens up into an expansive stone room. There's a stillness of the marble all around you as the inhabitants intensely hover over their feed, with the oven fire in the center keeping everyone warm and safe.The Salerno-style pies are expectedly full of flavor, with the oven being wood and coal-fired. And the ingredient list satisfies the checkmarks of champions with San Marzano tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella and basil on the Margherita. Other pies dazzle like La Riccardo's with butternut squash puree, smoked mozzarella, pancetta, and basil pie (see pictures).The mix of heat sources do a great job, but now i fully realize the smarts of the rotating oven... here, the pizza guys keep having to rotate and it can lead to some human error ( aka artistry ) at times.Beware only ordering pies, it's may not be appreciated by the staff. Pizza is plebian, and they do not consider themselves plebes. They consider their kitchen to be a little more well rounded than that - and their purses at a higher level. Personally I don't give a pepperoncini, but to fit in, order your pizza as an appetizer to do like the proper Arthur Avenue kinsmen do. Some people say it's old school, some say it's new. I don't know and I don't care. It is full of expectations and they are unapologetic for it. The chefs work hard, with great ingredients, and turn out a great pie. They can hold themselves however they like.Opened: 2007Distinction: Coal and wood-fired oven.

Especially the pizza with butternut squash, scamorza ( smoked mozzarella) and pancetta! The Malfade pasta with chick peas, pancetta and pecorino cheese is deliciously simple. Other food options are hit or miss. The Nutella pizza for dessert, was like heaven, especially when paired with a glass of Moscato d'Asti. One of the only true Italian joints in The Bronx.

The area makes me feel like I've stepped back in time a little where mom and pop still run the show. You walk into the restaurant and are confronted with a staff who clearly speak Italian/other languages which to me - makes it legit. We were seated upstairs but got to pass by the main dining room. There is a great pizza oven that is kind of a work of art and definitely dining entertainment if you are in this part of the restaurant.  The staff seemed very attentive and from the looks of the food I passed by I'd go back here for sure. BTW: this meatball dish this guy had, had me near mauling him to try a bite. The pizza came out quickly and was the smallest most ""artisanal"" looking slices if you will. It was an average thin crust with the big chewy air bubbles of dough. There was just the right amount of char on the crust and bottom giving it that taste that you just can't replicate at home in a standard oven. The cheese was perfectly salty and abundant and there was just a few pieces of basil on top each slice. This pizza to me was the best one of the day, I may have even had a second slice!!!! Oh, they also have really great olive oil sitting on the table to dip your crust which it out of the world.

5.0,11/23/2016,"If I had an Italian granny, I'd want her to have  a dining room like the one here, with high ceilings, a big oven, and sepia colored walls to give the feeling that you are eating somewhere in granny's villa in the verdant mountains of Italy. My Italian granny would be able to cook huge plates of pasta so delicious each bite would feel like a granny's hug, comforting and filled with care and love. Perhaps an Italian granny awaits me with some future reincarnation, but for now, I defer to Trattoria Zero Otto Nove to satisfy me in the just how Nonna  would cook it department.A tiny car marks the entrance and storefront. My friend, who grew up on Arthur Avenue and was giving me the grand tour, explained it was similar to the old cars that one used to drive in Italy. Inside, the restaurant itself is beautiful. Past the bar we went, into a large room with  a skylight in an intimately lit dining area There's a wood fired oven; for the pizzas, I surmised.  Even with the dim lighting, the scene before me reminded me instantly of Botticelli's Primavera. This wasn't outdoor dining, but It was charming, rustic, with warmth and conviviality in the friendly smiles of the waiters and in the relaxed joy so evident in the diners. The breadbasket had Italian bread and focaccia, so fresh and not even needing the olive oil provided as a dip. I had the Linguine Al Nero Di Seppia, squid ink pasta with cuttlefish. The waiter had asked if I wanted the pasta in a red sauce, perhaps worried that a dish colored all black would frighten me. I asked him how it was traditionally prepared and he said with just the squid ink, garlic and oil. When in Nonna's villa, do as Nonna would do. It was marvelous, with perfectly cooked pasta made spectacular by the seemingly simple sauce of squid ink, garlic and oil. Indeed, the folks here knew how to cook. My friend had the Costelette Di Maiale Organic. The two pork chops were so huge if you're ever chased by a large, hungry dog, this is the doggy bag you want to offer as sacrifice. You'll be down the block to safety by the time the pooch finishes eating it. And the taste? Well, my friend comes from a family that makes its own pasta sauce from scratch every year, with buckets of plum tomatoes, and has a brother who actually slices whole almonds by hand to put into his bean casserole. And my friend, who had eaten here before, was very pleased. We were so stuffed we opted out of dessert, preferring to walk a bit and then sample some of the bakeries in the area. Portions were huge, so we both happily had leftovers to cart away.If you are around Arthur Avenue, do stop by for some outstanding Italian food served by efficient, pleasant waiters. By itself, the food would be worth a visit. But the pretty ambience of the place makes it terrific for a meal with friends, a date, and even family.

2.0,9/26/2016,Came here for a birthday dinner. Very excited as I thought this would be authentic Italian food which is hard to come by. Ordered the muscles as an appetizer they came to the table and right away had an odor of smelling bad. I had almost 5 closed muscles which were obviosuly bad... They should of never served this. After that I ordered the pasta al forno which had looked delicious from the pictures and ask I thought they made the pasta homemade. My mistake ! The pasta was undercooked and everything lacked flavor. My boyfriend had the osso buco special... The meat was ok but the risotto was gross no flavor and was over cooked even salt couldn't help it. Overall I was really disappointed in the food the service was pretty great very attentive and kept checking in. I might go back to try the pizza as that looked very good and they have a brick over right in the dining area.,1,0,0,Samantha T.,"Inwood, Manhattan, NY",4,10,6

The ambiance of the restaurant is really cool, it goes far back and it feels like you are sitting outside on the streets of Rome at a trattoria. Our service was extremely fast, and it seemed as though our waiter was from somewhere in Italy, which made the experience that much more authentic. We got the meatballs with polenta and goat cheese, which were delicious, I wish that there was more meath though! We also split  a margherita pizza which was prepared and cooked extremely fast and was delicious. If you plan on splitting a pizza however, dont go hungry! Their personal pizza sized! We also got Prosecco and Pinot Noir to drink which were both perfect and reasonably priced. To top off the meal, we ended with tiramisu which was out of this world. I highly recommend that dessert.

5.0,7/11/2016,"Ask any local and you will learn that Manhattan's Little Italy has moved. Increasing rents and the ever encroaching Chinatown have pushed Little Italy to the Bronx and Arthur Avenue. You can't go wrong with any of the spots on Arthur Ave but I particularly like Zero Otto Nove. On a Sunday evening, get your name in early and expect to wait. It's family dinner night and everyone was waiting at this spot. Having gone a few times and with only two in the dinner party, the wait was never more than twenty minutes. Once seated, enjoy an appetizer, a glass of wine, real authentic Italian dining. The service is spot on, the atmosphere is friendly, and the food is the best Italian I've ever had outside of Italy. The only down side is the place is a little echoey, so it gets hard to hear at times. However, bring the family, dress up or dress down, and break bread together without breaking the bank.

5.0,6/22/2016,"I got a chance to go to Zero Otto Nove a few weeks ago when I was in NYC and I was blown away.  Living on the West coast I don't have very many opportunities to try traditional Italian food but this place easily surpassed my expectations!     To start we had their antipasto platter.  A pretty traditional mix of meats/ cheeses but the quality is what stood out.  For years now I've always thought I disliked provolone cheese, just seemed mild and boring, but apparently I've never had the real thing, the provolone here was INCREDIBLE!  Way more flavorful than I ever thought it good be.     My girlfriend and I decided to split a pizza and a order of the Squid Ink Pasta for our main course.  Both dishes were incredible!  The pizza crust had the perfect texture, slightly toasted but not burnt.  The Pasta was also delicious, I'd never had squid ink before so I wasn't sure what to expect but I can honestly say now that I'm a fan :) .  The only warning I would give is to be careful if you have a formal event later in the day, my lips and tongue were stained black (totally worth it).     The service was excellent and complimented the food nicely.  I think the thing that really pushed it over the top for me was the decor, it totally feels like your in an Italian vila!  All in all I'd give Zero Otto an A+ .  If I ever find myself in Little Italy (Bronx) I know where I'm going.",0,0,0,C H.,"Mountain Home AFB, ID",4,211,0
1.0,6/20/2016,"This is only a review for the service here, because as much as I would have loved to try the food the waitstaff didn't seem to have too much interest in making that happen. I was pleasantly surprised when we walked in and the hostesses were nice and accommodating since we had a child with us and wished my husband a Happy Father's Day as we were seated. After that the waiter was pretty quick to bring us plates and water and even a special plastic cup with a straw for my daughter. We were really looking forward to this meal. Then he came back and read us the specials. All good up until now and nothing out of the ordinary. So we waited for him to come back to take our order. Just the three of us, so it didn't take long for us to decide....and we waited...and waited some more. After at least 20 minutes a table of 12 was sat next to us. We were starting to wonder where our waiter had gone, and after we had been seated for I'm guessing close to 30 minutes, he appeared and took the orders of the table of 12 that had just been seated without a glance at us. He was right next to us and just ignored us. He spent about 5 minutes with each person at that table taking their order and we thought, okay, this is insane that we've been sitting here this long and he's not even looking over here, but had a glimmer of hope he'd take our orders after he finished with them. Nope, he disappeared. After that our starving daughter was getting obviously cranky after having to sit and wait for food for so long (and so were we to be honest). We found another waiter and told him we had to leave because we'd been waiting so long and still hadn't even placed our order and our daughter just couldn't wait any longer. Everyone seemed really confused and another waiter asked in a panic if we'd placed our order and we said no, that was the problem no one took our order and he just threw his hands up in the air, like, ""oh that's fine then"" since they didn't have to worry about canceling an order. No apology...not a great feeling to leave a restaurant with. Even if we didn't have a kid, I think we still would have left after being so blatantly ignored like that. I think we stuck it out longer for her sake because she was super excited for pasta.",3,4,0,Baek D.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,23,0
5.0,6/10/2016,"Holy hell this place was incredible. Found it on Yelp and came by for food after a long day with a date at the Bronx Zoo - and what a perfect ending it was. The interior was clean and beautiful, without being too fancy. The front features a bar with TV (soccer was playing)  and the hall to the back opens to a cavernous dining room with natural window lighting in the ceiling and a second floor balcony for dining too. For the quality and creativity of the food, this prices were totally reasonable. Bread and olive oil comes free to the table, and of course you have to drink a Peroni. The Riccardo pizza with butternut squash purée was fan-f*****g-tastic. The entire staff was gracious and our waiter was helpful in making suggestions- the menu gives a lot of option! What blew my mind is that my date and I walked in right when it opened at 4:30pm, and within 10 minutes, half the place was full. On a random Thursday afternoon. Wut.

My dish was Pasta Al Forno and it was so filling with eggs, red sauce and pancetta! My husband ordered the spaghetti with ink sauce and I thought that was fabulous too.

5.0,5/16/2016,"Went there on a Sunday evening with my boyfriend and we were blown away. Not our first time on Arthur Ave, but our first time at this restaurant. Wow is all I can say. We ordered the special which was grilled calamari & arugula salad, it was charred to perfection. Next we ordered the caprese pizza which was delicious, very cheesy, and had a well done crust so you could actually hold your slice without the cheese sliding off. I'm not a huge fan of personal pizzas since most times I end up having to eat them with a fork and knife because the crust is made too thin, but this was not the case. Last and definitely not least, we ordered the squid ink pasta, one of our favorites. It was unbelievable - cooked in a garlic & oil sauce it had so much flavor and you can tell the pasta was super fresh. I'm not a dessert person at all (probably haven't ordered dessert at a restaurant in like 2 years) and my dinner was so good I had to order something here. We got a chocolate mouse cake with a side of vanilla gelato to finish up the awesomeness that was this dinner.

3.0,4/30/2016,"Seems like a lot of people have birthday dinners here - no less than 5 birthdays during our dinner. At 6pm on a Saturday, we had to wait 50 min for a table. As other reviewers have noted, cool decor. The service was okay - we had to ask for things like bread and freshly ground pepper, but the servers were polite and delivered what we asked for reasonably quickly. The food was just okay though. The appetizer and pizza we got were really salty, which kind of ruins things for me.  Maybe an off day?Pizza: We got the Diavola, which has red sauce, fresh mozzarella, and spicy sopressata. I don't blame the sopressata for being salty. However, the pizza dough was also salty and the tomato sauce was SUPER salty. The pizza would otherwise have been great. The crust was both crisp and chewy, the tomato sauce was thick and flavorful, and the mozzarella was great. The salt did me in though. Antipasti: We got the Polpettine, Polenta & Caprino. Again, this would have been great if it hadn't been so salty. The polenta had a nice smoky flavor which I liked and the meatballs were pretty tasty, if not very warm. However, the polenta was a tad too salty on its own so it was a little hard to take when combined with the salty tomato sauce.  I ended up having a lot of bread and water.Pasta: We got the pasta special of the day, which was a thick linguine with grilled veggies. The linguine was like super dense udon and had a very slightly pasty, sticky texture to it. Still, this was the most enjoyable dish of the meal, perhaps because we specifically asked that they cut back on the salt. For dessert we had the dish with strawberries and cream (I'm blanking on the name). This would have been good, but the strawberry sauce drizzled over it had an artificial flavor. Also, the dish was supposed to be made with fresh cream, but something about the taste and texture reminded me suspiciously of cool whip. Maybe it was just the artificial taste from the strawberry drizzle bleeding into the cream.We left full and I might go back if I was in the area.

The potatoes in my chicken dish were under cooked with the cornish hen being edible but not impressive. Worst part is we weren't even asked why barely touched dishes were being being taken back.

I wasn't expecting being seated right away for dinner on a Saturday night with no wait, but if the food was fantastic I wouldn't mind one bit. Plenty of places are.We came here towards the end of the night, but I don't believe that's really a good reason to ""run out"" of an entrée on your menu. Since the item is a regular entrée it should be available even towards the end of the night. If it was a limited market priced item, easily understandable if they are out. Moving past that thought of what we wanted and not getting it, we ordered two other entrees that were again simply not memorable. I definitely will not be coming back, only because there are so many other places to try on Authur Ave.I can understand this place is a classy spot and more on the higher end of fine Italian dining and I can appreciate that.

The inside ambiance is very calm and relaxing, some wallpaper bricks along the back and what appears to be a private upstairs for parties. There were young people on dates like us, there were a lot of families. The food was to die for. I'm not kidding. I'd die happy with that pasta dish being my last meal. I had complete order envy because my boyfriend ordered this rigatoni pasta with meatballs and spicy salami thing. The pasta was PERFECT, the sauce was PERFECT. I was so jealous. I ordered a white pizza and it was good, but not as good as I bet a regular pizza with sauce and cheese would have been. It's a little pricey, but very much worth it. I fell in love all over again with rigatoni, and cannot wait to go back.",0,0,0,Phoebe R.,"Manhattan, NY",2,42,0

4.0,3/5/2016,"I came across this place by chance since my friends and I were craving pizza and this was the first place we saw after leaving a bakery a cross the street. I am really glad we decided to come in because although at first it is really easy to glance over, after the hostess brings you past the arched passage, you enter into a spacious, sky lit room. The whole feeing felt as if I was back in Seville (which is weird for an Italian restaurant) because of the spaciousness and the natural light. The decor of this place is amazing.The food is a little pricy, hence my four stars instead of five, but it was good. My two friends and I shared two of the ""individual"" pies, which was more than enough food, especially since they also gave a bread basket. The olive oil is also really good, with a kind of fruity flavor to it. The waiters are also all extremely nice and accommodating.

The front of the house is not all that - with a front facing bar area, some tables, and an old car  on display out front. After walking through a narrow hallway, you enter the main dining area. Huge space decorated to resemble a street side Italian dining area. Very nice.The service is good and friendly. They are also pretty knowledgeable on their winelist which was a plus for us. The pizza was very good - freshly made in the brick oven, which we were seated close to. It was the saving grace. The pasta, on the other hand, was a little disappointing. We ordered the squid ink pasta and the cavatelli. The squid ink came ok but we were hoping that the pasta itself was made with squid ink. It was just standard dried linguini smothered in a squid ink sauce. The cavatelli was undercooked and dry. The staff explained that, with the exception of the pizza, things are cooked in small pans.

Fresh bread basket served alongside a jumbo bottle of table olive oil. The menu had a good variety between pizza, pasta and proteins. I was a bit thrown off when the looking at the price of pasta as it was more than the protein entrees?? Our group ordered apps- burrata, calamari (marinated and grilled, not fried) and antipasto plate. All were very fresh with on the smaller size portion wise. For entrees my friend and I split a Diablo pizza (hot sopressata, mozz and tomato sauce) and one of their specials which was a type of linguine with goat cheese, meatballs and tomato sauce. The pizza was awesome  and had a chewy salty crusty and spicy sopressata. The pasta was very al dente and could've used way more meatballs! Def felt skimped on these, they were so small but so tasty.

Bread is great and really makes the experience. Only Italian wines on the wine list with 1 California Cabernet available by the glass only.

The two specials we ordered, a risotto and a black sea bass, were surprisingly bland despite multiple ingredients. There were no child-size dinners so we paid $20 each for plates of plain pasta with butter - which to the restaurant's credit, were the best part of the meal. The pasta was fresh and delicious.

We walked in and they put us on the list and indicated it would be about 40 minutes. We decided to wait at the bar. They placed the bar right at the front with only a small area for everyone to walk past so it is not conducive to waiting groups, and the bartender was extremely unfriendly. We ended up waiting about one hour and a half. I don't mind a wait but I do get frustrated when it's much longer than anticipated and even when checking in with the hostess a few times, they can't give me an update on the wait time.We waited quite a long time for the waiter at our table. We ordered a salad to start with that never showed up. Even after we reminded him he didn't remember the salad until we were halfway through our entrees, so we just had him take it off the bill and not bring it. I had a pasta special with burrata and truffles which was delicious. My only positive experience here was the food which is why I am giving it 3 stars. From the hostess to the bartender to our waiter, the customer service is extremely lacking (maybe because they get a lot of tourists). The restaurant is a poor design for waiting groups and there is no option for you to leave and come back (they merely call your name), so I recommend coming when you know there won't be a wait. It also seems that they struggle to provide good service during busy times. I doubt I will be back because I can get just as good Italian closer to home but if you're in the area at an off peak time I'd suggest it.UPDATE: I got a very nice note from one of the managers through private message apologizing for my experience and ensuring me that they want all guests to feel like family.

The Martini was a harbinger of great things to come.Dishes our group loved included Linguine in Squid Ink,Orata Fish with Clams Baked in Foil, Pasta Puttanesca, Meatballs with Polenta, Ragu(Sausage, Meatballs, various Bracioles and Pork Skin) and Wood-Fired Pizzas. Service was attentive, prompt, efficient and even.....kind. The waiter was patient enough to go around the table explaining the Italian language items each of our fifteen diners ordered so that we could settle the check properly. One of the most remarkable facts to know about ""Zero"" is that the prices are VERY low for this type of quality.Run ......do not walk back........to Zero Otto Nove!!!!!!",1,0,1,Thomas C.,"Massapequa Park, NY",363,308,3969

Upon entering we walked down a short hallway through to a cozy room with a sun roof and a brick oven crackling over to one side. They most definitely aced the ""homely"" feel with decor that transports you straight to Italy (or what I assume is Italy, I've never been there to know for sure but I'll trust their judgment ;) ). Our waiter, Geo, was very professional and attentive, and eagerly explained any menu items that we didn't understand. The bathroom was also very clean, which is always a great sign.I wasn't too hungry so I decided to have the polpettine, polenta and caprino antipasti & insalata di arugola. I absolutely loved my dish. So much so that I haven't stopped thinking about it and I'm definitely having it when I go back again. I took a few scallops & shrimp from my husband's grigliata di pesce and they were pretty good, too. The table had also ordered some ciambotta which was alright but I wouldn't say great.

4.0,9/14/2015,"I heard so much hype about this place, I couldn't wait to try it. This restaurant is both spacious and beautiful, it is almost easy to feel like you are not in the Bronx or NYC at all while dining here. Definitely got the vibe that this was a bit on the sophisticated side. You know when you're in a truly authentic Italian restaurant because they don't offer things like ""penne ala vodka"" or ""chicken marsala."" I ordered the mafalde e cici which had so much going on, but I appreciated that it was not a dish loaded up with cream and cheese. It had chick peas, a bit of cheese, bread crumbs and pancetta, pretty good. Extremely filling, I had to take most of it home for leftovers, the food is definitely great.I have to minus one star because this was an insanely uncomfortable dining experience. All of the male waiters, about five, literally lined up a few feet from our table and just watched us. I get that it was the afternoon, nothing to do, but we felt so uncomfortable being stared at the entire time we were sitting. It's not like anyone came running over if we DID need something, so why post up there? Go do something! We had four different people wait on us, not sure who our actual waiter was. They all kept speaking to each other in another language which is fine, but only added to how self conscious we felt while being stared at during our meal.",6,5,5,Stephanie A.,"Brooklyn, NY",312,307,317
2.0,9/12/2015,"I expected a lot more from this place.  I found myself in the Bronx last weekend, and what better place to go for lunch than this well respected old school Italian spot in the Bronx's little Italy?We were a party of two and decided to start with the Cozze alla Marinara  (mussels in a garlic red sauce.)  The flavor of the sauce was absolutely delicious, but every single mussel was way too chewy and grainy. We also were served a plate with 3 closed shells which are known to be bad mussels and not safe to eat.  I understand this happens, but 3?!  Moving on, we also ordered the Polpettine, Polenta & Caprino for appetizer which is basically 4 small meatballs over two ""cake slices"" of polenta dressed in a red sauce and goat cheese.  I was excited for this, but they completely overcooked the meatballs to the point of no return.   And our last appetizer was the arugula salad with fresh squeezed lemon, olive oil & shaved parmigiano reggiano.  Spot on.For pizza we asked the servers their opinion on what's best since we have never been here.  They were VERY selling on the ""La Riccardo"" and told us we would not be sorry if we ordered this one.  Well, I was sorry.  This pizza is basically a butternut squash puree, smoked mozzarella, spicy pancetta & basil. Sounds good, but it truly lacked flavor.  I found myself wishing I had a balsamic reduction or even some sriracha to put on top because it just wasn't satisfying my craving for that delicious pizza I expected.  To be fair, the servers were very wonderful and the house wines that we tried were delicious.  I might try this place again, but I definitely would order completely different appetizers and I would go with a pizza that has red sauce, none of that butternut squash business.",1,1,1,Tara D.,"Manhattan, NY",70,54,0

There are a lot of tables in this small space yet you never feel that you're sitting on top of the people sitting next to you.The service itself is excellent, the staff is very attentive from the minute you sit down until you finish your meal.But, it's the food that is the real star here.  We started off with a shared appertizer called Polpettine, Polenta & Caprino which consisted of delicious small meatballs sitting on top of polenta and topped with crumbled goat cheese.  I have to be honest and say that after the first bite I regretted my decision to share this tasty little app and could have easily ate the whole thing myself!I followed up with a main course of Cavatelli al Tegamino which is basically cavatelli baked with mozzarella and fresh basil.  To me this is the perfect pasta dish...beautifully cooked cavatelli with fresh mozzarella and topped with a delicious red sauce.

2.0,8/24/2015,"I can't agree with all of the rave reviews.  I had lunch here on Sunday 8/23 and was not very impressed.  The long narrow hallway to the dining area gave you the feel of walking in an alley in Italy.  The hallway opened into a brightly lit eating area (thanks to beautiful skylight).  The space was not large but we were not cramped in our seating.  I loved the dining area and we were all looking forward to a wonderful lunch.We were immediately greeted and were quickly served beverages. However, our enthusiasm was quickly extinguished when we made a simple request to have our bread warmed.  Our server denied our request and haughtily informed us that the bread was baked fresh daily thus did not need to be warmed.  We assured him that we understood but we liked our bread warmed and we were again denied.  I never expected this from a dining establishment that clearly wanted to give the impression that they catered to their guests.  A small incident but it soured our experience from the start.One person in our group asked for something not on the menu ( some restaurants will make you a dish upon request).  It is understandable if an establishment does not provide this service (Zero Otto Nove is one that does not) but again the response to our request was rude.We finally made our selections.  I can't say the food was terrible but it was nothing to rave about.  The Margherita pizza was okay but the salad was underdressed or possibly not tossed well.  I had a seafood risotto that again was not bad but was nothing exciting.  I would skip Zero Otto Nove.  They seem very impressed with themselves and a bit snobby.  There are so many other choices in the neighborhood that don't make you feel uncomfortable when making a special dining request.  We left Zero Otto Nove unimpressed and disappointed.",0,0,0,Catherine S.,"Danbury, CT",0,3,0

In fact, I'd probably give it five but the food still does need to be reviewed.  The waiters were amazing - very courteous and eager to please.  I honestly have to say that I chose the place based on the pictures - they looked soooo yummy!!!!  Unfortunately, I didn't really find the place to be as good as I was hoping it was.  We tried the butternut squash soup and the stracciatella zucchini e uova - very interesting; both are broth based (I was hoping for a creamier butternut squash) and had good flavors.  We also ordered a Bistecca alla Salernitana and Linquini alla Pescatore.  The pasta was good but (and I really don't want to sound like a snob BUT) they probably ran out of big shrimp (because we found only one in the dish) and threw a bunch of tiny little thingies in there that they clearly forgot to devein (though I'm sure if the shrimp was a tad bit bigger they may have seen the huge black line that ran down its back). The scallops were a bit chewy and grainy actually.  The steak - very disappointed at round one of it (yes, there was around two) - we ordered it medium rare and upon arrival it was much more medium than anything.  It was also so very burnt that tasting it - quite frankly I couldn't.  The (amazingly sweet) waiters insisted to get us a new one.  Round two was much more acceptable - definitely medium rare and not at all burnt; though it was still disappointing that it wasn't seasoned very well (salt people! come on!) and by then we were so stuffed that we asked for it to go.  The simply wonderful waiters (yes yes, them again) offered us some Lemoncello on the house - very delish! good stuff!

4.0,8/4/2015,"We stopped here after a day at the Bronx Zoo and found a small municipal parking lot a couple of blocks away. This is a great spot for solidly good wood-fired pizza!Service: The waitstaff was attentive and polite. When we split an appetizer, they even divided it onto our plates for us. My only complaint is that they used our bread/olive oil plates for the app instead of swapping for clean appetizer plates. Well, one small second complaint - I asked the server if the ""ham"" listed on the pizza menu was prosciutto. He said it was - turns out it was not.Atmosphere: It's an interesting space, but the dining room is LOUD. If you're on a date, prepare to scream your conversation. It didn't bother us too much. Generally packed and loud = decent food, and this was also the case here. The pizza oven is visible in the center of the room.Our order: Pizza with mushrooms, olives, and ""ham."" Not prosciutto, it turns out. Little thin, rubbery strips that were pretty tasteless. Not even really salty at all. Not a fan. However, the rest of our pizza was great! The charred bits on the crust were heavenly, the sauce was good, and the mozzarella was high quality. Yum!We also got a meatball app with polenta, fresh basil, and goat cheese. Great flavor combo, well-seasoned meatballs. They could have been a bit more tender, but I'd order them again and I don't usually opt for meatballs.We also received bread and focaccia when we first sat down along with a bottle of olive oil. I was happy with the olive oil but wish the bread was warmed up even a little bit. Cold bread isn't as nice to dip. My daughter loved the focaccia, though.They gave us a booster seat - didn't need it but it's nice that they have them.Overall I was very happy with our meal and would definitely come back the next time we visit the zoo.",0,0,0,Brenda A.,"Santa Clara, CA",66,95,259

It was a convenient drive from the gardens and on-street parking was aplenty on a Sunday evening.We arrived on the early side for dinner at around 5pm and were seated right away but by the time we left, the restaurant had filled up and many people were waiting for tables.The menus boasts lots of traditional Italian dishes. To start, we had the Grilled Octopus Antipasti special which tasted delicious but was served lukewarm which kind of weirded us out. Fortunately we suffered no gastric consequences of the lukewarm seafood. We had noticed the big pizza oven and we are kind of fanatical about pizza so we decided to try the Margherita pizza with olives and anchovies added. The pizza is a traditional Napoletana style pizza with a thin crust.

3.0,7/27/2015,"I came with friends for a late lunch to finish off a day spent at the NY Botanical Gardens in ""da Brawnx"". As others have said, the design of the place is deceptive. The bar area is rather odd on entry, giving a modernized feel to the old time Italian social club. The long alley leading to the back is successful in conveying a feeling of a small street in Southern Italy. We settled on Mafarde Porcini (which I had spied on another table on our way in), and a pizza with sausage and broccoli rabe. The winner was the Mafarde (dialect for ""mal fatti"" meaning badly made in Italian). The pasta was perfectly al dente, the sauce tasty, but light on the porcini. The pizza was also beautiful, but oddly lacking in flavor. In true southern Italian style, this was easily fixed by asking for hot pepper flakes, presented in a ramekin (so you know it is a standard item in the house!). Both dishes were well priced for the quality and portion size, and the house has a nice ambiance and terrific service.

5.0,7/1/2015,"Oh sweet baby Jesus. This place was fantastic when we went last night. It was a real crowd pleaser and I'm so excited it was recommended to me. I can't wait to go back.First things first. The decor is adorbs. They have the whole back dining room (which isn't very large, maybe 20 tables) painted to look like an alley in an old Italian city. The hallway you walk down, which disguises the kitchen, has a bunch of faux doors to make it look like you're walking down some back street. It's very squee but I liked it.Our server was awesome. Incredibly friendly and helpful. He had no problem reciting the specials again for us (and almost everyone ordered a special) and was just so pleasant he really enhanced our experience. We liked him very much.Now for the interesting stuff. Our meals. I ordered off the menu and was the only person who did. For apps we had the baked portobella with smoked mozzarella and the sauteed calamari. Everyone was pleased with the calamari and the baked 'bella was rad. It wasn't tough or chewy and the mozarella wasn't drowning the mushroom. I could have eaten that as my meal.For dinner I ordered the rigatoni with butternut squash puree, peas, and mushrooms. The rigatoni are HUGE and awesomely rustic. The dish was really tasty but in comparison to what my dining guests ordered I was disappointed. Their dishes were so out of this world delicious that my equally delicious but ""safe"" choice paled in comparison. My fiance ordered the short ribs cooked in a Peroni sauce with the most amazing roasted peppers I have ever tasted in my entire life. I nearly ate half his dish. And we still had leftovers. My FIL ordered the chop special (veal chop, lamb chop, hangar steak) with brussels sprouts and potatos. The lamb chop is what dreams are made of. Gah you can't go wrong with a perfectly cooked and seasoned chop. My MIL ordered the cavatelli which was piping hot still when we were finished with our meal. It came in a wonderfully seasoned tomato sauce with the most perfectly baked on layer of cheese.But the winner of the evening, in my humble opinion, was the pork osso bucco. Sweet heaven above, if I had ordered that dish you can bet no one was going to get a bit. The tomato sauce was the most perfect definition of a bright, acidic, summer tomato with the most robust flavor I've encountered. The meat literally fell off the bone and the risotto it was paired with had the perfect balance of chewy and creaminess to compliment the tomato sauce.Literally going to be dreaming about that osso bucco for the rest of my life.

As you make your way past the bar, it's like you're entering a small Italian village secret where all the locals come to eat BOMB-ASS food.I had the pasta special of the night and if that's any reflection of what's on the regular menu, then you will find me here whenever I get a hankering for Italian food.I'm not sure what it was called but it was presented in foil, the waiter broke this pouch and plated it in front of you STEAMING out with fresh pasta (unsure of the shape's name but it was slightly spiraled and looked like little harps), pureed butternut squash, clams, shrimp, garlic and parsley. I demolished it! The portion was large, but as with most REALLY GOOD pasta dishes, it all goes down until you stand up and realize you've eaten too much!Wait staff was courteous, friendly, helpful and patient.

4.0,4/7/2015,Love the place!! The food is amazing. Saturday night my boyfriend and I were starving. We had heard about how good this place was from friends that live in the Bronx. We live in Yonkers so we aren't too far. We had the margarita pizza and it was delicious. The cheese is so authentic tasting and was one of the best I ever had and I'm Italian. For dinner I had the short ribs and he had the linguini pasta with calamari. The short ribs were tasty and filling. I really enjoyed them. My boyfriend didn't care for the calamari but liked the pasta. For dessert we had the cannoli which was great and took a nutella pizza to go which was delicious. Overall we were happy with the food.The ambiance was beautiful in this little place. We were really impressed - it was nicer inside than we expected. While we ate there were two birthdays and it was nice how they celebrated the birthdays there. Very cute. Only two things are that are downsides to this place that stopped me from rating it a five are the prices - a little overpriced for the entrees. Second the free Italian bread they serve you on the table was cold. They should serve it warm would be ten times better!All in all I would definitely return and its worth a visit!,0,0,0,Jenna S.,"Yonkers, NY",667,150,0

They also don't take reservations by phone!Food:- BREAD: i love the free bread they have at italian restaurants, especially when they are warm and tasty. sadly, this one was not warm. But when i asked for balsamic vinegar and parmesan cheese, they came and gave fresh grated parmesan with it. If you ask for extra bread, they bring out a second kind of bread that's also delicious.- PIZZA La Cirilo: delicious! the butternut squash puree gives it a really nice creamy flavor. not too salty and the mozzarella was delicious. and u can never go wrong with truffle. great non-tomato based pizza- Pasta al forno: i thought from the ingredients it would be a plain regular pasta that i could whip up at home, but it was really good! the sauce were savory and the meatballs were on point- Linguini al Nero di Seppia e Calamari: i was hoping for a squid ink pasta and they have a really great one! i tried both the spicy and mild and both are yummy. the calamari was good too. just be warned that the calamari isn't breaded/fried (thats the appetizer)ambience: dimly lit, very fancy/romantic interior.  very nice. but mood might get interrupted by the birthday song they sing, if you request it!Service: great service. all the waiters were on point. price: a little pricey, but worth it!

Chicken needed more flavor. I don't think it was seasoned.4. Dessert, biscotti, was very wet and mushy. I guess this is the texture it was supposed to be. Didn't like it5. Not a cheap place.

5.0,12/14/2014,"I've heard so many good things about this restaurant I couldn't wait to try it for myself.  After dining here, I have to say it definitely lived up to my expectations. This place is the real deal - everything about it is what you're looking for in an authentic Italian restaurant. The decor is modeled after an outdoor cafe in an outcove surrounded by stone walls. Walking into the restaurant you're greeted by a vast wine cabinet and a small bar you can patron while waiting for your table. You walk down a long hall to get to the main dining area, which is very cozy and warm. There is also an upper loft area with additional tables. Service was great  - the staff was prompt, knowledgable, and friendly. The menu was a combination of classic Italian food with more modern dishes. The food was some of the best Italian I've experienced. I had the pollo capricciosa; the chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. They topped it with bruschetta and pesto which was a little different but delicious nonetheless.

3.0,11/9/2014,"I like Italian food so Arthur Avenue is one of my favorite places to go when I have a chance.  There are many Italian restaurants to choose from so I made the decision based on Yelp - Trattoria Zero Otto Nove had the highest rating with the highest number of ratings.There's a old school Fiat parked in front of the restaurant. As you walk in, you're greeted by the hostess and have an opportunity to sit at the bar if you need to wait for a table.  Bartender was courteous and friendly.  Service was prompt.  When your table is ready, you walk through a hallway / corridor until you reach the open dining area.  It's kind of a cool experience.  The dining area is huge and has a second level, which only makes the high ceilings for the dining area more dramatic.Food - ordered two of the five specials for the day.  The risotto with broccoli rabe and almonds was good, but wasn't worth the $25 they were charging.  Everything else on the menu seemed to be reasonably priced so I was surprised when I found this small plate of risotto being charged at $25.  Good, but not worth it.The short ribs were excellent.  Served in it's own gravy, the meat was tender and that melt in your mouth quality.  Well worth the $25 they were charging.The margherita pizza was OK.  I was lured by the fact that they use fresh mozzarella and homemade tomato sauce with tomatoes imported from Italy.  The sauce was actually a bit too sour for my taste, but the mozzarella was excellent.  The crust was just OK.Overall, a pretty good place to go if you're in the area, but I was a bit disappointed by the lack of value in the broccoli rabe risotto and the pizza.  The short ribs were good and worth every penny.  It is worth going back just for that.A bit of note if you drive to the area.  There are some shady characters that may act like parking attendants.  They'll ask you if you need parking and direct you to a spot.  I almost took a spot until something in my brain clicked and I realized that the parking attendant looked like a homeless guy.  I don't mind giving some change to a homeless guy, but I did pass by another guy who parked with the help of the homeless parking attendant and it looked like he was being hounded for some cash.  Beware.",2,0,0,Brian C.,"Manhattan, NY",26,270,0

The bread was good, but not warm. The portions were not large, which I liked because it's the first time I finished a meal and felt great afterward. I had the rigatoni seafood medley special, which was good but it had this delicious yellow sauce but it barely had any seafood in it. The scallop pieces were incredibly fresh and delicious, the clams were teeeeeeny tiny and there were only five of them, and then the shrimp, let's just say those really lived up to their name. They were so tiny and few in number and tasted like they were straight out of a defrost bag.  My friends were not very happy with their veal scalloping. The pasta with meatballs was definitely the winner at the table.  Sooo summary.  Food ok/good but nothing to remember. Service was great. And ambiance was truly wonderful.  Little cave like hallway and one large open room that felt like you were sitting in a small Italian village.  I would recommend it for the experience but would def try the other restaurants instead for my next visit.",0,0,0,Marika C.,"Manhattan, NY",85,164,56

Not only was his service incredible, everything from the drinks to the food and the coffee at the end of the meal was perfect!We wanted to have multiple courses, so one friend and I split every dish that came out, and Anthony expertly split the plate right in front of us, taking the time and care to make sure each small plate got plated as beautifully as the original plate was. The Mozzarella Caprese was made with some of the best fresh mozzarella and ripe tomatoes I've had in a while. There was a slight twist which made this even more interesting (in a good way): roasted red peppers. YUM!For our second dish, we had the Rigatoni e Zucca, which is rigatoni served in a delicious butternut squash saucy with peas and porcini mushrooms. Again, YUM!This was followed by melt in your mouth short ribs (I think they were a special and aren't on the regular menu). Absolutely delicious. For dessert, we couldn't really pick, so we got both the tiramisu and strawberry shortcake. Both were just as good as the courses which preceded them (as in YUM!).The dining room is beautiful, and the hallway and everything are decorated as if the dining room is a little piazza in the middle of venice, but to be honest, eating at the bar was so much fun I don't know why I would want a table!",2,0,0,Lee M.,"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",132,58,63

Auguri to the artists and to Roberto's vision.  I took my Mom (90), and the soothing Italian music, gorgeous archways, polite staff and great food made us suspend belief that we were sitting in a piazza or trattoria in Trastevere...1. Food.  great.  we had eggplant parmagiano, arugula saiad, broccoli rabe, mozzarella caprese, chianti, espressso and the fragola dessert.  All wonderful.  We were both happy.2. atmosphere.  wonderful.  yes great for a date, or group of friends, or to bring Mamma.  spacious.  you can believe you are in a true piazza (almost) -- the exit sign break the illusion...)3. lighting.  candlelight and subtle high ceiling light and wall lanterns.  4. waitstaff -- polite. white shirt and black ties.  We had all young men waiters, they spoke one or two words of Italian ""Signora"" and ""Graziemille"" -- but when I spoke to them in Italian, two of them said ""Sono Albanese""  They did not speak Italian.  Just a couple of words to keep up the illusion of being in Italy or a Bronx Italy......5. Price:  85 bucks including tip for me and Mom. (2 appetizers, one vegetable side, one salad, one glass of vino, one coffee, one dessert)6. Street Atmosphere: Luckily we parked right out front.  I would not want to walk Mom around there at night.  We walked down Arthur Ave, and people were hanging out with pit bulls on the sidewalk -- not the place to walk at night with Mom at 90, a Mom who has nostalgic memories of all the neighborhood once had to offer to the Italian diaspora in the post WWII years.  That emblem is long gone.  The very emblem in brass, the big Italian American circle marking the neighborhood in the intersection of Arthur Ave and 187th Street is now covered with asphalt, erased as is most of our history.  I will definitely go back with friends.  It's the best of what we have in NY.  God Bless the Bronx.  Blessings on Chef Roberto.forever,Annie Lanzillottoannielanzillotto.comAuthor of L IS FOR LION: an italian bronx butch freedom memoir (SUNY Press)and SCHISTSONG (Bordighera Press)Singer/songwriter of BLUE PILL",0,0,1,Rachele L.,"New York, NY",333,46,39

I shared La Cirilo (pizza with butternut squash puree, mushroom, fresh mozzarella and some kind of truffle oil) and black ink pasta (with calamari and sepia inside ) with my girl friend. We also ordered tiramisu and cannoli as desserts.  Food: Pizza was heavenly tasty. I love the combination of mozzarella and butternut squash puree! Pasta was good too. But maybe because of the excellent pizza, it did not give us too much surprise. Ordinarily delicious. About the desserts, tiramisu is ok but just like the ones I had tasted before. Cannoli, I have to say it was way too sweat and sticky. It is my first try and maybe it should be like this.Other:  The environment is Very comfy and standard yet not too classic. I hate those mahattan spots where you could barely relax yourself and eat. The decoration which I like a lot is somehow reminded me of narrow street in little Italian village.

So, we had pizza as well as the specials and I can say I enjoyed every bit of food we got.  The must haves in my book are:La Cirilo pizza - ​Butternut squash puree, cream of truffle,  mushrooms & fresh mozzarella, was beyond delishIce Cream topped w/ Nutella - don't know how they did it but they created a Nutella shell around the ice cream, but the shell wasn't solid.  It melded so well with the ice cream.The only thing I disliked about the place was the lighting, or lack there of.  I don't think I get it, they are trying to make it look like a dark, foreboding alley in Italy somewhere?  More fear inducing than welcoming.  Then there is this one beam of sunlight that causes a glare to everyone except those sitting under it.  However, none of this will take away from how good the food is.",0,0,0,Balsam K.,"Hoboken, NJ",25,56,8

4.0,7/28/2014,"Decided to go here for the first time after reading the reviews. Spent a day in the city, and then came here hungry. It was pretty busy when we got there, although the place looked empty to us. I later learned all the action is in the back, but we started with drinks at then bar. Anthony was wonderful and told us we had to try the special appetizer of the day; we were glad that we took his advice. We were seated on the 2nd level, which I preferred, because the view looking down was awesome, and it was more cozy/romantic sitting up top. They give you some italian bread to start (not toasted, and no butter) but we used it with the meal. They also have a bottle of olive oil on the table to use at will. We started with the special app of the day, fresh homemade mouth watering mozzarella with arugula, capers, balsamic, beets....wow! Then we had to try the special pizza because we saw pizza in everyone's table, it came with asparagus, homemade mozzarella, and prosciutto; It was phenomenal. The app and pizza came out lightning fast. We also shared a plate of cavatelli with mozzarella, and a side of meatballs. This took a while because they bake it, but overall good. I definitely liked the app and pizza best. Saved a little room for desert, tried the $7 cannoli, worth every penny. The filling tastes incredible, one of the best I've ever had, and the presentation looks amazing on the dish. Service was excellent too, two people are pretty much constantly tending to you.

5.0,6/23/2014,"Arthur Avenue puts NYC's Mulberry Street little Italy to shame.  Two will wait at the bar for about 30 minutes for a table, which is well worth it.  Have a glass of wine and build your appetite because the smells from your neighbors' eating at the bar will be too much to bear.  They have excellent red sauce options, calzones, pizzas, fish, antipasto, wine by the glass or bottle, and this is typical, but what makes it special is this:  Whatever you choose will be the most amazing thing you have ever tasted.  Mussels marinara, veal, chicken, linguini...the bread...the olive oil...hell, even the salt is the best tasting salt you ever...ok, maybe that's a bit much, but I ate well beyond my comfort level because I didn't want the taste experience to end.  If you choose a place based on service?  You won't be disappointed.  Attentive, but not obtrusive.  They make you feel like part of the family, but be warned, it's not easy to get to by public transportation.  Flag down a green cab at 182-183rd and unbutton your pants to make room for the amazing fest you will consume at Trattoria Zero Otto Nove.",2,2,2,Jenny M.,"Brooklyn, NY",39,224,90

Check.Attractive waitstaff that sparks just a touch of jealousy to strengthen your relationship? Check.Came here with the partner-in-crime after a lengthy walk to a not-too crowded restaurant despite the booming festival down the block. The establishment is beautiful, with skylights and a balcony. The menu is limited, and lacks a lot of the dishes typically found at Italian-American establishments. Instead, they offer creative, more traditional plates and an arsenal of pizzas. If you're looking for the red saucy, tortellini alfredo style places, this isn't it. Not to bash other Italian restaurants that I adore, but there's a time and place for everything and this, like many others in Belmont, is a step above.I ordered the pollo capriccioso (I have an obsession with the word ""capricious"", as it perfectly describes my personality) and recieved a hulking, breaded breast of chicken loaded with tomatoes, pesto, and lightly touched with mozzarella (from practically down the block). It was amazing. I also tried some of the pasta al forno, and oh man, that was a tasty dish. Imagine baked ziti but BETTER.As for desserts, I was a little disappointed that most of the items contained nuts (I'm allergic). I won't hold that against them though because it's common in Italian restaurants. The fragola romana was a sweet, tasty alternative, though.Brotip: If you are used to other joints, entrees do not come with a side of pasta.

1.0,6/19/2014,"We were looking for an Italian restaurant on Arthur Avenue. The Yelp reviews and 4.5 star rating is why we chose Zero Otto Nove over Dominicks or Robertos. Both of which I have been to previoulsy but suprising had lower ratings on Yelp than Zero Otto.  We went there on a Saturday night with a group of 6 for a pre-Father's day dinner.  The staff was friendly and accommodating and the menu interesting.  The bar area had a good feel with a friendly hostess and bartender.  The actual dining area of the restuarant was a entirely different story. While they had a tradition pizza oven in the center, the décor was over the top and tacky. It was just like being at the Pirates of the Caribbean at Disney World and someone thought it would be a good idea to add tables and serve food. Someone may have put alot of work in trying to create a nice atmosphere, but the results fell short and only resulted in a touristy, theme park feel.The food was a mixed bag, but overall disappointing.. Appetizers: Insalata Di Arugola was good, but then again it was only arugula with olive oil & shaved parmigiano, kind of hard to screw up.  Soup - a chicken broth with diced zucchini & egg drops was actually quite good. Cozze Alla Marinara , sautéed mussels in garlic & olive oil with tomato sauce.  The mussels were overly fishy, the marinara sauce over-cooked, bitter and burned. No hint of any flavor from the garlic and oil.  I have had mussels from a corner pizzeria that was better than this.  In short awful.Grilled swordfish was the fish special.  This was done to perfection and was quite good.The pasta dishes were mediocre.  Bland, overly dry and devoid of flavor.  The Ragu' Salernitano which the menu described as ""pork skin braciola, beef braciola & meatballs slowly cooked in tomato sauce"".  I have had pork and beef braciola at home and at other restaurants and was truly looking forward to this entrée.  Anything slowly simmered in tomato sauce should result in food that is full of flavor and will melt in your mouth.  This was not the case. The entree was served in a deep dish and was drowned in their signature awful, over-cooked tomato sauce.  It was extremely bitter with a flavor of being burned. The pork skin braciola did not appear to have been browned or simmered prior to tossing it into the tomato sauce. It was slimy & tough with the look, feel and texture of raw squid. After only one bite (which I had to force myself to swallow), I reburied under the sauce and moved on to the beef braciola.  The beef braciola was rubbery and dried out. I had difficulty cutting it and could barely chew it. The meatball itself (menu is plural, but my entrée only came with 1) was ok, but it was ruined by the sauce.  The entree also came with a piece of sausage which again tasted ok if aside from the sauce.  Overall the entree was terrible and close to being inedible.  Lastly, while dining we were treated with the added pleasure of participating in a number of birthday celebrations for other diners. Each celebration started with loud tacky music blaring throughout the resturant and the staff serving a small dessert with a candle.  They surrounded the lucky guest and sang (more like shouted) happy birthday and clapped.  It was quaint and amusing for the first 2, but after the 7th birthday celebration (no lie) during the 2 hours at the resturant, the novelty wore off.  If began to feel like we were eating at a Chucky Cheese or trapped in some crappy comedy skit where everyone had the same birthday.In summary, it could be that we just caught them on an off night, but I don't think that was the case. It's inexcusable to run an Italian restaurant and not know how to make and serve such a basic staple as a tomato sauce, or realize that the chef may have burned today's batch and should toss it out and start over. There are much better restaurants on or around Arthur Avenue where you can get true Italian food prepared by people who know how do it right.  Any of these other resturants puts this one to shame.

5.0,4/27/2014,"Yum! The food at Trattoria Zero Otto Nove is absolutely delicious. We popped in for lunch today and were treated to a really stellar Italian meal. We decided to go with 2 dishes to share, the Ragu Salernitano which is pork skin braciola, beef braciola, sausage, and meatballs served in an herbed tomato sauce and the Mafalde E Ceci which is fusille pasta with chick peas, pancetta, bread crumbs, and pecorino cheese.We loved both dishes, top to bottom. The meat in the ragu was outstanding. I particularly liked the classic fennel sausage and the generous amount of herbs and garlic in the middle of the beef braciola. Also, the sauce was so flavorful, having soaked up all of that pork and beef goodness, I could not resist sopping up all the leftovers with some of their excellent crusty bread.Lord, if I could eat high quality food like this every day, I'd be ecstatic. Why is it such a chore to find great restaurants?Anyway, let's not forget the Mrs. She really dug the pasta dish, commenting that it was very complex flavor wise, but at the same time very much like something your mom would make at home. I loved it too, the pasta was cooked perfectly and what's not to love about crispy pancetta?For dessert, we went with some hot apple cake which was spot on, and some espressos which were just delightful, the perfect way to close out a very special lunch.Trattoria Zero Otto Nove is a really amazing spot on Arthur Avenue, an area which is chock full of tired old war horses.

5.0,3/20/2014,"I'm a newbie to Arthur Avenue and the vicinity, but whenever I'm done visiting the NY Botanical Garden, there's no way I would leave and go home hungry. So after seeing the orchid show this past Sunday, at around 5:30pm, we got a table immediately and watched as the bar area turned into a waiting room within a half hour.We got a pizza margherita ($14) because you can't come to a place with a brick oven and not eat something that came out of it. It came quickly, and was divine, but you have to eat it fast, or else the bread will start sogging up. I'm not a fan of crust, but this crust was soft and chewy; I wanted to get some marinara just to dip it in. The waiter says they source their mozzarella from the nearby Casa Della Mozzarella (we also saw them hauling in a small tank of the day's supply), so of course it was amazing. We also shared the Linguini al Nero di Seppia e Calamari ($23); seppia is cuttlefish. We chose to  have it with mild black ink (instead of red sauce) and it was an impressive pasta with a wonderfully garlic-heavy base. It was one of the best squid ink pastas I've had.

2.0,3/10/2014,"I was pretty excited to try out Zero Otto Nove (Sunday afternoon) because of all of the great reviews on Yelp and due to the fact that I hadn't been in (the real) Little Italy in years. Meh. First off, the hostess service was lacking. I was in a party of four (my partner and both of our mothers); we went in, asked for a table and waited for about 15 minutes as two hostesses walked back and forth chatting with each other and wiping down menus. Finally, they had a table ready for us...on the second floor...when there were at least three empty tables on the main floor. This was no problem for me or my partner but both of our mothers have visible joint and feet issues (one wears a foot brace), so for them, climbing stairs is often difficult.Later on, when my mother was ordering a beef dish well done, the waiter insisted, rather condescendingly, that she order it medium because it would taste better and if he put in the order as ""well done"" the chefs would burn it because it was being cooked on a grill. Now, I can appreciate the art of cooking and the method behind cooking techniques in order to get the ""best"" flavor, however, flavor is a mighty subjective thing. If you think having your meat cooked medium tastes best, great.. If you prefer your meat well done (and not bloody), also great. Imposing your $0.02 on how someone should order their meal? That's the quickest way to turn a guest off and have them ordering something else that they perhaps desired less (and that's precisely what happened).The dishes ordered included the caprese salad (really lovely smoky flavor on the roasted red peppers), the beef ribs (well seasoned, moist), the ragu salernitano (very tasty, although the pork skin was not crispy at all and had the consistency of rubber), the breaded chicken cutlet dish with sauce (not much flavor in the chicken) and the galleto al mattone (SUPER-BLAND cornish hen with a side of potatoes and eggplant). The house pinot noir was pretty good.The bill at the end was nearly $200.00, which was surprising considering our dining experience so far.Zero Otto Nove's pizza and calzone menu looks very appetizing, so if I do muster up enough will to re-visit, I may just try it.

However, there are not many tables for seating. For a party of 5, we had to wait nearly 40 minutes for a table to open up.

5.0,1/24/2014,"I live north of NYC, & love Italian food. I've lamented Arthur Avenue's not being worth the trip, for years now. A few people suggested I give 089 a try. I finally did, but didn't have my hopes set high. I took my girlfriend there for lunch, yesterday. What a pleasant surprise :~)! The Trattoria has a nice atmosphere, ample supply of friendly & professional serving staff, & a very wide selection of Italian cuisine. Our late lunch was delicious. They served me the best Osso Buco (w/organic pork) that I've ever had. The attentive serving staff was a pleasure. I've been so disappointed w/Arthur Ave. restaurants the past several years, that I'd stopped going. Having found this Gem, that's going to change. Try them.

2.0,1/21/2014,"Of all the Arthur Avenue locations, I'd least recommend this tourist trap.  Zero Otto Nove is not apart of the ""old"" Arthur Avenue and is place you can come to experience this ""fake"" Italian tourist experience.  Let's get down to the business: the food.  The only item in this restaurant that warrants more than 2 stars is their pizza.  Their cavatelli is chewy and is an embarrassment to their restaurant considering they have borgatti's around the corner who should be their supplier.  The cavatelli was covered in polly-o mozzarella, which is another embarrassment consider they claim they use Casa's mozzarella ONE their pizzas, the one i ordered (noted on their menu). Their squid ink pasta is overwhelmed with the ink and looked more like soup and not in the least bit appetizing.  If you are a true Italian and from the neighborhood, you know this place is not the one to go to.  It is mostly filled with Fordham students and their parents who don't know any better.",3,0,0,Mike D.,"Whitestone, Queens, NY",58,152,459

When the check came. They charged us for the steak and not the other pasta dish we substituted to. I understood because they lost a steak but idk... it didn't feel right getting charged for a steak and then hating your pasta dish after. To be fair the pasta dish I ordered was delicious. It was a rigatoni with prosciutto and sun dried tomato. Because it's on Arthur Ave with a lot of competition... I would say go somewhere else.

I don't remember waiting for so long for the food to arrive. By the time it came everybody's hunger has gone to the stage of ""whatever-not-hungry-anymore-letsgetoutofhere"".So, the only thing that could have cheered us up would be spectacular food or super warm and welcoming service.

5.0,9/11/2013,"For more years than we can count Arthur Avenue in the Bronx has been known for their Italian food, from grocers and butchers, to bakeries and restaurants.  So when we found ourselves stuck in the Bronx Expressway traffic on our way out of NY, where else were we going to go but Arthur Avenue.We followed our noses and our GPS and found Trattoria Zero Otto Nove, one of three restaurants owned by Chef Roberto of Roberto's Restaurant.  Before we start this review we want you to realize that this is not Americanized Italian food served in this part of the world.  This is authentic Italian food made using traditional methods - Salerno, Italy to be exact. And done right it is quite delicious.When you enter the restaurant all you will see is a host stand to the left and a clean, small and well-appointed bar behind. Don't let this be off-putting.  The hostess will lead you down a very long hallway where you will emerge in Italy, or at least it feels that way.  Whoever designed this place did a wonderful job of transforming this space into a piazza with a skylight that provides natural light during the day, and whose nooks and crannies hold candles providing natural light at night.We were a little under-dressed, or felt that way in jeans and casual shirts, but no one said a word and we were comfortably seated without being pushed in a corner.The service here is impeccable, with as many as 4 people waiting the table to make sure food is delivered and placed well, dirty dishes are cleared swiftly and glasses never empty.  They do this without feeling like they are hovering or like you are being rushed.  Servers are practically invisible as they appear and disappear from your table, making your visit quite pleasant.We were not incredibly hungry, so did not try any of the pasta dishes.  Instead we ordered a pizza, an antipasto and a salad.  Our salad was a simple arugula salad which was simple and clean, dressed only with fresh lemon juice and olive oil and served with a few shavings of parmigiano reggiano. The arugula was crisp and fresh and we found the dish to be refreshing. Our antipasto was the Calamari alla Peperomata, made with yellow and red peppers, olives and capers.  This dish was quite delicious. The calamari was tender and the flavors came together perfectly.  A light hand was used with the olives and capers, creating layers of flavor without overwhelming the taste of the seafood. Our pizza of choice, which is cooked in a traditional wood fired oven, was he Patata Salsiccia & Provola - a sliced potato, sausage and smoked mozzarella pie.  This is a sauce-less pie, but you won't miss it.  The flavors of this pizza are quite nice. It is well-seasoned with rosemary which stands up well to the strong smoke flavor of the mozzarella.Though a number of the ingredients come from Italy, they are all purchased fresh daily from local stores all within blocks of the restaurant.  And these stores are getting thing like meats and cheeses from regional farms, so there is a good amount of support for the local economy while still keeping its roots in Italy. Local, fresh seafood, baked goods made right across the road and pasta made fresh right there at the restaurant are reasons enough to give this local gem high marks.",0,0,0,Shelley J.,"Venice, FL",95,68,20

This place may be a little uncomfortable for some who come to relax. The glasses for your water/drinks are all scratched up and look really dirty. I thought they were really dirty and sent back the first two. The waiter brought out two more that were not much better and upon closer investigation I saw they were actually scratches in the glasses. The plates also were all scratched up as well. That's not sanitary, as bacteria can live in those scratches. I persevered against my better judgement and started looking over the menu. Now the food...a BIG disappointment. Nothing was really standing out to me as I was not familiar with the dishes from whatever region of Italy this restaurant represents. I settled on the insalada di escarole and rigatoni Zucca. Big mistakes. The salad was ok at best and the rigatoni was very BLAND. I ate about 1/8 of the rigatoni. My dinner companion. order some kind of chicken cutlet. It looked like it had been deep fried and just topped with chopped onion and tomato. The mozzarella was not the fresh kind either. She ate about 1/4 of it and took and rest home. I asked her if it was alright and she insisted it was good but I saw her at one point scraping off some green sauce off it. I asked her about that and she said the sauce was too peppery. When our waiter came back to collect our plates he noticed I didn't eat my dish. He asked did I want to take it home and I said no and told him it had no favor. He just smiled and took the plate away and never offered me something else or to not charge me. We just hurried up and paid and got out of there. Will not be coming back. Too bad. I really wanted a go to restaurant in my neighborhood to entertain friends. I'll have to keep on looking for now.",0,0,0,Cee B.,"Bronx, NY",0,6,0

2.0,6/16/2013,"Ventured into this establishment on the recommendation of an old friend, an Italian buddy from High School days, and by all indications, a food enthusiast, who frequently travels to Italy and posts about his meals, but I have to say this was a  disappointing experience.Perfunctory service, bland or else overly salty entrees, excessively huge and unrefined portions, and triple digit prices.The Buratta appetizer was the highlight - delicate, flavorful and freshly made, served on a bed of arugula and surrounded by cherry tomatoes and caper-berries.  The Polenta and meatballs appetizer was also passable, but it was drenched in a red sauce and I am not that much of a red-sauce fan.The room was great - the best part of meal - you enter the restaurant and encounter a pizzeria, with a totally, obnoxiously, overly loud, flat screen TV displaying and hollering the latest international soccer game - REALLY offputting.  But if you wait it out, you are led down a narrow corridor to an open room with skylight and hand painted scenes of Italian village streets along the walls, and posters of Italian concerts and media events, coupled with rough wooden tables and a tile floor -- all of which really lends a feeling of being in Italy.Perhaps that is why my friend likes this place.    I get it about the room but to me, this place was kind of a rip-off and a tourist trap.  And I think I know good Italian when it happens.  I have enjoyed a plate of  Cacco e' Pepe, the most pedestrian of dishes, plus some House Red, and the local Bread Basket, in a small hole-in-the-wall Trattoria in Sienna, that far surpassed anything served to me today.If you read all the 5 star reviews, it's usually about the room, and if it is about the food, it's about the pizza, which in fairness, I did not try, or else the quantity not the quality, or else about how attentive the waiters were (which was not the case during my visit).  You have to read between the lines of all these reviews, to gauge the knowledgeability of the reviewers.  Please note: They do not take American Express, which I thought was a bit ornery, especially if you are robbing me already with gratuitous pricing for a mediocre meal.Bottom line - Diner beware - this place is just mediocre, and dresses it up with decor and ambience.  And maybe the pizza is OK.",2,0,0,Presley A.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,60,0

When we convened later that week we all talked about how divine the pizza was as leftovers.IF I have to find one fault, I think that it was obvious that we were type A lunchers.  We were definitely out for a special lunch but weren't able to stay ALL day.  The food came out quickly but they seemed to falter when it came time to bringing the check, collecting the credit card, and bringing the receipts back.  At that point of the outing the wait was incredibly painful.",1,0,1,K D.,"Little Compton, RI",15,208,393

My brother is a student at Fordham University and on my visits up there for various occasions we'll visit the Bronx and go out for dinner on the famous Arthur Avenue. Zero is our favorite spot and usual go-to as long as the wait isn't too long. It's wonderful and delicious from the first sip of wine to the last bite of your meal and I've never had a less than stellar experience at this location. Sometimes there is a bit of a wait on Friday and Saturday nights, but there is a cozy bar in the front with a full wine list so you can enjoy some delicious vino before your dinner begins. The ambiance is nice. Dark and candlelit and romantic, with high ceilings and brick walls. My two can't miss menu items:Quattro Formaggi Pizza - four cheese brick oven pizza that is literally the most heavenly thing I have ever tasted. Smoked and fresh mozzarella, fontina and gorgonzola over perfectly baked crust, served to you slice-by-slice by a handsome Italian waiter. I'm hungry just thinking about it. I'm not the type to usually order the same thing every time I go to a restaurant but I won't leave until I've had a slice of this bad boy.Parmigiana di Melanzane - Eggplant Parm appetizer, the most delicious I have ever ordered. I actually usually order this as my entree because we typically get a pizza or another appetizer to share for the table before. It is melty and the sauce is delicious and I'm always impressed with how pretty the presentation looks when it comes out. Always a good choice.Pricey, but worth every dollar.

We asked to be moved downstairs to a spot that was much more enjoyable, against the ""fresco"" wall. Bread basket was not exciting--cold squares of focaccia and traditional Italian bread. Menu was a bit more modern than we were expecting with no red sauce spaghetti in sight which I guess is good for the college area, but not the traditional old school Italian that I think we would have preferred, as we were coming in from Manhattan. We split the pasta al forno and broccoli rabe which were quite tasty--pasta had a nice mix of meats (meatball, sausage) and egg and cheese, and the veggies had enough garlic that I was glad we were sharing the two dishes. We were going to get a dessert but opted to go to an old bakery nearby instead which I think was the right choice. I think this place has such high reviews because it's probably a bit more upscale than the traditional places along Arthur ave that I have been to in the past, but I wouldn't say the food was amazing (or worth the trip from Manhattan, for sure).

There were a few bad tasting ones in the batch and the sauce it was cooked in had no flavor.For the entrees, we ordered the ragu salernitano and the cavatelli. The sauce for the cavatelli was bland. The pasta had a mushy bite to it. The salerniatano was a large meatball, pork skin braciola, beef braciola. The meatball was mushy and extremely white on the inside. The skin braciola was bland. The beef braciola wasn't bad but wasn't good enough to make up for the other deficiencies.Why this restaurant gets so many positive reviews, I don't know. Either the reviews are faked (which I do doubt) or people just haven't had better food (which is tragic).After years and years of hearing how great the food on Arthur Ave is, this experience has made me a bit gun-shy of returning and trying another place, especially if this is the top rated place on Yelp.",0,0,0,Jared J.,"Atlanta, GA",7,48,0
2.0,12/4/2012,"Things started out well enough, but deteriorated over the course of the meal.  The restaurant knows it's audience- there's an old Fiat 500 parked out front.  The decor is on the border between cute and over the top- almost achieving the feeling of being in an Italian restaurant at Disney World.  The talent is clearly local.  Our waiter, an earnest young dude, really cracked me up- when we asked for a wine recommendation, he said that he wouldn't give one, because if we didn't like the wine it would then be the restaurant's responsibility.   I was expecting to sign a release from liability form before our entrees were served (which, in retrospect, wouldn't have been a bad idea).  Despite our waiter's anxiety, we settled on a good bottle of Sicilian syrah, for $42.   We were served a couple of baskets of excellent bread.  The appetizers were OK to good.  The special of grilled sausages, artichoke hearts, arugula and cheese were good.  The Italian tuna salad was ok, though I would wonder about the fish's provenance.  An arugula and parmesan salad was OK.  The main courses continued the meal's decline.   My buddy's hangar steak was good.  I had the pasta special.  I don't order pasta often and was disappointed when it was overcooked.  the ragu was OK.  My wife and a friend ordered branzino.  It was served cold and was about 30% filleted, making for an annoying dining experience.  Dinner with friends is always fun, but there has to be a better place on Arthur Avenue than this.",0,0,0,Joel S.,"New York, NY",37,675,16

4.0,11/27/2012,"Out on a mission to experience the ""real"" Little Italy of NYC - Belmont in the Bronx - we decided on Trattoria 089 as our lunch venue. Note that I'm Italian (as in moved to NYC a couple of years ago, not a couple of generations ago) so I'm notoriously finicky about my Italian eats. 089 delivers, though we might have gotten lucky with the specials. The only thing we had that was on the normal menu was the eggplant parmigiana, and it was delicious, slightly oily and cheesy. Must have. Then we had 2 pasta entree specials to die for: oven-baked fresh-made pasta with a tomato/ mozz/ spicy soppressata sauce and radiatore pasta with ossobuco sauce. Both were incredibly decadent and mouth-watering, though definitely not for the faint of heart (imagine digesting a brick). Not content, we then decided to top this off with a short rib in a lightly acidic pepper sauce - fortunately not too heavy. As a final touch, pastiera, espresso and Amaro del Capo (a surprising find and one of the best amaros from Italy). Everything was really good. Service was outstanding, too: our server was incredibly attentive and helpful, splitting up all our dishes between us on the spot so we could partake in the gluttony on equal terms. The wine list is quite strong and all-Italian - unfortunately a lot of the better wines are priced incredibly high though. We managed to get a decent Chianti Classico for something like $65, but definitely the least impressive aspect of the meal. Final note on the space: it's very original, with a ground floor decorated to look like you're eating in a piazza and a terrace level overlooking it that feels like you're in somebody's home. I highly recommend the terrace, the piazza room feels too cavernous and the wall paintings to resemble the outdoor environment are a bit cheesy.

We walked in and saw that there was a lengthy wait ahead of us. It actually took nearly 40 minutes to get seated but we were able to sit at the bar and sip on some wine in the meanwhile. I have to comment--wow, I have not ever seen such a generous pour of wine at any restaurant I've been to. Easily two glasses worth. I was in a pretty good zone even after one ""glass"". You reach the inside after a long walk through a corridor and it is quite dark, spacious and cozy at the same time. The brick oven pizza is right inside the dining room and the irresistible smell of toasted bread permeates the room.We ordered another huge glass of wine, pizza with smoked mozzarella, sausage and potatoes, a special of the day which was essentially shrimp and scallops in a citrusy sauce, and rabbit stew. Each order was quite good. The pizza was ridiculously tasty with healthy slabs of smoked cheese and sausages. The potatoes provided an interesting mouthfeel alongside the chewier toppings. Huge winner. The shrimp/scallops weren't particularly memorable but very good. Can't really mess that up. I expected something like soup for the rabbit stew but it ended up being more like rabbit on a dish with a thick stew-like sauce around it. Great flavor profile. A little tougher than chicken but more intense. The sauce was a bit salty but provided a nice complement to the dish.I'd come back but the Bronx is so damn far.

5.0,8/18/2012,"Arthur Ave. has such an amazing selection of restaurants to choose from! I love Arthur Ave. because it's like Little Italy in Manhattan but without all of the tourists. It's a fun neighborhood to walk around. Trattoria Zero Otto Nove is one of the best restaurants on the strip. Thanks to our fellow yelpers for the great insight into finding this restaurant. My wife and I arrived at 5:45 on a Saturday night. The wait for a table for two was just under 20 minutes. Not bad considering we did not have reservations. They have a nice white marble bar area in front with limited seating. Checkout the frozen beer tap at the bar, it's very enticing. By the time we left the restaurant, about 7:15 is so, the line to get in this place was down the street. The hostess was very friendly and gave us a pretty accurate estimate on how long of a wait we were going to have.Once seated we both started with a glass of the house Pinot Grigio ($9). Very good, better than average house wine. We followed that with the Polpettine, Polenta & Caprino ($11.95) appetizer. This dish includes small meat balls, spicy tomato sauce, polenta & goat cheese. The combination is so amazing. The meatballs have a lot of flavor. Although the menu said the tomato sauce was spicy we didn't find that to be the case. I highly recommend you try this one if you end up at Trattoria. We shared on appetizer at the waiters' recommendation since we wanted to leave enough room to enjoy our main course.For our main courses we went for two of the daily specials. My wife had the Risotto with sausage and artichoke hearts ($23). The portion size was perfect, maybe even a little too much for my wife. The artichokes were delicious. I had the pork Ossa Bucco ($22) which came with a side of risotto and cannaloni beans. The meat fell off the bone, as it should. Perfectly prepared. The sauce is very well done. I've had this dish in some Manhattan restaurants and paid almost twice that price from the same flavor. Hats off to the chef for an amazing, and affordable, Ossa Bucco. I know this place is also well known for their pizza but we'll have to save that for another visit. We will be back! For dessert I had the Fragola ($7) with fresh strawberries and cream on a biscuit. The perfect ending for me! My wife went for the Biscotti ($6). Hard to go wrong with biscotti in an italian restaurant. I chased it down with a double espresso ($5). The only disappointment was seeing grinds at the bottom of my espresso cup.All in all it was a delicious meal at a fairly reasonable price. This place is very popular and for a good reason. If you happened to be in the area you should give this place a shoot.

Ordered octopus, it was tender but sadly the sauce was not even worth dipping the bread in. Then the now trendy style puffy crust but thin Neapolitan pizza came. (with hot soppersatta). This was the highlight of my two visits.Next the taramisu which was at a perfect temperature and creamy.                                    ANOTHER BRONX TALE...................................",2,0,0,Bobby G.,"Bronx, NY",10,180,0
4.0,4/30/2012,"Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa.  You're telling me there is good food beyond Manhattan and the trendy neighborhoods of Brooklyn?  No. Way.  I don't believe it.Okay, of course that's not true.  Arthur Avenue is a good example.  Elmhurst is another.  But for the moment, let's focus on Zero Otto.I didn't know what to expect.  I'm never particularly jazzed about Italian food (there are so so many bad Italian restaurants in my neighborhood.  I've been burned before), but this place is amazing.  I love the sky-lit stuccoed dining room, very reminiscent of an outdoor cafe in some Etruscan hill town.  And even if they sometimes gather 'round and break into song, I love the old school dry humor of the servers (one - humorously - recommended anger management classes when our 2-year-old dining companion fell into the table shattering a few glasses and spilled red wine).  And the food, the food!, is terrific.  Unexpectedly so.The La Ricardo pizza was excellent (prosciutto and butternut squash puree on a pizza?  Hello delicious) and the Mozzarella Caprese salad was super (it was accompanied by a cannellini bean salad that shone, it was so fresh and flavorful).  But the highlight was the pasta - a special that afternoon with asparagus and wild boar and some type of delirium-inducing white sauce.  I never get pasta - it conjures up bland heavy mush in my brain, but I maybe be a convert.  At least at Zero Otto.  Great wine list.  They have a bunch of bottles around $35 (and sure, some at $300, but save those for the sugar daddy dates).I can't wait to go back and dig into more of that menu.",2,0,1,merisa t.,"La Jolla, CA",77,209,2

Portobello al forno was delicious. Best calamari I have had in decades if not ever. Pizza special with thin crust, as it should be, and Bronzino were delightful. We were ready to stroll down the Avenue for a cannoli when we read the desert menu and saw cannoli filled when you order. We stayed and had cappuccino and OMG - that cannoli was undeniably the best we had ever had, including those in Florence and Venice.We will go back to try the pasta dishes and insalata, some of the veal and chicken and more.

4.0,4/23/2012,"After a beautiful afternoon at the Botantical Garden's Orchid Show, a fellow pal and I decided to swing by Little Italy for a quick bite. We were both craving some authentic thin crust pizza, and what better place but in the Belmont area in Bronx.  I went to high school in the area and eating some awesome pizza was one of the most vivid memories I have after getting out of class. I wanted to relive that and Zero Otto Nove definately held up to my memory! We passed but what seemed like a small quiant restaurant with a dim bar and we decided to go in. We requested a table and the hostess brought us back through a corridor and into a beautiful and immense space with a skylight. The setting reminded me of an Italian Theatre. There was exposed brick, high ceilings and painted murals and posters on the wall. Perfect date setting. The tables were well spaced out, and in the middle of the exposed area is a beautiful brick oven. Very traditionally Italian ala Sicily. The pizza was amazing! Very fresh ingredients, thin crust, and the flavors of each ingredient were prominent. Our waiter was also very nice, quick with service, and appeasing. It was a shame we only had time for pizza.

3.0,4/15/2012,"I was here for dinner today after a nice day visiting the Bronx Botanical Garden. Our first wish was to go to Roberto's, but they are closed on Sundays. After deliberating where to eat for a few minutes, we figured we would give Zero Otto Nove a shot since it is owned by the same owner as Roberto's.The decor was pretty cool, almost Las Vegas like. The wait was about 20 minutes, which was fine.My first course consisted of baby clams in a broth. They were ok but nothing worth discussing. My main dish was the pasta al forno, and I was definitely disappointed. The pasta and meatballs were both a bit dry and a bit forgettable. For dessert I had profiteroles and they were nothing special as well.The problem for me was coming in with such high expectations, and not being blown out of the water at all. There was no oomph, no pizzazz, no special feeling when eating the food. It was just sort of there, and sort of bland.What a shame.I think the next time I visit the Bronx, I will try to come on a Friday or Saturday so I can check out Roberto's.

2.0,4/14/2012,"Wow...4.5 stars... I don't get it.  Enzo, Mario, ...those places I get, but this place, I don't . Standard disclaimer: I eat out frequently,and I know good food, whether it's perciatelli with sausage and radicchio with shaved parmigiano reggiano...or a hot dog with kraut and mustard. (be it simple or complex, ""fa lo stesso""...when food is good, it's undeniable)But when I come to Arthur Ave, I want the Arthur Ave experience. I want to sit at what may as well be a communal table. I want to drink my wine from a jelly jar. I want olives, proscuitto and salami, nice bread (it shouldn't be hard to find, there are more bakeries on Arthur Ave than bars in Hoboken...walk across the street and get some real bread). Regardless, pull all of  this ""you didn't satisfy the expectation that I had of my mommy's cooking"" nonsense out of the equation, and let's evaluate objectively:Credit where credit is due. The fourth dish, Rigatoni e Zucca (Rigatoni with butternut squash and peas) was delicious (pasta was obviously fresh, and prepared really well). The beef short ribs were also well executed. Fork tender, and tasty. The water and wine glasses were always attended to. The front end staff were friendly. We arrived at 5:12, and were seated upstairs under a constantly blowing air conditioning vent at 6:20. If you do choose to dine here, do not sit upstairs near the wall. Re the wait, I've certainly waited longer than an hour for a table, but the inability of the front end staff to estimate the wait is inconceivable to me. You do this every day. Figure it out. If they can do it at the Cheesecake Factory, you too, can handle it.To continue:For all the hype about the pizza, and especially the crust, ours was as limp as the day is long. The braciola antipasta was tough. Where I come from, braciola is simmered low and slow in a pot for hours until tender. Besides being tough, it was served with porcini mushrooms and hot peppers in a cream sauce...what the what?Our entrees took an hour to arrive, and when they did, mine was the wrong dish, and two out of the four were cold. So, back to the kitchen they went for a ""warming"". Fyi, I don't want my food warmed. I want it cooked and served correctly. ""Warmed"" doesn't sound good, and the thought is irritating. Cook my food, get it right, or do it again.My dish, Mafalde Porcini e Provola, was an overwhelmingly smokey mess of undescernable ingredients. Maybe it was just a poor choice on my part, but the flavor balance was way off.Questioned the server about the hour wait for the entrees. Response was ""the kitchen is really busy tonight"". And?...I was really busy when I waited an hour for the table. What's your point?.  The server showed up with a complimentary pizza with Nutello and espresso for the table. I do genuinely appreciate the gesture. It was not anticpated, nor expected, so kudos to Marco, the 20 year old who was supposedly the manager. The fact that I don't really consider pizza as dessert, or even prefer the taste of Nutello, for that matter, is irrelevant. Would I have rather skipped the Nutello thing and enjoyed a well-prepared meal?...yes. Regardless, things go wrong, and Marco did his best to improve on a poor customer experience, and as mama always said, ""It's the thought that counts"". Whatever...the summary here is I can get mediocre trattoria food anywhere. When I come to Arthur Ave., I want simple, well prepared, rustic dishes passed down from Nonna...and Nonna's Nonna. That's not what's happening here. All things considered, my world did not end today at T089. I will eat again tomorrow...just not here. --peace.",1,0,0,Joe F.,"Cranford, NJ",14,72,1

This restaurant doesn't do that and stands on the food, service and ambiance without asking for 5 stars as it should be.This is the restaurant I choose for my official birthday dinner.

Also last time I was  disappointed in the pizza. Those are all of the reasons I didn't give it 5 stars before. I was sure not to order the pizza this time. In a city known for it's pizza in my opinion there are better options. We ordered the Cauliflower appetizer and goat cheese salad. I had the same dessert  last time  because I really loved it last time! We had 2 specials for dinner one was a lamb and pasta dish with Pecorino cheese the other had Chanterelle mushrooms  and Fava beans.

We mentioned this was my birthday dinner because I wanted to order the lamb dish and my husband  didn't think it would be that good he said well you're the boss it's your birthday! So I did order it and my husband told the waiter he was wrong about the lamb and he is almost never wrong about food so that was big! The waiter took it upon himself to light a candle and put it in my dessert and had the whole restaurant sing happy birthday to me! They got me, it's hard to catch me off guard and he managed to pull that off!  And the ambiance is unmatched in the area! Now that I gave you that background , I am upgrading it to 5 stars.

Mafalde Porini e Prevola- fresh pasta that is creamy with porcini mushrooms cherry tomatoes and smoked mozzarella......this dish is special I have spent many nights trying to mimic that sauce.Our final course was the most perfectly braised beef short rib  in sauce that if not for the 28.95 price point I would have ordered one to go.It is on the pricier side for casual but the wine and cocktails are good, the ambiance is excellent, the food is first rate...

1.0,12/5/2011,"Went there last night after having a very nice time about a month ago. We had a party of 8. When I called about getting a reservation or at least ""putting our name in"" as we were a few minutes away I was told ""that was impossible"" by an incredibly rude SOB on the phone. But we went anyway. Got there and put our name in...they said they werent sure how long it would be (they had just seated a large party downstairs where we needed to be as we had a handicapped member in our party). But we waited and had a drink. After 45 minutes (watching them seat other albeit smaller parties) inquired again and asked for a guestimate on time...""another 10 minutes? longer?"" the woman at the door ""couldn't say"". But we all felt like it couldn't possibly too long right? so we decided to have another drink and wait. She finally came up and offered us two separate tables of 4. Um...excuse me? We were together as an extended family. Finally after an hour and a half I asked for a specific time...how much longer??? She again ""couldn't say"" but said if we wanted a table upstairs we could be seated. What? How is that a solution? We have someone who can not get up the stairs! I said please go walk through the restuarant and gauge, based on where everyone was in their meal, how much longer...that I wanted a specific time.  She said she couldn't be sure but left supposedly to check.... I called Rigoletto's down the street. Asked them how long to seat 8 people. They said if we got there right away we would be seated immediately. I went back in....got our party....the woman from the front door never showed back up...the bartenders felt awful....we spoke to them for a minute or two...I was waiting for the hostess to come back up....she never did. What? she went and hid? Come on! We left and had a great meal at Rigoletto's. Now I fully understand restaurants have difficulty guaging how long a party may stay (I bartended for years) but the total lack of care on the part of the hostess was apalling.

5.0,11/28/2011,"I'd been waiting to try this place out for literally over a year the first time I went.  I go to Arthur Ave every once in awhile, but I kept putting off coming here.  Its owned by Roberto Paciullo, the man behind Roberto's and arguably the best Italian restauranteur in New York.  He's opening another 089 location in Manhattan eventually, but I believe in always trying the original.  Finally I got to try 089, and it definitely lived up to the billing!First thing you notice here is the amount of work they did to make this place look like its smack dab in the middle of some Campanian village.  From the texture on the walls, to the skylight, to the oven, if this place doesn't transport you to Italy nothing will.  The service is very professional, and as hard as I am on servers I found absolutely no fault with them.  Thats a festivus miracle in itself.  And smack dab in the middle of the restaurant was the most important thing: Roberto Paciullo.  He wasn't barking out orders or anything, just sitting and having lunch with a friend.  His presence alone was enough to ensure that everyone was on their game.  Thats great leadership, and exactly what it takes to make a great restaurant one of the best in the city.Since the first time was only lunch, I just got pizza although the rest of the menu made me think twice.  The bread they brought out as well was a great variety, and looked to be from Madonia but could've been from a few different places as there were several kinds.  The pizza I got was the Riccardo, which had buttersquash puree along with smoked mozzarella, spicy pancetta, and basil.  The crust could've used more char, but was pillowy soft and had a nicely risen lip all around.  I was actually expecting something more crisp and with less of a lip as this is Salerno-style pizza, but this worked just fined.  While the crust was great, it was outshined by everything else.  Simply put, this combo WORKED.  The pancetta was the fatty kind they serve in Italy, broken into bits and with a subtle little bit of heat as promised.  This contrasted with the smoked mozzarella from Casa della Mozzarella around the block, which was bursting with milky smokiness.  Combined with the sweetness of the squash, every bite was bursting with flavor.  The only change I would make would be to add a bit more basil, as it acted as a wonderful balancing agent that brought all the different flavors together.  All in all, one of the best pizzas I've had, and thats saying something at this point.  The next time I came back for the normal menu with a group of 6.  For starters we had the zuppa di vongole and the calamari alla peperonata.  Both were pefectly executed, with the sweet, tiny clams being the standout for me; the calamari was also perfectly cooked, with the flavor of the peppers standing out in particular.  We decided to get a bottle of wine, and our server was extremely helpful in selecting one that worked with all of our dishes (a reasonably priced Super Tuscan).  For my main, I got the Linguini al Nero di Seppia e Calamari, which is their homemade linguini in a black squid ink sauce with calamari and cuttlefish thrown in the mix.  It was awesome.  The flavor of the tomatoes wasn't lost and the squid ink wasn't overpowering--two common issues with this dish.  The homemade linguini was a perfect al dente as well.  Once again, the calamari here was perfectly cooked, and the cuttlefish--which feels halfway between octopi and calamari--was too.  This was food exactly as it is in the south of Italy.  Fresh, simple and straight forward.   Also, when we were leaving one of my friends left something behind and the waiter ran out after us to make sure the schmuck didn't forget it.  From the appetizers to the service to the espresso we had at the end, this place was remarkably consistent in how great it was.At this point, if you're interested in Italian food, you've probably heard of Arthur Ave already.  If you haven't gone already, you're probably looking for an excuse.  The restaurants around here can be a mixed bag, but you'd be hard pressed to go wrong with this place.  One weekend, go to the Bronx Zoo for a few hours, use the Southern Blvd exit, walk north a bit and turn onto 187th, and walk over to the neighborhood.  Retail Market, bread bakery, meat market, cheese shop, pasta shop, eat some clams on the side walk at a seafood market, and this place.  If that isn't a good day, then what the hell is?",17,8,11,Justin L.,"New York, NY",900,1005,34
4.0,11/17/2011,"Picked up a pie here called La San Matteo (fresh mozzarella, sausage & broccoli). The broccoli was perfectly cooked (soft but had some texture), and made me feel less guilty about eating pizza. The mozzarella was pretty tasty and you can tell it's of good quality. I wasn't a big fan of the sausage but I understand the need for meat on this certain pizza. I'm really not a big pizza eater but I did enjoy my lunch.

4.0,11/7/2011,"Great Italian! Their table bread is delicious, esp the herby roasted tomato-topped one. I think it was focaccia, but I may be blaspheming some poor Italian baker's pride and joy. Nevertheless, it was good.We had their appetizer special, some sort of dry-grilled sausage served with broccoli rabe and mushrooms--super delicious!  The saltiness of the sausage was well-balanced with the broccoli.Dinner portions are pretty good sized--I tried the linguine with seafood and squid ink sauce, and loved it. Pasta was chewy, sauce wasn't overpowering, and it was too dark in the restaurant to watch my mouth turn black from the ink. My friends enjoyed their rabbit stew, risotto with seafood, and eggplant parm. Everyone was super full afterwards, but still made room for some dessert! Which was delicious. Not sure if I'd spend $8 for a cannoli when I can walk outside to a legit pastry shop and get one for $2.50, though.Service was great, they took time to explain everything to us and were very accomodating to our requests. Lots of families here on a Saturday night, so plan date night out well! They don't take reservations either.Minus one star for the darkness of the restaurant.

My hubby ordered La Vincenzo Pizza ($13.95) which came with tomatoes, gorgonzola cheese, porcini, and spinach. The oven brick pizza was good and the restaurant used high quality cheese. Loved all of the flavors.I orrdered linguine al nero with spicy black squid ink and lot  of calamari ($18.95). There were 3-4 calamari for every bite of linguine. Calamari was not overcooked either. Beware. Your teeth and lips will turn black. The restaurant had a cute dining area where there was a sunroom, and walls were painted like being in Italy.

Food is delicious.  I recommend one of thier pizzas to start, chicken capricosa for an entree, and then their unique nutella pizza for dessert.  You will leave this place very satisifed.  Just to note it get veryyy crowded so from Thursday night on make sure you have a reseravtion or get there very early!",1,1,1,Steven E.,"Manhattan, NY",28,81,0

The bartender was great - knowledgeable and attentive - without being overbearing.  We started of with drinks - a glass of wine (a nice heavy pour, BTW) and a Plymouth gin & tonic.  The fact they have Plymouth is unbelievable and wonderful at the same time.We started off with an appetizer of broccoli rabe, which was amazing.  My wife got a trio of meat in a dish with a rich tomato sauce.  The 3 meats were meatballs, beef braciole, and pork skin braciole.  She made short work of that dish, she absolutely loved it.  I had one of their amazing Neapolitan pizzas.  I ordered the margarita and added sausage.  It was absolutely fantastic!! The sauce and cheese were delicious, but the crust...ohhhh the crust!  Chewy and crusty all at the same time.  People like to drone on and on about how good (average at best, IMO) NYC pizza is, etc.  The pizza at 0-8-9 is way ahead of almost any other pizza in NYC.  No questions asked.Our dining experience was incredible from start to finish.  I can't wait to go back.",12,3,10,Dan C.,"New York, NY",989,942,532

Finding parking was surprisingly not difficult and I walked the length of Arthur Ave and really enjoyed the lovely Italian neighborhood. I walked into one gift shop and asked for a restaurant recommendation, and was told to go to either Roberto's or Zero Otto Nove. Since the latter was right across, I decided to go in there.4:30pm was a bit early for dinner, so when i walked in I decided to eat at the bar. The brick oven/kitchen was visible from my seat and I enjoyed the expertise with which the chef;s were cooking each dish. The bar area is dark, with candle lights decor on one wall. The menu was in Italian with english sub titles. I do not claim much familiarity with Italian menus so seeked the help of the bartender and decided to order the ""PORTOBELLO AL FORNO - Grilled portobello mushroom, diced tomato, basil and goat cheese baked in brick oven"".They started of with bread and olive oil, and the bread itself was extremely good. The Mushroom arrived fairly quickly and one bite into it, I could tell these guys know their stuff. It definitely had a brick oven smoked flavor and was delicious. I took my time fluctuating between the bread and the mushroom and enjoyed the laid-back yet attractive ambiance of the restaurant. After I was done with my food, I took a walk down the hallway behind me to explore the rest of the restaurant. After going through a bricked narrow tunnel, i was surprised to see a dinning area at the back of the restaurant, with exquisite walls and a charming decor.

4.0,12/19/2010,"I'm writing this review slightly drunk. Sorry. But I've been on a mission to visit all these supposed best pizzerias in New York for awhile now, so my word counts, man, even if I'm drunk. Slightly drunk. On my way to more than slightly. OK.So, you have to go to The Bronx to visit this place. And boy, if you've lived in New York for awhile, people are eventually going to start asking you if you've been up to Arthur Ave., the ""real"" Little Italy. I grew up among Italians, so I wasn't impressed, but I never liked those dense cookies that taste like cardboard growing up, so whether it's downtown Manhattan, Belmont, or Lodi, NJ, I don't think Italian-American ""culture"" is anything to drive out to shitty neighborhoods for. But pizza is another story.I just heard on NPR that ""pork butt"" means the shoulder. Isn't that weird? Wait, did I hear that right? Or am I drunk?Anyway, is it worth it to visit 089 up in The Broncks? I don't know... it's fucking crowded and the service is shitty and the pizza is good but not better than a dozen places in Manhattan. I guess if you live there it's better than fried chicken and overripe mangoes.Warning, this place is touristy, so don't be a fool and order bottles of water. Free bread, though. Super yum. Ten extra stars for free bread with olive oil to dip it into. Nice space. High ceilings. Much light. Balcony seating area. Too bad it's in the Bronx.I ordered the soprasetta with tomato sauce, fresh mozz, etc. I spelled the name of the spicy ham wrong I think, but it was spicy ham. My dining partners ordered the one with potatoes. I like pizza with sauce. The sauce was bland but not abnormally so. The ham was good. The crust was VERY GOOD, but brick oven style, which means, I guess, a little soggy, but not too soggy, like that fucking waste of time Grimaldi's place in Brooklyn. So this is definitely a decent place to get Neapolitan style fancy overpriced pizza, and it works that formula better than most places. So four stars. Generous for me, really. But I reward good crust. And the crust at 089 is almost ideal: chewy without being tough and crispy without being hard, crunchy, or burnt (like Otto and Co.).CRUST.That's how I feel about crust. I'm going to get more drunk now. Thanks.",0,6,0,Steven S.,"New York, NY",76,352,133

I think all servers just might be purebred Italians who cannot stand the thought of having my glass of water less than 51% full.  And all the other reviews talking about how you go through this ""alleyway"" and into an atrium of Italy is an experience you won't find anywhere else in el Bronx.",0,0,0,Tan N.,"Sunnyvale, CA",29,162,11
1.0,12/4/2010,"This used to be our go-to place for friends visiting from Manhattan.  With great decor and outstanding pizza, we could overlook the bad accoustics that make conversation difficult and the terrible waiters who try every trick in the book to upsell you.  Granted, the cheesy pushes for bottled water tended to make us uncomfortable, but when the pizza is this creative, who cares?That ended a few months ago.  My wife and I took some of our closest friends to Zero Otto Nove for pizzas, appetizers and conversation.  My wife picked out a bottle of mid-priced wine ($36), and we ordered the food.  A few minutes later, the waiter came back, pointed at a wine and asked my wife if that was what she had ordered.At the time, my 3-year old daughter was acting up, so my wife glanced at the menu, noted the vineyard, and the fact that the wine name started with a B and nodded her head.The meal was great, although the wine was watery and unable to stand up to the spicy food.  Still, at $36, we weren't about to complain.  When the $407 check came, we thought they were joking.  On closer investigation, we discovered that they had given us their most expensive bottle of wine, a Bruno Giacosa Falletto Barolo 2001, priced at $315. We had ordered a Bruno Giacosa Barbera d'Alba.We called over the Maitre d and waiter, both of whom were perched nearby (waiting for this to happen, perhaps?).  We talked over the problem with them.  We asked them to call the boss, but they claimed that that was impossible.  We asked them to let us pay the wholesale price, but that was impossible.  We asked them to let us go next door to the wine store that they owned, so we could buy a bottle of the wine and replace the one we had drank.  That, apparently, was impossible, too.We pointed out that we were regulars, and probably spent $100+ per month at the restaurant.  We noted that, if they didn't give us a break, we wouldn't be back.  They didn't, and we haven't.",28,5,3,Bruce W.,"ASTORIA, NY",152,32,0

3.0,10/25/2010,"Its hard to give this place 4 stars when they serve you such a disappointing dish. I was here three days ago, early on a Saturday night. I had read so many reviews here on Yelp and other local NYC publications.  I chose 089 because it didn't seem to be another red sauce tourist Italian place.  It is not.  It did, however, play me like a fool when they served me their risotto special.  I wasn't going to order risotto, I was more inclined to order the pasta as they claim it is fresh and made in the neighborhood.  But when  the waiter described the risotto with cannellini beans, asiago and drizzled with truffle oil, I had to succumb.  What came out however, was not ""risotto"". At least not what any self-respecting cook would describe risotto, and that is a dish made with ARBORIO rice.  Arborio lends a creaminess, a texture to the dish that complements the flavors within.  What I got was long-grained rice. Plain and simple.  ANd not very good long-grained rice.  The dish wasn't even out of the waiter's hand when I told him ""this is not risotto"". ""oh yes, senora, this is the risotto special,"" he replied.  ""no, "" I repeated, ""risotto is made with Arborio rice, a short grain rice. You cannot stretch out arborio rice to make it look like this rice. This is not arborio""   He told me that this was all the rice they had. I shook my head.  To his credit (certainly not Roberto's, the owner) he came back from the kitchen a few minutes later, repeated that it was the only rice they had, and asked if I would like something else. He did not try to tell me that it was arborio rice.  I declined his offer as most of the people at the table were well into their dinners and I didn't want to keep them waiting.  Its too bad. The dish was tasty, but it certainly wasn't eye rolling; it was lacking the proper texture.  The other dishes at the table got thumbs up. The pasta was indeed fresh; the arugula salads simple but not skimpy. My grilled portobello was fine- nothing I couldn't make at home, but decent.  My husband's pork was ""great"".  Echoing other's reviews, the staff was terrific.  The atmosphere also quite nice.  Just couldn't believe that an Italian owner/chef would allow a ""risotto"" to be served in such a way.

When our table was ready, the hostess brought us back into an impressive, somewhat dimly lit, two story restaurant. We sat upstairs and overlooked the people eating below us. I give the ambience 4-5 stars. The food was fantastic. We had the Halibut special, seafood special and three of us ordered different pizzas. As is the case with our family dinners, everyone sampled each other's food. The Halibut melted in my mouth. The seafood special was very good, and the Daviola pizza was definitely something I'd order again.The wait staff were all very friendly--from the hostess to the bartender to our waiter and busboy.

5.0,7/13/2010,"Arthur Avenue - a small Italian-American enclave tucked in among the Bronx's Latino and African-American neighborhoods - is perhaps the most disorienting place in New York City. When you emerge from the train station at Fordham Road, the sidewalks buzz with Spanish and heavily accented English, while stores' loudspeakers shout advertisements at passers by; guys wearing sandwich boards yell about unlimited texting and free phones, and sweaty dudes halfheartedly offer flyers in the July heat.  The route from the train to Arthur Avenue is lined with fast food places, hot dog and pastelito vendors, and old Puerto Rican ladies selling Italian ice beneath big umbrellas.  Then, when you make a right turn at the White Castle on Fordham Road, your field of vision fills with white people holding heros and slices of pizza.  This, my friend, is Arthur Avenue.Trattoria Zero Otto Nove sits on this peculiar, delicious street.  An old blue Fiat, parked on the sidewalk, marks the entrance to Roberto Paciullo's excellent restaurant.  Although it's more upscale than other Arthur Avenue pizza staples like Full Moon and Ivana's, it's not prohibitively expensive.  A pizza - which is almost enough for a hungry 21-year-old guy - runs you fifteen bucks, tops (plus tip).  Booze prices suck, but, so long as you're not ashamed to order the cheapest wine on the menu, you can get a bottle for around $25.  My thoughts on the meal I ate - one part of which blew my mind - are as follows:The focaccia, which our waiter delivered immediately after we sat down, was extraordinarily moist, and the small roasted tomatoes which dotted its surface took on a hearty, pleasurable tang from their time in the oven.  The other preprandial bread, a crusty half-loaf with excellent texture, was good dipped in olive oil, but not so delicious as to spoil my appetite.  The salad - which had mixed greens, grilled pear slices, goat cheese, olive oil, salt, and pepper - underwhelmed me, but this is generally what I expect from salad.  Perhaps I am provincial, but the plate could have used more flavor.  The lettuce was supple, and the olive oil was good, but there simply wasn't enough goat cheese and pear to keep the dish interesting; I was forced to become a flavor actuary-quartermaster, making minute calculations of flavor cost-benefit analysis, rationing out bits of cheese and tiny, sweet slices of pear.  The result - a tiny pear-cheese combination enfolded in a massive, oil-coated leaf - was certainly rich, but boring.  Zero Otto Nove's pizza more than made up for its middling salad.  The well-sized pies came to the table almost directly from the oven and stunned me with their beauty.  The big, wobbly circles of mozzarella and the deep red sauce had a seductive sheen that, like the 20 minute wait we endured at 7pm on a Thursday night, augured well for the main course.  The cook had cut my pizza into quarters and I carefully inspected to ensure that there was basil, sopressata, and a good deal of mozzarella and sauce on each slice.  The pie - I ordered the Diavola - was spectacular.  The spicy, salty sopressata ham intermingled with the rich tomato sauce, basil, and fresh mozzarella in the most delicious premium pizza I've ever eaten [1].  I'm not usually a ""the ingredients are everything"" guy, but Zero Otto Nove's pizza clearly benefits from high quality component parts.  The sauce gets its potency from San Marzano tomatoes, the tender mozzarella is made daily at a store next door (""La Casa Della Mozzarella""), and the basil - well, I don't know where it comes from, but it has marvelous intensity and strong notes of tropical fruit.  And the crust - the crust!  The pie's outermost ridge is tender, chewy, and perfectly salted.  Do yourself a favor and visit Zero Otto Nove with someone that ""doesn't like crust"" - this ensures that you get a double serving.  Consider dipping any surplus crust in the olive oil that waiters never remove from the table.So, in conclusion, get yourself to Arthur Avenue and eat this.[1] I am totally comfortable elevating Zero Otto Nove even above the legendary Di Fara's, which had been my favorite gourmet pizza for almost a year.",0,0,0,Sam H.,"Denver, CO",2,1,0

5.0,4/28/2010,"With the notoriety rendered upon the majestic proprietorship over Pizza in both Manhattan & Brooklyn, one would question why such offerings are not more highly acclaimed on a little road called Arthur Avenue in the Bronx? From the ramblings of my fellow compatriots, a restaurant located on Arthur Avenue that simply goes by the name Restaurant 0-8-9 is known to serve one of the most humbling and delicious renditions of Neapolitan Pizza in all of the five boroughs.  For those of us whom have been privy to this find, the restaurant is better known as Trattoria Zero Otto Nove (or Restaurant 089 in Italian).The Setting:  To describe the interior confines of Trattoria Zero Otto Nove would be doing it an injustice; the decor is best observed first hand.  At first entry, patrons are in the main bar area of the establishment.  The modest decorations ranging from solid red tiled floors and walls gives this segment of the establishment a relaxed feel.  Immediately after being escorted through the bar is the true marvel of the edifice.  The 20 foot tunneled walk into the main dining room possesses a secretive and tranquil feel.  From the lightly stained sand color rugged brick walls to jagged wooden oak stained doors housing the lavatories, the interior confines immediate produces a feeling of minimalism & grace.  Upon immediate entry to the main dining room is where the true spectacle of Trattoria Zero Otto Nove's architectural genius comes to light.  From initial observation, patrons will find that the decorative art painted on the walls depict scenes of Italian villas and daily neighborhood activities.  The natural light from the clear glass roof opening allows for a candid yet serene feel to the main dining area.  For those dining at Trattoria Zero Otto Nove, the decor of the establishment renders feelings of relaxation and subtlety; thus mirroring the tranquil feel to those experienced in mainland Italy.Despite the appreciation to the attention and detailed rendered to the design of the establishment, Rachel & I are here for the Pizza...Pizza 1: ""Margherita"" - Simplistic in its design is the classic Margherita Pizza.  Containing San Marzano Tomatoes, Fresh Buffalo Mozzarella, and Fresh Basil, the presentation of the dish mirrors all other renditions previously consumed.  What should be noted about Trattioria's rendition of this Naples classic are the aromatics stemming from this concoction.  From first scent, patrons will discover a hearty and robust flavor stemming from the San Marzano tomatoes.  A secondary note of buttery sweetness is detected from the Buffalo Mozzarella.  At first bite, patrons will be privy to an explicit flavor profile that's comparable to many, but far exceeds anything ever consumed.  The first notable detection is the slightly charred foundation of the pizza.  The protrusion of subtle sweetness yet savory bite of the San Marzano Tomato Sauce are greatly subdued, yet amplified, but the rich and delicate flavor of the Buffalo Mozzarella.  Patrons will find that the exertion of both sweetness and bold savory properties to work in conjunction with both the San Marzano Tomato Sauce & Buffalo Mozzarella.  Although the Fresh Basil was slight in the application, the subtle hints of vulgarity derived from the refreshing properties allowed for the pungent flavors of the Margherita to truly amplify.Pizza 2: ""Caprese"" - Contrary to the exquisite and exceedingly complex flavors of the Margherita, the Caprese embodies a subtle yet well balanced flavor profile.  The aromatic base of the application is best described as refreshing and earthy, with little notes of spice and boldness detected from the shaved Parmigiano Reggiano.  At first bite, patrons will discover that the heartiness embodied within the Margherita isn't present with this rendition, but rather a subtle, delicate, and earthy presence.  With a strong bitterness derived from the Arugula, that's complemented by the sweetness of the perfectly ripe Cherry Tomatoes, the pizza itself is transformed to a rendition that embodies a cleansing property when consumed.  The slight application of the Buffalo Mozzarella provided the much welcomed buttery sweetness that amplified the earthy flavors of both the Arugula and Cherry Tomatoes.  Ultimately, the Caprese pizza embodies the true earthiness and complex flavors of the ingredients used in the application.  Although lacking the true heartiness of a San Marzano rich application, the Capreses embodies simplicity, which helps to amplify the natural sweetness and delicacy of the ingredients used in the application.What Pizzaiolo, Robert Paciullo, embodies with his creative rendition is that of exquisite perfection, that's complemented by the exceedingly impressive flavor base.  For those venturing to Arthur Avenue, Trattoria Zero Otto Nove is a must visit.  Such perfection must be sought.",23,15,21,C M.,"New York, NY",266,454,791
4.0,4/25/2010,"Came here for dinner on a Friday evening.  Its related to Roberto's in the area.  A modern front entrance with a bar area doesn't prepare for the dining area, reached via a stone-lined passage that opens into an almost cavernous space, with a deep skylight.  The effect of space and paint seemed to evoke an Italian town corridor. It made for a very open, comfortable dining space with lots of natural lighting at the time we went.  Wait staff were plentiful, friendly, and helpful.  We shared a bottle of red, perfect recommendation.  Started with the special grilled octopus with cannellini beans and arugula.  One of the best octopus I ever had, super fresh, tender enough to cut with a fork, nicely charred.  Not strongly flavored on it's own but when combined with the tender beans and spicy arugula, it's wonderful.  Very generous portion too.After that, shared the La Riccardo brick oven pizza.  Very thin and crispy crust, slightly charred and uneven looking, topped with a butternut squash purée, spicy pancetta, smoked mozzarella, and basil.  Never had this combination but it was delicious, light, the toppings never overwhelming the pizza but working together nicely.Finished with the special lamb and artichoke bucatini.  The lamb added nothing to the dish, IMO, but the pasta was well-prepared and flavored, the marinated artichokes a great complement.  Lamb was chewy and wholly unremarkable.I thoroughly enjoyed this dining experience and will most definitely recommend and return.",0,0,0,Valery C.,"Forest Hills, NY",56,837,9616
5.0,4/17/2010,"""But I don't want to go to the Bronx today!"" I cried plaintively at the rest of my family. They wanted to take a field trip on one of my days off to the Montefiore Medical Center, where I'll be spending a huge chunk of the next four years for my job. Why would I want to spend even *more* time there when I didn't need to?""I want to see your hospital,"" my sister said firmly. ""Besides,"" she added, ""then we can go to Arthur Avenue.""Arthur Avenue! A mythical land, inordinately difficult to access by public transit... As far from me as Camelot or Numenor. But for years, I've been raring to visit this heir to Manhattan's now irrevocably hokey Little Italy. While NYC has its share of wonderful, high-minded Italian restaurants, truly high-quality old-school Italian-American is a more elusive thing. My sister knew that the mere mention of the neighborhood would inspire me. So we piled in the car and drove over.For lunch proper, we settled on Zero Otto Nove -- henceforth referred to as 089, the translation for the name. It greets you with a small bar in a gratuitously large atrium, a flaunting of the land available in the Bronx compared to the sardine-can lots of Manhattan. The dining room put a smile on my face as soon as I walked in. It's a simulation of an Italian courtyard, weathered stone and large-scale faux frescos surrounding wooden tables. Structurally superfluous arches add some visual interest, and a distinctly non-superfluous brick oven occupies one corner of the room. All of this might strike one as overly Epcotty, but a large skylight lets the sun in so bewitchingly (at least at lunchtime) that one is likely to forgive a lot. Or at least I am.Still, it didn't have that same old-world patina that many other eateries on Arthur Avenue clearly have, making it an odd choice for a first foray into the area. I'd picked it because I'd heard good things about their Neapolitan pizza, made in the aforementioned oven. The margherita pie we ordered went in that oven and came out nearly instantly, testament to the oven's operating temperature. I eyed it warily as it arrived steaming at our table: how good could it be compared to a Motorino, a Keste, a Co.?Pretty damned good, it turns out. Motorino's has better mouth feel, Keste's has more interesting char, Co.'s has a more flavorful crust... But I'd still put 089 in a blind taste test with any of them. The sauce tilts to the sweet side, the crust soft, the mozzarella (sourced from across the street) nicely tangy. I was reminded of Franny's estimable margherita: no single element dominating, each ingredient fuses into a well-conceived whole. That I can even mention 089 in the same breath as these others is quite a compliment from me.But 089 is from the same man behind the more upscale Roberto's in the area, and so has a more ambitious menu than any of those other places (excepting perhaps Franny's). The margherita was a mere amuse-bouche for our full order of starters. An antipasto plate benefitted from all the Italian markets in the immediate area, with prosciutto that sublimated on the tongue and olives far more subtle that most. Meatballs, loosely packed and surprisingly dainty, were finely paired with triangles of polenta. And a special grilled octopus appetizer actually made me double-take: its deceptively simple appearance on the plate belied the sheer creaminess of the cephalopod. It was the best octopus dish I'd had since 15 East's slow-poached version. (You know I'm being blown away when I'm comparing an Italian-American dish to something at one of the finest Japanese restaurants in NYC.)But we weren't done! We got pastas, too. A squid ink linguini had just the right amount of ink and a nice undertone of spice, but the calamari itself was a touch rubbery. No complaints whatsover about a ""pasta al forno"", though: a madhouse baked ziti of dreams with meatballs, soppressata, and hard-boiled egg. And a mafalde pasta with porcini dish was a riot of flavor, the ruffled noodles taking up the mushroom bomb of a sauce as it all happily melded with smoked mozzarella. The al dente school might have failed these dishes -- in Italian-American fashion, they were all on the more cooked side -- but I found them all hearty and delicious.Of course 089 doesn't have the ambitions of a Scarpetta, a Marea, even a Motorino. But that's not what Arthur Avenue is for, what the Bronx is for, what Italian-American cuisine is for. 089 delivers a crazy amount of hits in a setting that manages to be charming almost despite itself. I can hardly imagine being more compelled by an eatery in this genre, and though I have not previously given 5 stars to any establishment I've only been to once, I do so now without qualms.Did I mention the pizza was damned good?Probability of return within 1 year: 20%, but only this low because Arthur Ave is so out of the way; if I'm actually there again, then 80%",10,3,6,Lawrence C.,"New York, NY",82,215,0

I normally don't even like peas but these were spiced so wonderfully, I couldn't help but eat them all!  For dessert I had the Fragola a la Romana, which was made with strawberries and some kind of cream.

4.0,3/11/2010,"When I was debating whether or not to take a job in the Bronx, everyone who was pro-job kept uttering the magic phrase ""Arthur Avenue"" in hopes that the power of Italian food would sway me. It didn't really add much to the package, since I brown-bag it every day. What's more, a billion touristy red-and-white-checked-tablecloth, candle-in-a-Chianti-bottle, five-raviolis-in-butter-and-cut-rate-parmesan-for-twenty-bucks places have pretty much soured me on most Italian restaurants outside of, you know, Italy. But I did take the job and I did find myself on Arthur Avenue for lunch eventually, and now I can safely say I get it. We only had pizza and a few appetizers, but I'd definitely trust anything else on the menu after tasting that much. Whether this is the best pizza in New York City is hard to say, but it is excellent. I would say it's got a little too much end crust for my tastes, but the sauce is divine and the crust is perfectly chewy. Appetizers are mostly simple affairs, but executed flawlessly. The dining area is spacious and charmingly decorated, and we had excellent, attentive service. This will most definitely become my go-to place whenever I've got friends visiting my new work 'hood...and that will teach me to dismiss an entire cuisine based on what you can get in the better-trafficked areas.

Cooked super quickly in true Neapolitan style in a large brick oven in the main dining room, I'm craving it hard a day later. You can't really compare it to old, traditional NY pizza places like Di Fara's or Grimaldi's, but in comparison to the newer places inspired by Wolfgang Puck's Spago in LA, it compares quite favorably.

5.0,1/3/2010,"By far the best Italian meal I've had in the past year, if not ever! After spending a few hours at the Bronx Zoo, we made our way to the same borough's Little Italy on Arthur Avenue. This was our second trip to both, and both times with my in-laws. Of course, this time we also had our preschooler and toddler.Reminding my wife and me of how years ago we ended up at Cafe Gitane in SoHo, a couple leaving the restaurant said we absolutely should eat there because the food was ""wicked good."" At Cafe Gitane, a guy sitting outside said the coffee was like liquid crack.Walking from the restaurant's entrance and bar towards the dining room in back, I knew we were in store for more than Sbarro. The rear wall had a gorgeous fresco from floor to ceiling, and the wood-burning oven had a strong presence well integrated into the dining room. Best of all, we had the perfect seating in an alcove.Back to food ... the couple we encountered outside the restaurant was absolutely right. While house salad is house salad, the entrees were heavenly. La Cirilo pizza was made in the brick oven, with perfectly thin and crispy crust, and a unique mixture of butternut squash and fresh mozzarella.Oh, and the Mafalde con Porcini e Provola pasta not only tasted magical with smoked mozzarella and fresh tomato, but also felt in your mouth as if it were ""born"" just minutes before being boiled. I've had homemade pasta though never this fresh.Bringing everything together, service was friendly and attentive without annoying. They offered a booster and plastic cup for Jonah, brought a new fork when someone's fell without our asking, and cleaned off our daughter's table mat.Needless to say, we might have hit on that rarest of restaurants - absolutely going back, maybe without trying others in the neighborhood.

4.0,12/22/2009,"It was a great change of scenery to get dinner in the Bronx rather than Manhattan. The shops and restaurants along Arthur Avenue are far better than anything in Little Italy/SoHo. The ambiance at Zero Otto Nove is quite relaxed and laid back. A hallway leads to spacious dining room with high ceilings, a skylight, and painted walls that bear semblance to a narrow side street you might find in Italy. Because there were six of us, we decided to share two pizzas and one of the specials as starters. We ordered the Margherita and Marinara pizzas - both were very good but the crust was really doughy and was more like ""New York"" style pizza than thin crust Italian pizza. Our seafood antipasto was good and large enough for the table to share. I ordered the grigliata di pesce, which was grilled shrimp, calamari, langostinos, and octopus. Some of the seafood had a fishy taste and smell to it, which made me question how fresh it actually was. Of course, I liked everyone's dishes better - the butternut risotto squash was rich and had tons of cheese - it was like heaven on earth. The penne was also fresh and delicious. Of course, everyone saved room for dessert. It was too late in the evening to order to nutella pizza, which was a huge disappointment. My tiramisu was alright, but I'm very picky about how dense or creamy it is. Fortunately, no one went overkill with the marscapone and there was plenty of liquor. The fragola alla romana was definitely the best dessert of the bunch - the sweet strawberries and cream were such a treat. The pastiera is basically the southern Italian grain pie served at Easter with all those icky citrons in it, nothing special. Our waiters were patient and very attentive, although one of them almost drowned an iPhone when attempting to refill water glasses.

Aside from the olives, my friend enjoyed his pizza.   Given that I rarely come out to the Bronx, I wanted to try their dessert (even though we planned on hitting up some bakeries afterwards).  Unfortunately, I can't seem to determine what the dessert was called but it was a petite lady finger cake filled with light cream and topped with sliced strawberries and almonds.

5.0,5/9/2009,"From the front, it looked stylish, polished, and small.  The hostess offered to seat us at once and led us down this hall further and further...where were we going??  We ended up in the large room with a skylight and murals on the wall.  There was a balcony on one end that looked really cute, but nobody had been seated there yet.  The large menu has a few classic Italian dishes, lots of pizzas, and lots of high-end ""new"" Italian dishes.  We ordered across the spectrum, and it was all DIVINE.  And the desserts...mere words can not describe!   I'm giving it a 5 based on the food, because I thought the layout was a bit odd and led to the room being noisy.  And our waiter was rather inattentive.  That said, I can't wait to return!",1,1,1,Alison B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,29,0

3.0,3/27/2009,"Biggest mystery? Why this place thinks it is too good for reservations.My parents and I had a lovely dinner here back in the fall of 07'. I don't remember what I ate, but I know it was delicious, and that we were all dazzled by Chaz Palminteri's looming presence on the other side of the ""piazza."" It left a good impression, and I've wanting to go back ever since.Last weekend, I thought I'd have a nice birthday dinner with friends at Zero Otto Nove. I called twice to make sure that a party of 15 would not be a problem at 6:00 on a Saturday, and was assured that we would be accommodated. The hostess was equally confident when we arrived, but explained that we could not be seated until everyone arrived. It's a bit of a trek up to Arthur Ave for a good number of my friends, and the final stragglers didn't make it until just before 6:30. We then waited patiently for a table until 8:10! They needed to clear two tables in order to seat us,  and they clearly seated a new party at one of those tables before us, rather than holding it open for us while the second table finished. We hung out at the bar in front and ordered drinks, but the bartender was ""too busy"" to ask the kitchen for a bread basket, and the owner did nothing to ease the drawn out wait. Once finally seated, the waiter was rather businesslike, and even asked me for ID when I ordered my drink. Unwise when the cranky, 23 year old birthday girl has been waiting more than two hours for a table!!! Hungry and anxious to get the show on the road, we all cut straight to the chase and ordered entrees. They did not arrive until 9:15. In the mean time, management could have easily made amends by offering us a complimentary plate of antipasto, but this courtesy, like all others, eluded them. I must admit that my pork oso buco, (one of the night's specials), was incredibly tender and tasty, and I also loved the accompanying white bean risotto. However, at that point it was far too little, too late. I was so visibly irritated, we didn't even order birthday cake.I do not understand why they would not seat us when we were there at 6. We would have happily drank wine and ate appetizers while we waited for our stragglers to arrive! The way they handled seating us is just baffling to me! Luckily, my friends were all much better sports about the whole ordeal than I was, and enjoyed themselves. I got a little stressed out, but it is a wonderful thing to be surrounded with friends you love on your birthday, so in retrospect, it didn't put TOO much of a damper on the evening. The food is far too good to give this place two stars, but I was extremely disappointed in the level of service we received, especially at these prices. When I dine out, I expect to be treated as if my time is valuable, and I did not have that experience here. I would still recommend Zero Otto Nove, as the food is among Arthur Ave's most interesting and delicious, on par with Enzo's and Roberto's. Just don't try coming here with a group, be prepared to wait if you get here after 6 on a weekend evening, and be warned: the food may be authentically Italian, but the hospitality is NOT.",4,2,3,Sarah C.,"New York, NY",152,352,60

5.0,12/22/2008,"Trattoria Zero Otto Nove has some of the most authentic Italian food that I have ever tried.  Even though the trek was a pain, the restaurant was superb.  The servers were extremely professional, friendly, and soft spoken.  All of them.  They were a team.  It wasn't like in other restaurants where you have one server pretending to like you to get your tip.  These people worked like a team all equally helping you out and were very sincere in their efforts.  The atmosphere was very much needed after having walked so far in the frozen slush.  The atmosphere transports you to Italy.  Take time to look around the room and appreciate everything.  They were very quick to refill our bread and drinks.  For my meal, I got the pollo capricciosa.  2 pieces of breaded chicken cutlet with melted cheese, marinara, pesto, and covered in chopped tomatoes and olive oil.  It was outstanding.  I tried other dishes too.  My friend had the pollo scarpariello which is chicken on the bone sauteed with white wine, rosemary, and lemon juice.  I was in heaven.  Furthermore, my other friend couldn't finish her cheese and spinach calzone so I had the pleasure of finishing it off for her.  I was very impressed with the authenticity of the food and the friendliness of the staff.  This place is definitely a winner and I can see why Belmont is considered the real Little Italy in NYC.",3,3,3,Dan B.,"Brooklyn, NY",460,972,42

I've always wanted to experience their version of ""Little Italy"" I went on the internet and tried to find the best Pizza that Arthur Ave has to offer. I found two places that people raved about. The first is ""Trattoria Zero Otto Nove"" and the other is ""Full Moon"" I gotta tell you I was so disappointed. The place inside (Trattoria Zero Otto Nove)  is really nice and very Italian looking! The bad right off the bat is they only sell personal size pizza, but i knew that right from the get-go. Anyway i went there with a friend and ordered one. The Pizza had a very nice taste, but it was not crispy at all. The crust was good. It cost me $25 for the pizza a coke and a Heineken which i think is way too much.

5.0,11/16/2008,"In a year where I have been fortunate enough to have some tremendous meals in all corners of the world, this place goes down as my personal  ""Find of 2008"".  Simply tremendous.I have wanted to go to this place for a while, as I've heard it many, many times mentioned as an answer to that somewhat-rhetorical question of, ""Who makes the best pizza in New York?"".   This, I'm sorry to disappoint you, is not a question that I dare to tackle in this review, as for every opinion of a place which deserves this honor, there are a thousand people who will disagree.  Let's put this to rest for a moment because, believe it or not:  It's not all about the pizza!  (although the pizza is certainly damn good!)Nestled on Arthur Avnue, Zero Otto Nevo could easily get lost among the rest of the trattorias, pizzarias, ""clam houses"" and everything else that tries to lure you in with their garlicky aroma.  What you have here, however, is an exceptional, truly-authentic Italian dining experience that you're going to find in few and far places between here and Italy.  The owner is a true Italian, the staff are true Italians and the food makes you want to set fire to every Olive Garden and Macaroni Grill that exist this side of Tuscany.  A group of us made the trek over with one mission:  Taste as much as we could in a single evening.  And that, we most certainly did...We started, of course, with the aforementioned pizza.  Expertly-crafted and finished in their wood-fired oven, the end result meets ethereal levels.  The crust is that absolutely perfect combination of crispy, chewy, slightly salty and tasty.  The toppings are perfectly proportioned, delicious and in many cases, pretty unique.  The Capreicciosa with ham, mushrooms, tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, olives was superb.  The Patate Salsiccia e Provolo with sliced potatoes, sausage, smoked mozzarella made me want to order another.   Is it the best pizza in New York City?  I'll let you decide.  But I have tried all the contenders and this certainly ranks up there, without a doubt. Moving on, a simple salad of arugula, fresh lemon and giant shaved chunks parmigiano reggiano was a great way to clean the palate (and good enough for two).   The sauteed sausage with butternut squash and gorgonzola is similar to something that my grandmother used to make and was simply delicious.   As with most of the menu, the antipasti choices range from the classic to the inventive.For the mains, a simple Pasta al Forno with meatballs was cooked perfectly while the Pollo Capricciosa (a huge piece of breaded, thick, chicken cutlet with fresh mozzarella marinated tomato, pesto) looked like it would be incredibly heavy and over-fried, but was probably the lightest piece of sauteed chicken breast I have ever tasted.  Note:  These dishes are clearly made for sharing.For dessert, a medley was required.  The filling for their classic cannolis was perfect and their fresh, homemade shells melted in your mouth.  Tiramisu was surprisingly light and flavorful and their signature Nutella Pizza was whisked from the wood oven to our table - it was truly unique and delicious.  The espressos, as you might imagine, are perfectly crafted.The atmosphere here is great and is perfect for groups.  The service was incredibly attentive and well-orchestrated.   You could see that dishes moved from kitchen or pizza over to your table within seconds.  The wine list is varied, with all price ranges, and there is a full bar up front if you do have to wait (our wait was 20 minutes at 8:30 on a Saturday).  I believe the closest subway stop is about a mile or so away, so be prepared to hitch a ride or get some sort of bus out there.   ...or just walk.  Or swim up the Harlem River. Because it's definitely worth the effort.",4,1,1,Chris U.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",73,235,111
5.0,11/11/2008,"You do not get more authentic Neapolitan than this in the city.My pizza travels have taken me across the length and breadth of the five boroughs, and beyond. They have allowed me to discover this great city in ways that my previous 7 years did not. I did not realize that the tourist trap called Little Italy in Manhattan pales in comparison to the Arthur Avenue section of the Bronx that also bears that name. Even though perhaps few Italian Americans actually live in either section, it was abundantly clear that they actually do come in to shop at the many bakeries, grocery stores, etc. and dine in the pizzerias and restaurants in and around Arthur Avenue. Zero Otto Nove (089) is the area code for the owner-chef's place of origin, Salerno. As I made my way past the front bar and through a narrow, arched passageway I came to a high ceiling dining room, centered around a brick, wood-burning pizza oven. The seating area is skylit and muraled, and resembles more a Broadway set for a medieval Italian Piazza. The Trattoria is generally filled with Italian speaking patrons who know each other and are often talking to someone across the room. The servers are also Italian, mostly FOBs (Fresh off the boat) and usually in their teens.When Zero Otto Nove was launched earlier in the year, the wood burning oven was manned by the pizzaiolo Ricardo, who had quite a reputation in Salerno. He spread Zero Otto Nove's fame with his pizza wizardry leading to the restaurant being featured as one of the best pizzas in the country. While Ricardo has since left for home, Zero Otto Nove is still churning out fantastic pizzas.I've been here on more than a couple occasions, and thought that their quality was consistent. Thin crust pizza, well charred (not too much, but not burnt) at the bottom, crisp, but airy at the edges. Compared to Luzzo's I found it a bit thinner in the middle, less airy and a bit crisper. The creamy mozzarella is one of the richest and freshest that one is likely to find, the basil and olive oil are perhaps the best coordinated in the city. Usually I have found that either pizzas are bathed in olive oil (even the great Dom is guilty of it at Di Fara) or the basil is withered because it is too dry. 089 manages both of these elements perfectly. The one weak link is perhaps the tomato sauce, which has been somewhat bland on occasion. Nevertheless, all of the elements of a great Margherita pizza come together almost perfectly. This is an exceptional pie.The service is polite and attentive. My glass has been filled promptly, the bread brought to the table at the earliest, and all my queries attended to with courtesy. Compared to Luzzo's Italian staff, I find those at 089 to be more proficient in the English language.Comparisons to Luzzo are inevitable, and I have to say that other than the pizza which is almost comparable (Luzzo's a bit ahead), Zero Otto Nove is far better on all other counts. Their pastas are some of the best in the city, and that is to be expected with the owner also running the famed Bronx restaurant, Roberto's. I have found their desserts to be much superior as well. I liked the Pastiera (Italian Ricotta Cheese Cake with candied fruit) more (better textural variations), and the Tiramisu was also the most superior version of all the pizzerias I've dined at. It's been a while that I thought that not just the mascarpone cream, but the ladyfingers were also executed exceptionally well.I can not endorse Zero Otto Nove enough. Sure, the round trip travel time adds up, but then you will not have to wait a couple of hours for your table, that is inevitable at a great pizzeria in the city. And, even though 089's ambiance and surroundings might suggest that the fat lady is about to sing, rest assured that the pizza travels continue :)",21,9,20,Atif I.,"New York, NY",177,642,1772

Even the bathroom is spotless (and in the Bronx, no less).If it's available, top your meal off with a serving of torta di fragola alla Romana, a luscious treat of soft ladyfinger cakes layered with vanilla cream mousse, fresh strawberries, and strawberry syrup.Now you know what's on the menu in heaven.",2,1,1,Aris F.,"Miami, FL",0,366,40

Finally I can put an end to the constant probing, the researching, the love handles. Trattoria Zero Otto Nove hits the mark in every way. It is The Best Pizza I Have Ever Had (cue confetti). And it's nestled in the Little Italy of the Bronx, ma certo! The brick oven itself has been transported from Salerno, Italy, where the owner of this spot hails from. Mercy! It doesn't get more Italian than that. The crust was chewy, charred and crumbled under the weight of the fresh mozzeralla (made daily from the cheese shop down the street). The sauce was sweet and busting with ripe tomato flavor. A 10"" personal pie is just enough to leave a lasting impact. Like, forever n' ever.

4.0,5/25/2008,"Being 8 months pregnant, when I want a certain kind of food, I want a certain kind of food and I want it now. Right? Last night, I wanted brick oven pizza. We didn't want to go into Manhattan, so we looked in Westchester. Then, my genius husband suggested Arthur Avenue, right here in the Bronx. I know all about the legend that is Arthur Avenue (""Bronx's Little Italy"") but I never made it over there... until last night. I googled ""Arthur Avenue in the Bronx Pizza"" and the first hit was Trattoria Zero Otto Nove, or 089.  089 is the area code for Salerno, the town from which the chef hails. One point for authenticity right there. We hopped in the car, not sure if we'd find parking but willing to try. It seemed pretty quiet for a Saturday night... on the street, anyway. We found parking on Arthur Avenue near the restaurant, but there's also a municipal lot nearby (much cheaper than a private parking garage!) if you can't find on-street parking. There was a shiny blue FIAT parked on the sidewalk, coming out of the restaurant, whose front was completely open. The front room is a bar, which made my husband take one look and keep walking while I stood there bewildered. Where was he going? ""Hey, come back here!"" The tables are in the back, duh. The hostess was very nice and extremely attentive, emphasis on the extremely. She updated us every 5 seconds on when our table would be ready, which wasn't a long wait anyway. We sat at the bar until the table was ready.  We followed her down a long corridor that opened up into a room (with an upper level) designed to make you feel like you're in an Italian plaza. If you've been to Italy (and we have), if you tune out the noise, you could very imagine yourself in a little piazza, for sure. Speaking of the noise... that's the source of the missing star. The place was packed, a good sign, but incredibly noisy. The sound just bounces off the walls and high ceilings. We had a hard time hearing our waiter but we got through it. Other than that, the ambience was familiar and friendly. We started off with a pizza. A pie is cut into 4 slices, so I would order one pie per two people (or if you just want a light appetizer, order one pie per 4 people in your party).  The pizza was made in the brick oven across from our table, and delivered piping hot. All their pizza choices sounded good but we decided on a house special called La Carminuccio, a tomato pizza with pancetta. It wasn't the best best best pizza we've ever had but it was pretty good! We also ordered a dish of mussels in marinara sauce (you can get mild or spicy), which were yummy and a special treat for this pregnant lady who can't eat shellfish to her heart's content. We washed it down with a glass of red wine. The wine list is pretty good and extensive (the whole back side of the menu) but  wines by the glass are not listed, so ask the waiter. We finished off dinner with a yummy tiramisu that was heavy on the espresso and had a faint citrus-y aftertaste. Overall, it was a good experience and we'd go back there again for sure. They don't take reservations, unless you have a large party but on a Saturday night, even with a crowd, we only waited ten minutes for our table. (Regarding Lori's comment about feeling rushed, we didn't get that experience at all... we nursed our wine for awhile and had to ask for the check when we were ready to go.
