4.0,3/31/2019,"UPDATE #2Went to breakfast again on Monday, but instead of a buffet, it is a la carte. We had Lucasz as our waiter, and he's actually pretty great. He was on top of our orders, really attentive, and was the complete opposite of our disastrous Sunday experience. I had the eggs Benedict, and they use a different kind of ham (was not typical Canadian bacon), but it was good. Kids ordered a cheese omelette and chocolate chip pancakes, both good. The croissant tray is also amazing - chocolate croissant and cheese croissant were our favorites.UPDATED REVIEWGreat service recovery by Luis. He saw how unhappy we were with the lack of food in the buffet (croissants, fruit, cheese and other items not refilled) and brought over some fresh cut fruit for the kiddos. Thank you for saving the day. Managers should take note - Luis deserves a raise as he seems to be only person in the restaurant that cares about the customers.PRIOR REVIEWStaying at the Conrad for a 3 night stay. Went to Atrio for breakfast on Sunday morning and there was a 20-minute wait. Asian man at host stand said that we would have to wait in the lobby and cannot go back to the room to wait. We have small kids in tow so we did our best to entertain them in the lobby as we waited. Then when we were finally let into the restaurant, they ran out of many foods and would not refill. Everyone working here has a frown on their face and are unhelpful. We didn't have sugar on our table for our coffee and when asked, they told us to grab it off of our neighboring table where other guest was sitting/eating. Do not recommend this restaurant at all, especially if you have to pay.",0,0,0,Amy A.,"Northbrook, IL",74,173,113

5.0,12/24/2018,"Would recommend this place!I was here to take a client out to lunch. It is located in the lobby of the very fancy Conrad hotel. The staff is very nice and attentive. This is the type of place you have a ""power lunch"" at, or perhaps just a nicer lunch than in the nearby options. The noise level is low, which is great because you can hold conversations without raising your voice over other patrons or the music.The food is great. The serving portions are on the smaller side so you'll likely want to order an appetizer or two with your entree if you're coming in hungry. The price is what you'd expect for a ""$$$"" place in the Bryant Park neighborhood.All in all, I would definitely return to take future potential clients out in the area.",0,0,0,Derrick W.,"New York, NY",232,31,5
1.0,11/19/2018,"If I could give this bar lower stars, I would. I have been here many times, and the bartenders have generally been nice and they recognize a repeat customer. However, today I encountered a bartender named DANIEL that was both rude and condescending. He was attentive to other guests but not to me (allegedly because he did not ""recognize me"" even though I have been to the bar and been served by him before). Even if he just lacks that mental capacity to remember people and be kind, his attitude and rudeness are unacceptable and extremely off-putting.

3.0,11/3/2018,"I came for breakfast and wasn't too fond of the menu. I asked to see a lunch menu. I liked those options better. It was only 40 minutes until lunch so I decided to wait. Lunch time (11:30) came. A guy comes to start setting up the bar about 10 minutes prior and looks at me but doesn't say a word to me for the entire time. He had a completely unfriendly vibe. At 11:40ish I decide to ask him if it's lunch time because I'm thinking perhaps I was wrong if this guy is ignoring me. He tells me that it is lunch time, and that I could sit at any of the tables and that he isn't responsible for the area I was sitting (and I was sat here by the host). I was confused thinking I could not order food at the bar. He yells someone some other guy over, asking him if he's responsible for the bar area in which I'm seated. I finally got some silverware and placed my order. The food came in no time. Steak sandwich with fries. Fries were average,  steak sandwich was decent, nothing amazing. Definitely will not be back.

5.0,10/7/2018,"Atrio in the Conrad Hotel in Battery Park City is right off of the stunning lobby atrium.  It sports an open kitchen that immediately sets your palate on fire due to its spick and span (and I mean clean - and I am Jack Lemmon/Felix Ungar OCD!) appeal.  The restaurant/bar is immaculate and is very modern with a slight retro feel.  You actually feel as if you are in a restaurant in an airport terminal, and that is meant in a very jet-set way.  Shaun, the GM, is a true gentleman, and our server, Valter, has veteran qualities of an old-world service that has made a renewed stake in New York City.  He was very pleasant, making conversation very easily, and made sure that we were very happy with our dinners, which were exceptional, from the al-dente risotto with English peas and asparagus, to the French pressed pot of coffee and savory desserts.  He overheard me say that my parents' 60th anniversary was this coming Thursday, and brought out their dessert with a lit candle and sang ""Happy Anniversary,"" along with me!  The restaurant also has a wonderful, and somewhat magical, aura in that it has a rare quietude that lets you relax almost instantly.  Atrio has fast become one of the greatest culinary finds in NYC.  Offset from the tension of all of New York, is is nestled within the Conrad Hotel right on Vesey Street (at North End Avenue) across the street from the spectacular Brookfield Place in Battery Park City.  As my mom and dad have both been facing medical challenges this year, this was one of the first times they were able to finally get out and enjoy fine dining again, and I was so happy to see that happen.  And Atrio and its staff made this blue autumn afternoon one to remember.  Happy fall to all at Atrio and thank you from the three of us - Paul Sr., Grace and Paul Jr.  Sunday, October 7, 2018.",0,0,0,Dr. Paul R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,6,0

Patrick was the server who was taking care of us for the night. We ordered our food and drinks and was asked if we were keeping the tab open which is odd because we ordered food and not just drinks but I gave my card because I didn't want to think anything of it. When we were done, i asked for the bill. In return, i got receipt with my card being charged without my bill being shown. Me and my friend planned on splitting the bill which I explained to him after he ignored me trying to get his attention after he quickly dropped the receipt off.

4.0,4/30/2018,"Came here for restaurant week lunch - chose this restaurant because we were meeting friends who worked in the financial district so this wasn't to far for them to come for a lunch. This restaurant is located within a hotel and sometimes felt a little too integrated with the hotel (which was a downside to me) - for example to use the ladies room you have to leave the restaurant and walk across the lobby past the front desk. Other than that, we were seated immediately, I ordered a martini (which definitely wasn't watered down), and I chose the salmon from the pre-fixe menu, which was cooked perfectly. It was paired with a grains dish which complimented the salmon very well.

I also got the pork meatballs, which were brought to me quite promptly, then again there weren't many people there at around five, so I can't vouch for the service when it's busier. The meatballs were good, nothing to travel for, but good. I enjoyed the crispy, oiled bread which I dipped in the tomato sauce.

The salad was very good, the beers were aromatic and delicious and the goat cheese dressing was spread on the rim of the plate. The octopus was good, a bit too charred on the ends but the portion was good. Entree: I got Atlantic halibut and my partner got chicken. Both were delicious and very filling.

I worked in my room at the Conrad all day and lacked the energy or the will to leave the hotel to find a spot to eat. There is no lack of options. Except I would have had to leave the building. It was too much work.I'm so glad I stayed. The pasta is homemade and cooked perfectly -- al denté but not too tough. The ragú was moist and succulent, not dry like others I've had. The aromatics were well done but had not disintegrated. It was topped with Spanish jamón, the first time I had it. It was a great dish. The summer salad I started with was delicious but almost forgotten after having finished my entreé (unsuccessfully -- I'm so full).

3.0,6/22/2016,"This review is for breakfast only.The Skinny: came here for breakfast as a Hilton Honors guest - food was okay but nothing special (3) service: can be a bit slow in the mornings - surprisingly so considering that it is breakfast - most people want eat and vamoose. (3) value: the food is okay if not overpriced. If we didn't have the Hilton Honors Diamond benefit we would have passed on breakfast here (3).As a Diamond Hilton Honor's guest, you are entitled to a breakfast benefit with your stay. At the Conrad NYC, you are able to eat at their regular restaurant (they do not have a lounge). Your options are a $20 credit for anything on the menu or you can order 1 item off a truncated Hilton Honors Diamond member menu which includes a hot drink and juice.On the truncated menu there were a few options: steel-cut oatmeal, breakfast bruschetta, house-made granola with berries and Greek yogurt, market fruit plate, pastry basket. We tried everything except the steel-cut oatmeal.The breakfast bruschetta ($20) was okay - basically it's scrambled eggs on pesto-cheese toast, topped with cherry tomatoes and microgreens. Nothing mind blowing and actually a little on the bland side. The house-made granola ($15) was not memorable in my books. Slightly over toasted but yet lacking a nice crunchy texture, it needed a bit more sweetness to balance out the yogurt's sourness. Totally meh and actually I prefer Kirkland brand organic ancient grain granola over this stuff (you can get like 2 lbs of that for like $8).The market fruit plate is still pricey for what they charge for it (and it isn't even organic; $18). If you were to go the grocery store, you could probably buy a whole organic pineapple, melon and berries plus have a bunch of spare change for that price.Pastries are a waste in my humble opinion ($14). They charge $14 for a basket of pastries (by a basket, it means 3 pastry items - a brioche roll, a croissant and a scone) that aren't even warm. All of the pastry items are decent but surely they could provide a better value for what they want to charge.Finally, we ordered off the regular menu - the ricotta pancakes ($19) and the french toast ($20).The lemon curd ricotta pancakes were totally ho-hum. Normally, ricotta pancakes are super light. These were too dense and tasted just like regular pancakes. Not to mention they totally skimped on the lemon curd. I wouldn't order this again.The french toast fared better but still not special enough to warrant the $20 pricetag. It was served with half a stick of butter on top. No joke - it was kind of gross. Plus all that butter totally makes the french toast soggy. Overall, if you are a Hilton Honors Diamond member, it may be worth your while to take advantage of the breakfast benefit with the idea of grabbing an earlier lunch somewhere else. However that being said, their portions for the price provide a bad value if you are paying out of pocket. Service is kind of slow for breakfast and easily overwhelmed if there are more guests so get there early. 3 starred review.",4,1,1,Candace C.,"Las Vegas, NV",313,382,1595

It was a nice place to watch the crazy rainstorm that was happening outside. Very friendly, warm welcome upon our arrival. The service was efficient. Everyone enjoyed their lunch. Bread baskets were served with an interesting dipping spread that was hummus(?) with an olive oil drizzle. My friend got the burrata; he loved its creaminess and that it was served with thin slices of prosciutto - sitting on top of pesto. I had a glass of Pinot Noir which was smooth and delicious. It was a nice sized pour. I didn't see the bill, and am not even sure which wine I had or how much it cost. I had the flatbread without the prosciutto. It was supposed to have zucchini squash blossoms... Didn't see even one. It was very tasty nonetheless and served hot right out of the stone fired oven. Coffee ( decaf) was way too strong... No matter how much cream I added it was still very dark and bitter. The salted Carmel and peanut butter galette dessert was crunchy ( not sure if it was supposed to be or was it over cooked?). Couldn't detect any peanut butter or fleur desel. I split it with a friend and she felt the same but we both managed to eat every morsel so it was ultimately good. I would go back and perhaps try the $18 lunch special. My flatbread was rather pricey at $22.

We were given a regular menu and a restaurant week menu. Restaurant week menu is great and I would encourage people to eat during the times it is running in NYC and other cities. As for our meal, this is a mediterranean inspired place so there were lots of refreshing dishes to select from. My dining partner had the veal and pork meatballs and I had the watermelon and feta salad. We also split the zucchini flower starter which was incredible. As for the main, I had the branzino, which was fresh and really well seasoned. It was served with organic farro, fiddlehead ferns and thumbelina carrots.

2.0,6/4/2015,"On Friday we ended up back at Atrio as the rooftop bar at the Conrad was too crowded.  We had fun, but our waiter was horrid.  I asked if the arancini where indeed rice balls, since it said underneath that they had mushrooms and truffle oil (not a traditional rice ball).  The waiter said no, they are fried mushrooms.  I said, really?  They aren't rice balls?  and he said again that they were fried mushrooms.  Low and behold they come out and guess what...they are rice balls.  Not only that, but there are no mushrooms inside.  I can't even see little bits of mushrooms or taste the truffle oil.  So basically it was a fried rice ball.  Ridiculously uninteresting and very disappointing.  He also talked my aunt out of the red wine she wanted, telling her it would be too sweet, even though she loves that kind of wine and says it isn't sweet.  I just feel like at this price point and in a nice hotel, the servers should know something about the wine and the food.  Once I told him that the rice balls were rice balls and had no mushrooms, he basically ignored us completely and stopped refilling our waters, etc.  The flatbread, meatballs, etc. that we ordered were tasty, but the terrible service ruined the experience for everyone.  It was exceptionally disappointing considering all of the other places we could have taken my mom and aunt while they were visiting NYC.  We will definitely go elsewhere in the future.",1,0,0,Leana D.,"New York, NY",37,175,131

Atrio also serves lunch and dinner, but this review is only for the breakfast.First off, these prices are a bit out of whack. $22 for a boring eggs benedict? That's a bit much to stomach. The first day, we order the eggs benedict, and then the yogurt with granola. The yogurt was also extremely overpriced. The second day was kind of like a different restaurant, probably because the executive chef was the expediter and not somebody else. The crispy corn beef and hash was tasty, but somewhat of a small portion. The waffles were tasty.Ultimately, Atrio is not worth the money. I get that it is a boring hotel restaurant, but it is what it is.

4.0,7/14/2014,"Lovely setting in the Conrad that feels a little less like a restaurant and definitely more like a bar, as the name suggests, though the food is most definitely of restaurant quality. I visited during Restaurant Week and thought it was great value for the price. The salad (appetizer) that I tried was fascinating, topped with delicately fried shallots and candied figs, alongside a creamy ricotta cheese. It was one of those salads that really draws your attention to everything but the lettuce leaves, for all the right reasons. The octopus appetizer was also very well done - the presentation was beautiful. The spaghetti was nicely done but not particularly memorable, while the fish (sea bass, perhaps, though I may be mistaken) was more notable, especially as it was served alongside clams.I thought the service was as one would expect at such a restaurant, but was particularly impressed when one of the chefs overheard us discussing what was in the chocolate mousse dessert and came over to tell us about it. There was a fruit preserve served on top of the chocolate mousse, which was an unusual but very nice contrast to the sweet cocoa flavour. The red velvet cheesecake tower was a little plainer in appearance - and less memorable in taste - but also delicious.Atrio is definitely worth a meal's time!

I would expect to get either an OUT STANDING meal and good customer service or GREAT food and GREAT customer service. I got quite a different feel for this place. First, although the decor was nice, it had an open kitchen.  The staff was so loud, I could barely hear the person I was dining with. Secondly, don't expect service with a smile, especially if you ask for Splenda with your coffee. Also, when my sugar finally made it to the table, the gentleman filled my water glass, after pouring enough water on my table, soaking the sugar packets and required a towel (which he never returned with).  This caused me to use my napkin, and had to ask for more sugar which took long enough the first time. The food was okay. Nothing to write home about. The convenience of having a restaurant in a hotel is what caused me to give this establishment a second try. Much to my dismay, with the exception of the water spilling incident, was a duplicate of the prior visit. I recommend enclosing the kitchen in glass as noise reduction, and take another look at the staff employed there. They are in dire need of customer service skills (that match the price that's charged for the food). I spent the rest of my money eating at the bagel shop around the corner.

Great overall experience!First experience was meeting the management staff who happened to be assisting the floor staff on this relatively busy evening. Very knowledgeable and seemed sincere in their friendly approach to service. Nothing I hate more than a phony Yes Man"" who would give you happy ending to sell Friday oysters on a Monday evening. I literally let one of the manager's bring me a glass of white wine without glancing at the menu or asking what they recommend. He paired it perfectly with my main course. My wife and I had several seafood dishes and all were great. Nice fresh, chunky tuna tartar. Great grilled octopus! And those big fat juicy scallops were truly a treat cooked just right, as per my request to a medium/med rare. My wife had the mushroom risotto. If you know anything about risotto you know there is an art to cooking it correctly. They got it right and the blend of earthy flavors were just right. I saw 3"" thick filet mignons and other beautiful red meats going by on their way to other tables. Though I can't vouch from a first hand experience, I will say all their cow parts looked beautiful. Clearly I'll have to return and try other selections.One criticism; I found two of our four selections too sweet. Not by accident, mind you. They use sweet chili sauces and mango and other great hints that lead to sweetness. Though these are not mistakes, my pallet happens to not enjoy sweet and protein or for that matter with anything that is not a dessert.The location is nice with some tables offering Hudson River views.

Whatever the case, I had a nice little time riding out an intense thunderstorm just steps from the Freedom Tower last week. Located inside the Conrad Hotel (the entrance to the hotel might be one of the most dramatic, stunning scenes in NYC), Atrio is a Mediterranean restaurant on paper, but it sort of strays a bit from the typical hummus and feta spreads that are somewhat synonymous from this region's delicacies. Items like meatballs, pizza, brussels sprouts, and burrata dot the menu... and last I checked, pizza didn't get a chapter in the Mediterranean Diet cookbook. But the pizza ain't half bad! It's hard to pinpoint a specific style, but the lamb sausage variety was quite tasty. In addition to the foodstuffs, they had a nice wine program with a variety of wine regions being represented, as well as different sizes so you can try several without breaking the bank.

I've been there for dinner a half dozen times, and its always been excellent. I've also had coffee there after going to the cinema in the building on Sundays, and they have an excellent French roast. One HUGE plus is the great acoustics - someone engineered the ceilings and space so you can hear the people you are sitting with very well, and NOT hear all the din of the other diners, or the busy bar (which is a rare thing in NYC). I think many of the negative reviews are from patrons of the Conrad who are looking down their noses at the in-house restaurant.    To them I say, leave the building and check out many of the other excellent choices within blocks, or don't, but remember it's just a hotel restaurant. My one issue with the place (and the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars) is the drink prices.   $18 for a cocktail?  That's obscene even to someone who lives in Manhattan, and enjoys a high-end cocktail.  I can see you getting away with it on the rooftop bar, where there is a view to go with the drink, but not for dinner.Update: cocktail prices are now $17.75 - really Atrio?

In a nutshell, the place seems like all show, with very little substance to back it up.",3,1,0,Sean R.,"Alexandria, VA",14,31,0
3.0,4/27/2012,"Delicious,but deliciously overpriced too!  While staying at the Conrad Hotel, I had one lunch, one breakfast and one round of drinks here.  For lunch, the carmelized onion and gorgonzola pizza was awesome.  But lunch for two, with one coffee, one soda came to $60.  A breakfast for two, with two pots of coffee, and two sides of toast, was also excellent (the bruschetta scrambled eggs yummy and unusual).  But a modest sized breakfast for two (just coffee, no juice, no mimosa etc.) for $60 is over the top in my opinion.  I'd happily eat here again if someone else was picking up the bill.  Later, seven of us came in for drinks and sat at a table.  We asked for nuts that were provided at the bar,  The server brought over two teeny, tiny bowls, each of which had about ten nuts in them and he told us that was all the bartender ""would let him have"".  Really?  With $16 cocktails you could have given the seven of us more than 20 nuts.",0,1,0,Deirdre W.,"Fort Washington, MD",0,45,0
