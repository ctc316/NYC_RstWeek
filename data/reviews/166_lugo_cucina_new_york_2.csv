5.0,4/18/2019,"This place is on a great location and good food. They also can give you a glass of champagne when you check in so don't forget to do that. The service is good but don't come too late because they are very serious about closing their kitchen at 9pm at least on Fridays. In addition, the view from the restaurant is great surrounded by great windows and wine bottles. Overall it was a good experience and I recommend it for those that love Italian food.",0,0,0,Santos G.,"Manhattan, NY",1,5,4
3.0,4/9/2019,"I try to come here anytime I'm attending an event at the Garden, & it's always been enjoyable even when the service was slow as that was usually due to it being busy, which is understandable. Food has always been good.This time though (4/8/19), was easily my least enjoyable experience, & ironically it was the least busy I've seen it. I guess the Pennsy has taken a bit of business away from them. Our server was very aloof, & I was left with an empty drink for 10 minutes before I was able to make contact requesting another. It seems after a misunderstanding where the server was under the impression we were only ordering appetizers, he was no longer attentive at all. Regardless, this isn't an excuse to dismiss a table. He did not return to our table after taking our order (aside from when I initiated contact for a 2nd drink, a wine, which I had to pour myself) until it was clear we were finished w/our appetizers & to ask if we wanted the check. By then, we did not want to spend any more money there, & went elsewhere for dinner. We were a two top that ordered 3 substantial appetizers, & were planning on ordering two more entrees, two more rounds of drinks, & possibly even dessert.The appetizers we did have were good as always, and the back waiters were competent and pleasant. Servers should never give up on a table, as there are always opportunities to take care of their guests, & increase their checks. I will be back as I've mostly had good experiences there. If you haven't tried it, it's still worth a visit. You can't beat the convenience, & if you're looking for a sit down spot as opposed to the chaos over at Pennsy, then give this place a try.",0,1,0,JP D.,"Neptune Township, NJ",22,8,1
2.0,4/8/2019,"I want to love this place - great atmosphere and location perfect for pre-MSG events.   Unfortunately, the salads are overdressed, the veal Milanese over cooked & dry, the coffee bitter.   My $29 shrimp & scallops entree had 2 shrimp & 2 scallops, also over cooked.  Maybe stick to the pizza and pasta here....",0,0,0,Ginny M.,"Merrick, NY",0,31,0
4.0,4/6/2019,We came last night for a friends birthday and were very impressed. The place was almost empty as they close around 9pm on Friday - which I thought was strange. Either way the ambience of this place was beautiful. The food was good - but some of my food was cold and it seemed like they were in a rush to get us out of the restaurant. It was also very expensive but my steak was definitely worth it as well as the veal and the seafood appetizer. I do not recommend the penne ala vodka - it is a very small portion and did not taste good. Everyone else liked the food and they were very large portions. Overall I would go again but earlier so I didn't feel rushed. Also check in for the free Prosecco offer ! There were 10 of us and they poured them for everyone.,3,0,3,Stephanie J.,"New York, NY",223,79,194
3.0,4/3/2019,"I met up with an old classmate from NYU for lunch here.  He works a block away, and I was catching him during his lunch break.  Seeing him was great, after 22 years, but the food was so-so.I may have ordered the wrong thing, but I had a branzino the day before for lunch (with another old friend from Georgetown) and pizza for dinner, so I wanted something different.  I had the spinach and ricotta ravioli.  It had a butter, olive oil, and garlic sauce, and was sprinkled with sea salt.  At first I liked it, but midway through the plate it got kind of boring and bland.Again, I probably ordered the wrong thing.  My friend like his dish, and the fried calamari were shared was also quite good.  I would come back again and give it another try.",1,0,1,Fernando A.,"Long Beach, CA",222,510,376

There was a lot of food. I had ordered a grilled calamari l. When we were almost done, I noticed it never arrived. I told the waiter I wanted that canceled since it never arrived and we are full and done. He checked the order and told me he actually did not put that in. And he jokingly said it actually worked out since we were full which had nothing to do with the fact he didn't put in the order. Then as he was cleaning the dishes he spilled salad dressing on me. Yes on me. On my shoulder and on my hair. I felt the liquid dropped on my shoulder so I just wiped it off without saying anything to him. Then he told me there's something on the back of my hair and handed me a napkin. I said to him ""since I cannot see (the back of my head) can you please help me?"" and handed him that napkin.

1.0,11/13/2018,"I had one of the worst meals and dining experiences ever in this restaurant. We were there before a Rangers game last week on Tuesday. We ordered the calamari, a dish that was supposed to be a poke dish as appetizers and salmon and the scallops as our entrees. Tuna poke was not poke. It was basically avocado and little bit of tuna mushed in with a ton of jalapeño. It literally looked like puke and it was so spicy it was inedible. Calamari was cold, dry, thin and weird, with some kind of bland tomato sauce that tasted like it came out of a can. I'm sure it wasn't but it was that bland. Salmon was stale and tasteless, the scallops dish was... I don't even know what that was. Some huge scallops thrown in with some veggies. Between all, the worst one was the tuna poke. The server said it was a new dish and recommended it. That's why we had ordered it. It was built actually like a Tuna tartar with very little tuna and incredible amount of avocado and jalapeños. I love, love spicy food but I don't think humans can eat that much spice :) so I am not exaggerating my response. We didn't finish any of the food except the calamari because they were so bad but we had to eat something with our drinks and the only barely edible one was the calamari. We asked our server 2 or 3 times about talking to a manager about the food. We said ""we are ready to pay for this food but it's awful so at least we would like to express this to a manager"" She did try to get a manager and for 45 minutes she shouldn't get this little guy to our table. The manager (little guy in his 20's probably) would look at our table from the computer he was doing something on,  and would never come to talk to us. I work in restaurants and his attitude was unacceptable. The white wine we ordered was off. I am a head bartender at a very upscale restaurant. I know how food and wine are supposed to taste and I know how a floor manager is supposed to respond to a guest's request to talk to him. He might not have time at that moment, he might be overwhelmed but in over an hour we were there at least he could do was to acknowledge us. Our server dropped our check and after we paid she didn't even come to the table again, said thank you, sorry or a goodbye. It's a shame and a mistake. I will tell everyone in the industry this story. Please don't waste your time, money or peace going to this place. It's also super super loud (I almost lost my voice before the game. Ha!) and tables are on top of each other. We couldn't even get to our table without hitting the table next to us and that table's menu fell on me a couple of times.

5.0,11/5/2018,"Had a great experience here recently. Walking around the city with my fiancé when we found ourselves outside Madison Square Garden. We are from the West Coast and wanted to see the famous building. There was a game that night and we were getting hungry and decided on this place because it was close, like across the street! Because of the game and it being a weekend night, the place was packed. They have a beautiful and fairly large bar, so we decided to put our name in for a table with the hostess and have a drink. We were a little worried that we might miss a music set we had tickets for a little later in the evening downtown but the manager Dave overheard our concerns and assured us they would get us set-up as soon as they could. He even passed us at the bar and took time to tell us he did not forget about us. We really appreciated that and soon enough we had our table.

1.0,10/24/2018,"Probably the worst dining experience I have ever had. To sum it up maybe the waitress was new. In a nutshell, never got an appetizer I ordered, apps,kids meals and my entree all came out at once. My wife s entree never came. The waitress came back over when we were finished, apologized, and asked if she would like it to go. Really? Please message me and I will give you the entire horror story. Could not make chocalate milk for my kids, no burrata as advertised, claimed to have run out earlier. Really, on a Sunday 2 hrs after opening? 100 dollar meal for chicken parmigiana, no sides, kids penne with butter and kids pizza. Was supposed to be a margarita pizza! Looked and tasted like an Ellis microwave meal. Caprese salad, 2 milks, I draft beer and a house glass of wine. 100 bucks, really? Not even an apology from the manager. Walking out the hostess asked how was everything? Just told her the part about my wife s entree not coming out. She said, wow that s messed up! I wouldn't t eat here again. That was from the hostess!!!!! Terrible, terrible experience. Cheap I am the furthest thing from. Funny thing, my wife was at MSG for a concert tonight across the street with her mom. They couldn't t give her a meal to get her in there again! It s a shame especially because I am in the customer service industry. I know how to treat people correctly.

The calamari was good, but once again the sauce was sooo sweet! I liked the fact a got a free glass of prosecco...that was a bonus...especially that it had 2$$ when in reality it should've been $$$.

3.0,8/28/2018,"""It's ok"". At best it's a good place to stop by for a drink before going to penn station. For food they need to put a lot more effort into their presentation and flavor. I got the gluten free penne pasta w basil and tomato sauce, very plain very bland. If they even threw fresh basil leaves on it or something, it would be so much better. Maybe give more cheese on it, or add some meat into it. It's lacking flavor and taste. I would come here again but not go out of my way.",0,0,0,Kiki W.,"Manchester, VT",136,54,10

4.0,7/12/2018,"Came with my cousin to celebrate my birthday. This is a nice restaurant surprisingly situated near Madison Square Garden (an area I've generally associated with Sbarro and street meat). They didn't have a table ready for us, so we ended up having drinks at the bar. The bartenders are knowledgeable, friendly, attentive, and can make solid drinks.Once seated outside, we ordered our food, including a burrata and heirloom tomato salad, a roasted beet salad, fried zucchini, fettuccine with crab meat and tomatoes, and tiramisu, along with a bottle of Sancerre (ironic choice for an Italian restaurant). Service was a little spotty, pretty attentive most of the time, but would take long to clear plates (we were sitting at a pretty small table).For starters, the burrata and heirloom tomato salad was delicious; the acidity of the tomatoes paired well with the sweetness of the burrata, which was firm, not runny. The fried zucchini was a real treat as well, and came with a fresh aioli. The beet salad came with greens, cauliflower and blue cheese (along with shrimp we decided to add on, which costs extra), and was filling without being too dense. The fettuccine was cooked al dente and tasted fine with the tomatoes and crab, but was a dish that required a little extra Parmesan for it to be palatable. For dessert, the tiramisu came with blueberries, strawberries and chocolate sauce, interesting additions that didn't take away from the richness of the main dessert. Lastly, the Sancerre was just okay, not a bad wine by any means, but not worth the price of the bottle.Overall, there are good, even great, things to have at Lugo, and it's a trendy restaurant in an area where you'd least expect it. I'd go back if given the opportunity. Having said that, be prepared to spend $$$ and be sure to consult other reviews so you know what to order and maximize your experience.",1,0,0,Sam W.,"Weehawken, NJ",314,111,187

The food is usually good as well (besides their Margarita Pizza which tastes like cafeteria cheese pizza). I write this review in dismay because the service at this restaurant is very poor compared to it's other aspects. I find the waitstaff to be extremely preoccupied and inattentive to their tables. I came here with 3 friends and we ordered apps, dinners, desserts and of course alcohol. Needless to say our bill was very high (which was not a problem). However, our waitress handed us our bill before asking if we wanted anything else. How about dessert? Another drink? She took it upon herself to hand us the bill while our dinner plates were still on the table. I was absolutely mortified. And yes, we did order desserts and additional drinks. While dealing with our situation, I glanced over at the table next to us (who also had the same waitress). He was a single elderly man and had just received his dinner. However, he did not have any silverware to eat. Not one waitstaff came over to this man. He waited 6 minutes with a hot delicious chicken parmesan in front of him until I, MYSELF got up and told the bus boy he's been waiting for silverware. The waitress was no one in sight.

The manager Daniel had to come over and verify the yelp redemption - no problem. Shrimp appetizer is amazing! The dirty plates just remained on our table for about 15 minutes until our entrees came out though... we attempted to get someone's attention to clear them but no one looked our way. Oh well. Our pasta entrees were cooked perfectly too, delicious with a nice glass of red wine. We each ordered a second glass of red. Our waitress was chatting with the table next to us for 10 minutes, struggling to open their bottle of wine (someone else had to come help her...), and we were still waiting for our glass of wine. I watched her finally head back to the bar, expecting her to grab our wine. Instead she stops to chat to the manager. I then had to flag her down and ask to just cancel the wine all together because it was taking way too long.

That was our big mistake, maybe we should have asked  for assistance to move tables but again the place was empty and it was 4pm. The hostess cane huffing over as if we had committed a cardinal sin. She asked us ""who told you you could do this"" and began to berate us and told us the table was reserved. Umm again.. 4pm. She finally relented and stormed off. About an hour later (no one showed up for this reserved table) we had on additional guest come by for a beer. At this point the hostess comes back over and made me feel like I had lit her house on fire. She was spitting venom at me, totally completely embarrassing me in front of clients. In all my adult years I have never been treated so disrespectfully at a restaurant. She was so awful i lost sleep over it. This woman needs anger Management if she is going to be dealing with the public. Also, no one ever showed up for that ""reserved table"" he whole time we were there.

The only thing I wasn't crazy about was they put peas in my entree. My boyfriend ordered the lobster ravioli which he said tasted really good, but it was lukewarm. He didn't send it back, just because we were in a small rush. Overall I think I would definitely go back! I would recommend to friends/ family.",0,0,0,Rachel -.,"Smithtown, NY",0,49,0

With this as a prelude, I'll warn anyone looking to sit down for a meal during dinner hours when there is a game or event at msg to go elsewhere. It becomes chaos with plenty of walk ins and the staff as nice as they are can't seem to handle it. We had a particularly bad experience tonight, promised a table and left hanging with young kids, and once sat we were five on a four top.

2.0,10/17/2017,"Penn Station remains a very central and terrible place to try and find good food. The one of the only good thing for Lugo Cucina is the location. It's attached to the Penn station at 1 Penn Plaza. It really depends on when you go. Up until around 7:30 pm, between the commuter and Madison Square Garden events. During Happy hour, it is incredibly noisy. You have to literally shout at each other even at tables of four. The service staff really stretched to the limit and makes you regret picking it if you are in a mood for conversation. Miraculously, even for a Friday night, around 7:30pm it starts to slow down including at the bar and you can actually have a normal dinner. Overall, the décor works for the Italian restaurant. Food is below average, boring in taste and not well prepared. Service has many flaws and is intrusive and prices are high for what you get.

My lunch mate got the sausage pasta and said it was fantastic. This place was his recommendation as he comes here for a lot of business meetings and he loves everything he's gotten.

The burrata cheese was NOT soft, it was a little harder than mozzarella cheese. Very disappointed Then came the entrees: Three of us ordered the spinach ravioli...DO NOT ORDER THESE. Every ravioli on every single dish was hard as a rock, and came with little to no sauce.  I ordered the gnocchi with crabmeat in a truffle sauce, which the sauce was basically a pink cream sauce...no truffle.Finally we ordered dessert...every coffee was cold...when we asked for hot fresh coffee we were told ""we are currently out of coffee but we can make a cappuccino"". Are you kidding??? The dessert came out...but in segments. The people who ordered the cheesecake, there's came out first; 5 minutes later, my apple pie; 5 minutes later, two tartuffo's; 10 minutes later, a ""assortment of cookies"" which was 6 pieces of biscotti.

Thank goodness we only ordered one portion to share as it was huge! The calamari was crisp and fresh and served with a tasty tomato dipping sauce.I had the arugula salad with crumbled Gorgonzola and bacon, and some grilled shrimp on the side - delicious! My fellow diners chose meatballs (two massive meatballs - you need to be really, really hungry to get through both!!); pizza - delicious but again too much so he asked to take out the remainder; and pasta with a meaty sauce (a bit heavy but I'm not a pasta fan so not the best judge!)The deserts were obviously home made and very good - apple tart with ice cream, chocolate tartufo (very rich) and I chose lemon sorbet.The ambience is good.

4.0,11/28/2016,"Lugo was always on the backburner as a nice option that's right across the street. I always looked past it in search of the cool, new, interesting places, but a recent work meeting (and other venues proving tricky to book a large group on days' notice) proved to be the right occasion to finally check it out.We were a group of 8 or so and snagging a table for anything under 12 here is a cinch most any day of the week. There's an outdoor area I wish we'd reserved as it was a balmy November night. The restaurant is bright and cheerful, and not particularly stuffy--if not altogether personable. Inside, the room gets pretty boisterous with all the after-work busines groups sipping wine and blowing off steam, and sundry commuters loosening ties at the bar (Lugo is right next to Penn Station). If you're looking for a quiet evening with colleagues/clients, come on the early side or ask for the private area. Otherwise, you're pretty much at the mercy of strangers' mood and drink level. Prices are about $5-10 higher than they ought to be due to location and expense accounts paying for meals, but c'est la vie. If we're being honest, the quality of the food is good enough to merit 4 stars. (I'm sure if the same dishes were $15 a plate in a cash-only joint in the East Village, the place would magically garner an extra star and a have on Yelp). I had the tuna poke (what restaurants are calling their tartare dish now that the poke buzzword gets higher hits). It was generously portioned, fresh, and satisfying. Not too mushy. The perfect appetizer. You can't go wrong with just about any pasta dish and should probably stick to that. They are all competently done. The night I was here they had a pumpkin ravioli special (sadly I didn't get to try it). Orecchiette (sweet sausage, broccoli rabe, pecorino) is my go-to and it was just about right--al dente, not too heavy, and well portioned.If you're out for good pasta, good wine, and dependable service, Lugo is a fine choice in the Penn Station area.",6,3,4,Yan T.,"Manhattan, NY",2506,1716,229

There's even a good selection of wine and cocktails.On this given night, my friend and I ordered identical meals.

The portion is actually quite big, I couldn't finish it myself as an entrée.The foccacia bread offered at the start of the meal is fluffy and delicious.

Don't get me wrong if the food is absolutely delicious I wouldn't find it to be that big of a deal. But I am a decent eater so I kind of hate leaving hungry. Focaccia was brought to the table and the olive oil to dip in was very good. I ordered the spinach raviolis in sage butter sauce. The raviolis were pretty good but the sauce was missing something, pinch of salt? Some pepper? It was a little bland. The other person I was with ordered the gnocchi special with crabmeat in a truffle cream sauce and I thought that had more flavor than mine. I ate my ravioli in probably about 3 mins because they were bite size. I left feeling ok but not full. Our waitress for the rest of the night was ok. Food was ok.

I did enjoy the margherita pizza, but my favorite had to be the Bronx Tale pizza. It had meatballs, ricotta and mozzarella cheeses and sauteed onions. I don't even like sauteed onions, or any onions for that matter, but this pizza was incredible. I found myself craving it for weeks and even months after, and they do takeout orders so if you call ahead its not a problem to order for lunch at work. The pizzas are pretty small, and look more like a flatbread than a pizza, but they could be split with one other person.

I wish mozzarella were of slightly more delicate consistency, however, it was well balanced with the vinegar touch. Highly recommend it.  As main course I ordered linguini with clams in white sauce. I don't know what they do with pasta, but whatever they do - works. Not too many clams, plenty of sauce and perfectly cooked pasta placed Lugo (in my eyes) in the top 5 just for this dish.

Not a pleasant way to start the meal. Sadly, I was also not too impressed with the artichokes. The portion size was small for the price ($11) and the textile kind of fell flat. For the entrees, we got the trofie al pesto with shrimp and the linguine vongole. The trofie was pretty good but it was very dense so I could only finish half. The shrimp was absolutely necessary to add some pizzazz to the dish, otherwise I would have been eating a giant bowl of pure carbs. The linguine was a better mix of flavors but nothing to write home about (but definitely something to Yelp about :). The service was pretty non-attentive and the bus boys who brought our our dishes practically dropped them on the table in front of us. Not impressed and the prices ($26-27 for each pasta dish) are definitely not justified.",1,1,0,Julie L.,"New York, NY",62,94,112

4.0,2/16/2013,"My boyfriend surprised me dinner here for Valentine's Day after work. Too fancy for my style, but I guess once in a while to an expensive restaurant wouldn't hurt. We ordered the Ceasar Salad and Calamari as our appetizers and a meatball pizza for us to share. Loved the appetizers but I wished they cut the lettuce leaves for the salad and not over-salt the calamari. The meatball was delicious though! We both thought it was the best pizza we ever had. We ended the night with gelato (Pistachio is my favorite!). Our food came out pretty fast, which we were surprised.What I didn't like was the service. When we first arrived to the restaurant, the hostess nicely greeted us. The manager then asked me if I wanted them to hold onto my coat and bag. I politely said no, and according to my boyfriend, he caught the manager giving a nasty look. Wow, really? In addition, our waiter didn't really come by to check up on us. He just casually comes in to refill our glasses with water, that's about it. One of the waitresses gave us a nasty look when she  set up the stand for our pizza. I get it - no one wants to work on Valentine's Day, but still at least be sweet and polite to us.

1.0,8/23/2012,"A friend and I stopped in on a Wednesday evening in late summer. I had to catch a train in ~1.5 hrs., so we figured this time frame would allow us to get one more enjoyable meal in the city. As a foodie who willingly and eagerly pays more money for better food, I was very disappointed in Lugo. I've never experienced a highly-rated restaurant that was more of a let-down in multiple ways.Bread Basket: 2 out of 5The bread offering for two people consisted of two ciabatta rolls and two strips of focaccia. Both were dry in the overcooked sense; the ciabatta was notably missing the soft, doughy interior with the rustic crust, and the focaccia was borderline stale. In addition, it was oily, the herbs did not impart any flavor, it was pretty bland.Scallops Al Cavofiore (cauliflower purée, black truffle, and crispy prosciutto): 2 out of 5At prima facie, the presentation was pretty and I excitedly anticipated the first bite. Upon closer inspection, the dish seemed on the small size for a $28.00 for a dinner portion. Three regular-sized scallops sat in a shallow purée, accompanied by six or so tiny cauliflower crowns, or nibs, and three pieces of prosciutto. Putting the surprisingly small size of this /main course/ aside, I eagerly cut a piece of scallop, scooped some purée and its brown jus sauce accompaniment. Sand! Yuck. I chewed through the grain of sand into a lukewarm piece of scallop. The sauce was no saving grace; it was under-seasoned and almost tasteless. I tried one of the cauliflower nibs, which was sadly cold and void of flavor. The prosciutto crisps were almost dripping fryer oil, yet they too were room temperature. If the description of the entree did not include truffles, I would not have known they were included; the little black mounds of ""truffles"" did not taste like anything and it was quite strange. Having tried all of the distinct elements, I was starving, so I opted to salt the hell out of everything to make it more palatable. Afterward, I was still hungry and so much so that I dipped into the bread basket, even though the bread was not worth it! Ugh.Overall, I was disappointed, and ended up purchasing a protein bar and some trail mix from a vending machine in Penn Station to hold me over on my way home.",3,2,2,Paige B.,"Philadelphia, PA",169,107,364

When our drinks were delivered, they were NOT dry martinis, but very dirty martinis. She disappeared before we could send them back. Waited several minutes and knew we weren't going to see her for who knows how long as she was busy taking care of the other tables. I got up and asked the hostess if we could get some help. Another waitress appeared, we explained what went wrong. Rather than apologizing, taking the drinks away and getting us what we ordered... with an attitude, she said she would have to talk to the bartender.  Things went from bad to worse. The manager, I assume, ultimately brought our drinks... without an apology until I complained about the service and we then got MORE attitude and an insincere apology. This time there were no olives in the martinis and the drinks seemed to be watered down....... I could go on. We asked for our check and left. Another restaurant would have bent over backwards to make us happy.

So, then it's NOT room temp.  It makes a HUGE difference in both the taste and the tolerance of the dish.  Then, halfway through, because of the way the tray that held the apps was positioned, everything fell off and onto my lap.  Yep.  So, wee didn't get to finish.  I was offered another glass of Prosecco on the house.  I'll take it, of course.The meals arrive and my skirt steak, although covered in mache, tomatoes, braised onions, and regular onions, was very tasty.  My friend consumed her papperdelle with voraciousness, so I guess it was good.No desserts, apparently.  Not that I would have ordered any.",2,2,2,Tamar D.,"San Francisco, CA",98,533,172

The server was attentive and brought out our appetizers, food and wine quickly but without making us feel rushed. Their wine selection is small but accessible, and if you're in the mood to experiment they serve most wines by the quarter carafe, which is a nice touch. Like other reviewers have mentioned, their meatballs are GREAT. Two big meatballs in a nice bright marinara sauce. Not too bready, not too soft, just really good. For dinner our table ordered a pizza and two pasta dishes. I got the pappardelle with bolognese. I thought the sauce was done nicely, but I did think their home-made pappardelle was a bit too thick. The linguine con vongole was not as good as my mom makes it, but one of the better versions I've had at a restaurant. Their pizza is very nicely done, nice chewy crust, garlicky, and good cheese.

3.0,12/1/2009,"It's hard to find good food served fast round by the Penn Plaza office so I was pleased to be taken to Lugo. A nice, airy restaurant with a modern European feel and a friendly, efficient welcome boded well.The food was decent enough throughout, some nice modern takes on traditional dishes, but there was nothing outstanding and a few of the dishes were simply a step too far from tradition. I was disappointed that our server, who had originally sounded knowledgeable about the dishes soon ran out of real knowledge and did not respond well when found to be lacking.That apart, decent food, nice atmosphere, fast service and close to the office. I will go again.",2,0,1,martin c.,"San Carlos, CA",72,236,1
4.0,10/23/2009,"I used to work in 1 Penn Plaza, and Lugo was a convenient happy hour spot- one of our favorites. I have shut down that place many tiems and made good friends with the manager and waitresses. It's a little on the pricey side, but the wine is excellent, the vodka tonics are strong, the pizzas are crispy, and it's an interesting crowd. For a nice restaurant, there are always creepy, hopelessly drunken middle-aged men hanging out at the bar, at all hours. I guess Lugo attracts these weirdos because it's in close proximity to the trains in Penn Station. They are more funny than scary, and these drunks always end up making their way to our table. We end up with a pretty motley crew by closing! Lugo always makes for a good time :)",1,0,0,Suzanne G.,"New York, NY",98,259,5
3.0,8/4/2009,"Was taken out here a while back for something I can't remember, but I passed by today and realized that I'd been here before. There were about 5 of us that went so we got a wide variety of appetizers ranging from calamari to artichokes (which i don't particularly like) to start.I don't quite remember what everyone else ordered because the bulk were pasta dishes, but I know that one friend ordered seared tuna and I went with the veal scallopini. I don't want to say that I made the best order, but I definitely did, though everything looked more than appetizing.There wasn't much room left for dessert once everybody was finished so we finished off our drinks and went on our way.What took away a star from my rating for Lugo Caffe was the service. It wasn't necessarily mean, but seemed a bit indifferent and neglectful of us. The drink orders took quite a while to get there, and naturally they forgot a couple of them, one of which was obviously mine. It could have just been a busy day, but I won't know for sure unless I make a return trip, which I'm considering. I guess I'll do a follow-up if I do, if not somebody let me know if it's a common occurrence, thanks.",0,0,0,Jeffrey D.,"Manhattan, NY",97,48,1
2.0,6/17/2009,"A friend and I went here for dinner on a week night.  I give one star for the cute and spacious interior and an additional star for the friendly staff.  I actually feel bad for giving this place only two stars because our waitress was so sweet and even gave us a complimentary drink.  We ordered salads that were nothing to write home about and pastas for the main course.  My spinach ravioli was awful -- very bland with a combo of soft and hard textures like part of it was undercooked.  I sent it back.  Our waitress was kind enough to give me what my friend was having, I believe a pasta bolognese, and we both agreed that it was just ok.  I definitely didn't think it was worth the $20 price tag but if it had been $12, maybe I would have been happier.  We also both agreed that we wouldn't be back for dinner.  However, since the space is so cute, I would be willing to try the pizza for lunch or come back just for dessert and coffee.  Sorry Lugo Caffe - I tried to like you!",0,0,0,M H.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,13,0
4.0,6/4/2009,"I give this place 4 stars because it impressed my clients.  For yelpers (on a date or otherwise, see below...)Yeah, so I had clients to impress, and they preferred a restaurant close to Penn Station.  This is a challenge people, as I'm sure you're all aware, there is very little quality in the area, it's tourist crap left and right.  So, what to do?  Turn to Yelp of course... and this seemed to be the safest bet.They are open early for breakfast, serve lunch starting at 11:30, and have a pretty good cross section of items on the menu.  Meat lovers will be happy, vegetarians will be happy, drinkers will be happy.  You've got your bases cover.  Plus 1 Penn Plaza is literally across 33rd street from Penn Station (close to 8th Ave side) so easy to reach.  Another plus is there's outdoor seating, which was starting to get packed around noon.  For hard-core foodies, and yelpers, I'd say this place is really 3-star rating.  It's generic italian food, with a little bit of flare, and decent waiter service.  I mean it was certainly edible, but no culinary delight.  Also, I would not really recommend the place for a date, as there are no romantic corners, it's bright, and open...  Also price-wise it seemed they just inflated the prices to please the business set who want to pay a little more.  That said it really has the perfect pricing for clients, a little overpriced is important, but not too much to make it ridiculous!Long story short, this place will totally impress out-of-towners, but for yelpers, you probably already know all the good spots already!",2,1,1,Sean S.,"Manhattan, NY",757,1661,36

4.0,12/21/2008,"After walking an hour in the cold, searching for a good place to eat near penn station that wasn't packed, all while being pelted in the face by hail, Lugo Caffe was a welcoming sanctuary. As an appetizer I couldn't help but try the gnocchi with truffle oil, since those are basically my two favorite things and I could only imagine the possibilities of the ultimate combo. When the dish arrived, the so-called ""gnocchi"" looked and tasted like polenta, but call it what you will, it was still amazing. As an entree I had the chicken with sauteed spinach and garlic - I never order chicken at a restaurant, because its such a simple dish, but this one was calling my name - the waiter also confirmed that it was a good choice. I was with my mom, who got the pork chop: also delicious. The pizza also looked fabulous but I will have to try that next time. The waitstaff was also delightful and did not rush you through the meal at all - we split tiramisu for dessert - which was ok...I'd skip it next time. And there will be a next time. Very unexpectedly satisfied.",0,0,0,Lauren S.,"New York, NY",7,35,0
3.0,12/18/2008,"Lugo Caffe, the recent overhaul of Tupelo Grill by the same owners (and owners of Lugo Menswear), is a respite from the choke-worthy crap that saturates this armpit area of Manhattan. The food is New Italian, and they've successfully accommodated the needs of their staple clientele--douche bag business men--because it's swarming with them. But no worries, you can easily ignore them by getting a seat facing the wall and focusing on the quality fare in front of you. Or, go at 2:30 in the afternoon and you'll have ample room to spread out amidst a mostly empty restaurant. The food is very good, and although not spectacular, its lack of pretension helps make it palette pleasing. They offer an adequate charcuterie and cheese option, which I've opted for each of the three times I've gone, and though neither are something that would be deserving of individual accolades, it's good enough to have time and time again. The wine list is accommodating to the afternoon drinker, with glass, carafe, and bottle options. I haven't delved into the full list much, but I have ordered a few bottles and they have been good, and competitively priced. I've also opted for a simple entree when I've gone--cherry tomato spaghetti. I think they do this simple dish really well, allowing the sweetness of the tomatoes to come out, and using ample amounts of olive oil and garlic without creating offending olfactory experiences later in the office for your co-workers. The portion is well sized, and I finish it every time. The desserts are more-or-less standard Italian desserts. The cheesecake is good, with its lemon accents, but the tiramisu is below-average, with the lady fingers being a bit over-soaked, and thus lacking any crumb or structure, and chocolate is lost to a bit-to-strong espresso element. The by-the-glass dessert wine options are unimpressive, and I don't remember if the by-the-bottle options are any better. But, if you want some moscato d'asti with your cheesecake, it's only $7 for a glass. For a show at MSG, or if you are in the neighborhood (my office was at 30th and 8th) than this place is great option. And although being a bit overpriced, it offers enough options to please a pretty diverse crowd (obviously they need to like Italian), and has convinced me to return three times.",4,3,2,Adam D.,"Brooklyn, NY",45,37,0
3.0,11/9/2008,"""Lugo Caffe is located at 1 Penn Plaza? Interesting address. Isn't that right across the street from Madison Square Garden?"" I wondered. Sure enough, after doing a quick restaurant search for ""Lugo Caffe"" on menupages.com, my greatest fear was confirmed: 1 Penn Plaza sat on 33rd Street between 7th and 8th Avenues...Directly across the street from Madison Square Garden. Lugo Caffe, Midtown South/Chelsea's newest Italian, was conceived in one of the most random and challenging neighborhoods for a restaurant of its caliber. T.G.I.Friday's, locally-owned deli's, and fast food joints lined the streets and took center stage...Until now. After my mother and I exited our taxi on 33rd Street, it took me a couple of moments to locate 1 Penn Plaza. As we approached the large office building, I saw Lugo Caffe situated on the ground floor. What stood out like a desert oasis was a space that had me at ""hello."" Upon entering the restaurant, I found the interior divided in to three rooms; a bar, main dining area, and a semi secluded private dining space. Artfully displayed just above the boisterous open bar were the words ""La Dolce Vita,"" which means ""the sweet life"" in Italian. The space felt so large for a New York City restaurant; perhaps it was because of the grand twenty-foot-tall ceilings and walls of windows that overlooked Lugo's very own vast outdoor patio. Rooms were divided by fully-stocked wine racks appearing to be suspended mid-air. The usage of butcher block tables, subway tiles and art deco-style lamps, fans and a splash of Vespa turquoise-blue was the perfect combination of ""brasserie"" meets ""modern Italian chic.""Although my mother and I arrived at 6:30p.m. (which is considered quite early), Lugo was already hopping with both happy hour and dinner patrons. Impressive, especially for a restaurant that had not even been open yet for a month! We were seated promptly and given a basket filled with two large pieces of bread, a bowl of infused olive oil and food and drink menus. Mom and I each ordered a martini, and began perusing what to choose for our appetizers and entrees.To begin, we chose to split three appetizers. Brussels sprouts are my new obsession, so when I placed this particular order, I suppose I wasn't expecting these emerald green morsels to arrive chilled. The Classic ""Caesar"" dressed with romaine, parmigiana, a bitter-creamy lemon dressing and homemade croutons was one of the best versions of the salad that I've tasted. Our third appetizer was the Mozzarella Carozza, which was sliced cheese lightly fried and served with stewed baby tomatoes. I enjoyed this dish, however, I thought that the batter surrounding the mozzarella tasted more like tempura than traditional ""carozza"" (an exterior so lightly crisp, one may not know that it's fried). My mother even mentioned that this dish reminded her of the mozzarella ""sticks"" one can order at sports bars. I was horrified!In keeping the spirit of sharing, we decided to split two entrees. The homemade ravioli filled with velvety ricotta cheese, spinach and topped with a simple dollop of stewed fresh tomatoes and chopped basil was divine. Besides the light dusting of freshly grated parmigiana cheese added table side, I, the self-professed salt/pepper addict, had one of my very first ""douse free"" experiences. Conveniently, we ordered a Margherita pizza to sop up all of the extra pasta sauce. Think authentic Italian pizza: Thin, lightly charred crust; chunky, bright red tomato sauce; homemade mozzarella cheese and finished with fresh basil leaves. Delicioso!To end our meal on a sweet note, Mom and I split the profiteroles and an order of ricotta cheesecake. I was surprised to find that the profiteroles were filled with custard instead of (what I thought was traditional) gelato. The cheesecake was nice, but it would have been much tastier had the crust been thicker.Lugo Caffe is the most welcome addition to the neighborhood surrounding Madison Square Garden! For a restaurant that has just been open for a month now, I found that it has very few ""kinks"" to work out. The food, service and space were lovely and I look forward to returning.",2,0,1,Lindsay F.,"New York, NY",376,277,184
4.0,10/31/2008,"My boss and I went today for lunch and we were both impressed. The restaurant is open and airy, elegant but not fussy. The menu has lots of nice appetizer and small plate options, broken into a few different categories (meat/cheese/vegetable plates, hot appetizers like gnocchi, salads, pizzas, etc.), plus pasta dishes and meat entrees. We didn't look at the wine list, but it seemed to be extensive. Our server was knowledgeable and described each section of the menu - you wouldn't want all that detail if you'd been before, but since it was our first time, the background was nice. We both ordered a tri-colore salad (a generous portion served cold, crisp, and lightly dressed with a pinenut vinaigrette and shaved Parmesan) and a pizza. My boss got the margherita, and she said it was delicious, with very fresh basil. I had sopresetta on mine. The light, chewy crust was just right, with crisp edges, and the size was perfect for one. The presentation was nice, too - it was an oblong shape, served on a thin wood plate.The bar area is large and welcoming - I'd definitely go there for a drink after work. In this location, I doubt Lugo will be a destination for many people, but before a show at MSG, or if you're looking for a place for a nice lunch or quick dinner after work, it's definitely a place to check out.",0,0,0,Catherine O.,"Seattle, WA",0,7,1
3.0,10/19/2008,"I was so excited that this place opened up just in time for the Madonna concert. You know whenever you have to go to MSG the main problem is, ""where the hell do you eat?!"" Let me tell you, Lugo Caffe solves that problem. It was an unusually warm October night, so my friends and I sat outside on the patio. No, there's not much to look at, but they kind of enclosed the area with green and it's nice. We did have a drink inside and while the decor feels like a cheaper pastis knock-off it's still pleasant. The entire staff was warm and friendly. We were greeted by three (count them: THREE) hostesses and one very friendly bartender. Once seated, our Australian server was so sweet and guided us beautifully through the menu. The four of us decided to let the ""Lugo Salumeria Tasting"" ($25.00) to start. It includes two salumi, two formaggi and three assaggini.  We chose the sopressata (hot dried cured salami), Cacciatorini (dried pork salami), Pecorino (my favorite cheese in the world), constant bliss (cow's milk cheese from vermont), roasted beets and roasted cauliflower. I could have easily been satisfied with that and a glass of wine and been on my happy little way. All were delicious! Well, I don't eat four-legged animals, so I can't testify for the meat. BUT, we didn't stop there. We ordered mains.  I had the Wild Salmon (very smart to put ""wild"" already in there so I don't have to ask) with broccoli rabe, potatoes and manilla clams. It was cooked to my requested med-rare temp and had a rich flavor. I can't remember what everyone else got. I think my friend, Kim, got the cod and I'm pretty sure the other friend also had the salmon and the fourth person in our party did pasta. We all agreed the food was solid.We got a bottle of the Nero D'Avola (sedara 2006) which was priced at $38.00. It wasn't great, but definitely drinkable. And you know, you get what you pay for. All in all, I wouldn't go to this area of the town to eat here. I will defiantly go back if I have an event to attend at MSG. I'm sure they will do well. It has no other competition. The service alone would make me remember it fondly.",2,0,1,Jennifer N.,"New York, NY",73,166,3
