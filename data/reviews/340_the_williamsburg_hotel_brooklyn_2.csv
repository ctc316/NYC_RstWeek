1.0,4/28/2019,"I went for tea today at the Williamsburg hotel with a group of ladies. I must admit, I wasn't pleased at all with the establishments service. The wait time for our tea along with the pastries was HORRIBLE!!! I didn't feel warm welcomed. I couldn't wait to leave fast enough. I don't really know what the problem was?!? To my understanding the manager didn't want to take part in the vouchers that were purchased by the group...However, regardless of the vouchers at the end of the day.  Everybody's money is green. Had they acted right, you would have seen a lot of $$ being spent. But we kindly paid our tea tax & tips...left and went to another fine place for lunch...I wont recommend or revisit again!!!",0,0,0,Meshell C.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0
1.0,4/28/2019,"Want to high tea Saturday with family and while the staff was excellent and the sweets and sandwiches tasty and fresh the place itself is abysmally laid out .   The elevators are so small that there's not even room to change your mind!  One of the three elevators has been out of order for three months. NOT ACCEPTABLE.  You need them to get to the bathrooms.  I waited 20 minutes to go down one level and then another ten minutes to get in to the loo.  NOT ACCEPTABLe.  HOW did they get a liquor license with that set up?  Also, no freight elevator and huge laundry carts had to vie for space in the tiny elevators.  NOT ACCEPTABLE,",0,0,0,Patricia D.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,0

Although we are a party of 19 (and we had reservations) The manager Grant, was exceedingly difficult about redeeming our pulsed deal (again....we mentioned it while making reservations), stating ""Only 3 certificates per party, we really don't make any money off the pulsed deal"" (again.....we mentioned this while making reservations and your profit margin is not my concern)! The tea was cold by the time the pastries came out (it was apx a 40 minute wait between the tea delivery and the food delivery). The only reason they earned 2 stars is because of the staff (besides the snarky hostess and the manager) was fairly pleasant and I enjoyed the live music..we've opted to salvage the afternoon and head to another spot for lunch.",0,0,0,Stephanie D.,"Bronx, NY",3,91,81
1.0,3/30/2019,"The bartenders are horrendous. My boyfriend came up to order drinks and he waited a very long while because they would just look at him and ignore him and walk away. He went back to our table after being treated so rudely and I took my turn, figuring they'd pay more attention to a female ordering drinks. I did get my order after 15 whole minutes (the bar was not busy at all at this time) because one of the bartenders completely ignored me and the other one who finally acknowledged me kept me waiting 15 minutes because in between making my drinks he kept going over to the other side of the bar to flirt with a group of women. This happened thrice before I got my card back to sign the receipt. Will never come back here. This is a place to go if you really want to kill your night.",0,0,0,Geraldine S.,"Elmhurst, NY",0,2,0

1.0,3/21/2019,"If I could, I would give this hotel a negative star. I had my wedding party stay at this hotel and aside from various guests with multiple incorrect charges on their cards,but on the way to the afterparty of my wedding, the elevator got stuck for over an hour. Needless to say, there was no after party after that incident. Despite complaints, the hotel did nothing to acknowledge this disaster. Accommodations in the hotel were not what they sold us. They also told us there was a hotel garage with a valet. I would steer clear of this hotel. There are many other hotels in Brooklyn nearby I would choose that are far better. Whatever you do, DO NOT have your wedding block at this hotel. They are NOT equipped to handle it. There were many mistakes made even leading up to the wedding date. Unfortunately we couldn't change the block and even worse it never got better only worse with their service. Elevators were terrible and the fact that it got stuck was not a surprise considering it took an abnormally long time during regular hours, when not busy. The point, go stay somewhere else. We will never get our wedding day back again and that's upsetting. But anyone who reads this will hopefully not suffer the way we did.

Missed my after party of my OWN wedding after being stuck in their elevator for more than an hour with my uncle passed out from claustrophobia and had to be sent to hospital and no one in this hotel gave a crap !! They did not do right by us and try to comp our room. They didn't even come check on us to make sure we were okay! Zero. Nothing. It was my WEDDING NIGHT!!!! If you want to see more of the night see Melanie M. Review below, to see the rest of the horrible service and treatment this hotel displayed! I would NEVER ever recommend you stay here. Also when we arrived our safe was broken and the light in the wall was hangin off that you could see through the wall.

1.0,3/17/2019,"I  came into the hotel and to get drink and was told about the roof top. So went to downstairs bar and attempted to go upstairs with the GF. We were stopped stating the we were not allowed to go upstairs. The doorman looked at us and stated we had to spend minimum of $500 and get a table if we were going to be allowed upstairs. That was kinda ridiculous but being neighborhood people, who feel more and more alienated by the influx of these types of establishments, that are not for us.The bartender GIO stated that the doorman is kind picky and we can probably get in during the week.  I feel that after he turned us away he let up some younger ""hip"" millennials but that is what they are looking for.  Won't be coming back and will be voting in next zoning board meeting to change rules for these horrible establishments which alienate the locals who have been here for decades.

1.0,3/14/2019,"One star is generous. I am beyond disgusted with the treatment we received here. Enjoyed a beautiful night at a wedding nearby and then went to the hotel where many wedding guests were staying and the afterparty was booked on the roof. Well, from the second we walked in we were met by rudeness from staff only to be magnified when we got stuck in the elevator for over an hour with people from the wedding including the two brides. Not the way you really want to end your wedding night. A few minutes after we got stuck one of the brides uncles passed out from claustrophobia and the heat.  The lax effort of the staff to get us help while we called down and told them someone in the elevator had passed out and was unconcious on the floor. It was beyond hot in there and the air was very thin. Panic set in to many of us around the 10 minute mark and only increased the hotter it became and the less oxygen we had. It was horrifying. After over an hour the fire dept got us out and the man who was passed out was taken to the hospital. Beyond belief, we were met by no hotel personnel and there was no concern at all on their part for our well-being and safety. Zero. Good business practice, not to mention Common decency would dictate that someone from the hotel should have at least pretended they cared if we were okay. They did not. When we took the stairs down to the lobby we saw 2 police officers which comforted me that they would come since we were stuck in the elevator with a man who had passed out. Nope! They were called by front desk because the couple of people from our party who made it up to the roof bought a bottle of grey groose before they knew the rest of the wedding was stuck in the elevator. When they found themselves up there alone they came down to the lobby and the staff called the police on them because they were carrying a closed bottle of grey goose they had bought overpriced AT THE HOTEL. What?!?! I mean I have heard of adding insult to injury but come on now! I emailed the hotel about my concern regarding their LACK of concern for us and the safety of their building. Unfortunately I can not get a response because they have our money so they are done with us.  Anyone in our party who used a credit card there was also overcharged. One person has a mystery $4,500 charge from the hotel. Customer service is zero. Common courtesy unfortunately is zero as well.",1,0,0,Melanie M.,"Hempstead, NY",21,5,0
4.0,3/11/2019,"I'm torn about this hotel. On the one hand, the front desk and the hotel staff were absolutely wonderful. I requested a higher floor when we booked our king terrace room, and they had a top floor room ready for us upon checking in. The hotel is gorgeous, the decor is modern but welcoming and the rooms are decorated beautifully with very comfortable beds. The sleep machine was a great touch, and combined with the provided earplugs helped us sleep through the late night revelry of the nearby music venue. On the flip side, while the aesthetic of the room was great, it lacked basic features to make our stay as comfortable as it could have been. There is only one mirror in the entire room, in the bathroom so it made getting ready to go out super inconvenient, especially with the all glass open concept shower which provides NO privacy and definitely made things a bit awkward sharing the room with my adult daughter. They only provided one washcloth and one hand towel. I wish they had a coffee maker in the room, but the provided coffee in the mornings down at the lobby bar was a nice touch and was available hot and fresh both mornings of our stay. The views of the city are amazing from the terrace, we never went up to the rooftop pool as it seemed to be more of a nightclub and requires special entry. A local friend described it as ""a high pressure swimming situation"" which pretty much took away my desire to check it out. Overall we enjoyed the location and the hotel, and hopefully with enough guest feedback they will make some minor modifications to increase overall comfort and convenience for all their guests.",0,0,0,Dawn D.,"Seattle, WA",2,34,1
1.0,3/9/2019,"A beautiful hotel in a prime location. Unfortunately, that's it. The rooms are small, the rooftop is about the size of an nyc apartment.

3.0,2/18/2019,"So, I need to begin my review by saying, my boyfriend and I had a great Valentine's weekend here, but the 3 stars are accurate in my opinion - I've walked by here many times and even had high tea at Harvey once and was impressed with the funky hipsterfic vibe - so when we decided to have a staycation for Vday, I thought it would be nice. I was impressed by the pics and booked a Queen Terrace room. They aren't cheap but it sounded like a high quality experience - I requested a bath (as they come few and far between) and due to medical reasons I cannot bathe alone (seizure prone) and thought this would be a great opportunity to take a bath with my boyfriend in the room - the hotel wrote me back and said they could not guarantee this but would take note - when I arrived I asked about the bath and they said I would have had to request this long ago, when I said I had, they even saw it in their notes, they apologized and offered a bottle of wine to be sent to our room - that wine never materialized and when I went to ask about it, the person who checked us in had gone. Now the rooms are nice, very well decorated and detailed - the view from the Queen Terraces are remarkable - well worth the price tag really -  the bed was super comfy and the bathroom is funny - its all open so taking a shower is in full view of whoever is in the room, this doesn't bother me but my boyfriend wasn't feeling it - the toilet has more privacy behind a sliding door but we couldn't get it to shut all the way and because the bathroom itself has no door, all your toilet business is in full volume to whoever is in the room - not really romantic haha - so just an FYI...Also, there is no complimentary coffee machine in the room, which for the price tag, I would expect at least a place to make hot water and some tea or coffee...supposedly they have coffee in the lobby in the morning but we couldn't find it.We didn't partake in room service or anything at Harvey but we had a great experience at the water tower bar...We booked this hotel, mostly because we like the bars in the area so as we were heading out for a drink, the manager of the Water Tower was on the elevator with us and he was telling us we should come back for a cocktail - we said we were gonna come back after dinner and check it out and he informed us that it was more of a nightclub then and that we may like it better earlier - when we came back around 7, we were told there was a 40 min wait but just as we were about to leave he saw us and said, give me 10 mins - it was really nice and magical, we just had one cocktail but the view and vibe up there is remarkable. Later when we got back from dinner - around 10:30pm, the bass from the nightclub was intense - we were on the 7th floor and even tho they give you a sleep mask, ear plugs, a sound machine, nothing could drown out the bass that went till about 4:30am on a Saturday...just a warning...my dude slept right through it but it kept me up. Few other notes, the elevators are hella slow...and sometimes it would skip our floor, I think they are haunted haha - but it was a minor annoyance...I wanted to keep the robe that was in the room, it was soooo nice but for $100, not that nice haha - lovely perk tho...I wore it anytime I could during the short stay...the shower albeit it OPEN was also really nice, and the toiletries were hella fancy pants. Overall, I am not sure I would stay here again for some of the reasons I have stated but I would likely return for cocktails at the Water Tower...I'd like to check out the penthouse suite someday and the staff are all really friendly and kind...which is sometimes not the case at a place like this...I'd check it out if I were you, especially if you are younger...I'm 40 and although I go dancing till 4am once a month - I don't like having the club above my head at a hotel...cheers.",1,0,0,Sarah N.,"New York, NY",129,10,1

1.0,2/4/2019,"Update:Immediately after I posted my first 1 star review, someone from the Hotel DMed me and said they'd give me a refund even though it was a third party promoter who organized the event. She directed me to send an offsite email (sketch #1) to someone at the hotel. I emailed him and he asked me to email him my credit card information (sketch #2). It's super dangerous to be sending your CREDIT CARD INFO OVER EMAIL to strangers. He said this was necessary because since a 3rd party organized the event he doesn't have my credit card info. Meanwhile, I checked my bank statement and the charge is from ""Williamsburg Hotel"".. hmmm.I replied and said that no, I would NOT be doing that because it's unsafe and the whole reason we're even talking is because I already got scammed once at your place lol. I said he should mail me a check or PayPal or something secure and safe.After that I got ghosted. This whole experience honestly just made my opinion of this place way worse; were they not satisfied with scamming all of us once? Now they want us all to expose our credit card info to strangers over email?All I can advise and IMPLORE you is that if you DO ever transact with this place, PLEASE PLEASE use a credit card and not debit/cash so you at least have some chance of getting reimbursed by your bank for fraud when the time comes. My bank was able to help me out finally.And I want to point out after getting ghosted, I messaged the person who initially contacted me on Yelp and told her what happened and that they were only making it worse, and she never replied either.

Found parking on the street (pay attention to street cleaning rules, they are at odd hours overnight depending on where you park). It was slightly confusing when we walked into the hotel, because the lobby wasn't on that floor. After a ride in the elevator, we found the main desk and a hip bar/restaurant/lounge. We got our room key and checked into a quaint spot with superb views of the Manhattan skyline. The bed and linens were plush and clean. Only con was the coldness in the bathroom.

5.0,1/18/2019,A friend recommended coming to the Williamsburg Hotel for high tea and the experience lived up to her recommendation.

1.0,1/4/2019,"Happy 2019, Yelp friends! I think you guys will definitely feel grateful about your countdown after hearing about mine. My group of 14 was waiting on the (beyond ridiculous) line for... AN HOUR AND FORTY MINUTES (1hr 40mins)! We arrived at 8:50, thinking doors open at 9 pm, AND open bar starts at 9 pm as well for only one hour. With pre-purchase tickets, we figured ""even with a line, it should only take 15 minutes max,"" but no! I remember thinking to myself around 11 pm, ""Will we even be inside for the countdown?"" As we finally made our way into the door, here's a list of what I realized: 1) Only one of the four security guards were treating guests like actual human beings. I was shoved through the crowded, slippery staircase. One security guard was letting his friends in, while the line was *literally* down the block and around the corner. 2) MANDATORY coat check? Um, hello? It was not stated on their event page about the coat check pricing, which would've expedited the line significantly. My friend emailed the event organizer the day before to inquire about pricing to know how much exact cash to bring, he responded, ""there will be a small fee."" Thanks for answering our question. Not to mention the chaos when people were looking for their coats afterward. I felt so bad for the three ladies working coat check. 3) By the time we made it into the venue, extremely UNDERWHELMING. We all agreed it looked like a high-school prom. The second floor had a much better ambiance. Of course, by 11:20 the open bar had ended. You would think an experienced venue would be apologetic and understanding to keep the open bar until 12 am because it was clearly their f. up. So we paid $14 per cocktail, though informed it would be $10 if paid by cash (the only good news about our experience).4) Pretty sure there was no official countdown by the venue/DJ. LOL. 5)  Around 1 am, the bathroom by the entrance was CLOSED. I had a better chance of finding a bathroom in Times Square than getting through the crowd by the second bathroom. Such a shame, my friends and I were super excited about this celebration and we've been meaning to visit this hotel for the longest time; Our expectation turned out to be utterly disappointing and embarrassing.",2,0,0,Samantha Y.,"New York, NY",269,172,470
1.0,1/3/2019,"The Williamsburg Hotel touts its glamor and hospitality, but that counts for nothing due to its egregious error and horrifying lack of judgment in doing business with whatever irresponsible planner mishandled the recent New Year's Eve event. I'd say this is the worst event I've been to--if I had even been able to get into the building in the first place. Instead, I, along with the hundreds of hopeful individuals, had to stand in the cold, winter, pouring rain for over an hour with zero assurance we would be able to get into the event. Forget the ""open bar."" Clearly, that was a typo. More like NOPEn bar. But that was the least of our problems when we were stuck in a never-ending line that barely moved and were forced to wait for who knew how long in the freezing rain. Having endured enough of this absurdity, we left (we had arrived at 8:30-9). In doing so, we wasted our valuable time and money on an overpriced event the establishment planned so poorly. This event was clearly a huge scam against so many people, and that is appalling. Everyone was looking forward to this night and the fact that we all paid a lot of money expecting to have fun at a highly anticipated event only to stand miserably in the rain for ages and catch colds is not right (that is obviously an understatement).

At one point in the night, my girlfriend, who wore open toed heels, expressed that her toes were in extreme pain due to the blistering temperatures. Unfortunately for us, the bouncer expressed that it would be only 15 more minutes for the next 45 minutes, and so she tried to battle it out every single time. Thanks to waiting outside, she is now extremely sick and has been ever since waiting for this event. Eventually we made it inside at 10:30PM, just in time to get our $55 dollars worth of waiting for 30 more minutes for check-in and coat check. After being soaked in the rain for an hour and a half, waiting to check our soaked clothes into coat check, then standing in the venue with our soaked outfits because the rain soaked through our coats, we ended up leaving prior to the New Year out of frustration and disappointment. No extended open bar hours were provided and no accommodations were made to even remotely attempt to improve morale of all individuals at this event. We will never consider another experience or night at this hotel, and we will be sure to spread the word about the terrible experience we had to ring in the new year.",6,0,0,Jesse K.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0

It was also cold and raining but they don't control the weather so again, I get it. HOWEVER, what they did have control over is facilitating the line and they sure did a terrible job at that.

I won't get into the rudeness of the doormen and the circus that was the ticket line as that is all well-documented in the other reviews. Give us a refund.

Not only did we miss the open bar promised from 9-10p but we never made it inside (despite being told we'd be let in within the next 5 minutes at 9:20, 9:30 and again at 9:40).We were forced to make other plans after it became clear that we would not be let inside and would be forced to continue standing in the pouring rain.

5.0,1/2/2019,"New Years Eve party (amended): After contacting the Hotel they informed me that the party was hosted through a third party (Dream Hospitality Group) who were in charge of the lines and bar. Not only did they apologize for my inconvenience and promised me they would not be working with the DHG again but they also refund in full for my ticket even though it was purchased through Dream Hospitality Group. I appreciate the good customer service I received and in spite the difficulty getting in the venue itself was very nice.Previously (about Dream Hospitality Group):""I really do not like to complaining however I feel very mislead and disrespected by the event and staff.

Instead, I waited in line in the pouring rain and cold for about an hour and a half getting soaked despite having an umbrella. Being a hotel you should be very familiar with this process and have all of the infrastructure to make the line function smoothly so there is no excuse for how chaotic and slow the line was and for making hundreds of people wait outside in the rain for hours. It's also extremely disappointing that despite knowing about these issues no compensation was offered. I asked a couple bar tenders and managers if there was an extended open bar or drink tickets for us because we had missed it during the time we waited in line. The bar tenders said they didn't know anything and when I found a manager he was not only unhelpful but extremely rude despite my approaching him in  a respectful manner despite my outrage at the situation.""",5,0,0,Samuel J.,"New York, NY",1,2,0
1.0,1/2/2019,I MESSAGED DREAM HOSPITALITY GROUP THE PROMOTION GROUP WHO ORGANIZED THE EVENT BUT WILL WRITE MY REVIEW HERE TOO: I attended your NYE event at the Williamsburg Hotel last night and was incredibly shocked and upset by what I had to experience-It was incredibly poorly organized and managed. The doormen had people waiting for hours in the POURING rain and then continuously screamed at the line GET BACK GET BACK ( no one goes out to get screamed at is if we were criminals in a prison or animals)  -I had to wait an hour to get in and a friend had to wait for an hour and 45 mins in the rain--if we all have tickets then we should have been let in without a delay especially considering the rain made it miserable to wait outside so long- the organizers needed to take into account the fact that waiting for 2 hours in the rain made the experience miserable how could anyone enjoy the new year event when we were all cold wet soaked to the skin and tired-we planned on drinking once we got inside but after the wait we got in at almost midnight and left about 30 minutes later we didnt want to give you any more of our money or stay any longer we were cold wet and exhausted-once inside there was another huge line just to get tickets checked which bottlenecked and was a huge fire hazard as everyone was forced into a narrow passageway--no IDs were checked (Im sure there were tons of underage attendees from just looking at the faces in the crowd) and no security checked bags or clothing for weapons--it seems that the issue was that the event was oversold  too many tickets were sold by Dream Hospitality which is a safety issue because that many ppl should not have been in the venue at one time and unfair to ticketholders who wanted to have a fun new years eve and in fact were forced to wait hours in the rain to later be crammed into an overpacked ballroom littered with cups broken all over the floor and other garbage..My friend and I demand a refund.

The most horrific experience and service in all of my travels (and I travel on a weekly basis for work). Finding a doorman or someone to assist with luggage is a challenging. The staff is lackluster, short and disregarding. The food menu leave so much to be desired...Then consider special events at this location...The hotel charged us $50-$70 for a NYE party. It was to begin at 9. Hundreds of us arrived at 10:00 pm reasonably to find ourselves in a line wrapped around the corner (quite long) for an hour and a half in the pouring rain. Not reasonable rain down pouring hard cold rain. When some attempted to wait in the hotel lobby to stay warm the greeter pushed people away saying they weren't welcome. This was done so in a manner that made it seem it was pleasing and enjoyable for them to do. Almost with smiles on their faces. Some jumped ship and I could here them sadly saying well let's just leave it's too cold. The rest of us waited in the down pouring rain waiting to file into the Williamsburg Hotel Ballroom for almost two hours. We arrived drenched, exhausted and so discouraged. Once inside it was pure chaos! We were barked at and yelled at hotel staff! ""Stand here! Don't move! Get in line!"" Horrific! Then once you got to the ticket line (1 person!!!!! was scanning the tickets) then if they swiped your ticket some got a wrist band right aways while some waited in another line for (1) guy to verify them again. Meanwhile a completely disregarding brunette sat right next to him FaceTiming with someone laughing and talking about all the money the event would bring in. I texted the promoter shows pictures and begged for them to help only to be told the following: ""The hotel staff is doing the best they can"" Then at the end of the night after paying for coat check submitting our coats receiving a number all that standard process we all came out to find out coats on the floor, in piles on the floor or tables. It was pure insanity. The response? The staff yelling at everyone saying ""get back!"" ""Get away from here!"" as people inquired about their coats or attempted to search. My coat was found on the floor stepped on! My friend found her's in a pile on a table. We did have coat check ticket numbers by the way. I will never recommend this hotel to anyone for anything and I will especially share my experience with as many people as I come across.

One afternoon the entire staff rushed into one of the adjacent rooms as one of the guests may have overdosed... it was bizarre. 2) although based on Google maps downtown Manhattan is 3 miles away- you'll be stuck most of the time in traffic if you wanna go to Manhattan and he cost of Uber and Taxi is high so if your primary point is travel and visit Manhattan you might as well pay a little more and be in the city.. 3) the restaurant had great food with exception of the burger that one of my family members ordered- there was a screw in it! She bit into the burger and felt something hard and when she spit it out it was screw! We informed the staff and filed a report. They responded promptly and were nice but it still wasn't enough. I would not recommend eating here! 4) the shower leaked and the entire bathroom got flooded any time we took a shower so it was just not very convenient! 5) the quality of the hotel rooms did not reflect the price... we paid almost 400$/ night but felt like got less qualityIt was hard leaving this recommendation but I just hope my fellow yelpers think twice before staying here!

2.0,9/30/2018,"*High Tea*  I was at the hotel yesterday with friends for their High Tea menu because it's something I used to have and enjoy quite often in Singapore at many of the Hotel restaurants there, it's a nice way to enjoy the afternoon chatting while sampling excellent sweet and savory goodies along with a nice cup of fresh hot tea.  Unfortunately The Williamsburg Hotel's High Tea was a major letdown and extremely disappointing.  For a hotel restaurant you would expect freshly prepared and in-house baked goods.  And if the products aren't made in-house at least be made that day somewhere else.  To start with the hotel lobby, bar and dining area are lovely, inviting, open and comfortable.  The space has a nice feel to it and restaurant is good for large groups since it's so quiet with plenty of space.  The problem is basically the food, which is pretty much what will get me back to the place to dine.  The High Tea arrived on a three tiered platter with three savory tea sandwiches and the upper two tiers were filled with sweets.  The avocado and salmon sandwiches were both very good but the fig conserve sandwich was too sweet and that's all I could taste (don't even know if anything else was in it).  The scone was also good and didn't taste stale or saturated in sugar.  As for the sweets here's my comments:Macaroons: not fresh, hard, most of us did not touch either of them.Donuts: not fresh, hard inside, too sweet.Mini Cinnamon roll: not fresh, hard inside, too sweet.Cream custard cardamon tart: The best sweet item on the plate, fresh, moist and tasty.  Pastry shell was firm and filling was creamy and flavorful.Carrot cake: This was also good but could have less sugar - too sweet.At least the tea was excellent (difficult to go wrong), I had the Sencha Matcha which was fresh with a pleasant taste of umami.  Presentation was beautiful but still couldn't make up for the poor quality food.  This High Tea could be excellent if they stepped up the standard and quality of everything.  I would cut out a few of the sweets and spend the money on better quality goods instead.  For me it's more about quality, freshness, taste than quantity.  For instance, remove the macaroons (if you really must one is more than enough) and it should be comparable to Laduree, otherwise skip it.  The donuts don't need icing but should be freshly baked or fried - how difficult could this be?  Cut out half the sugar.  Even the bread on the sandwiches could've been lighter but that's not a deal breaker.  This High Tea could be so good and yet I would not recommend it to anyone.  I would loved to have returned and raved about my dining experience but sadly that just isn't the case.  Save your money, goto your local bakery, Donut Plant and Laduree, get some good quality tea leaves add hot water and enjoy your food instead!",0,0,1,Anita L.,"New York, NY",3,113,7

2.0,9/17/2018,"This hotel is just OK, the location and view from the balcony of the hotels rooms is the only thing that makes it worth staying here.Parking: None- I actually valeted my car at the William Vale Hotel. It is only a half of a block walk, but a hotel not having parking or valet should have been the first red flag. Check-in: The staff was not friendly, and repeatedly called me the wrong name even after taking both my husband and I's IDs. They then informed me that I had already checked-in for the day and they didn't understand why I was back at the desk...um because I never checked-in. It was like they didn't believe me and the women had to go speak with her ""co-worker"" (left with my ID and credit card) to figure out our room situation. Elevators: were the slowest elevators I ever had the displeasure of waiting for. They held at most 5 people, with out luggage and there were only two of them. This left to wait times of up to 5 minutes for a friggin elevator. Room: By far the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in. The balcony has one chair, even tho there is room for another. The decorations are nice and on trend, but there was no dresser, no where to put luggage and MAYBE 3 hangers. The bathroom was cute, but the shower took way to long to get hot, and then kept running even after you shut it off. Also- the housekeeping lady tried to enter our room at 9:30AM on a Saturday...completely inappropriate. She then kept coming back to check if we were gone, even tho we had a late check out.Rooftop Bar: We tried to go- the line was SO long, and they were plucking people out of the line to be ""accepted"" into the bar. So strange, I know there is a guy to girl ratio that should be upheld but when the line is so long people can't even get off the elevator something needs to be addressed. I believe there should be a separate line for hotel guests (who are paying over $400 a night) to enter the Rooftop. It was full of non-hotel guests who were using the hotel guest elevators, again making the wait for the elevator extremely long.This hotel is super trendy and in a great location.

3.0,9/9/2018,"i came to the williamsburg hotel for the rooftop pool for my birthday (on a weekday). my thoughts:i called twice in the weeks before my birthday to confirm the necessary info (cover charge, hours, etc). i was told cash was preferred but credit card was okay. upon arrival i was told cash was not accepted. luckily i and everyone i was with had a credit card on them.the rooftop views were nice. the pool water looked dirty / cloudy. i think they use salt instead of chlorene. but the water was the perfect temperature. not too cold - walked right in without having to slowly adjust to the temperature.i didn't like the pool chairs. the back piece didn't adjust tall enough to sit up straight. the cushions for the chairs were also dirty. i recommend getting two towels to cover the length of the chair.food & drinks are very expensive for what you get. my avocado toast was talked up to a size resembling a meal, but it was hardly a snack. i then had the fruit platter, which was good (dragonberries were cool) but not worth the $17 price. my first drink was strong for the first few sips but then i only tasted the margarita sour mix. my second drink was the same thing but made by a different bartender. it was stronger, and either she charged more for the drink, or didn't tell me she included gratuity.the bathroom is dark and smaller than most pool bathrooms i have seen. reminded me of the bathroom at the surf lodge, but without the beachy theme.i was stuck in an elevator for a few minutes. it just randomly stopped on a floor that wasn't selected in the elevator and the doors didn't open. a hotel employee said it was because neither i nor the other person in the elevator had a hotel pass to go up to the pool. i don't know how or why the elevator started to function again but apparently an elevator mechanic had just fixed it, so i was told not to worry... if a mechanic had just been there i figure there was in fact a problem that wasn't entirely fixed, but i have seen many hotel elevators that require a room key, so idk what i believe. i had a miscommunication with the pool waittress a few times. she seemed not to understand me and she became frustrated, as did i - asking for a receipt shouldn't be complicated, but it was. she was also upset that i ordered a drink at the bar without ordering through her. i didn't see her and i was really close to the bar ‍my sister requested an umbrella by the pool chair and received one from a pool attendant. the waittress asked for the umbrella to be moved so that another chair wouldn't be in the shade, but everyone in my group was happy with the level of sun and shade, and no one was even in that chair in partial shade, so i was more frustrated that she created confusion for an empty pool chair.the music was ok. i got there at opening and only heard eminem (i hate angry music). luckily it changed to more current radio music by 11:30 or noon. the pool does allow kids, which i didn't care for, but they weren't out of control. it was overall a good day. i do compare everything to the best pool party i've been (encore beach club) so this definitely didn't measure up, but was still a good way to spend my birthday without having to pay for a vacation. i still don't see myself coming back.",2,0,0,Letizia V.,"New York, NY",0,50,0

Yes the view and location are great but that's about it. Rude staff, and it's become the trashiest pool party on weekends...they are now treating the place like a beach club, where even a bench is for table service. I went today thinking Labor Day Monday would be less crowded (my bad) with tourists traveling back home but instead I found myself at a Vegas-meets-Jersey Shore party. Over crowded, no chairs or spots to hang out in, murky pool with too many people in it. We left after 5 mins, and on our way down in the elevator chatted with some hotel guests who were complaining about the utter mismanagement of the hotel in general. not surprised they've turned their rooftop to cheese ball promoters--not at all the 5star/luxury place they promote on travel sites at all.",2,0,0,Isa B.,"New York, NY",0,9,3

The room service leaves a snail trail and the food is meh, yet priced like they have 3 Michelin stars.The ONE redeeming quality is the staff.  They are all very helpful and pleasant and clearly doing their best with what they have to work with.I yearn for the day more hotels open up and force this turd to attempt to redeem itself.",4,4,1,Alyssa M.,"Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn, NY",111,40,13

Why should we have to get a bottle? Why do I have be forced to pull out my cards - connection and plastic to meet your standards?I decided against it due to principal.What bothers me the most is the fact that we weren't told about the services required until we got upstairs, and when I asked the guy who's giving the bracelets as to why this is not specified prior, his rude pretentious attitude made it all worst.Needless to say, I won't be paying this place a visit.There are plenty rooftops down the street and I rather give them my business anytime.",1,0,0,Jag ..,"Astoria, Queens, NY",1,13,0

1.0,8/14/2018,"Pros: Great view from your room.Cons: Everything else. Compared to what else you can get in NYC this hotel is a total ripoff. I basically live out of hotels due to my work and this is the worst hotel and biggest rip off I've ever experienced. This hotel is awful. The staff here are poorly trained and managed. It is obvious staff morale is low and that is clear by the way they behave and treat the guests. The lobby looks impressive but the air conditioners are leaking water all over all the seats. Does the staff care enough to inform before you sit down that you are about to sit in a puddle of water? No. Does the staff care enough to do anything about the problem? No. Three different times the fire alarm went off on our floor and one time it went off in my room. When this happened, it took them 20 minutes to get it off. No one really seemed to care about this because apparently the fire alarm goes off all the time from the showers. Here is how my conversation with the front desk went about the fire alarm going off in my room at midnight. Front Desk: ""Oh its going off again? Ugh, are you running a hot shower? Well, thats why it happened."" Basically implying that this was my fault. One morning one of the cleaning staff walked into my room without warning and then yelled at me for not putting the do not disturb sign up. She opened the door as she knocked on it so I had no time to even respond. But no apology just yells at me through the door ""PUT THE DO NOT DISTURB SIGN UP IF YOU DON'T NEED SERVICE!""There is no gym but they they have bikes for all guests to use. The unfortunate reality is I was never once able to use a bike and I heard various excuses from the bikes were ALL being used to all the bikes all at the same time needed to be repaired. The elevators here are awful and you will spend way too much time waiting for them. I took the stairs down almost every time from the 5th floor because the wait was too long. On Saturday when walking down the stairs I found the front door security guard chugging beers in the stairway without shame. On the weekends the hotel is run more like a night club than a hotel and the security will treat you as if you are trying to sneak into the VIP section of the Beyonce concert even if you prove to them you are a guest of the hotel. I was chastised by the security guard for wanting to use the lobby on a Saturday night to get some work done. The rooms are small. And on the weekends you won't get any sleep because of the nightclubs are all blasting music and the hotel didn't put in the proper windows to sound proof.

Then we both were trapped in the elevator after it opening mysteriously on a mystery floor that was under construction. Sorry, BRB, gotta move because water is dropping on me again.Ok, more bad things: At a $500 price point, a guest might expect hot water and water pressure. I mean, I'm not that fancy.

1.0,7/18/2018,"If I can give this place zero stars I would. I love Williamsburg. It's very artsy, down to earth and young. I visited the pool with a group of friends who traveled from far. This hotel needs to be in the middle of Tennessee or Mississippi because I cannot believe the amount of hate and discrimination that I witnessed at this rooftop. I was literally gagging. The view was beautiful but that's about it. My friends were told that we were able to sit on the reserved couches because they were reserved for her party but we were told we have to get up by the person who is in charge of the rooftop (some white/Albanian looking bald headed guy who needs to stop drinking the beer up there.)  He literally told us ""I don't know who on my team told you you can sit here but I will scold them for telling you that and I am a partner for the rooftop so that means I have the last say, so move, now."" If I wasn't in just a bathing suit and cover-up only, I would have had the final say - and that's on God. Secondly, the bar. My friend was waiting literally for 20 minutes before one of the bartenders told her ""we'll get to you, when we get to you."" My friend's a bartender at a place with heavier volume and after 20+ minutes of being at the bar...she returns to the poolside with zero drinks. I asked her what was wrong and she said, I refuse to give this disgusting place my money. Another gag. So another friend had to wait another 20+ minutes before I walked over there and saw the madness for myself. It was nuts. Third, I guess they reached capacity even though a good number of people were leaving. They let my other friend's skinny friend in but when her heavier-set friend tried to come to the rooftop...they denied her entry. I was so disgusted and that was the absolute last straw for me. My cousin plays soccer on a reputable team and I wanted to celebrate his birthday at that rooftop...but not anymore.

And didn't let any of the other people of color in and when we called them out they just shrugged their shoulders and ignored us. Once again If they were apologetic then maybe I would t of thought it was about race but unfortunately it was because the party wasn't at capacity and they only let a select few people in for one party but was very lenient for the other crowd.

The food itself would have been good, but for tea pairing it was extremely heavy on the sweet side (ex no scones or biscuits) and I love sweets. If you aren't that into tea and just want to come for atmosphere this is fine, but definitely not worth the cost, just come for a drink and hang out.",0,0,0,Laura D.,"PRINCE, NY",0,3,3
1.0,5/25/2018,"Unfortunately I had a bad experience as I really wanted to like this hotel, from the hip and swank decor to the neighborhood. Three things is forcing me to give this review 1 star. First, I checked in early so they held my luggage. The front desk clerk informed me that they would place my luggage inside my room before I returned in the afternoon. Not only did they not do this, but after I arrived in the afternoon, they actually lost my luggage. They searched and eventually found it 30 mins later, but this delay only gave me a few minutes to shower, get ready, and rush out as I had a very tight schedule. Second, the thermostat was broken. I had set it for 68 degrees, but it remained at 73-75 all night (see pix). After rolling in my bed, unable to sleep, I got up at 2am and played with the thermostat for 15 minutes, cursing the NYC gods of night!  Nothing happened, so I called the front desk and 10 minutes later a person showed up and tried to fix it. No luck. So he had to reset the whole system across the hallway, informing me that it would take a while to kick in. At 3 AM the temperature remained the same! I was beyond furious.  I did not sleep until 6 AM. And finally, there was a club nearby with rock 'n' roll music (strong base guitar sound pounding) and the club folks were smoking outside which reached my room. That music continued until 3 AM...and this was a Tuesday night!!!I called in the morning, completely drowsy, but infuriated, and the front desk clerk offered to pay for two drinks that I had in the bar the night before. I think he should've offered me a free breakfast, because what I endured was not worth 2 drinks! I found his apology to be ludicrous.  Bad service to customers!!! Don't go here if you want better service and a quiet night's rest.",4,3,1,Randy M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,72,69
3.0,4/25/2018,"This review is for the high tea. Is the places super aesthetic and nice? Yes. Is the tea good. Eh. Is the food good? No. Is the service good? No. So if you're here for that insta go for it. If you're here for afternoon tea, save your money and drink tea at home.First of all, even though we made a reservation, we were put on the smallest stool table seating. The table was so shaky and small we couldn't fit our plates on it and had to eat from our laps. The table next to us in the same layout even broke a plate (there was no space to put anything!) we got the tea relatively quickly. I got the Korean pear that tasted like fruity water aftertaste. Then we waited for the food. And waited. And waited. By the time food got to us, our tea (in our teapots!!) got cold lol.The food itself was no bueno. Everything tasted like they just took it from the fridge and microwaved it then forgot it. The muffin was ice cold. My friend didn't finish hers and when they asked us if we wanted to take it to go we laughed - no thanks. Besides that, everything was just bleh. The scone had sugar on it which is black mark in itself. And there was pizza lol. Why is there pizza with tea? And why did the pizza taste like leftover pieces from last night microwaved again. I'm not going to break down the rest because there's nothing much to say. The hotel/restaurant seems nice in itself. There was a band playing which was cute. The restroom is downstairs (you have to take an elevator) which was odd. When I was there an employee came out a stall and I swear he was crying in there if something. Damn. Anyway, I digress.

1.0,4/13/2018,"I made reservations for high tea, in part due to the beautiful photos advertised.Unfortunately, our actual experience was much less ""beautiful"". My cousin and I both have allergies (which our waitress inquired about), but apparently the menu selections don't allow for personal preferences. So there were not only selections each of us was allergic to, but also selections that neither of us preferred.Furthermore, when our tea arrived, the teaspoons for both of us were dirty!!The waitress replaced all the tea and the silverware, which we appreciated, but when the food arrived, several items were over cooked- the guacamole toast was served on way overcooked toast, the pizza slices were super dry, and the mini scones were SO dry and hard, I couldn't even cut them.

I must preface we both work in the service industry, so I don't want to come across as some spoiled hipster asking to be feed grapes. I did hair for a wedding at this hotel recently and thought it looked great to stay and relax for a night.The bar is beautiful and overall the hotel was clean and in a good location. However, its expensive. Which is fine- when the price is followed up with things that make it worth it. They have a pet fee of $100 which they do not tell you about online when booking the room, and you would think for that additional fee things like a dog bowl would be given to you for the room. I had to ask several times for one. The shower head didn't work and literally sprayed all over the bathroom. The rooms are TINY. I've stayed in Manhattan hotels like the Nomad which are bigger. The terraces are nice to get a view and fresh air. So many little things that add up to make this a not great experience. Like when I ordered coffee and they had to tape the lid on because it didn't fit, and it wound up spilling anyway. The kicker was on the way out, there are two doormen who literally just watch my husband and I fussing with the doors with all our bags and dog without moving or breaking their own conversation. Do yourself a favor and book another hotel or Airbnb.

5.0,3/28/2018,"I was absolutely in love with this hotel!  So happy I paid the price for one night in Brooklyn, you sure get what you pay for.  This hotel is quite posh, new, friendly, trendy, safe, CLEAN, and super comfortable.  Also no fear of bed bugs at all! The night I checked in was a little later than expected since I drove from Boston.  Really wish I had gotten there earlier to enjoy more of my room and hotel experience, such is NY traffic, thankfully I was able to get a late check out the next day.Anywhere you choose to stay in New York is going to be small, it's just how it is, so I didn't mind the small room because I understand.  As I was slowly walking down the hallway and enjoying each room number sign lit up above the doors, the carpet, the wall detail, and the ceiling lighting, I was so excited to open the door to my room.  It was pure luck to be on the 6th floor (every room above the 5th has a view).  TA-DA, there it is!Right away your eyes focus on the details of the interior design and ambiance of the room.  The huge wall window plays a big part in making the room feel larger.  I had a nice view of the Williamsburg Bridge and my rental car, which was parallel parked on the street below.  Everything in the room was high tech from USB outlets in the wall to a noise machine on the nightstand, but I couldn't get mine to work (the only downside to my stay).   My Brooklyn friends met me at the hotel restaurant called Harvey for dinner shortly after I checked in.  We ordered a lot of food to share and happened to find a piece of plastic in the cheese on one of our two pizzas.  The waitress apologized and didn't charge for the pizza and threw in free desserts for each person.  That's a review in it's own for Harvey, but nice to know they offer delicious food in the lobby of the hotel.  I recommend the spaghetti squash - it was heaven!The toiletries were high quality and smelled very nice.  The gold shower fixtures, blue tile, and vanity were so beautiful I couldn't wait to shower after my morning run. If you ask the front desk about a fitness center they give you a pass to the Brooklyn Athletic Club about .5 miles away.At check out the next day around noon, the front desk clerk was very friendly and gave me two complimentary cookies that were baked on site.  I was able to hang out at the bar area in the lobby to kill a few hours before I had to drive to the airport.

The rooms are beautifully decorated with things I didn't even know I needed in a hotel (white noise machine-amazing) The only reason I didn't give this a 5 star review is because on the last day we were staying they ran a fire alarm check at 8am, I understand they have to do their work but a little later in the day would make more sense.

The tea set was very colorful and the rest of the platters were completely white which made your tea set pop out the most.The tea set came with an ordinary tower of snacks. The sweets were great however I think the sandwiches/savory level wasn't the best. The avocado toast was on the staler side and it was lacking in flavor (same with the mini pizza).

3.0,2/11/2018,"Very nice and clean hotel.  Fairly new in regards to all other hotels in the immediate area.  Rooms are very small, almost micro.  I cannot compare to any other ones due to the fact that I chose a Queen size bedroom with large window.  The bathroom set up is all wrong in my opinion.  The stationary half glass door cannot contain the shower water and thus leads to a small puddle outside of the bath stall.  The room was surprisingly very small and even a little tight. I guess this is the new trend since it affords more available rooms thus more profit.  Even though it's a no smoking policy room / hotel, my bed had the scent of cigarette smell which made it very difficult to sleep on my first night stay.  I advised the front desk the next morning, and they quickly changed my sheets.  I really like the area and the hotel is nice for what I paid, but between the size of the room the issue with the cigarette smell on the bed, and the shower issue , I likely will not be revisiting.",3,0,0,A S.,"Pompano Beach, FL",23,68,38

Also, there is a small ensemble that plays on Saturdays!We ordered the high tea which was 30/pp and features an assortment of teas you can choose from, and a tower of pastries/small eats.Amongst the small eats I would have to say the Smoked Salmon with cucumber sandwich was my favorite. The refreshing taste of the cucumber melded well with the strong taste of fish. Perhaps I will try this in my own cooking!I thought all of the baked pastries were good, with the exception of the scone as it was a bit too dry for my liking. The almond cookie was a favorite of mine as it made me think about the Mini Almond Pie that we eat during Chinese new year. This mini pie however definitely had a strong blast of almond flavoring than I'm used to. The Fruit Tart was also created right with the correct portions of cream, tart, and fruit put together!As for their teas, I liked how much variation there was from one leaf to another. I had Wild Pear from Hadong, Korea which was definitely a light and sweet tea. If you're looking for something sweet to go with your high tea, I would recommend this one. I also tried a couple of others, which ranged from tastes of strong green tea to a black tea style.

I appreciated that their tea menu featured interesting blends (though it might be nice to also offer the classics for those who prefer old school flavors like Earl Grey). I went with a Korean wild pear one which was super light and subtle and lovely. The snacks were lovely as well, and you get a ton for the $30/person.

I would have appreciated if they would have told me they were running a security deposit for my entire stay and incidentals when my room had been paid for in full upon check out. It took several days for the refund to be processed and when I called to inquire about the charges, the front desk seemed annoyed. I acknowledge that they went above and beyond for my party to make our stay welcoming and fix the minor kinks, but they could be more communicative.

4.0,6/13/2017,"Williamsburg Hotel is a beautiful private hotel in downtown Williamsburg. Take the L train to Bedford Ave or the G train to Nassau Ave, and it is a 10 minute walk from there. It was a hot summer day and we were looking for a cold drink. We walked in. The space is modern and chic. It seems pretty new because of the small number of people who were there. It is calm and quiet. There was a jazz trio playing soft music in the corner. They have a high tea service for $30 per person that includes tea and a three-tier of pastries. I looked up prices for rooms and they are pricey. Rooms are for 2 people only (no 4 person rooms) and small (less than 300 square feet for the standard room). Also, it is not part of a rewards program like SPG or Marriott, so you can't gain points by staying here.",2,0,0,Sooz A.,"New York, NY",368,525,568
2.0,6/10/2017,"Good layout and service, but ordered a cocktail and it came out about 20 minutes after everyone got their beers, which then everyone had finished their beers. The cocktail then tasted like half water and really not the best for $15. I would have rather not paid for that.",1,0,0,Phoebe S.,"New York, NY",3,19,16
3.0,6/4/2017,"Gorgeous hotel, great design, especially the multi-tiered outdoor patio.  The staff at the bar, especially the waitstaff, were super accommodating and helpful... as long as you ordered beer and wine.  Classic cocktails, not even fancy cocktails were insanely bad.  A negroni was made with aperol, sans gin. A Manhattan tasted like watered down cream soda.  The bartender was using a cheat sheet and still botched the drinks hard. Obviously they are still opening and have more work to do, only the lobby bar is open, but someone needs to ""John Taffer"" the bartenders on everyday cocktail recipes!!",0,0,0,Steph D.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,123,1
2.0,5/23/2017,"Let me begin with the Hotel did our rate and bought us a drink when when checked in which helped for the few minutes when we checked in. Ok - so he rooms are Tiny even for NY standards - how they were able to stuff a King Sized bed in that room I dont know - but at that point you have room for nothing else. Thank goodness that we had small carryon luggage because a full sized suitcase would have been impossible. Once again I give props when I see nice things - the room was tiny but all of the amenities were modern and cool. The hotel's website which has now been updated but still rather difficult to follow touted all of the Hotels amazing new bars and restaurants, rooftop pool and even complimentary TukTuk rides around within a 5 block radius. Whoops nothing except the lobby bar was open! It is full of nice but inexperienced bartenders who are so hassled due to being short handed constantly behind the bar. They offer Tea Service which seems to perplex the staff at every occasion and leaves the bar patrons sitting alone unserved for long stretches. The bar while looking cool is not well thought out. The poor short female bartender even had difficulty reaching across the bar to place our drinks, much less reach the call brands that were on a shelf way to high for her to reach normally so they offer up a step ladder ( anyone that has ever worked behind a bar knows how we it gets on your feet, this is an accident waiting to happen) all in the name of making the bar look cool.Since all of the Restaurants are still not open (we heard because of screw ups in the kitchen design) they offered a continental breakfast of sorts but once again my wife and another gentleman asked for a tea and a coffee respectively and was informed that she had the tea and coffee, had cups but no lids, which is not real conducive while walking. I guess the final straw is on Saturday morning we inquired about the TukTuk (Motorized rickshaw) to carry us 4 blocks to the wedding we were attending, I was conversing with the Bell Captain (Chris) about it and he said that we should talk with the front desk to ""reserve"" the ability of using it. Well guess what once again we have the conversation with Front Desk and at that point guess what (We have no one to drive you) really? you tout this as another amenity yet its another amenity that isn't available.  The neighborhood is cool, right across from Brooklyn Brewery and some cool bars, restaurants and pubs around oh and we lucked up with a foodie fair at the park around the corner which was awesome.I hope this hotel gets its act together because it has the ability to be a really nice one but they have a long way to go.",2,2,0,Patrick K.,"Tampa, FL",155,144,96
2.0,5/15/2017,"I came here for afternoon tea in a Sunday afternoon.  I'm a big fan of afternoon tea places but there's not as many here than in London.  They serve afternoon tea in the bar area.  We had a reservation and we wanted a booth but they were all filled since they were using 3 of them for a photo shoot.  We ended up at the bar which was not the best place to have afternoon tea.  I ordered the Wild Pear tea and the High Tea set.  Most of the items were sweet than savory.  I prefer half savory and half sweet.  The scones didn't come with jam or cream which was strange.  The Wild Pear tea itself was interesting and the teapot/cup set was cute.  The High Tea was $30 so I guess for that price, I guess they thought it was okay to not have the essential things for High Tea.  They should just charge more ($40) and have better items.  I would not come back.",5,0,0,Julie Ying X.,"Brooklyn, NY",230,557,557

5.0,5/14/2017,"This hotels star rating should be MUCH higher - any of the less than 4 stars seem to be from people complaining about very specific things and not the actual hotel experience, so if you're here for a review of the HOTEL, here's what I have to say... - AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE. We arrived straight to the hotel from a redeye on no sleep at 9:30AM and they were able to find us a room immediately (you have no idea how grateful we were to have a bed to sink into) - FLEXIBLE CHECK IN/CHECK OUT. I know the hotel isn't yet fully open so this may change in the future, but in the meantime the front desk staff were SO kind and courteous. We were able to get into the room early and check out late. (Very important when you're hungover until 1PM following a crazy wedding the night prior)- LOVELY CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST. Each morning there was fresh local pastries served in the basement lounge which is also decorated so beautifully. - GORGEOUS DESIGN. This is a new privately owned hotel and the attention the detail did not go unnoticed.  Everything from the lobby to the bar to the room was straight out of an interior design magazine. Talk about #designgoals- COZY (read 'small') ROOMS: ok listen, its NYC so you can expect any room to be small at any hotel HOWEVER that being said they MADE THAT ROOM WORK. The interiors of the room are gorgeous and give strong 'All Saints meets Restoration Hardware' vibes aka IG-worthy for sure. Upon walking in I was like ""oh ok this is a bit tiny"" but once we settled in it was perfect. No complaints at all. - PERFECT LOCATION. it's in the heart of Williamsburg, I don't need to expand on this one.

4.0,5/10/2017,"Really like this space. Ive been here before and would definitely come again. The 4 stars is mostly based on how long it took to get drinks. Other than that they have done a really good job. The space is warm and roomy, they have a good selection of spirits and their bar staff as well mannered. The drinks run from about 11-$15. It's definitely on the ritzy side. But the drinks are strong and the ambience is top notch so depending on what youre into its worth it.",1,0,0,Charles K.,"Brooklyn, NY",236,365,554
5.0,4/23/2017,"What a great addition to the neighborhood! We recently stayed here while our apartment is being renovated and, even though the restaurant and water tower bar aren't open yet, we had a fabulous experience. The overall ambiance and style are spot-on; the rooms are beautiful (spectacular views, sleek design, really comfy bed, plush robes, nice TV, awesome shower, balcony, lots of outlets, phone docks and other thoughtful conveniences); the lobby bar has delicious cocktails; the staff were delightful and helpful; the location is ideal; there is a complimentary breakfast of yummy pastries, muffins, breads, yogurts and coffee/tea; and the overall vibe is chic yet welcoming. We will definitely recommend this gem to friends and family who come visit us!

1.0,4/14/2017,"My friend and I love afternoon tea, and have gone to several places in search for it. We were excited to hear about this place, and there was a great review from this past year in Brooklyn Magazine about it. However, the review included many things that were not available to us.There were 13 options on the menu, two of them were savory, and 11 were sweet. As afternoon tea lovers, we were not thrilled by the lack of savory options. And by the lack of scones. There was one cucumber Brie sandwich on stale cold bread. The other was a quiche with ham and marscarpone- but the menu did not say there was meat in it. Back to the scones- Afternoon tea should have scones- and the scone option here was a hard, dry burnt scone w currants and sage. No clotted cream. No preserves. Strange. Very strange to have afternoon tea w a pseudo sage currant scone. Out of the 13 options- I enjoyed the spelt nougat- it was the size of a thimble so it went quick. The sweet potato donut was another quick sweet bite.  The zucchini bread was moist. Also thimble sized. These were the most tasty of all the choices. As I was eating these things, it felt like they cut the baked goods into small small portions to make it ""high tea"" like. We had our two daughters w us- and were happy they said they were child friendly. The space was roomy. Each child had a glass of milk, on the house. We talked to management about our concerns w the menu/food and showed them the review that our visit was inspired by. They took off the price of one set of high tea off our check to address our concerns. There are lots of places that serve afternoon tea- and this place called their ""high tea"" which comes w many high expectations. It is a relatively new spot. Their kitchen is not opened yet and it seems like they get their food from a local bakery. I hope that they improve their ""high tea"" service, and realize that serving a pot of tea w deserts from a local bakery on a porcelain three tiered tray does not account for high tea.",3,0,0,Shirley W.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",0,43,0
5.0,2/11/2017,"I highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the Williamsburg area. We stayed for one night in a king room with a terrace. We were really impressed, the minute we walked in. This hotel is awash in understated elegance. Beautiful fixtures and furnishings! Excellent and attentive service. Patrick at the door was fantastic, along with the rest of the service. The staff goes out of their way to make you feel welcome. From the time we entered the property, we were made to feel welcome and any question we had was answered in a polite and courteous manner. Iana and Shian were very extremely helpful giving recommendations in the neighborhood as well as hotel amenities.The hotel is well maintained and comfortable. The restaurant, pool, and rooftop bar are not yet open. We can't wait to come back and try it though. We loved all of the fixtures and pieces in the room. They even sent us a welcome gift to our room. The beds are a dream, the water hot with good pressure. Bar is fantastic! We loved the detail on the bar, the chandelier.
