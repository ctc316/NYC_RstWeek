5.0,3/25/2019,"Untitled is a premier restaurant in the heart of Chelsea. This restaurant has absolutely phenomenal food, service and drinks. From the moment we entered into the restaurant we were greeted by the host and promptly seated, others who were unable to be seated immediately, were promptly attended at the bar. The keepers of the bar had great suggestions and were very knowledgeable regarding spirits and preferences thereof. I enjoyed everything I ordered so did my companion.We had a variety of burgers and appetizers; words CAN NOT NOR SHOULD THEY describe our delight.  From the aesthetics of the plates and the taste of all the food which is simply put a 10 out of 10.All the desserts are equally as pleasing as the main courses and appetizers. Do yourself a favor and if YOU ARE A New York City local Go check out Untitled at the Whitney If you're a tourist in the city please make it a point and ADD this hidden Gem to your itinerary.",4,0,1,Eloah Nasir A.,"Brooklyn, NY",225,29,2
5.0,3/16/2019,"A lovely experience. This place has really good dessert, and I ate a lot of good dessert already. We had mocha mousse and triple chocolate cookies, and they were heavenly made. The mocha mouse was soft and balanced in sweetness and bitterness.  Plus, the mint chocolate was very complimentary. The chocolate of the cookie was melty and smooth. We had chicken thighs for lunch, and they were crunchy. I am not a spice lover, yet their spicy sauce put a nice twist on the ordinary fried chicken dish.",0,0,0,Linh M.,"Thompson, CT",1,3,3
4.0,3/7/2019,"I came here for lunch and generally had a positive experience, I think it's a solid 4 stars.  There are tables along the counter and table seats so make sure you specify when booking which you'd prefer.The menu is not that extensive and it may be difficult to find things you like on it, so do check it out before you come.  We decided to only order appetizers because none of the mains jumped out to us.We very much enjoyed the foie gras appetizer.  It was perfectly creamy with delicious spread and crunch from the accompaniments. If you like foie gras I highly recommend this.The beef tarter was also quite delicious and fresh tasting. The side of potatoes (which were not gluten free for my fiancé) were amazing, perfectly crispy and seasoned with delicious dips on the side.The Vermont cheeses were also great.  The seared fish however was too fishy for me and I did not enjoy this.I would definitely come back and try different appetizers and see if new menu rotation shows any mains that I find worth trying.",1,1,1,Elyka A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",198,204,634

Music was at a good background volume, good acoustics, so I didn't need to shout conversation. Clean. Spacious, but intimate. It was late afternoon, and the menu was simple. I ended up getting the chocolate cookie & milk. What a great choice. So nostalgic. Loved the presentation of tiny milk with tiny straw. Cookie was sweet, but not overly so. Fluffy and warm.

4.0,2/3/2019,"A solid four stars for my experience at Untitled on a Friday night.  The room has a good energy and feels strangely intimate despite the fact that an entire wall is made of glass, which sort of invites the street into the restaurant.  It's not the most attractive street.  Tables are spaced luxuriously far apart from each other, the crimson chairs by a Big Name Designer are ridiculously comfortable, and the acoustics are great - no need to shout at your dining companion to be heard.  Service was a little weird.  The manager took the bottle of wine we brought and promised to open it so it could breathe.  He did not communicate this to our server, who seemed generally confused (about this and other things) for the duration of service.  Our cocktail took a long time to arrive.  Our first round of plates arrived thirty seconds after we got our drink.  The food was delicious - every dish was familiar enough to be comforting, but with a surprising twist to make it interesting.  It's true, the portions are small, especially for the price (pasta, I am looking at you), but they still satisfied.  I imagine we will return, probably for lunch.",0,0,0,Jessica D.,"New York, NY",4,158,0

5.0,1/12/2019,"It's a classic Danny Meyer restaurant with light, spacious seating and carefully crafted dishes in tapas portions. It's very busy during the weekends so definitely make reservations!  We came for brunch after a few hours at The Whitney and it was still packed at 3 pm! I would recommend the bar seating as it is more spacious than most and you can watch the chefs prepare the food in the open kitchen. The food was great!  Some highlights:1. Roasted cauliflower with toasted almonds, apple slices, and yogurt: Tender and flavorful with a hint of olive oil. The textures and flavors were carefully cultivated and meshed well. 2. Salmon poke: Fresh and tender with toasted sesame seeds and chips. 3. Duck wild rice with shiitake and tastsoi: Very tender pulled duck topped with wild rice and sliced shiitake. It looks small but the duck portion is quite generous. 4. Carrot cake: I could eat a few more of these!  Very light and fluffy with the perfect amount of creamy icing and topped with granola!  So good!The staff here are wonderful and service sublime and it is a non-tipping place.

3.0,11/24/2018,"Don't order the duck fried rice!!! It's absurdly overpriced. An entree priced item ($28) delivered at less than appetizer portion and value. This is my second time dining at Untitled for brunch.  I really enjoyed my experience here the first time, as I normally do at most of USHG restaurants. The food is delicious, normally well executed and presented. This time I came with a friend and ordered three dishes; scrambled eggs for $18; duck fried rice for $28, and the roasted carrots for $15. My friend's scrambled eggs was descent, nothing very special; the roasted carrots were amazing; the duck fried rice was extremely disappointing and atrociously overpriced, and there was sand in the rice!!!I don't know what to say... the portion of my main entree was so tiny that I had to make another order for toasted bread. I still think Untitled is a good restaurant but I would like to relate the message to the group....PLEASE adjust the pricing for this dish, it's completely misleading as the second most expensive dish in the menu but it's so disappointing in both value and quality. 1/4 cup of rice with three pieces of tiny duck confit and two coin sized daikon is NOT worth $28, nor it's a proper dish sized for an entree.",0,0,0,J Z.,"Manhattan, NY",44,42,3

For $4, this is a MUST. Bread had a great char, too.Obviously I ordered the cookie & milk. With three kinds of chocolate and served warm, it was one of my favorites of the day. I'm not a huge milk person and was able to substitute almond milk. This is a no tipping restaurant and I think the prices for what I ordered were very fair considering.

2.0,11/9/2018,"Ate brunch there with three other people  recently. Everything was somewhere between acceptable and very tasty, but all portions were extremely small. That said, I wouldn't bother to be posting a review  were it not for the fact that   when one person at  our table requested that the eggs in a scrambled egg dish  ($16.00) be cooked ""hard, not runny,"" our waiter said he didn't know if that would be possible. Why not, I asked - would the chef refuse to do so? No, he explained, but the eggs were pre-prepared. What on earth has happened to a Danny Meyer restaurant that the eggs would be pre-prepared, I responded. He stammered out that he didn't mean pre-prepared but....and then he couldn't come up with another word. Whatever he was trying to say, I'll concede that the eggs were indeed prepared as my friend requested.

5.0,11/5/2018,"Nothing is better than amazing food AND fantastic service. Untitled delivered both flawlessly. We were a party of five for brunch and our server, Dragana, was amazing from the moment we arrived. She not only excelled at her craft... she very clearly enjoyed it. So difficult to find this level of natural, professional service. All other servers assisting Dragana were also fantastic. The level of training (that was obvious in the ways food was delivered, plates removed and in all interactions) was consistent throughout the team, so hats off to the management who understand what it takes to distance your restaurant from the pack. And the great part was that all this was achieved without a hint of the pretentious atmosphere that accompanies many of the top service eateries in New York. This was casual, friendly, relaxed and natural, but also chic.... very clever and difficult to achieve.The food was just outstanding! Brioche Donut to die for, Chili Roasted Scallops cooked to perfect firmness with amazing accompanying flavors and Triple Chocolate Chunk Cookie & Milk that was not too sweet and delicious to the last crumb.Well done to all team members working the kitchen, tables and back office at Untitled At The Whitney Museum!

4.0,10/12/2018,"The Whitney museum has a little restaurant/ bar connected to it - Untitled. This restaurant/ bar is a non-tipping restaurant which is written on the receipt. I believe that is why the prices are a little lofty but it isn't outrageous really. I am wondering since Untitled is non-tippng and they do revenue share, that is the reason for the huge smiles on everyone's faces. I am not joking! Everyone was extremely friendly and they seemed very sincere. I kinda just went with it and smiled back. :)For what I ordered the price was reasonable considering I did not have to tip. I ordered an iced coffee which was created with Sumptown coffee. Have you ever had Sumptown Coffee? If you have then you understand my excitement! It was good- dayum good. I also ordered the rice pudding with cherries. It loved it as it was a nice carb treat after walking all over NYC for the day.Whitney museum is a Modern Art Museum so it just makes sense that Untitled is just as modern in design with large windows. It is a beautiful sense of space. Untitled is definitely a great modern café with delicious treats for your museum day at The Whitney. Have fun!",3,0,1,Trixie N.,"Las Vegas, NV",1092,687,5725

Waltzed right in to Untitled, the nice Hostess got me a very nice table, water magically appeared and the friendly server brought my weary self a Prosecco. I ordered the Romaine Wedge salad. Somehow the order got in wrong and I was brought a salmon poke bowl. They realized their mistake and comped it. I have always avoided raw fish- but they said ""try it you'll like it"". It was so fresh, mild and tender- now that I learned to say Pokay not Poke- I'm a fan!

5.0,8/29/2018,"Though we are New Yorkers, this was our first visit to The Whitney Museum.  After touring, we had a lovely lunch at 'Untitled', the onsite restaurant on the first floor of the museum.  Normally we'd never eat at a museum restaurant (except the Isabella Gardiner in Boston, which at least years ago, was special), but this looked good on line and it did not disappoint.   My husband and I were immediately greeted and seated on this Wednesday at around 1pm.    Our friendly servers, Isabella and Oliver, made it very comfortable to enjoy looking through the menu, with no rush whatsoever.  Isabella offered to explain anything on the menu we did not understand.  I ordered the Romaine Wedge with Surryano ham, crumbled bleu cheese, sungold tomatoes and pumpkin seeds mole ($16USD).  The mole was a particularly tasty sauce, lightly but effectively administered.    I also had a glass of Muscadet, recommended by Oliver when I asked him to tell me which wine by the glass was closest to a pinot grigio.  This was a perfect suggestion and introduced me to a wine I've never had.  (I'm only an occasional wine drinker.)  My husband had the Grilled Shrimp Lettuce Wraps ($19USD), with avocado, sunflower seeds and kohlrabi slaw.  Accompanied with a glass of Pinot Noir.  He enjoyed his entrée and wine thoroughly.  We had ordered sparkling water, and it was refilled several times throughout our meal without us asking.  The coffee ($5.00USD), was truly delicious. My husband topped it all off with a blueberry creampuff, with a chunky blueberry sauce reduction surrounding the tiny puff.  He was pretty much speechless as he savored each bite!    This is a non-tipping restaurant--the tip is included in the price of your meal.  We tried to tip anyway, and it was respectfully refused by Oliver.  We explained that the concept is a ""revenue sharing"" one, whereas as 'Untitled' generates income, those working there share in those profits.  Mmmmm, a new concept to us.  We assume it makes every single person employed a real team player, all working for the true benefit of the customer and therefore the restaurant.  Overall, a very good experience.  The meals are small--if you have large appetites, this will not satisfy you, but very well prepared and presented.

4.0,7/28/2018,"Went here with a friend to try the restaurant week menu. The place was decently crowded, so we made sure to have a reservation. We decided to split everything since we wanted to try several dishes:Baby lettuce salad (3.5 stars): This was actually a much larger salad than I was expecting, but it was pretty average. The one bright spot was the buttermilk dressing that seemed to have a hint of dill in it that was delicious. Lamb meatballs (3.5 stars): These were decent as well--though they were definitely on the smaller side. The kale yogurt and spiced carrots were also tasty, as was the pickled cabbage--but nothing to write home about.Sourdough and whipped honey butter (4 stars): This they brought out on the house and it was very good. The sourdough was pretty plain, but had great texture and the whipped honey butter was quite flavorful.Arctic char (3.5 stars): This dish was a bit on the smaller side--and again it was decent, but nothing overly impressive.Crispy duck confit (4 stars): This was a decently-sized dish and had some great flavor. The way it was served was easily split and accompanying vegetables were great also.Caramel mousse (5 stars): Wow--this dish was absolutely incredible. The flavors here were so rich and complimented each other perfectly--from the chocolate to the caramel to the peanut--it was truly divine.Blueberry cream puff (5 stars): We thought after the first bite of the mousse that it would be hard to even come close with this dish and somehow they were able to pull it off. Completely different ingredients, but the same level of mastering a variety of flavors. The cream puff was a fun vehicle for a starch and the blueberry compote with pops of ginger was out of this world.Overall, this spot is definitely trending upward as a fine dining establishment in the Whitney. That being said, the restaurant week menu is a great deal and worth checking out. Though the appetizer and main course options are good, the real winner here is the dessert, which is definitely one of the best I've ever had in the city.",2,0,2,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",746,1843,225

2.0,2/5/2018,"I hardly spend any time on Yelp these days, since I've migrated to a different platform, so I'll keep this short and sweet. Come to Untitled for: Itty bitty portions at gargantuan prices.Let me caveat this review by also noting: I've lived in NYC for almost six years now and dined across the full spectrum of restaurants - so I'm not naive when it comes to NYC prices. What I will say, however, is that it is preposterous to list a dish third-to-last on a full menu of dishes, place a $17 price tag on it, and present it as a dish that is essentially one fried egg, a few pieces of diced bacon, and several spoonfuls of potato. Yes, I am referring to their Butterball Potato Hash.Their $11 French Toast was one dismal slice of bread with several slivers of cara cara orange. The $27 Fried Chicken dish consisted of 3 bite-sized nuggets of fried chicken, and one small section of breast meat - one, that we ate in 3 bites. The $22 burger was more bread than it was anything else.There are so many better restaurants in the area that will actually serve you a filling plate, especially at upwards of $20.

2.0,2/5/2018,"I have lived in NYC for nine years now and have been to a myriad of different restaurants with varying price points. Surprisingly, in this span of time, it has been rare that I have said, ""WOW. This is horribly overpriced for the amount of food on my plate.""Welcome to Untitled.Originally, two friends and I went for a Restaurant Week brunch, but after looking at the brunch menu, we decided we'd rather split a few plates among us. We ordered the French Toast with cara cara orange, mascarpone, honey, and almonds ($11); the Butterball Potato Hash ($17 on their 2/4/2018 menu, though, on their online menu, it currently says $15); the Untitled Burger ($22), and the Roasted & Fried Chicken with Brussels Sprouts, kale yogurt, and Korean chili ($27). The French toast was a SINGLE slice of bread. The egg that came with the potato hash was roughly 4 inches in diameter with a scattering of potatoes. The fried chicken that came with the chicken plate were three nugget-sized portions. The burger, at least, was ample for the price, though I still hate paying $22 for a burger, even if that's almost becoming the norm here in NYC. Haaa. We were all so disappointed by our portion sizes. One of my friends actually asked our waiter if our hash dish was the normal portion size. He confirmed that it was that size, but it is meant to be a small dish, not an entree. That is not clear on the menu; being the third item from the bottom at a cost of $17, we never thought it'd be a considered a small dish. The menu was...IS...nebulous. The menu should perhaps be split into what counts as a small dish and what counts as an entree. We asked our waiter that our issue be brought up to the manager...though, who knows if that happened. (Hey, never hurts to ask...) This all being said...the food was really tasty, save for the potato hash, which tasted like any other hash I've consumed. (Potatoes are just potatoes sometimes, haha.) The mascarpone with the French toast coupled with the crunchy almond slices mixed well with the custardy texture of the bread. The burger was incredibly flavorful and cooked to a perfect medium-rare. The chicken, both fried and roasted, was wonderful; the crunch on the fried chicken melded perfectly with the tender meat inside, and the Korean chili really added that special touch to the roasted chicken. Kudos to Chef Suzanne Cupps, absolutely! Upon telling someone about my experience, they countered with, ""Well...it IS the Meatpacking District. You should have expected high prices for small amounts of food."" Ummmm...no? NO. I don't think I should have to. That is a huge fallacy. I've been to plenty of restaurants in this neighborhood where, though expensive, the price point matched the size of my portion. I once had a $25 cut of meat at a neighboring restaurant while celebrating my boyfriend's 30th birthday, and it filled my plate, filled my stomach amply, and left me satisfied. Untitled simply did not live up to this.I understand artisan plates and appreciate the crafting behind them. But culinary art can be and should be satisfying to both the stomach and wallet, I truly believe. Though the food tasted divine, I can not see myself returning unless someone else is picking up the tab. That is unfortunate.",9,3,3,Allison C.,"New York, NY",215,1638,450

4.0,1/8/2018,"This is no chicken fingers & burgers amusement/zoo/park cafeteria.  Despite the fact that it is an eatery in a major tourist attraction (the Whitney museum) the cuisine here is good enough to be a standalone restaurant.  There's two entrances to Untitled --one outside museum & one inside so you do not need pay museum admission to eat here--although if you are a museum member (as I am) you get 10% off your entire bill.  Despite having a classy type dining room & artfully plated entrees & small plates--Untitled is kid friendly--we brought two small kids there & they even had high end high chairs of the most aesthetically pleasing type--the $300 stokke trip trap high chair in all its modern glory.  Needless to say my toddler felt fancy AF during our new years eve brunch last weekend.  Now down to the business of food: for three adults & two babies/toddlers we got large plates of shrimp and grits, bacon and pimento cheese toast (x2!) and small plate of french toast with ricotta with caracara plus vegetable sides of marinated beets with pear & charred cauliflower with pistachio butter & sunflower seeds.  The shrimp and grits were topped with bok choy--the overall taste was respectable (spoken by a shrimp and grits aficionado) but the bok choy while tasty didn't really fit into this souther staple.  The bacon & pimento cheese toasts also a doable brunch plate however the best standouts were doubtlessly the vegetables.  The veggies were good enough to be worthy of such veggie temples as Dirt Candy.  I adored the charred cauliflower and spent half my time devouring it and the other half plotting how and if I could replicate this dish at home!!  The beet and pear pairing was also welcome change to how beets are typically presented.  I have been here three times for museum related meals and will continue to return in  the future!",2,1,1,Grace F.,"Manhattan, NY",105,110,883

But she will give the credit to her team, the ingredients and everything but herself. But guess what, she created the dishes, all of which have a huge WOW factor, and she has trained her team to execute each dish the way it is supposed to taste. Not an easy task. She's amazing and so is her food, period. And anyone that gives this place less than 5 stars, needs to either go back  or have their tastebuds checked. No offense.

5.0,6/22/2017,"We've twice dined at Untitled for special occasions attached to our visits to The Whitney, and both times, they've provided us with very memorable experiences.  Renzo Piano's newish home for the museum is one of its most defining works of art, and, though there's a slight IKEA café vibe to the room, it actually works quite well.  There are dramatic ceilings and windows, and people watching at the literal end of the High Line is fantastic.  Inside the restaurant, despite all the reflective surfaces, the conversational din is quite manageable.  The room is rectilinear, with an open kitchen along the long interior wall.  As befits such a modern space, the chairs and tables reflect that modernist vibe (though, unlike those of The Modern, at the MoMA, another Danny Meyer joint, they're a little more comfortable and stable).  Service is USHG standard, which is to say, marvelous.  The waitstaff is personable, charming, attentive, helpful, and clearly after ensuring a happy and satisfying visit.  On our first visit, for our anniversary, the sommelier stopped by and poured us a 30-year-old Beerenauslese of Pinot Noir (which he billed a weird but wonderful wine) with our dessert.  The wine was haunting and magnificent.  For my mom's birthday, on the second visit, we were comped a fantastic grilled asparagus dish (with beguiling smoked tomatoes).  They know how to make a few gestures of hospitality and generosity which elevates an already wonderful meal to new heights.The food:  On the first visit, Michael Anthony, from Gramercy Tavern, was overseeing the kitchen, and the meal was very much in the vein of his pristine farm to table cooking.  Our starters included nectarines, fresh ricotta, and almond pesto over sourdough toast (what a winner - I've since replicated it at home), and a bracingly fresh gazpacho including peaches, watermelon, cucumber, and tomato, with ethereal slices of raw scallop.  The meal concluded with an unlikely combination that just really sang:  apricot and coconut cream pie. Suzanne Cupps is now at the helm, and on our second visit, we all loved the pimento cheese and crackers, vegetable dishes that included roasted cauliflower with dates, almonds, and Romano, and a fluke crudo with cara cara oranges and watermelon radishes, a riot of colors on the plate.  Entrees included sea bass with a melange of Thai flavors, the much-admired plate of roasted and fried chicken, and a deeply flavored slice of rotisserie pork belly.  Strawberry cake with lemon verbena and delicious macerated berries on top (with five times as much flavor as grocery strawberries) was a wonderful coda.  Cocktails and wine are excellent, and our favorite way to drink at Untitled is to order the untitled wine selection, which is described only after you order it.  This past visit, it was an elegiac Chablis, the last effort of the winemaker Stéphane Moreau-Naudet, who died unexpectedly in September.  His legacy lives on in bottles of flinty, bright beauty, and this was definitely a glass for the ages.  I think the prices are reasonable, given the real estate, the service, and the high quality of the food.  There's fierce competition in the neighborhood, which just makes being a diner in the vicinity all that much better.  Museum cafés used to be such a drag, but with marvelous destinations at Met Breuer, The Whitney, and MoMA, the tide has turned.  What a treat!",3,0,1,David R.,"Bethlehem, PA",1,32,163

Two friends and I were eventually able to snag seats by the food counter (not bar counter) and watch the chefs work their magic making colorful, fresh dishes. That was a lot of fun. I wasn't very impressed by the beer list, but we eventually settled on a really awesome, light red under the category of ""something different,"" which apparently they do when they have a great but not easily categorized wine.

3.0,4/24/2017,"This place is bright and modern on the first floor of the Whitney museum. The place was definitely crowded for Saturday brunch around 2pm, so thankfully we had a reservation. The menu is unique and definitely has someone really tasty options, but is also expensive. Portions especially the small plates are very small. We weren't super hungry, so thankfully we were still satisfied. I got the butterball hash with fried egg, which was very good ($13). My friend got the fish lettuce wraps, which she said were also very good but literally $10 for 2 of them. They do serve bread for free to the table. They had soy milk, but I didn't like how it was already mixed in to my iced coffee for me. When I had my second coffee, I asked for the soy milk on the side, which helped with the taste. However, not only was the coffee overpriced at $5, but he charged me for getting a refill. Essentially $10 for two small iced coffees...most brunch places don't charge you for each glass of coffee...same went for the Americanos. Actual entree large plates are $20+.As a member you get a 10% discount off your bill if you show your employee ID or member card, which was nice. Service was okay. At times kind of slow.

Never had that experience before, but it wasn't a downside for us.For appetizers, the four of us shared an order of duck rilletes and fried chicken (it's not officially on the menu but is available upon request). I guess I'm not a fan of duck served as a spread, but the fried chicken was pretty tasty. We also got complimentary cheese biscuits that came with raspberry jam--yum.For the main course, I ordered the rotisserie porchetta, which tasted nice but was 95% fat, which did a number on my digestive system. I was expecting a little bit more meat and less fat. Wouldn't recommend for anyone suffering from acid reflux.We shared the olive oil cake for dessert, and our waiter was wonderfully attentive enough to have a lit candle on top when he brought it out (at some point I briefly mentioned that we were celebrating our friend's birthday).

4.0,12/5/2016,"I'd heard a lot about Untitled when it first opened, but I finally only made it recently for dinner here. I've only walked by the Whitney on the High Line, but the restaurant decor is very chic and minimalist - not a lot of interior decoration, high glass windows all around that makes it easy for passersby to peek in (or for you to look out, although it's less interesting in that direction), and the kitchen out front for everyone to see the magic going on. The service was quite good, with our servers being good sports even as the wine kept flowing. They also brought us a couple of free dishes to eat in the middle of our meal, which was quite generous. The all-you-can-drink wine selection that we had was okay overall; the chenin blanc in particular was a bit drab, while the red (I forget what kind it was) was more drinkable.The food here is quite accessible, in that even though Untitled presents itself as an upscale dining experience, I never got the sense that anything we ate was overly pretentious or trying to impress us. As such, it was a relatively casual meal that was executed in fine fashion and tasted great along the way as well. We started off with a fried fish wrap in lettuce - almost like a healthier (and tastier) version of a snack wrap, although it was a little difficult to hold together once the wrap started unspooling. We then had the couple of extra dishes in between; the more interesting one was the beef tartare, which had a relatively muted flavor itself but was given a dash of fall heaviness from roasted onions and brussel sprouts. We also had a salad for which the most notable thing was the generous shavings of pecorino on top - but otherwise, it didn't stand out all that much. The main was definitely the best by far, and the rye pasta served with braised lamb and merguez would make any Italian chef proud. The meat was richly marinated in the sauce, and with a full, hearty pasta that had a bit more character and chew than your typical off-the-shelf pasta, it was a dish I could have probably eaten once over if I had the opportunity. The sweet potatoes as a side were okay (I'm not that into them to begin with), while the charred cauliflower is a proper fall veggie dish, with a hint of mint to give it a bit of liveliness. I finished up with a slice of devil's food cake, which had a fantastically rich chocolate cake and ganache layered on the inside, with a vanilla frosting dusted with chocolate on the outside and served with a few grapes. Definitely a heavier way to end the meal, but I thoroughly enjoyed the cake - not super-fancy, but a very homey and delicious way to close it out.The second half of the meal (main, dessert) definitely stood out to me, and in all, I enjoyed the relatively simple thematic and seasonal dishes that were served here. Untitled has a cozy feeling despite the high ceilings and glass walls, and it's a very solid value for a classy dinner in what can be a very expensive city to dine in.

We split a few smaller plates so we could try more of the menu and ended up with the cabbage dumplings served with sesame vinaigrette, the grilled white shrimp on a corn pancake, the baby lettuce salad with corn, freekah and goat cheese and summer squash with chilis and hazlenut. Presentation was incredible - the dishes were so pretty it was hard to eat! In particular, the squash is sort of hollowed out like a boat and filled with ricotta and hazlenuts. The first two dishes were smaller with an unusual Asian flare, and then the salad was a great combination of flavors. Naturally we ordered wine to with our meal (acceptable on vacation/funemployement/really whenever) and our server was incredibly knowledgeable about the different whites they had available by the glass (because I ate here six weeks ago unfortunately I forget what we ended up with, but his recommendation was perfect). We ended up splitting the chocolate chip cookie with milk for dessert and it was pretty good but I would probably skip it in the future, it was just a bit crunchy for my taste. Still, a warm chocolate chip cookie is never a bad idea and getting to enjoy it all in the crisp, pristine white room with sun pouring in the windows made it a truly 5-star experience.",1,1,1,Maeve M.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",317,539,111
4.0,9/12/2016,"Located on the first floor of the Whitney, Untitled has a chic atmosphere.  Let's talk about food:- Ricotta, heirloom tomatoes, aged balsamic, grilled bread - really good but small portion- Grilled white shrimp, green beans, cornbread pancake - sounds a lot better than it tastes.  The base is literally a pancake and would have been better if it was crunchy like tostones or tortilla.  Not worth it at $5 per piece.- Sea bass, corn, sweet peppers, coconut curry - fresh with good flavors- Roasted and fried chicken, new potatoes, salsa verde - by far the best dish of the night (the fried chicken reminds me of Taiwanese chicken)Overall a good meal but not mind-blowing.  At this price point, there are many more options in the city.",3,0,0,Melissa W.,"Hoboken, NJ",75,354,545

Sadly, we left frustrated and very unimpressed at the service we received and were so turned off by it we declined to dine there.We arrived at the outdoor patio and waited patiently to be seated, noting that there were multiple unoccupied, unreserved tables. Very disappointingly, we stood there waiting for over 15 minutes, despite two conversations with the hostess regarding our seating. The second time, she explained that they had just seated other tables and needed to ""pace"" things - which meant we were left standing.

4.0,8/16/2016,"Came back to try some new menu items and was happy to find the quality of service and food has not diminished. I really liked the flavors of the grilled white shrimp (snack) and would've liked it even more if I didn't have to go looking for the shrimp. We also ordered the caraflex cabbage dumpling (snack) which was fine but basically a Chinese dumpling made with extra care. I loved the summer squash (vegetables), served as a yellow zucchini boat topped with a mix of green zucchini and hazelnuts resting on a schmear of ricotta- this squash inception was delicious and fun. The beef tartare (raw) is not diced up as small as most others, so it has more chew; this was a tad salty from the green sauce and the dots of hoisin (my guess, don't quote me on that) but otherwise really nice. For the mains, we chose the sea bass and it was a perfect light summery dish. The flavors are quite mellow. We also tried the burger, which the waiter said was a brand new item. It's a very good burger, a juicy (if somewhat overcooked) patty topped with pimiento cheese (similar in texture to cottage cheese) and served with fingerlings. I wish they'd switch out the potatoes for fries though, since they weren't crispy and were confusing (is this finger food or fork food?). The bun was also on the bitter side, maybe because its whole grain or was left to char too long. Im being picky here though, it's a decent burger. My favorite was dessert - I do have a sweettooth and I only wish I ordered another. We had the caramelized custard cake, which seems to be composed of a layer of bruleed light cheesecake over a sponge cake, decorated with raspberries and honeycomb brittle. I couldn't have asked for a better way to end the meal, SUCH a good combination of flavors and textures! It feels like a lighter dessert but it is so satisfying. Service was friendly but slow at times, and the ambience is perfect for almost any occasion.",2,0,3,Lillian Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",461,285,1300

It was a miserably hot that day, so we were thankful for the zero wait and the cool AC.We had the squash pasta, soft scrambled eggs, and tomato & peach salad. The salad & pasta were very delicious, but the portions were very small! Especially the soft scrambled eggs. For $12, you got a small bowl of eggs and a few pieces of toast & the flavor wasn't anything spectacular. Definitely ended the meal still hungry.

4.0,8/10/2016,"What an aesthetically pleasing dining experience! The restaurant itself is impeccably designed, and everything you order will arrive looking like a piece of art. This was fitting when I went, as my date and I were getting lunch before admiring art upstairs at The Whitney. We had the lobster salsa with chips, beef tartare on sourdough, and then shared the roasted and fried chicken. The lobster salsa was a bit underwhelming for me, but the other dishes both blew us away. We were amazed at how chicken can usually be so bland at restaurants, but this plate was particularly memorable. The contrasting textures mixed with the sweetness of the slaw made for a GREAT bite. Also worthy of note is the cheddar biscuits and red pepper jam they give you before the meal... They were to die for. I would definitely return to Untitled to try more beautiful, delicious creations.",2,1,3,Jessica G.,"Manhattan, NY",263,107,189
1.0,8/9/2016,"I'm surprised at the good reviews here- this was literally the worst lunch I've ever had in the city. We stopped in for a light lunch - salad and some oysters. We ordered the goat cheese salad, the lettuce was soggy and the dressing was so acidic it made the entire dish completely sour. I couldn't eat it, and tried to just eat the goat cheese because I wa starving and we were in a rush, so there was no time to send it back and wait for something else, I figured I'd just enjoy my oysters. The oysters were overly salted (it tasted like someone poured rock salt over them) and had some sort of ranch dressing in them. Not sure why you'd do anything to oysters at all except maybe put a lemon on the side or something? Literally gagged after eating them, was so disgusting I wanted to vomit after we left. I like my oysters briny but that was just like having a mouthful of salt. Luckily the wait staff is lovely, which was the only enjoyable thing during our lunch here.

4.0,8/9/2016,"After many times of booking and cancelling, I was finally lucky enough to have some free time to try Untitled at the Whitney, with the added bonus of having Mike Solomonov in the kitchen as a guest chef that night. The space has a very casual, yet elevated vibe, and I do like the glass encasing around the dining area, which allows for a lot of natural light. Also, I'm always a fan of the open kitchen, and it was really cool to see both Chef Anthony and Solomonov giving direction to the sous chefs throughout the meal. What we got:- Hummus with fava beans (guest chef menu)- Salatim (guest chef menu)- Oysters on the half shell (regular menu)- Smoked sable toad in a hole (guest chef menu)- Fluke crudo (regular menu)- green bean blini (regular menu)- Short rib with fried cauliflower and rice (guest chef menu)My favorites were the hummus (duh), the smoked sable with egg in the hole, the oysters, and the short rib. The hummus was super velvety as usual, just like at Dizengoff. The smoked sable was a very unique texture, and the runny egg on top was just great. The oysters had a really clean, creamy finish, which I really enjoyed. The short rib, while not a large portion, definitely had a great texture, and the fried cauliflower was a great accompaniment. Service was very attentive and friendly, and gave us great recommendations. We both were very pleased with the wine that we got, and just felt very comfortable. The prices are a bit on the expensive side, especially for a cafe-type setting, but the food was well-plated and executed, so at least you know you're getting a great meal.Definitely a great place to have a meal after touring the Whitney museum.

4.0,7/13/2016,"Overall, cleanly executed New American style. The chicken main does seem quite good, the beef tartare is worth getting, the spring onion can be skipped. I was a bit disappointed that in this season, the dessert menu doesn't have more fruit-centric options. Best dessert on the menu is the lemon meringueStarters:Spring Onion Dip: mild and creamy, with the allium coming in at the end. Wheat crackers were very thin but had an interesting nutty flavorTartare: bread was a little too hard, broccoli puree wasn't over powering, chinese five spice really bumped up the savoriness. I wasn't sure why the beef had a milky color but it tasted fresh. Beef had a nice chew and the garlic chips provided aroma .Main: Sea Bass: very tender and fresh, albeit not much browning. Probably a quick pan fry (low temp) followed by a hot oven. The curry was very lightly flavored with coconut, with some okra helping thicken it up. Corn and lentils, I believe. The bass was decent on the merit of its freshness but everything else was fairly boring.D esserts:Caramelized cheesecake: light, almost mousse like cheesecake with a cake base underneath. The custard blanketing the cheesecake on top was caramelized nicely. Honeycomb candy has a nice initial crunch followed by a sticky gummy chew. Cheesecake is nicely tart and balanced. The bottom cake layer may have been moistened with a bit of flower water? Perhaps orange blossom or rose waterPeanut Butter Blueberry Cake- really disappointing, despite the waitress telling us it was the dessert the restaurant opened with. I thought the cake was over beatened, leading to a very stiff cake crumb that felt somewhat dry. Buttercream was decent, not over sweetened. Blueberry sauce was pretty standardLemon meringue: nice light meringue, possibly hints of lemon zest in the meringue itself. The curd was whipped to more of a mousse like texture. Very bright and zingy. Good balance between tart and sweet. Great summer dessert. Also, the crust has some nuttiness thanks to oats and possible browned butter",1,0,0,Nick H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",358,320,790

5.0,7/3/2016,"This restaurant is one of my current favorites in the city. The menu is short, built around seasonal ingredients. It changes often but usually there's something with fried chicken as the basis and it's fantastic. (In the spring it was along a chicken and dumplings theme, now in summer the chicken has a BBQ theme) Vegetarians will find great options here.  The wine list is also interesting. Save room for dessert and be sure to see the flower arrangements on the service area. Reservations at least a few days in advance are a good idea. Service is great and at a deliberate European pace so you don't feel rushed from the first second. Make a day of it by getting museum tickets in advance online. Walk the High Line all the way to the museum, have lunch then enjoy the exhibits.A very special thank you to some staff- Jason, a manager gifted us with some muffins and scones to take home on a recent visit.

5.0,6/25/2016,"On two occasions, I've taken one of my favorite people to Untitled, the first time because I'd heard it was an excellent restaurant, and the second, because I'd confirmed it. I typically rate restaurants on a combination of their ambiance, service, and food, borrowed from Zagat. And the ambiance at Untitled is open, warm, and welcoming. The interior doesn't absorb as much noise as it should, so a loud party nearby might drown you out a bit, but the space *feels* great. The service is top-notch. No arrogance. No attitude. Only a desire to create for you a memorable, positive experience. And now the food. Simply put, it's extraordinary. Take small bites at Untitled -- let yourself experience the subtlety of the perfectly balanced range of flavors brought into a single dish. The chefs have a masterful understanding of our palate, and it's represented in every dish I've had there. For the main course, I'd recommend their fish dishes over most others, in part because what they bring into their kitchen from the market is impossibly fresh, and then because of the creative preparations that lead to heavenly dining experiences. Top recommendations on the June 2016 menu: Raw: Fluke aguachile, cherry tomato, cashew -- incredibly flavorful, I found this goes very well with a martini, which they prepare perfectlyMain course: Cobia, fried rice, sugar snap peas, pickled carrots -- to die forVegetables: Asparagus, egg salad, trout roe -- a unique flavor that I very much enjoyedI'm not a dessert person, but I do love an espresso after dinner, and unfortunately this isn't an option at Untitled.

This was a bad start.* Inquired about the Neighborhood menu and ordering off it since it's Monday and we are from the neighborhood.  Got the runaround from Chicken Lady telling us it's only for the bar but the expressions on her face told me lies.  Nowhere does it say on website or actual menu it is for the bar.  Said she'd get back to us.  Never got back to us.  Asked waitress after we placed our drink and dinner order and told her what happened and informed her we had to look at the Neighborhood menu on phone.  Waitress tells us they have to check with kitchen first to see if we can order from that menu.  What's the real answer?  We end up ordering 3 more dishes from that menu.* Gave us breadbasket with 2 slices of bread for 4 diners.  Asked for more bread since lamb meatballs had great sauce.  Bread did not arrive.  Asked again, different person.  Took 10 mins. to arrive.  Why?  Now the sauce be ice cold.* Cleared table while one guest was still obviously eating.  She had to tell them "" I'm still eating""... so now table is clear but only she gots plates in front of her.  A bit ridiculous.* Since we ordered 3 more dishes off Neighborhood menu and one appetizer still had not arrived and our table was cleared for entrees, we informed waitress to cancel that dish.  She said it was still coming out but with our entrees.  No other explanation was given.  Bizarre.* Where was the meat in the gnocci entree?  Ghost cow?We ordered drinks (2 rounds), more appetizers than needed, entrees for each of us, and one dessert since we ate like pigs.  The bill was substantial and we tipped 20%.  So if that Chicken Lady from the beginning was afraid we were gonna be cheap your ass be wrong.  The food was good but the entire experience and service was not altho our waitress was nice.  Even tho we from da hood, not sure if we gonna return.  It really be too bad since service and hospitality is the one thing that is a given at all D.

Was actually able to see my friends while talking with them haha. It also wasn't overcrowded. Didn't like the drinks. Wouldn't order them again. Food was okay - favorites were the beef tartare, smoked fish cream, and the fried and roasted chicken dish. What made this place a four star place, and not a three star, was definitely the desserts.

We shared the banana cake dessert, which was fantastic, not at all like any banana cake I've had (it was my friend's idea, I'm usually not a fan) -- with many tastes and textures from soft to crunchy.

4.0,1/23/2016,"You know when you're an adult when you're visiting the Whitney on a Friday night with the boy for date night. However, date night at the Whitney somehow ended up just being a quick 30 minute walk around the Whitney and date night at Untitled. Got the fluke and the cauliflower dishes. Fluke was not bad, but the cauliflower was the real hit. The fish lover in me is still incredulous that I would still order the vegetables over the fish. I blame that cardamon custard. So delicious. And light! After reading the Eater article on Untitled's layer cake, dessert was a must. I must admit, Chef Miro really knows how to make a solid banana cake, almost as good as my mother's and combined with the hazelnut buttercream frosting and the crunch, I almost wanted to lick the plate. However, the adult in me put the foot down. On the same note, the crunch is what really made the cake and if there was anything to really add to the cake, I would add more crunch, because it was just so unbelievably delicious, sweet, salty and then with that buttercream, perfect combo of sweet, salty, savory, fluffy, and crunch. Yummy...The meringue also is not bad and the lemon curd just kills it. Like I would order that lemon curd to go and just eat it with a spoon and maybe some meringue...However, the real star of the evening was the bartender, Rocky!

Service was very good, tentative, and informative.Had the ""Untitled Cocktail"" which at the time was a very funky (in a good way) apple cider. Tasted dry but can't really explain much further. Just very unique for a cider and very mysterious.Mains and sides were great! Cauliflower side with cardamom had a very floral taste. Recommended for vegetable lovers. Spinach Fettuccine with Shitaki Mushrooms was very savory but not overpowering. Same with the Fried/Roast Chicken - nothing overpowering. However, the kale with the chicken dish was deliciously mushy - you wouldn't think something of that consistency would taste good but it does. Nothing too salty either as most American food tends to be.Dessert was a bit of disappointment though (although they have many other options than the two we had). The banana hazelnut praline cake was a giant slice of cake but was like a refrigerator cake. A bit too sweet. The milk-to-cookie ratio was laughably low on our other dish (I should've asked for more milk) but the cookie part was good.But overall, top-tier service, good ambiance, great food aside from the dessert.

2.0,1/17/2016,"So I am new to Yelp-usually not into this reviewing thing but after having brunch here today and seeing all these glowing reviews need to add my 2 cents. Preamble- we spend money on food and wine-Relais & Chateaux, tasting menus at 4 stars, etc. Total bill for brunch for 3 was $250.00 sans tip. This place is wildly overpriced and presumptuous. Hash entree with kimchee, fried egg etc was $29. Neither food cost or complexity of the dish merited a price of $29. Plus with kimchee in description you would expect some spice or bite or something--totally bland. Had to ask for pepper since salt and pepper are not provided on table. Here is where we are presumptuous-our food is so perfectly seasoned you do not need to season. Incorrect. And by not providing it on the table, you are making the customer (those who might not be assertive) not ask for fear of offending the kitchen. I asked for pepper-it was agreeably presented. Other guests both had the fritatta-$25.  Also overpriced-maybe they get 8 slices out of the whole-when you think of it that way they are charging $200 for an item where the food cost is the lowest, regardless of how much the price of eggs has risen. Dessert-toffee cake-worth $10 as opposed to cookie with milk $8--how can you charge $8 for a cookie? The kitchen is happy screaming every time someone orders the cookie!Perhaps prices driven by an insane rent cost--and on that point- the external view is odd-when you approach from Washington Street you  cannot identify it by any sign and it looks like a museum cafeteria. If they are making money, they should clean or change some of the chairs--one of ours had seriously stained/dirty fabric.Service attentive and pleasant.All in all, would not go again-",1,0,0,Alex D.,"Mahwah, NJ",0,19,0

5.0,1/14/2016,"Love everything about this restaurant. The atmosphere, the service, the food.Came here with my lovely friend Celia Z. that recommended this place. Everything in the menu was listed without a title. They divide it based on section, Section 1 on the menu is most likely dip such as fondue, Section 2 is some small raw appetizer, Section 3 is vegetable appetizer, Section 4 is main entree (if I remember it correctly there are only 4 sections). We asked for recommendation and went ahead with these:Fluke: it is raw but it blend well with all the other ingredients such as ikura and carrots with some sauce.Roasted Cauliflower: from section 3, the cauliflower is roasted perfectly with their own special sauce. Surprisingly vegetable is my favorite dish here. The waiter told us that everything on Section 3 are his favorite and we can totally just do like a tasting menu and just order 5 of the items and it will fill us up.Monk Fish from the entree: we decided to share everything and they split it half for us. The way the waiter describe the sauce with it was really interesting. It was blend with Go Chu Jang sauce if you are familiar with Korean spices. I love it. It was also topped with some radish.Dessert: we went with their signature banana hazelnut with some cranberry sauce around. I like it without the sauce. It tasted like banana with nutela sauce just without the chocolate.. I loved it and I think I can have another piece.. They made it with REAL hazelnut!!!Bread: their bread with salted butter spread was  served warm.. WIN!!I will definitely return some time.

The glass-restaurant gives off the ambiance like you're eating outdoors in an airy space.

Best black bass I have ever had! So moist and the skin was so crispy. This was perfection. I was just so surprised how this tasted beyond perfect...this dish was enough to give this place 5 stars. My friends ordered the roasted and fried chicken accompanied with kale, radicchio and the country rib with apple, caraflex cabbage, brussels sprouts. They all loved their dishes as well.For dessert, we ordered the Banana hazelnut praline cake with concord grape, the sticky toffee cake, pears, chai, and the chocolate hot fudge cake with raspberries.

This dish was OK; it wasn't anything special for me.Beef tartare: SO GOOD! Great taste and texture, and one of the most interesting beef tartares I can remember.Black bass with spaghetti squash and shiso: this was a light dish and had a very Asian feel to it. It made me feel healthy :) the fish was cooked well and the spaghetti squash was a great accompaniment. Country rib: I had a bite and all I remember is that I liked it. Not very memorable - not that that's a bad thing though.Fried chicken: Delicious! and juicy and moist. I had food envy. I always forget how good the chicken is at fancy places (whereas I avoid ordering the chicken at most other places, since it is often dry and sad).Pumpkin cheesecake: I don't like pumpkin, so I didn't like this.

5.0,11/16/2015,"The first time I came here was pretty soon after the new Whitney had opened, and the museum's space is perfectly designed for the type of art it displays. Likewise, Untitled's airy, open, but still intimate dining room is a perfect fit for its accessibly creative cuisine. Many restaurants in NYC elevate food as an art form, and Untitled is especially conscious of this. Much like the Whitney's art, Untitled's food veers modern, American, and sometimes surprising. Some of the dishes have a little too much going on to really appreciate each element of the composition. And, the menu is seasonal, so the ""Yelp picks"" are probably heavy on items that were around when Untitled first opened. A few things that I've enjoyed over the summer and fall:Lobster Toast with Preserved Lemon: this tastes like summer and is presented beautifullyBeets with yogurt and verbena: I may be biased, since I will eat beets in pretty much any dish. But still, this is a solid take on a classic beet salad.Pole beans: I can't remember ever having beans this flavorful, wow!Roasted and fried chicken: I've had this a few times and it always delights me; the chicken is delicious and I love the contrasting textures.Desserts: everyone goes gaga over the gluten free chocolate chip cookie, but I found it kinda meh. To me, the peanut butter blueberry crunch cake was a standout (though I think this was a summer item); on the current menu, the banana hazelnut praline cake with concord grape is terrific and tastes like the fanciest PB&J you'll ever have. Recently, I also had the pumpkin cheesecake, which was excellent (and I'm not usually a cheesecake or pumpkin spice kinda girl). You gotta order dessert here, it's an imperative.Drinks menu: the cocktails aren't the most spectacularly creative ones you'll find in the city, but they're good. Personally, I'd go for wine here, as they have a very well-curated wine list.

5.0,11/2/2015,"During the past summer, I visited several world-class museums and consequently had the opportunity to try out a few cafeterias in those museums, with emphasis on the word cafeteria. Untitled at the Whitney, is not one of those places. The space is large, has an industrial feel, and blends indoors and out with floor-to-ceiling glass windows and natural and man-made elements. Blond wood frame the open kitchen and contrast with the concrete walls and limestone floors. I like the large light fixtures that lined up across the room. There is also outdoor seating available.More importantly for me, the quality of the food distinguishes this restaurant from other restaurants, let alone those located within museums. For one thing, even the soda was creative.  So much so, that I had to try the mango-lime one. Different and good. The temperature-perfect butter was served on a marble tile, with a carved wood butter knife, and rolls were served nestled neatly in a small wood box. Yes, these are incidentals to the meal but details matter.For the meal itself, the pork fritters appetizer had a pulled pork-like texture, and were coated and fried crispy. These small bites were savory and were accompanied by a sweet corn relish and a thick remoulade. They were topped with a complex mixture that included yellow mustard seeds and diced onions.I've been craving swordfish lately and could not resist it grilled. The thick and meaty chunks of fish sat on eggplant and were topped with charred shishito peppers and tomato vinaigrette. This light entrée allowed me to indulge in dessert. Okay, two desserts - it was my birthday eve.The peanut butter and ginger cake with a creamy peanut butter buttercream frosting was studded with blueberries and served with blueberry sauce. That alone was incredible. However, what made the dish even more creative and flavorful was the sweet toasted sesame and peanut brittle that adorned the cake. I cannot begin to describe the level of mad genius creativity that went into the dessert.I also had a bite or two of the gigantic triple chocolate (dark, milk and white) chunk cookie, served with a small cold bottle of vanilla-infused milk. The cookie was crispy, chewy, chocolatey and chunky. In other words, it was dessert nirvana.Service was fantastic. The servers were warmly attentive and friendly. The pace of the meal was perfect.

I did not have any but was told it was delicious.I then had the swordfish for my entree and I found it to be perfectly portioned and very tasty.

5.0,10/17/2015,"Terrific Venue not to be Confused for the Whitney's Dining CafeWe really enjoyed our dinner while the sun set over the Hudson (a spectacular visual experience in the dining room).  Here is a my short summary:Very solid, straight forward new american cuisine served in a landmark architectural space;  we really enjoyed the entire experience with the exception of the utilitarian bathrooms which perplexed us.  Even if it seems redundant to dine here after visiting the new Whitney, I absolutely recommend that you do.  It completes the Whitney experience and Untitled already ranks as one of the best restaurants in the Meatpacking District.**Last week in Mid December, to kill time I chose a seat at the bar in lieu of taking advantage of my Whitney membership for a quick visit.  I was hungry.  Anyway, to make a long story short, I was treated like a king.  It was the strangest thing.  The bartender, who was so gracious (he called himself 'Rocky') brought the manager out to meet me. THAT and the Upper East Side women adjacent to me at the bar asking me questions about my favorite NYC restaurants and thoughts on Sunchokes (Jerusalem artichokes) had me convinced that I was mistaken for a journalist who writes reviews.  Sorry, I know this section was more about me than ""Untitled"" but maybe this is the norm for well-dressed men dining alone at the bar.",0,0,0,Robert M.,"Titusville, NJ",0,8,0
5.0,10/7/2015,"Loved my afternoon lunch here with a dear friend. Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs and we ordered what felt like the entire menu!! My favorites were: Ruby red shrimp, peppers, emmer, okra - umm yum!! These had a grain as well and were just juicy and delightful! Grilled toast with ricotta and peaches was wonderful, with fresh basil, toasted bread and sweet peaches. Fluke, thai lime, celery had dill and was so refreshing. Smoked arctic char, grapes, tea was also good but I preferred the fluke. Corn, freekeh, parmesan came in a broth and was almost like a soup. The corn was so sweet! Roasted and fried chicken, kale, radicchio is a chicken salad and one of the most unique I've had. I loved that the fried chicken was without bones so you can just dig right in. Of extreme importance is the triple chocolate chunk cookie with milk. Words cannot describe my reaction when taking a bite of this cookie... But I'll try. Pure bliss for starters. There is milk chocolate, dark chocolate, and white chocolate and the most insane part of all is that this cookie is gluten free! Hello, best cookie ever!

Everything was good and well-executed, but nothing was particularly adventurous. The portions of the plates also varied widely - some were at least twice as large as others. The highlight of the meal for me was definitely dessert. The strawberry ricotta pound cake was light, summery, and creamy with just a bit of sweet, and the peanut butter blueberry crunch cake was an amazing combination of flavors and textures. Both were also unexpectedly generously portioned.Service can be a little slow at times, but the wait staff was friendly and extremely good at accommodating my table's request for vegetarian-only food. The waiter even mentioned that there was lard in the lemon verbena pie's crust and that gelatin was used in the panna cotta. That level of attention is detail is just impressive.

One reason we decided to eat here was because of a recent article saying that some restaurants are being designed now so that diners can actually talk to each in s normal tone other instead of shouting. The tables are spaced far enough apart and somehow the acoustics work. No shouting was necessary. As far as service, it is excellent. We counted 8 servers who assisted us, but they were not overwhelming, but appeared just when we needed them. The menu was challenging, but in a fun way. We kept looking up terms that we were not familiar with - nearly every dish had one. Such as ""emmer"" and ""guanciale"". We all enjoyed our dinners - swordfish, fettuccini, kale salad, interesting soft drinks, our- all were very good.

4.0,9/13/2015,"Came here for lunch with my mom one day before entering the Whitney. Since we came impromptu without a reservation, it took us nearly 45 minutes to be seated outside. I will not hold this against them, however, since the place is quite popular and it seems many people made reservations beforehand, but keep this in mind if you are planning to make a trip out here. We ordered the pole beans, calamari & hazelnuts ($16), the sea scallops, tomato & peach gazpacho ($14), and the ruby red shrimp, peppers, emmer, okra ($15). We also shared the strawberry ricotta pound cake, pistachios ($10). The gazpacho was my favorite hands-down, with the raw scallops being extremely flavorful, accompanied by the sweetness of the peach.The pole beans dish had a great sauce, but not so many pieces of calamari. If I were to come back just for a quick bite, the cake would be a great choice, since it's not too big, but very well-done.  Overall, the food was very good, and the ingredients tasted fresh.

5.0,8/31/2015,"Imagine your perfect summer Saturday date: Start with a brunch at Untitled, followed by a couple of hours wondering in Whitney, then walk along the High Line when the sun is setting. Untitled gave me a very positive beginning of this date. We ordered Pole beans, Oysters, golden tilefish, and chicken salad. I love the string beans in the chicken salad, extremely fresh like they were just harvested. Also, the golden tilefish is divine. The corn and the curried squash added an interesting touch to the fish, balancing the sweet aftertaste. When the waiter asked me how I enjoyed the oysters, I said it was a bit too sour for my personal taste. The waiter was so attentive and immediately asked if we'd like to try something else. I appreciated his kind gesture and didn't accept the offer because I thought it wasn't his fault that I ordered this dish and it was just my personal opinion. Maybe other people would love it instead.However, it didn't stop him from going out of his way to make sure we had a wonderful dining experience. He brought me back a complimentary dish and hoped I would like this on the house dish better. I don't think it's on the menu. It's a dish of fluke, melon, and a touch of lime. I loved it very much! It tasted like summer! The dish preserved the original flavors of all the ingredients and everything was perfectly balanced.

5.0,8/24/2015,"IN SHORT: Danny Meyer's newest restaurant venture on the ground floor of the new Whitney Museum serves clever, clear, and colorful dishes with local influences and broad appeal, making it your next dining destination in the city.THE STORY: Not surprisingly, people come to me for individual restaurant suggestions quite often. Most of the time they're looking for a place to eat in a certain neighborhood, and while I think my mind is naturally organized in relation to the city grid, I always like to remind friends that where you are shouldn't dictate where you eat, rather, where you eat should determine where you are. Regardless, if you really need to find a place to dine in Midtown East, I can probably help you out.But other times, people ask me to suggest just a new, fun restaurant that they should try for a casual dinner with friends and family. Lately, the only answer I've been giving to this question is simply, ""Untitled.""Because Untitled will certainly be everyone's Favorite New Restaurant and New Favorite Restaurant right after the first meal. It's a restaurant that has a truly uncanny ability to make you think ""I want to be a regular here so badly"" the moment you walk out the door with a complimentary chocolate chip cookie to take home because you were too full after 8 courses to order dessert but were clearly pining for it when you saw it arrive on neighboring tables, and of course your waiter took notice and packed one up for you.Untitled is able to capture this affect so well, because everything at the restaurant is already working nearly perfectly.While some naysayers have commented on the harshness and sternness of the interior space, I have to politely disagree. Taste may be a matter of personal discretion, but Untitled is one of the most beautiful artistically and architecturally rendered restaurants to arrive in New York this year. Pops of red from the plush, deeply comfortable Saarinen chairs color the space, while round domes of soft yellow light guide the eye in a procession toward Renzo Piano's sleek curtain wall that frames a particularly lush section at the end of the High Line. There is a warmth and ease in the energy around the tables and the bar, making the space inherently comfortable for grabbing a quick drink or enjoying a long, drawn out meal.The transition from space to concept to food is seamless at Untitled, where Michael Anthony of Gramercy Tavern is leading the kitchen, and where the transparency to the exterior means the food is inspired by a bounty of bright vegetation and planting nearby, and the flavors are thus fresh, clear, and vibrant.Rightfully so, vegetables are treated with a particular dynamic and imaginative energy. Our table eased into the meal with a bowl of chilled peas seasoned with salt, pepper, and chamomile for an ineffable, herbal air, and soaked lightly in a panna cotta butter, whose creaminess hinted at the silky texture of the chickpea hummus that we would next enjoy with bright cherry tomatoes.Just like the visual experience of the museum and this corner of the city at the terminus of the High Line, there is both exuberance and sophistication in each of the plates. The Yellowtail Flounder with radish and roe was intensely citrusy, yet quick and light on the palette, while the Pole Beans with calamari and hazelnuts were quickly grilled, allowing the flavors to remain strong, nutty, and juicy.There is a welcome contrast with the Corn Flatbread with bacon and okra, whose creamy, rich, southern flavors balance the more ethereal notes of the earlier vegetable plates while still remaining colorful and energetic. The Duck Sausage with mustard sauce was also tender and sweet with a distinct peppery bite, an elegant transition before the Smoked Spare Ribs served alongside apricots and caraflex cabbage. Each flavor manages to stand out with precision on the plates, particularly in the Artichoke Fettuccine, swirled around in a medley of swiss chard, black olives, and tomatoes, for alternating notes of richness, acidity, and bitterness.The menu from which I composed my spontaneous tasting is indeed inventive, connecting these many distinct flavors with clarity, focus, and excitement, much like the city and the museum do themselves. The staff that guides each guest through the meal is also a special brand of charming, and eagerly tries to connect the diners to the food and its surroundings, though from start to finish, the restaurant is so conceptually, architecturally, and culinarily strong that their joy and authenticity just complete an already extraordinary experience.So where should you eat next? Untitled. Because if Untitled isn't the Best New Restaurant and New Best Restaurant on your agenda, I'm not sure what will be.",2,0,1,Ali M.,"New York, NY",31,234,245

The outside seating looked wonderful for when it's nice outside. The waitress rec 2-3 dishes not including per person (1-2) for lunch.  The portions are small so be aware. Comp bread is just that, nothing exciting. We started with the fluke which was well seasoned and nectarine toast was delish (you dress the bread yourself). The beets were good but not unique IMO. For mains we got the chicken salad which was highly rec by waitress and other yelpers. It's a few pieces of battered and fried and then skin on pieces with a well dressed salad underneath. The artichoke fettuccine was good also. The cookie wasn't all that to me and the pound cake was a small slice with a scoop of ricotta on top drenched with sabayon.  I wasn't impressed with dessert at all but maybe I chose wrong?Id say there are better places in nyc for this kind of cuisine but I will give this place time to mature and come back later.",1,0,0,Thy L.,"Brooklyn, NY",71,327,399

Overall impression: it was a lovely dining experience with solid food and excellent service. I highly recommend taking a tour of the museum as well, especially the outdoor experiences, which are beautiful views of the best city in the world.My husband and I had reservations for a Saturday night at 5 PM and we were seated promptly despite being about 15 minutes late. The outdoor dining looked popular, but inside the dining room was about half full at the time. It was more crowded when we left for the museum around 7 PM.As stated in many reviews, the service was outstanding. It was also subtle. Our waiter, Giovanni, was very friendly and thoughtful, answered all questions knowledgeably and also offered suggestions based on what he could decipher of our tastes - and he was on point.The highlights here: +Pork fritters, although the portions are ridiculously small, IMO.+Kale salad (lots of texture and flavor)+Swordfish (cooked to perfection)+Our courses were paced perfectly; kudos to Giovanni, who knew when to fire them.+The wine and beverage list was awesome. I would happily go back to sit at the bar for drinks and small bites.+My glasses were never more than 1/3 empty, including my wine. Service was never intrusive, either.Other than that...-The ""appetizer"" portions are far too small. We received four, thumb-sized pork fritters and three thumb-sized lamb meatballs ($12 each dish). I might order the pork fritters again, but would prefer a whole bowl of them.-The desserts that everyone raves about are... just OK, especially the peanut butter blueberry crunch cake. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious and nothing was wrong with it. It simply wasn't anything to write home about (oh the irony, as I write about it on Yelp...)

4.0,7/29/2015,"Untitled is an excellent new addition to Danny Meyer's restaurant empire, serving certainly the best food I have ever had inside a museum. The dishes, and especially the deserts, are inventive and very tasty. While perhaps not the best restaurant in the immediate area hands down, this is a great new spot.I went with the Lobster and Preserved Lemon Toast to start which was fresh, light, and amazingly delicious. It is served with shishito peppers which complement the dish really well. This was probably the best thing I ordered besides the cookie.I also had the Fried and Roasted Chicken Salad which was almost as good. It is a take on the thai style of a cold pulled chicken salad enlivened with big hunks of piping hot fried chicken. It is definitely unique and definitely extremely good.Dessert here though is completely bonkers. I came alone and still got both the Peanut Butter Blueberry Crunch Cake and the Triple Chocolate Chunk Cookie with Milk. The Chocolate Chunk Cookie was, in my opinion, the better of the two. The three different kinds of chocolate and the dense, buttery heft of the cookie are just really addicting.The cake, though, is probably one of the better cakes I've had recently, studded in sesame peanut brittle, striped with a peanut butter buttercream, and drizzled with a blueberry syrup. Honestly, it is isn't as sweet and overwhelming as you might expect and it did taste amazing, but the cookie definitely deserves the hype.BTW when I came here there was a family sitting next to me with two kids that looked like they were about 8 or 9 and both kids really enjoyed their meals (they ordered basically what I did) and kept saying aloud how the food reminded them of the cooking shows that they love .I think that this alone is a testament to Untitled. Any place that can appeal to jaded foodies and conscientious 8 year olds is one pretty amazing place.",0,0,0,Paul A.,"New York, NY",270,403,462
5.0,7/28/2015,Amazing!! The food and service were beyond excellent and you can't go wrong with whatever you want to order. We went to celebrate my husband's birthday and they gave him a complimentary dessert to celebrate. The service was genuine and nice.

5.0,7/27/2015,"Yesterday we celebrated my 60 th birthday with brunch at Untitled and a tour of the new Whitney Museum. The lobster on toast appetizer was amazing, my daughters artichoke pasta was amazing, the calamari w pole beans and hazelnuts was outstanding, and on and on. The menu looks simple and at first I didn't get it- but server Jason made it all come alive with great descriptions that were spot on. The deserts were a home runs, but the unusual combination of peanut butter, a small peanut brittle and blueberry cake was beyond belief. It was definitely good as art and a meal we will never forget!

4.0,7/26/2015,"The savories were good, but the sweets and service take the cake.Jason, our waiter, went above and beyond to make it easy for our group of four to share plates, from cutting the lobster toast into four pieces, to ensuring that the chocolate chip cookie dessert had four glasses of mini milks because ""milk is really hard to share."" For the sweets - the strawberry sponge cake was my favorite - it was light and chock full of petite strawberries. The peanut butter cake with the peanut brittle topping was also on point. The chocolate cookie tasted like a standard warm chocolate chip cookie to me, but one of my friends was obsessed with it.I thought the entrees (tilefish and artichoke linguini) were better than the appetizers (duck sausage and lobster toast). Word of warning: Portion sizes on the entrees are on the smaller side.Overall, a delightful experience, and one that I'd return to again if I were in the area.",0,1,0,Tammy K.,"New York, NY",71,224,19
5.0,7/25/2015,"On a recent and brilliant summer Saturday around lunchtime, we climbed down from the High Line to find an outdoor table for four at the new restaurant ""Untitled at the Whitney"" available. With no reservations, we were a bit surprised such a high-profile new restaurant would be able to seat us at a prime outdoor table on such a nice day on a whim. Which it was. And it was a very good omen. For starters, we ordered glasses of wine and four dishes to share: the corn and okra flatbread, turnips with quanciale, fried oysters with corn relish and a main course of swordfish with eggplant and shishito peppers. The first three dishes arrived in a few minutes. They were great. I won't go into detail about them, because this story is more about the service than the food. But don't get me wrong; the food was spectacular. We were enjoying the last of these first three dishes, along with the wine and the sunshine, when the waiter came to us with an effusive apology. ""I'm sorry, I don't know what's holding up the swordfish. To make up for it we are offering you either a complimentary second round of wine or a round of desserts."" We were shocked. We thought the pace of service was fine. But that didn't stop us from taking him up on his offer. Two more glasses of wine and two desserts were the result. A few minutes later, another staffer arrived at the table with two dishes we had not ordered (cucumbers with soba, and fluke with radish and sorrel). They also came with an apology for the tardy swordfish. It seems the waiter and this emissary from the kitchen had not compared notes. I'm sure they soon discovered the duplication, but they were nonetheless happy to provide all these extras. In very short order the additional wine arrived along with the swordfish. Our complimentary desserts were the delightful peanut butter blueberry cake and the chamomile panna cotta. Again, though the food was fantastic, it was the level of service that was extraordinary. Shortly, a congenial young man was clearing dishes from our table while we relaxed and chatted. A few moments later, another young server stopped by to say: ""That's what I love about this place. That man clearing your table was our sommelier. Everyone here does everything."" Was it a newcomer's flush of eagerness to please, a fluke of kindness that won't last? Only time will tell. But Untitled was on that sunny day about the best place we could have landed--on a whim.",2,2,2,Neal W.,"New York, NY",1,10,2
3.0,7/22/2015,"We felt fortunate to get a table in a quiet spot outdoors at this new restaurant at the Whitney. The menu lists ingredients but no descriptions of the items. The waiter had to explain each and every one of them to us. The waiters fingernails were filthy, as if he had just come off a construction site. Apparently there is no inspection by a supervisor prior to starting a work shift.Once we ordered, service was quick. However, we had to ask for bread and butter. It was not automatically brought to the table.  The server did not seem happy when we asked for this.Prices were on the high side considering the small portion size.We all agreed we would come back to see how the restaurant evolves.

We had the lobster toast, marinated mussels, carrots, cauliflower and pasta with asparagus.  All of the items were divine: light, fresh and flavorful. The lobster toasts were like a fresher and more elevated lobster roll and melted in my mouth.  I normally wouldn't order mussels but with the different beans these were an amazing spin.  The vegetables stood out above everything.  The carrots were sweet with a kick of heat and the cauliflower in a delectable creamy sauce that was light and bright.  Lastly, the pasta - oddly shaped but perfectly al dente also stood out.  Props to the kitchen who seperated it for us to share.

I came here on a sunny summer day meeting a friend for brunch. The restaurant is bright and airy. Menu is eclectic, vegetable-centric.  like this pole beans, calamari and hazelnuts  served along with spicy, tomato sauce. It is healthy and delish! The beans are lightly grilled, slightly crunchy and subtle sweetness.  The toasted hazelnuts lends are nutty and has chocolate fragrance.  Bright color and beautiful composition just icing on the cake. I also got the Marinated mussels , fava beans and yellow eye peas in mint  & fava purée. It's summer in a bowl! Lovely greens! Top it with basil paprika salt and beansprouts.

5.0,7/17/2015,"I usually run out to try Danny Meyer restaurants since they're always good, but I dragged my feet in trying to go to Untitled because I thought it was more of a fine dining spot with the types of food I'm not usually interested in. Also, it's one of those places that keeps their OpenTable perpetually booked even though they seem to keep a ton of space for walk-ins, so I was always deterred by checking for reservations and seeing only 5 PM and 10 PM spots available.But then all of the blogs started raving about the Triple Chocolate Chip Cookie, so I knew I had to go eat here. Also, I happened to need to eat early, and I saw a good early bird special spot at 5:30 PM a day before going here and grabbed it.Located way out west right by the West Side Highway, the glass-enclosed restaurant is beautiful. There is some outdoor seating, which I normally like when it's at a place that's not directly on the street, but we skipped it due to the humidity, and it was just as good since the place feels so open and bright.Every bite was delicious, starting with the excellent little hot rolls of bread. The menu has one section for really small bites, followed by a bunch of appetizers and lastly a handful of entrees. We tried a few from each section, basically picking only the stuff with meat in it:- Pork Fritters with Corn Relish ($10 for 3)These excellent little pork nuggets got the meal off to a great start. They were so small I wanted another order though.- Duck Sausage and Mustard Sauce ($9)Another great starter, the small pieces of cut up sausage were delicious. Very simple, but it tasted great with just the mustard sauce, and it was a good example of the attractive plating present in every dish.- Corn Flatbread, Bacon, Day Lilies ($13)One of the larger appetizers, this was great as well. Crispy on the edges but very soft otherwise, the small bits of bacon and corn sprinkled throughout were delicious. - Cheddar Potatoes, Basil, Tomatoes, Chicken Gravy ($11)They actually brought this one out with the entrees, which makes sense since it's more of a side dish. Like a bowl of really creamy mashed potatoes, and more liquidy than expected, it was still very enjoyable and it went well with the chicken dish.- Roasted and Fried Chicken, Kale, Radicchio ($24)This was awesome, especially the fried chicken pieces (obviously). The dish consists of a few pieces of both roasted and fried chicken placed on top of some of kale and covered with some bright radicchio. Both types of chicken were incredibly juicy and flavorful enough so that you won't regret ordering the chicken.- Smoked Spare Ribs, Apricots, Caraflex Cabbage ($26)These were pretty good as well. Served with fancier wet naps, these are best eaten with your hands, which is another nod toward this place being much more casual than it might seem from just perusing the menu and hearing about some of the food like I did.On to dessert, which I always find to be especially good at Danny Meyer restaurants. Like many of his other places, there were just too many good choices, but we eventually settled on just a few even though I wanted to try them all:- Chocolate Hot Fudge Cake ($10)I planned on only getting the 2 mentioned below, but how can you see something with this name and not order it? As expected, it was as rich and decadent and delicious as it sounds. Decorated nicely with a few refreshing raspberries, this small plate of cake was packed with flavor.- Peanut Butter Blueberry Crunch Cake ($10)This was definitely my favorite of all, surpassing the soon to be famous cookie. This slice was much bigger than the chocolate one, and already looked glorious even before the server drizzled the bright blueberry sauce all over the top and around the plate. With whole blueberries on top as well as little pieces of peanut brittle also on and around the plate, this dessert looked as impressive as it tasted. Make sure you try this one, and get a bite of the brittle, blueberry and peanut butter frosting together, and you won't be disappointed (unless you are a weird person that doesn't love peanut butter).- Triple Chocolate Chunk Cookie with Milk ($8)Yes, this cookie is excellent - but when have you had a big cookie packed with chocolate, fresh out of the oven, that wasn't amazing? Sure, it's a lot better than your average cookie, but I think it's the other desserts here that are more worthy of praise.As expected, service was perfect throughout. Even though the food looks like fine dining and they treat you like it is too, the vibe is much more casual than you might expect. Most importantly though, the food is great and definitely worth stopping in for, even more than just for the cookie.",26,14,18,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834

2.0,7/9/2015,"waffled between 2 and 3 stars, but i think people consider 3 stars to be a 'good' review, so two it is. visited untitled yesterday for my birthday lunch (with a reservation).i'm not sure if it's the growing pains of a relatively new establishment or they have just overextended themselves, but untitled needs to get their shit together...and fast. service was hit or miss...the staff was pleasant enough, but seemed rather scattered and distracted. long waits all around. to order, to get drinks, to get bread, to get the rest of our food. the delay was noticed at one part and a complimentary plate of pickles was sent over without any word from us, which was nice, but even after those were done and gone, the wait for our entrees continued on. when the food did arrive, it was presented beautifully and tasted delicious, but the excessive wait left a sour taste in the mouth.  in the end our desserts also ended up being comped because they too took an inordinate amount of time do be served (even after we specifically asked if there would be another long wait for them before ordering). overall, lunch took over 2x as long as it ever has at comparable fine dining restaurants. this is simply unacceptable, especially presuming that many of the guests have a visit to the attached museum also planned. due to the length of time we spent at the restaurant, our visit to the whitney was cut entirely short...so a disappointing experience all-around.perhaps they should consider downsizing the number of tables if they are unable to handle a lunch service (on a wednesday, no less!) in an efficient manner. our table inside was uncomfortably close to our neighbors' and there also tables filling the sidewalk outside to capacity. it appears that there are simply too many seats for the kitchen to manage. what a shame.",0,0,0,Lizz K.,"Chicago, IL",21,100,9

4.0,7/7/2015,"KenScale: 8.0/10Another Danny Meyer restaurant in NYC...this time inside the new Whitney Museum. On a side note, I really loved the new Whitney transported from the Upper East Side where it had long been overshadowed by behemoths like The Met and Guggenheim to a cool space in Meatpacking District overlooking the Hudson River. It will only add to the gentrification of this neighborhood, with awesome outdoor space overlooking the High Line. While the Untitled at the previous spot had been more or less deemed a typical museum café-style restaurant (although I hadn't made a visit there previously), this time Danny Meyer brought in chef Michael Anthony from Gramercy Tavern to lead the new space. I had always been a fan of the elegant farm-to-table New American cuisine at Gramercy Tavern, and could feel chef Anthony's influence all over the food at Untitled as well.I was a huge fan of the clean flavor with fresh ingredients that defined the food at Whitney. Lobster and preserved lemon toast was really delightful, especially when combined with the shishito peppers. I certainly wish there were more calamari in the pole beans dish, but still I could feel the freshness of the beans that was another nice start to the meal. We proceeded to order two seafood dishes, both pretty successful. I was in love with the texture of black bass that came with corn, sweet peppers and curried squash that gave really well-balanced flavor to the fish. I had started to try more and more swordfish with that uniquely meat-like texture, and the one at Whitney that came with eggplant, shishito peppers and basil seed vinaigrette, while softer than I had expected, still worked well as a pleasant seafood dish. Among the desserts, the much heralded triple chocolate chunk cookie with milk was pure decadence that lived up to its hype, but I can't stop thinking about the wonderful chamomile panna cotta that came with local honey and market berries. It was such a delightful dish that would make for a sweet treat on any given day in the summer.The restaurant has a concise yet well-thought out wine menu. Getting a reservation didn't seem particularly challenging, but it was still fairly packed with crowd just coming back from checking out the museum. The vibe has the typical feel to be museum restaurant, yet I still liked the modern décor of the dining space next to the open kitchen. Untitled is definitely a worthwhile visit if you happen to be around or if you're planning for a meal after your trip to The Whitney. It epitomizes everything that you would love about farm-to-table dining that has swept the country for a long time.",3,0,0,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738

1.0,6/29/2015,"WOW......Danny Meyer should hang his head in shame on this one. The ONLY redeeming qualities of this place are the wine list and the service, the food is abominable/inedible. We had a 2:15 reservation for Sunday brunch. When I arrived the Hostess was very pleasant and allowed me to sit before my friend arrived although one of the servers took my drink menu away from me before I could order it because she thought I just randomly sat down and told me to go and talk to the Hostess....uhhhm, I already did and she just sat me. My friend arrived and we ordered a bottle of the Rebula from the list. I loved it as I love me a good orange but my friend was a bit uncertain. Our waiter was so accommodating that he said if we weren't lovin it we could send it back. The multi-grain rolls that they serve at the start of our meal were the only thing that I found remotely tasty. We ordered the crab and pepper fritters to start along with the asparagus with pancetta. When I can smell the crab from 50 yards it's not a good sign and I was spot on with that. They were so fishy we had to send them back. The servings are TINY so when we received the asparagus the dish was comprised or a few wedges of potato, a few spears of green beans and 2 tiny cubes of pancetta fat all covered with a gloppy tasteless dressing. I said to my friend ""is it my imagination or is this asparagus that tastes like green beans?"" Nope, they WERE green beans. I mentioned it to our waiter and he tried a good save saying there was both in the dish but then he came back and let us know that they had run out of asparagus and had substituted beans. The kitchen was remiss about not letting the servers know that as I don't care for green beans. Our waiter apologized profusely and took that dish off the bill as well as the crab fritters. We ordered the fried chicken kale salad and this was seriously the sorriest salad I've ever seen, all for $24. A few wilty lettuce leafs, very little kale and 2 little puffs of what were supposed to be fried chicken nuggets but were really just breading, all smothered in a tasteless dressing that made the lettuce even limper. We then went with the onion and pancetta flatbread which was really the size of about 4 saltine crackers and about as interesting, super greasy caramelized onions on crackers, no thanks. We ordered the cheese plate for dessert which was 3 cheeses that were not bad but there were no accoutrements served alongside, no jam no figs no nothing. We were still STARVING so we ordered a glass of Rose as I had no desire to try any more of the awful food. So you tell me, a bottle of wine and a few nibbles as our lovely waiter took a few dishes off our check, all for $145 before tip? I think not...stay away for anything more than a great glass of wine.",1,0,0,Leslie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",82,444,2

Seriously, the blinking and flashing was about to give me a petit mal. Disaster averted thanks to good service!My only critique (and this is me being super picky) is the bathrooms.

First the location is amazing being housed in the new Whitney Museum, the actual building is a beautifully bright, glass box, and the food and wine list will make you want to come back over and over again. The wine list is a beautifully curated medley of France's finest! I enjoyed the '13 Boudin Chablis, a must try! For dinner I enjoyed the Crab Fritters and Lobster Toast with preserved lemon. The Lobster toast is to die for, seriously light and fresh, and the taste of lemon just compliments this dish! The Crab fritters take a traditional hush puppy and blends it with crab and spicy peppers placed on top of another well-spiced sauce, amazing!!!!  For dessert do yourself a favor and get the Triple Chocolate Chunk cookie that is served with Vanilla Bourbon infused milk, ahhhhh!!? There's a reason Grub Street is calling this NYC's best new cookie!! To round out all of this deliciousness, was a glass of their Cabernet Franc by the glass- the perfect end!

The drinks are ok - a bit weaker perhaps than they seem like they ought to be. Try asking for alcoholic versions of the sodas - they'll make them, and my dining mates thoroughly enjoyed them. The sides are great - the chips, carrots and cauliflower are all truly outstanding. The sauces on the latter two are great and somehow the chips are incredibly interesting to taste. The stradette was not a huge portion but was fresh, flavorful and inventive. I didn't try the chicken (roast or fried) or the bass but the rest in my party seemed to greatly enjoy them. The bread was also wonderful - warm, crusty and soft, nutty and with great salted butter (perhaps the butter was a tad over salted).The cookies and milk were ok - the vanilla was quite subtle in the milk, but the cookie was pretty fantastic.All in all, another hit for Mr. Meyer I'd say - the place manages to make everyone feel welcome, despite being in a too-hip new locale.

Apart from the crispy chicken, the rotisserie chicken was slimy, cold and tasteless like 3 day old refrigerated left overs. This place is a expensive joke, very different from other Danny Meyer establishments.",1,0,0,Guilherme R.,"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",3,56,6
5.0,6/10/2015,"Had a wonderful experience at Untitled. I went first for a quick lunch at the bar and had the carrots w chili and peanuts and the cookie. Both were excellent, esp the carrots! Went back for dinner tonight and food, service and atmosphere were great. I recommend the shaved chips w dip, cauliflower w curry and chicken w kale and escarole. Fab rose recommendation too and wine prices are v reasonable.",1,1,0,Ann T.,"South Windsor, CT",26,189,43
5.0,6/9/2015,"Some people think the room has a wow-factor, which I guess I can understand because of the big glass and view (through the museum lobby) of beautiful Hoboken (that's in no way ironic, I live there)...though I think it's full of hard lines and a bit sterile, with the exception of the long open kitchen, which I love.  Now that we got that out of the way...the stars are the food and service, both  absolutely top notch.  This is one of the top values in the city as you can realistically have the Danny Meyer/Michael Anthony experience $50ish per person.  Great attention from every member of the staff, and the food...Cured vegetables had a few different vegetables pickled in different brines.  The fluke was generously loaded with roe (admittedly eggs are not my fave) but the lime gave it great flavor I enjoyed; the asparagus, turnips, guanciale, & pecorino was almost like a deconstructed chowder, both the monkfish and black bass in mushroom broth (very Asian flavors) mains were superb.  I would recommend any of these dishes, paired with something from the very reasonable by-the-bottle or by-the-glass wine list.  We skipped dessert, which given the sounds coming from diners at the next table, was probably a mistake, but something tells me we'll be back!",4,2,0,Jeremy W.,"Hoboken, NJ",175,526,20
5.0,6/8/2015,"Beautiful room flooded with natural light. More comfortable and welcoming than expected!The food we had was all super-clean, fresh & flavorful. Nothing too heavy! Even the crab fritters were tasty without the least hint of greasiness. I wasn't drinking booze, so I had an amazing sour cherry amazing soda made in-house. Our favorites dishes (which were all of them) were the lobster toast, smoked clam appetizer, fried/roast chicken salad, etc.Will definitely be back for dinner. Wine list looked interested and well-priced.",2,0,0,Eric S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,40,0
4.0,5/24/2015,"Great service and location, outside seating is only snacks and drinks unfortunately.  I look forward to trying more of the menu.Impressions of two people who tried about half the menuduck sausage and mustard - the sausage was tender, not granular but the house mustard seemed more like yellow mayonnaise, no spice or tang.  It made the sausage even more smooth than it was but I prefer something to offset the richness of sausage.fluke with radish and sorrel - An excellent mezcla of radish crunch, slippery fluke and salty balls of roe.  The sorrel was somewhat understated, standing in as a flourish of green while the lime seemed absent both in flavor and presentation, not sure where it was.  spring onion and bacon flatbread - a somewhat typical carmelized onion and bacon pizza, slightly oily and salty distinguished by flowering buds from spring onions, tastes good with a beer.leeks and citrus-pasilla - I do love leeks but I always end up regretting the resilience of their fibers.  I don't think it's possible to bite into a 6 inch piece of leek and take off half of it. The other half follows creating a bolus that is a mouth full of chew and difficult to swallow.  The leeks were nicely browned but the citrus-pasilla sauce tasted strongly of cardamom, not what I expected.asparagus, turnips, bacon and pecorino - simple, well prepared, would get again.roasted and fried chicken - I was confused about this one, roasting and then frying?  Seemed like overkill since I'm sure it was sous-vided at some point as well.  Turns out the they were two separate preparations.  The roasted was tender and well seasoned while the fried nuggets provided some crunch but left me yearning for more southern complements.  It was served over spinach and radicchio in some type of white sauce.  The radicchio seemed sad and out of place, I think it shines in it's crisp raw form while here it looked like some type of purple kelp monster in the throes of death.  lamb chops with emmer, ricotta, asparagus and olives - chops over quinoa and emmer (""ancient grain"" looks like wheat berry), the ricotta had a very feta flavor to it, overall excellent.strawberry and lemon pound cake with ricotta and candied pistacchios - Strawberries were soaked in elderberry syrup but still seemed fresh, I didn't try but she says it was yum yum.  The cake was moist and it wall went together nicely.",1,2,0,Paul M.,"New York, NY",9,130,5
5.0,5/23/2015,"Just finished lunch here at the bar. What van I say? The servers, Rocky and Andrew, were excellent--more like friendly bartenders than waiters! And the food was really creative and different in a good way. Michael Anthony, the young Executive Chef, even served us our entrees after the waiters pointed him out to us and we waved to himThe Lobster Toast at $12 dollars may seem expensive but there was a ton of lobster on the four pieces and it was really good with exhilarating fresh notes and well worth the price. A gentleman we met at the friendly bar recommended the Roasted and Fried Chicken Salad with Kale and Snap Peas which was the most creative take on a salad that I've eaten in many a year. The fried chicken on the salad was astonishingly light and airy.The Beet and Sugar Snap Peas were also a standout and the Asparagus, Turnips, Bacon and Pecorino was a complex confection that I urge you to try.I rsrely write reviews because I've lived in NYC for 30 years and am a bit jaded about restaurants, especially a restaurant connected to a museum, but Untitled is definitely an exception.Ignore the ridiculous lines at the Whitney (only three ladies selling tickets? What are they thinking? Are they trying to irritate people? Is, so they succeeded in my case!), and cruise right through the glass doors to Untitled. You'll be glad you did!",1,0,0,Kathryn B.,"New York, NY",0,2,0

5.0,5/17/2015,"First of all the space itself is dramatic. High ceiling, glass enclosed open space on the ground floor of the Whitney museum. The menu is creative, the service attentive. I recommend the lobster toast, monkfish, leeks, crab fritters and the amazing fried chicken salad. Try the upstairs Studio cafe for coffee but Untitled restaurant downstairs is highly recommended for discerning gourmands.",10,3,5,Debbie T.,"Manhattan, NY",29,42,113
5.0,5/16/2015,"Phenomenal food and service! Great atmosphere and acoustics in the large open space.We had lobster toast to start along with the chips and dip (spinach and yogurt dip). This served to whet out appetites for the food to come. We got a selection of the food from the different courses so we could sample multiple things at once :)The stradette with broccoli rabe pesto and fresh cheese was mouth watering - such fresh flavors and great texture. We also had the salad with green tomatoes and Caesar dressing, cauliflower with curry, the carrot dish (gorgeous!) and the asparagus dish. Everything was so fresh and tasty! The staff were great and the chef came to check how everything was. I'll definitely be back and recommending this place to everyone! Do yourself a favor and check out the new Whitney then go for a great meal here afterwards. You won't be disappointed!",5,0,2,Christine O.,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",12,37,91
5.0,5/14/2015,"The Whitney Museum has moved to the West Village and has brought The Untitled with it to its beautiful, brand new venue. The entire restaurant is caged in ceiling-to-floor glass and has a spectacular open kitchen running down the room, which is outfitted with bright red art-deco seats and swarming with expert staff who pride themselves on creating an experience. It was easy enough to make reservations and when I arrived at 6:30PM, there were many tables available. The crowd is beautiful in a West Village kind of way, and I felt relaxed even though seats were close-together. The tiny baguettes of millet bread brought to our table were piping hot and served with butter. Really special having the bread so warm and the grainy millet was unctuous. My friend and I ordered the Crab and pickled pepper fritters ($10) which came straight out of the fryer with a creamy pepper sauce, and beautifully fried. Just like biting into a crispy puff, no heaviness at all! We also shared the Smoked clams, cucumber and yogurt ($14) and were delighted by the adorable presentation but somewhat disappointed with the clams themselves, which were minuscule and I was eating mostly yogurt and cucumber to be honest. When it was time to select our main course, I immediately decided on the Grilled monkfish, black garlic and lobster glaze ($25) which came out looking like a huge lobster tail but in fact was the most succulent body of fish I've ever tasted. Absolutely amazing on its own and a fair amount for the price! I was excited about the black garlic which was said to be from the chef's personal farm, but the flavor was lost on me. As someone who LOVES her garlic, I was wishing for a stronger taste. Because my friend is picky about her meats, she opted for the Lobster toast ($12) and the Asparagus, turnips, bacon and pecorino ($14) small plates instead. The Lobster Toast was adorable, served in 5 small triangles topped with a lobster salad. I had been eyeing a cake stand with a marvelous layered cake for the entire meal, but I decided to opt out when it came time for dessert. Our server Scott explained that it was a Peanut Butter Sesame Crunch Cake with Blueberries ($10), and his very favorite dessert on the menu. He pressed it on me, but I persisted to refuse for the guilt of indulging any further that night. My friend declared that she wasn't a huge Peanut Butter fan, but would be willing to share the Banana Chocolate Cream Pie with me ($10). When dessert was served, we were shocked to see both the cake and cream pie brought to our table and Scott came over to announce he was so eager to have us try the cake on him. With milk, if we so desired. Never one to refuse free cake, I dug in happily. It really reminded me of a PB & J sandwich, the cake being a semi-dry sponge to maintain its lightness (lest it become the heavy poundcake variety!). The pie was layered with a rich chocolate cream, bruleed bananas, and a toasted meringue. I loved the thickness of the chocolate but we were both confused by the pastry shell holding it all together, as it was tough to cut through and not flaky in the least. I've never had a pastry shell like it before, but I wouldn't use it again. Overall dessert was satisfactory but not indulgent like I like them to be, and ordering a dessert each was definitely overkill after our light meal.The food at the Whitney is light and evocative of fresh fare on a riviera boat, which suits its beautiful new location by the Hudson river. A definite must for a sunny afternoon or a starlit night. Really looking forward to coming back and trying the rooftop cafe!
