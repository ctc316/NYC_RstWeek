2.0,2/5/2019,"A bit about my background: I have been eating Mediterranean food all my life and my palate's favorite food is Italian.I went and ordered from the NYC Winter Restaurant Week Dinner Menu some meatballs, pasta bolognese & panacotta. My partner in crime ordered a bruschetta with mushrooms, branzino & tiramisu.Well, starting with the best part, the desserts - solid options both of them: not too sweet & nice textures!The entrées: my Rigatoni Bolognese was good, but nothing out of the norm. The portion was quite fulfilling. The Branzino was presented with baked vegetables, very simple plating with Italian flavor - the sea bass was nothing special - baked with not too much taste (some drops of olive oil would have made it much better).Appetizers: the Bruschetta was a toast that we could have done at home with some mushrooms and spread cheese... this is not even a brunch level dish... and my Polpettine (meatballs) tasted like frozen meatballs with canned tomato sauce and microwave gratinated supermarket parmigiano (which, if I cooked myself, I would say ""bravo"", but being in an Italian restaurant... that is another story...).The service: correct until... those 33 minutes waiting in between the entrées and the dessert (20 minutes after we finished with the entrées, our waitress Oksana came to pour more water in our glasses & I didn't remind her on purpose about our desserts, hoping she would notice we didn't have food on our table... well, I had to call her and remind her 10 minutes later...) - no apologies nor nothing. Of course, expect to be charged fully & expect to pay their salaries with your tips after you ask for the check twice. Well, a simple gesture or ""apologies"" would have been appreciated... well, at least she said ""good night "" when we left.I understand that due to the location you have to charge the prices of this area. But I don't understand how some simple Italian cuisine is served at such a high price (relatively ok with the NYC Restaurant Week Menu) and with such a service... sorry, I just love decent Italian food - please do yourself a favor and check other restaurants before this one.You're welcome. ;)",0,0,0,Simón L.,"New York, NY",78,81,543
3.0,1/30/2019,"Great service. Great food. But we still don't know how we managed to spend $160 for two plates of pasta and a couple of glasses of wine with one side. Pretty pricey, if you ask me.",1,0,0,Fabrizio U.,"Brooklyn, NY",1127,235,225
1.0,1/26/2019,"This was the most unprofessional and terrible display of service I have ever seen at a restaurant, and ended in them losing our credit card and refusing to offer us anything for the nightmare experience... I showed up at 8:40 for my 8:45 reservation and was told ""2 minutes"" for our table and we ended up being seated at 9:15. Understandable, sometimes restaurants are busy we didn't complain about it.It was a prefix menu and one of the people eating with me is a vegetarian and ordered bruschetta which was described as ""daily market bruschetta"" on menu. When it came it had only cheese and prosciutto... he asked if he could get something else because he was vegetarian and all they offered him was mixed greens and balsamic dressing. We decided to just ignore this and move on with the meal.After eating our entrees, we were sitting, waiting for dessert for over 15 minutes. Instead of our dessert, they brought us the check, and described how we needed to leave because the restaurant was closing early that day... They failed to mention this when they sat us down 30 minutes after our reservation time. They tried to get us to leave the restaurant after 45 minutes of being seated when we hadn't gotten the dessert that we already paid for through the prefix menu! Still hadn't been offered anything for the clearly frustrating experience.We didn't make a fuss about anything and then they bring back the check and one of our cards is missing. Not only were they unapologetic, they immediately blame us for losing the card or perhaps ""putting it in our pockets without remembering."" They started looking around the restaurant forever and can't find anything. STILL they ask us to kindly pay the check and leave without offering any kind of compensation for this horrendous experience.When we were leaving the restaurant, I said to manager on duty (Matt), this is absolutely unacceptable and ridiculous; This was the worst service and experience I've ever seen in a restaurant, and if we were 40 years old we wouldn't have paid a dime for this meal, and probably been offered a free meal next time as well. He responds with ""you're right"" but claims he doesn't have the authority. He asked us to contact them the next day when his boss would be there.We called the next day, after they told us they had found the card and it was, indeed, their fault, to find out the boss Matt instructed us to speak to, Andreas, was not there. We asked for a way to contact him as they told us we would be able to speak to him today and they said no. We explained the situation and they bluntly moaned ""we know what happened,"" then said she was busy and abruptly hung up on us.I cannot stress enough how terrible this experience was and they still have not reached out to offer us any kind of compensation or even an apology for this horrendous experience. STEER CLEAR.Edit: They have since reached out and apologized as well as invited us back to the restaurant. The manager was very nice and apologetic on the phone.",10,1,0,Matt H.,"Ann Arbor, MI",399,3,1

4.0,8/8/2018,"A friend and I had an appointment in the area on a Sunday afternoon and it was restaurant week so she had made reservations at Tarallucci e Vino. It was a pleasant little place with a bar as you enter, tables outside and tables deeper in the restaurant. We were seated immediately and my friend ordered an iced tea and I got my usual tap water. We decided to go with the restaurant week menu-two out of three choices. I opted for the bruschetta dal mercato and the pan seared salmon which came with fregola, white beans, leeks, tomatoes and parsley pesto. My friend ordered the uova del tartufo-scrambled eggs with herb cooked ham, provolone, black truffle aioli on the house brioche and home fries. She also ordered the crostata di limone-a lemon custard with Italian meringue and fresh strawberries. Our meal was delicious-we ordered espresso at the end.

Couples were definitely on one side which is where we were.  Walked in looking for a spot in the area after Rosa Mexicana was PACKED. Glad we did! Portions were nice. We ordered meat and cheese which is 5 pcs for $30. Our waitress suggested a truffle cheese and prosecco cheese which we loved. Meats were great. Had the octopus to start and that was great.  Pasta fresh and amazing! Whoa. I had the scallops and my only thing is it could have had a little salt, but that being said I did clean my plate... dessert was a chocolate torta that barely made it off the table alive!  I'm definitely coming back!",0,0,0,Dililah S.,"Long Beach, NY",83,163,144
1.0,6/28/2018,"I just left here - warning: this is gonna be a bad review. I canceled my res at Ulivo because of a few bad reviews. I should have done the same here.I've lived in Manhattan for 22 years and Tarallucci is the worst food I've ever had. Honestly, Olive Garden would have been better. There was NO flavor in the tagliatelle (with octopus). How does a cook screw up pasta?! ZERO flavor! No garlic, no salt. What was that ""sauce?!"" Can someone please explain?! Who puts zucchini in pasta with octopus and whatever sauce that was supposed to be. Seriously?! I make better sauce. I don't even understand. Awful. I've never tasted anything so BAD. I only eat pasta couple times a month and sad I wasted it here. AWFULAlso, our waiter disappeared on us decided to be a sommelier for 20 min.

5.0,5/27/2018,Came here for brunch. The portion size was perfect for girls and the taste was overall very nice - not too heavy but very modestly great and delicious. Not excessive sauce/ dressing. The service was nice as well. Love their panini - the bread part was toasted perfectly that it was crunchy and crispy outside while the inside wasn't dry.

I waited again, now at the table and still nobody came over. Mind you, there were only four guests in the dining room so they were not busy! The waitress finally came over to me at 4:01 and when I told her my order she informed me that I could only order from the charcuterie menu from 4-5pm!! ""Oh they gave you the Lunch Prix Fixe menu!?"" she exclaimed. Yes, because I walked in the doors at 3:45pm with plenty of time to put in a simple Prix Fixe order! I left at 4:02 still hungry.

I was looking for a place to do my baby shower and came across this venue on a venue website, and found out they also own lofts within the same building!! We ended up booking their mezzanine up on the second floor, which had a private bar, wine cellar, lounge area, and kitchen. I was working with Basia throughout the entire process and I cannot explain how amazing the experience was. I have thrown a few parties in the city for birthdays and engagements and so on. I found venues to be rather un-accomadating (Sadly). But Basia helped my dream baby shower become a reality. The event space itself is stunning. Wooden rustic tables, wine cellar, large windows looking out into the streets with window sills you can sit on. It has a speak easy vibe, because you do not expect to have a hidden gem like this inside of the building. The staff was wonderful as well. Everyone was so pleasant and helpful. Sterian, our head waiter/server, was so professional and amazing. I did not have a worry in the world. The party came out so incredible, all my guests were very impressed. And of course the food. The food was absolutely delicious and there was plenty of it. Basia also worked with me on the alcohol prices, considering that I had 45 Russian women who drink champagne for breakfast.

My friends had the rack of lamb special (delicious  but only 3 pieces of lamb) and the parpadelle which  had a delicious sausage sauce combo. Their bread was even amazing - 3 types with focaccia, sourdough with olives and regular country white. I was stuffed! My friends then ordered the Affogato which they said was superlative as well.

4.0,12/18/2017,"I came here for Sunday brunch with a group of friends, and was very pleased and satisfied by the way the waitstaff handled what could have an uncomfortable situation. While dining with a group of nine, one of the people in my party felt the need to act like a can of three day old tuna to the waitress, wondering why it was ""taking over an hour just for some eggs."" Well if he knew how to properly read a clock he would have known that yes we had been at the restaurant for an hour, however we had only put in our food orders no more than 30 minutes before he felt the need to complain. And frankly waiting 30 minutes for a meal when you have a table of nine there is actually pretty standard, at least I thought. I was amazed by the level of respect the waitress showed towards my crude colleague and in my opinion they couldn't have been more apologetic and graceful over the uncomfortable situation.When the food did come out my order got lost in the shuffle, and unfortunately the waitress forgot to put in my order. Once again the waitress was extremely apologetic, even though I recognized that it's never easy dealing with a large brunch party especially when one is acting like a garbage fire. I waited no more than five minutes for my meal to come (which was delicious, by the way), and I later learned that my entire meal was comped which I did not expect and was very grateful upon learning.Oh yeah, and then of course when the bill came that patron at my table felt the need to bring in the manager and complain about the long wait and his meal -- to which I say boy bye and next time get your eggs at Dunkin Donuts if you want something on the quick quick. As for me I give the waitress, hostess, and the entire restaurant props for the way they handled the entire situation and look forward to coming back in the near future for a delicious brunch -- this time without that spoiled jar of mayonnaise of a human.",0,1,0,Kenny L.,"New York, NY",6,6,0

First while we waited (more than an hour), the bartender was unbelievably rude to us. He glared at us and gave us one word answers. Before that, we waited 20 minutes for his attention. Then when our table was ready, he made a big deal about transferring our bottle of wine to our table, even though we ASKED if we could transfer the bottle to our table when we ordered it. Two of us separately ordered the agnolotti but the server brought gnocchi. So while we waited for our correct order, our friend finished his food. Then our food came. None of us was too impressed with the food, but it was passable. The food was mediocre for the price and the number of incredible Italian places in the neighborhood (Union Square). There was no apology made for our food being served so late. We decided to split a glass of wine, so our friend could kill time while we finished our meal. They should have comped it.

I think the only surprise was the pitch to buy high-priced wine was a little over the top. What I say high-priced I mean it... we're having a sale off any bottle of wine $180 or more? One bottle that she suggested was over $400??? At any rate, to start we had a cheese, prosciutto, bread and olive oil that was delicious. I then ordered the arugula salad, which had shaved Parmesan cheese and a lemon vinaigrette that was delicious. Then for an entrée I had homemade pasta with Bolognese sauce that was divine! For dessert we split Tiramisu, and other goodies that was fabulous! Very impressed I definitely would go back!",0,0,0,William G.,"Sandwich, MA",29,269,38

2.0,9/17/2017,"Disappointing. Very, very disappointing.  My visit here was less than 40 minutes long, as I felt completely rushed from the moment the hostess saw me until I exited this place.  The hostess's first words to me were ""just so you know, the kitchen closes in 15 minutes, but you know, if you really want, you can still sit and eat.""  I could tell that the last thing she wanted was for me to have a meal there, most likely because it would delay in closing.  Nevertheless, I had read previous reviews and was craving good pasta.Too bad I did not get even good pasta!  I ordered the gnocchi and coffee.  The waiter looked at me and asked ""that is all? nothing else to drink or eat? really?""  Strike two.  Who likes being pressured to 1. leave and 2. order more than I new I could eat? So I broke down and ordered a side of bread (stupid.  Italian restaurant and a side of bread with jam costs $4?).As I waited for my food, the other servers and busboys started to collect all of the silverware, dishes, napkins, etc at the other tables.  What a noise!  Cling, clang, cling cling, of dishes and silverware being deposited.  I felt like I was witnessing the actual closure of the restaurant at the end of the day.  Furthermore, I had come for brunch, so it was not that late!!The food came, and I ate (admist more clinging and clanging of dishes and silverware and glasses being dropped into a bin to be washed).  I will credit that my server tried several times to quiet them, but without success. The gnocchi was...okay.  Small portion of less than 8 tiny gnocchis, and they were not the pillowy texture that I love about gnocchi. The sauce was BLAND. Like overly watered chicken broth thickened with a ton of flour and cornstarch.  Even the bread tasted stale and I did not finish it.With so many great Italian and pasta eateries in the area, I will NEVER come back to this establishment.  I left hungry, still craving good pasta, and upset at having felt rushed out the entire time.",0,0,0,Lindsay F.,"Saint Paul, MN",20,103,142

To be honest, people who come for drinks often end up ordering more drinks than food and still order food. But the fact that you piegonhole patrons into ordering food in order to sit at a sidewalk table is just plain cocky and not cool.

Since we were all hungry, we thought we should go have brunch somewhere and so I checked Open Table for the nearest options and this showed up and since we felt like having Italian food, we booked and went for it.Upon entering, the host already gave us a wonderful welcome experience. Took our coats and then led us to the best table in the house, farther back, U-shaped table which perfectly fit the 3 of us and even still had room, really comfortable.The waitress (I did actually ask for her name and I'm normally good at names but I cannot recall now, sorry!) was really nice. Greeted us, walked us through the menu and answered all our questions, fantastic product knowledge really. Especially when we asked if there was a separate cheese plate and she recommended cheeses according to our preferences and favorites (look for the ones which were Truffle-like and Camembert like!). So we ordered a Cheese Plate to share, got our mimosas and bloody mary and ordered our food. My friend Julie went for the Octopus entree (she made me try, so good!) while Jessica and I both ordered the Truffled Egg on the menu. THAT was so delicious! And generous! Didn't scrimp on black truffle and I couldn't even finish it all which is why I decided to not really eat the bread, but it was so good too! I also loved that they have this $29 brunch deal which gets you coffee, unlimited mimosas for 1 hour, choice of a brunch entree, and get this, a pastry! In this case, I got the almond croissant and took it home. Incredible value! We didn't want to leave right away but we had to be somewhere. Got our coats and exchanged pleasantries with the host and after giving her a tip for the coats, she said 'hope to see you again' soon and I said, 'oh you will!' She got encouraged to ask for a review on Yelp so here goes my promise! I delivered! :)Over-all, such a lovely place within the Union Square area. Delicious food. Warm staff. Great service!

I originally ordered the almond croissant, but was then told they had unfortunately run out of both the almond and chocolate croissant. I ended up going for the cheese danish, which was really good and fresh. I got an iced coffee with soy milk. For my entree I got the Uova Al Tartufo - they ran out of brioche, so I ended up getting it on a croissant, which was still good. The potatoes were really well cooked and crispy. The portion was large and the sandwich was cheesy. The waitress was friendly but seemed too busy to refill our mimosa glasses when we wanted her to. She made up for this by refilling past the hour mark until we were satisfied with our drink intake. My friend got the Uova e Polenta, which she said was also tasty but not that big. She got the strawberry donut for her pastry, which was tasty and huge. Overall, I would definitely come back. The food was good.

The food was good; I ordered uova al tartufo and it was both flavorful and satisfying. The truffle aioli was a nice touch and hit the spot. The cheese danish is just the right amount of sweetness. My soy latte and mimosas were good, neither too special. The lack of stars is solely based on customer service. For starters, I made a reservation a little over a week in advance but when I got there, my name wasn't listed. This already set off an uncertain feeling, but I let it slide because they seated us right away. My main issue was with the mimosa refills. My friends and I had to flag down a waiter three times before we even got our first refill. Two more times for the second refill. When we were up to our third refill, we tried calling our waitress over but she was occupied with another table and told us to wait, while walking back and forth by us a few times. When she finally came over to see what we wanted, she checked the time and proceeded to tell us that our hour was up.Bottom line: food is full of flavor but this was definitely not a ""bottomless"" brunch, especially since my glass was empty for most of the time.

One glass of wine turned to three in addition to a meat plate, cheese plate, truffle pasta and dessert. The whole environment is so cozy and we never felt rushed. The meats were melt in your mouth thinly sliced true Italian prosciutto and coppa. The cheeses were all great - I highly recommend the truffle cheese. We got the truffle pasta that was a special and it was perfect. Pasta al dente in a white wine sauce loaded with shaved truffles on top. The dish itself was simple but had such a focus on each ingredient. We could've done without dessert.

We had trouble navigating the massive wine menu but our server sold us on a rose they had on special, and it was the perfect spring wine to accompany our vegetable-forward meal. My friend went with the agnolotti stuffed with ricotta and accompanied by guanciale and ramp pesto. I had an appetizer, burrata ricotta surrounded by mixed vegetables and pesto, and a side of steamed ramps. Everything was excellent and just what we wanted. So why the 2 stars (which I'm tempted to make 1)? Our server seemed far more interested in chatting with his friend in the corner then helping us out. It took something like 30 minutes to order after he bought us our wine. The food came out quickly but then when he cleared the plates, he dropped off dessert menus (instead of asking us if we wanted to see them) and peaced out to the corner to chat with his colleague for what seemed like eternity. He didn't even follow up to see if we wanted dessert; we were only able to get our check because I basically hunted him down and asked for it. I want to say I'd give Tarralucci another change, particularly on a nice day when I could eat outside, but this meal left a bad taste in my mouth, in spite of the tasty dinner.",3,1,1,Maeve M.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",317,539,111

I have been here several times for lunch, but I guess today when I chose to go for lunch,  it had been long enough that I had forgotten my previous bad experiences. At each step of the meal, I was constantly being pushed to order more, spend more. And by the time my lunch had lasted 1.5 hours and our plates had been cleared, I couldn't get the server to come over to give me the bill and when I finally asked him, he still kept trying to make us buy dessert. You literally have to beg for your check. And in the rush to get out, I didn't realize they had charged me for the entire prix-fixe lunch price for the pasta he said I could order off of the prix-fixe lunch menu as an entree only. So I wish I had ordered dessert, just because I was actually owed for it. Will not be back from lunch ever.

The place was packed when we walked in and had a really great energy. We had made a reservation and although busy, we were seated immediately. My friend has a severe gluten allergy so she ordered the gluten free pasta. The server asked if the request was due to an allergy or preference. When he realized it was an allergy, he made sure to double check with the chef that the appetizer we ordered was also gluten free. Thankfully he did this since he found out that the sauce actually had an ingredient that included gluten and was able to let us know right away, allowing us plenty of time to order something else. We both ordered pasta dishes, the risotto and spaghetti, and they were amazing! Great portion sizes and made with fresh ingredients. We also indulged and ordered the panna cotta for dessert which was a perfect way to end our evening.

Like literally every time he passed him he'd caress his back. Totally creepy but we made light of it. Let's go to the food. Also, pictures below. Wow! Total wow factor. Everything we ordered was out of this world. Especially the tartar. I recommend that as a light starter. It is super tasty and fresh. I wasn't a huge fan of the pasta but that's just my preference in taste. The snapper was to die for! One of the best snappers I'v ever tasted. Well prepared and perfect in taste. The same goes for the meat. Dessert was adorable. Ha, I know it's an interesting word to use.

We order the (Dorada for two) that was not even enough for one, the server also forgot the sides, when we placed the order we were told that the Dorada was coming with two sides. Finally after waiting for 5 more minutes we got the appetizer and the two sides. When the runner came with the appetizer and the sides we expressed our frustration about the whole experience, and how the server was blaming the kitchen for all the mistakes, the runner told us that it wasn't the kitchen. Minutes after the server came over in a confrontational manner, telling us that we never order the appetizer nor the sides. Unfortunately we were  not ready for the final surprise, when we got the bill we were giving the wrong bottle of wine, the one we order was 48 dollars and the one given was 150 dollars, plus we were charged for the two sides that we were told it was included with the meal. We ask for the manager but he was gone, everybody else acted as they didn't care about anything. My friend, which she was the one inviting us, she has been living in NY for 15 years and visited this restaurant many times before,  she felt so embarrassed that she decided to pay the 277 dollars bill for the worse experience of our lives, and leave the restaurant.

But once I traded emails with Basia Biddle the event manager, I knew I was in great hands.  She answered my million questions thoroughly and promptly and I received a proposal within 24 hours of developing our menu.  She made lots of promises... beautiful party space just as depicted on the website, amazing service and perfect food.  Plus, she said she would be at the event from setup throughout the entire party. And it all came true exactly as she had promised.  Setup was seamless and the room was beautiful.  The service staff was amazing ... (shout outs to Matt, Sonia and Maria!) and even Chef Andrew stopped by the dining room during setup to introduce himself and see if he could be of any assistance. (But his perfectly grilled octopus, amazing house made gnocchi and out of this world branzino were definitely his claim to fame at our party!)  We are grateful to Basia and the entire crew at Taralluci for their talent, professionalism and hospitality.  Good to know...Taralluci e Vino offers guests table side choice of antipasti, primi, secondi and dolci. Most restaurants require a completely preset menu.  They have reclaimed wood farm tables so rental linen isn't necessary.  (Big savings.)The lighting in the private rooms is beautiful. Chef makes one gluten free pasta selection each day so they can easily accommodate that dietary restriction as well as vegetarians and vegans.The private rooms have private entrances and private restrooms.  No traipsing through the restaurant necessary.Our private room had its own excellent sound system that can operate off your iPhone or iPod.  Bring your play list!!Basia and staff really CARE about your event.  And that means everything.",0,0,0,Connie K.,"Napa, CA",0,3,0

It was between this place or Rosa Mexicana. The inside looks nice and spacious. It has exposed bricks and has a rustic feel. The waitress working there, I think her name is Soniya, is courteous but has a hint of annoyance in her voice. I don't think she meant to sound annoyed, but that's just how she is, so I let it go. After looking through the menu, I ordered the gnocchetti and my mom ordered the prosciutto and mozzarella panini. While waiting for the meal, a basket of rosemary and olive bread came with a little dish of dipping olive oil. I'm not big on olive bread and the rosemary bread was way too oily. A little while later, the meals came. My gnocchetti had black trumpet mushrooms, asparagus, guanciale, and sprinkled with parmigiano. It was hearty and a good portion. I loved the guanciale in it but I wish I had more asparagus. It's such a heavy dish that it really needed more vegetable to brighten it up. The prosciutto and mozzarella panini has a choice of either 7 grain bread or ciabatta. Decided to get it on 7 grain bread for my mom since she likes her grains. If it wasn't for the prosciutto, there would be absolutely no taste to the panini. I think they either need to get better quality cheese or flavor their food a bit more.

3.0,8/12/2014,"went there for lunch today with a couple of friends to try out their restaurant week menu ..Food was good but service is what disappointed me. The wait time between courses was ridiculous, there was a point that I just wanted to take my dessert to go. When we finally got our food, the waitress never once checked up on us to see how we were doing or if we needed anything. We asked how long the restaurant had been opened for and she had no idea. Even though the food was good I don't know if I would go back because of the service.",0,0,0,Samantha N.,"West Farms, Bronx, NY",17,11,83
2.0,8/8/2014,"This place is more expensive than $$.  It should be a $$$ at least and possible $$$$.  Service seemed a little slow, but I couldn't tell if the waiter was being inattentive or was simply giving us time and space to have a leisurely meal.  I found the portions a bit small for the price.  If you're hungry, you're going to want to get at least two courses and possibly an appetizer, which will bring the price per person to at least $65.  Also, everyone raves about the doughnuts, but they arrived at our table cold and a little stale.  I don't know if they sat in the kitchen window too long or if they just weren't fresh, but they weren't edible.  The waiter did remove them from the bill, but it was an unfortunate negative ending to an otherwise okay dining experience.  The menu is all in italian, so we had a hard time determining what some things were and had to ask a lot of questions.",0,0,0,Andrew W.,"Rego Park, Queens, NY",34,19,8
2.0,7/27/2014,"Went here for a late Sunday lunch without reading reviews for anything but the coffee. For lunch my daughter had the spaghetti, a reasonable portion for a small woman but for the $16 price tag, small. It was enjoyed, but simple, just pasta and tomato sauce. It was also a bit undercooked- a little too al dente, she said, almost like it'd be difficult to digest. She first ordered the salmon quiche, looking forward to the protein and house salad it would come with. The server happily took the order, only to have the host return several minutes later, telling us they were out of the salmon quiche. He offered a bacon one instead, and didn't bring a menu until she requested one. He then hovered over her, expecting an immediate second choice. We shared an insalata, which I enjoyed, but my daughter found the taste of pine nut overpowered the veggies. I had the frittata which promised goat cheese, speck and leek.  Yum!  Apparently they had also run out of goat cheese and substituted Brie w/out informing me.  Sadly I detest Brie melted into food so the whole dish was inedible for me.  For someone else I am sure it would have been delightful.  Thankfully the salad was fine. The espresso as promised was good.I wouldn't go again.  There are too many far better restaurants in Manhattan.  Life is too short for mediocrity",0,0,0,Hilary M.,"Davis, CA",0,3,0
5.0,7/14/2014,"I had my ""rehearsal"" dinner with Taralluci e Vino the week of my wedding and they were excellent! I worked with Amanda, the event manager, and she was able to come up with a proposal that worked within my budget. Prior to booking with them, I was on a restaurant hunt for a place that could fit 20 people without minimum spending charges. But, of course, if you live in NYC, many restaurants will try to get the most of out of you especially when you have a large group.  All I wanted was just a simple dinner with my closest friends and family but some restaurants I called came up with a proposal that required minimum spending charges of $$$$$. Ridiculous. I was relieved when I called Taralluci and asked if they have minimum spending charges for a private dinner party and they said no. Although the original proposal they came up was a bit above my budget, Amanda was able to work around it by waiving the private room fee (which is really a loft space above their main restaurant) and discounted the staff and clean up fees.  The private space is actually a lot larger than I anticipated it to be but it is as private as you can get.  It is their loft space on the second floor above their main restaurant, but there is no direct entrance from the main restaurant to the second floor. They have another side door entrance that takes you up there. The entrance isn't as appealing since it is freight/delivery entrance but once you take the stairs to the second floor, it's a complete change of  scenery. It's almost like entering someone's fancy apartment except you see a private bar area with two long dining tables and lounging sofas on the side. It is really a private space and not some shabby private room. I was pretty amazed with the set up and for them to waive the room fee was way more than I expected. The food was stellar as well. I pre-ordered the 4- course menu that included antipasti, primi, secondi, and dessert and here were the options:Antipasti: Insalatina or BurrataPrimi: Gnoccheti or RavioliSecondi: Capesante or PollettoDessert: Tiramisu or Ananas At first, I didn't think a 3 course would be enough so we went with the 4 course thinking the portions might be small. Boy, was I wrong. By the time I was done with the primi, I was full. The secondi was my favorite and I chose the Capesante (scallops). They were really fresh and huge.  Overall, my guests enjoyed the food and that was all that mattered. Thank you Taralluci again for an amazing experience!

3.0,7/12/2014,"I came here for a friend's birthday dinner.  The service was good.  They prepared a long table for us, which was nice, and they also let us know that tip was already added to the bill when they saw that we were about to tip them again (though I suppose it would have been nicer if they had told us that from the get-go).The burrata appetizer was delicious.  My main course, though, was disappointing.  I had asked the waiter what the vegetarian options were and he mentioned the gnocchetti, so I got that.  Unfortunately, it was very bland and flavorless.  Maybe because they made it without the guanciale?  Still, if he offers it as a vegetarian option, I assumed that meant it would taste good as a vegetarian dish, not just that it's possible to make it without the meat.Erm.... I also saw a cockroach in the bathroom.  Take that however you want.  This is NYC and it was in the bathroom, so I don't want to freak out about it... but gosh, I'd really rather not go back there.",0,0,0,Jai S.,"JACKSON HTS, NY",0,6,0

1.0,3/25/2014,"Alright, let's start off by saying their coffee is awesome. Amazing iced coffee, even in the dead of winter.Okay, that's out of my system.Now let's talk about service.The two guys that currently work the counter could not be less helpful. What happened to the two helpful girls that used to work there? They were great. You know why they were great? Because they took my order.Yeah, that's what I said. Sounds crazy, but after you experience the laziness that's currently standing behind the bar at this place, you'll take anyone that will at least ask you what you want.There's the one guy with the glasses, who literally just stands staring at the espresso machine and talking to people in Italian. Okay, I get that you're trying to make things authentic, but I refuse to believe that people in Italy completely ignore customers. You could walk in there and spontaneously burst into flames, at which point the fire department across the street would rush over and hopefully save you, but you'd get no acknowledgement from this guy.Then there's the other guy, who eventually looks at you like you like some weirdo on the subway, but this is just his way of saying ""what do you want to drink?"" If you can muster up the courage to actually respond, you might be able to get something, but know this: it won't be what you ordered. You want a large? He'll give you a small. You want black coffee? He'll put cream in it. How do I know this? He did both of these things the last time I was there. BOTH of them. Seriously man?Disclaimer: You can completely dismiss this review if you think ""large iced coffee"" is a complicated order. If you think that, you actually might be Tarallucci's target customer.Bottom line, I'm shocked this place would hire such useless people. It's a shame that they make such good coffee, but don't actually have the capability of providing it to their customers.

I couldn't identify its broth, the kale was barely cut so just dumped a big and leafy pile on top, and large lumps of garlic.

Not much room at the high bars, but if you could get a seat, it would be nice and comfy to read a book or chat up with a friend.FOOD: My friend and I ordered the Porchetta Panini and split it, along with two glasses of wine each.  You can order the panini with ciabatta or whole grain - I opted for the ciabatta.  Although I know panini are not supposed to be overstuffed with meat, I sorta wish there was at least 2 layers of the porchetta.  I was sold on the truffle mayo, but didn't really get much of the ""truffle"" flavor overall. Nonetheless, the sandwich was tasty of course, but could've used a little more time on the grill to make it a little crustier.AMBIANCE:  Modern, rustic, and cozy, and clean.  The white finishings, brick walls, and flowers in the middle of the room really makes a girl like me feel....nice.  WILL I RETURN?:  Most definitely.  I also like their 1st Avenue location (another great spot), which is better suited for coffee and studying.",1,0,0,Grace L.,"CANAL STREET, NY",243,20,135

2.0,4/29/2013,"Based on the experience I just had at Tarallucci E Vino for dinner, I'll probably never return, unless it's just for a glass of wine at the bar.  Don't go unless you LOVE horrible service and miniscule portions. It is a shame because the food is quite good (the quality of the food bumped this to 2 stars instead of 1).I've had dinner there once before and drinks/apps a couple of times and was generally pleased, but this last experience was a joke. The biggest issue was the service. It was terrible and slow. Over the course of dinner, our waitress bothered to stop by only to take our order and drop the bill off (after my friend had to get up and ask her for it). Seriously? This is supposed to be a fine dining establishment. It was fully aggravating. As for the food, I will admit that it was beautifully plated and the flavors were nice. We had the rabbit entree and while it looked lovely, the place contained about 1 ounce of rabbit, which was surrounded by savory little favas and fiddleheads. Nice, but it was not a meal, it was a tease that cost $26. The gnocci entree was fine, a couple of mushy pieces of large gnocci with nicely cooked kale plopped on top. The kale was the best part. We shared a dessert, the chocolate one (name slips my mind) and it was nice. A bit or two for each of us, which is probably a good thing because bikini season is coming up and that's all I wanted. With so many excellent restaurants in the city, there is no reason at all to spend your time or money here. I bid a FAREWELL to you, Tarallucci E Vino.

Today, we had the worst experience with the manager and we'll never be back. My kids like the pastries there and my son ordered a cream cornetti (basically an Italian croissant with cream in the very middle and not the ends). He ate the sides and didn't figure out that there wasn't any cream until there was 2 bites left. We told our really nice waiter who said he would change the charge to a plain cornetti which was OK because my son did eat it. The manager came over to see what was wrong and after we told him, he said we should have notified the waiter so he could have fixed it. OK, maybe I wasn't clear about how the cream usually isn't until the very middle so I told my story again. The manager then says that we should have sent it back, and then he says ""Am I right?"". Of course he's right if it was something obvious like we ordered a salad and got a pasta, but that's not what happened. It was a lot of attitude over a $3 item on a $90 bill, particularly when we eat there every weekend and it is expensive for what it is. Because of him, we'll never be back.

The wine was delectable and our server was super knowledgeable. I can't stress enough how much I appreciate when someone knows what they are talking about and are genuinely happy to serve you. As it was transition hour between lunch and dinner, we were confined to ordering from the Panini Menu; however no complaints after the fact. The ciabatta bread rolls were fresh and the side mesclun salad was lightly dressed.

Then the waiter asked us again and brought over wine glasses. Minutes later the maitre d' brought over our glasses of rose and had to take the other wine glasses away. Anyway, I ordered the mortadella emmenthal cheese panini and it was really tasty. A bit on the salty side, but what do you expect with cured pork. The ciabatta was actually a bit too hard, so much so that I  had to be careful how I bit into the panini. If I wasn't careful, it could've cut into the roof of my mouth.

Evidently, a panino at the To Go window is one in the Italian sense of just being a sandwich of any kind, rather than what we have come to expect around here as a pressed, hot sandwich. You know, what makes many a panino good. When I was handed a bag about 4 seconds after I ordered, I probably should've said something, but I figured it couldn't be that bad. What I got was admittedly excellent bread sliced in half, brushed with a tiny bit of olive oil, two slices of ham and one of provolone. This is WEAK for $11. Seriously weak.

My colleague was sweet enough to split two paninis with me so we could try a bit of each. The first one was the eggplant, which we got with mozzarella instead of ricotta at the recommendation of the waiter.  Actually our waiter had quite a few opinions when it came to the menu, which I found to be refreshing. The sandwich was really good and while I didn't get to try the ricotta I agree the mozzarella complimented the eggplant perfectly. As for the other panini we split the smoked salmon. Also good, but if I were to choose just 1 next time I'd most likely stick with the eggplant.I also tasted a bite of another colleague's gnocchi and it was quite good.

The spinach and marscapone ravioli in brown butter and prosciutto is in my opinion the single best item on the menu, but I had to pace myself to not finish before my date. I have tried all of the croissants during the last year and they are well made flaky on the outside and tender inside..... scrumptious  and they have other offerings as well.The service can get slightly sketchy if they are busy.

I don't care if you have sand in your vag, smile.So, he lost his wine cork and the two ladies he served before me, this tool needed this tool. He goes on a whiney fit to the floor manager, I need my wine tool. He then tells the ladies that he needs his tool. Shut the eff up stupid, be a professional and beg, borrow or steal one. Just don't throw a hissy fit in front of me because I'll tell my 100K Yelp friends and post it on facebook. I asked him for a bar menu and between 4:30 and 5:00 there is a menu change and so he couldn't sell anything?? I didn't want his bar nuts so in my mind I said eff you and let me get outta dodge.Needless to say, this tool found his tool and all was right with the world. I asked him for a recommendation for a different glass of wine and he was spot on. He was able to open a new bottle of wine. Yay!

Definitely heavier on meat-based small plates, it was not entirely easy, nor was it incredibly difficult, to find something meat-free. I opted for Verdure Arrostite, Vinaigrette alle Erbe, Ricotta Salata. The vegetables were roasted well, and presented beautifully, with triangularly shaved pieces of ricotta salata.

That process can take 10 minutes.

The breads were yummy! And they gave us more, too. I had the roasted vegetables which had way too many mushrooms for my liking, but everything else on it (especially the tomatoes) were good. The spaghetti (I forget the actual name) reminded me of Chef Boyardee spaghetti but it was yummy nonetheless (maybe because I was famished?). The portions were really tiny, though. I definitely had room for dessert, and then some. Dessert was VERY good--of course I had to get the tiramisu and it was pretty much amazing.

Wet, slimy, undercooked and sooooo small.  Finally, the next dish, a fried fish, was also disappointing.  The final straw was there was an open door next to the restaurant using a hose and cleaning the ground while we were eating our food.  It smelled awful...lots of bleach.  A woman next to us had her handbag on the ground, and it got wet!  We moved tables and were so shocked.  The hostess did apolagize for the guy cleaning.  However, at this point we were done.  I got the check and my boyfriend mentioned quietly how he was disappointed...upon his return to the table, there was $30 removed from the bill.  They bought us each a glass of wine, and paid for some of the food.  We both would have rather had a pleasurable dining experience than a comp.  My boyfriend is a former restaurant owner, and currently is involved in the restaurants in New York.  He said this about the place, ""This was my worst dining experience in New York City in 15 years.""",2,1,0,Christina S.,"New York, NY",282,34,49

First, the good: delicious duck ragu, amaaaazing braised octopus, and delectable desserts (white chocolate wafers with watermelon and a strawberry/pistachio napoleon). But, the bad: the lambchops with candied fruit had great flavor but were inexplicably tough. They didn't seem overcooked, but they lacked the tenderness that lambchops should have, somehow. Also, the service was inattentive -- when we pointed out that we'd never been given bread, the manager offered to comp us dessert and espresso. Lo and behold, the dessert and espresso was not comped, until I pointed this out as well. I hate having to complain at restaurants -- it makes me really uncomfortable -- but they were compliant enough and seemed sorry about the inconvenience.

For those of you who are wine bar fans, you will love this place.   Their wine selection is top notch, we had a 2003 Barbaresco that was stuuuuuning!  We had decided that no one was really into having  a really heavy meal so we had ordered almost the entire app menu plus 3-4 mains and split it.  No problem.  The food was scrumptious.  Recommend the sage leaf fritters, the deconstructed beet lasagna w/rabbit ragu and the gnocchi.  One of the main things that really stood out was the service, Sean (at least I think that is was his name) was simply the best.  Very friendly and welcoming, knew the menu backwards and forwards, knew his wine list perfectly and had great suggestions.  He was never all over you but always knew when you needed something.  We had an extra person show up about 2/3 into the meal, no problem.  The extra food ordered for the late comer was expedited so that he could still eat with the rest of us and the rest of the party wouldn't have to wait around for ever for him to finish his meal.I have been back a few times since this initial visit and have not been disappointed .  The reason for only four stars is that it is a bit pricey for what it is.  As good as the food is here, it's just a bit too pricey, but I'm not going to let that stop me from going back.",0,0,1,John T.,"Maplewood, NJ",90,58,6

The menu is pretty extensive for a wine bar. We shared an appetizer of the Polipo Brasato, Agretto di Peperoni e Patate Candite, or the Braised Octopus, cream of peppers, and candied potatoes. This dish was pretty good. It wasn't as good as the grilled octopus at Kefi, but it was good in its own way. The octopus was slightly overcooked but the flavors was top notch. The sauce worked well with the octopus. The candied potatoes just tasted like home fries. For entrees, my friend had the Lasagnetta aperta alle Bietole Rosse, Coniglio Brasato su Crema di Carciofi, open beef lasagnetta, braised rabbit on artichoke puree. It was pretty good. The pasta was cooked al denta, and the rabbit was fork tender and very flavorful. I ordered the Tortelli di Funghi, Robioloa e Castagne Glassate alla Anatra e Pecorino, mushroom, chestnut, and robiola tortelli duck glaze and pecorino shavings. The tortellini was cooked well here too, but i thought this dish was way too salty for my taste. The sauce was just too overpowering. I had to drink a lot of water to down this dish.Honestly, this place would get a 1 for just the food, but the atmosphere, gives it another star. I think i would have given it 3 stars if I tried a different dish. This place looks it it will be a good wine bar to meet friends/coworkers after work and just hang out and shoot the shiet.

Don't pass it up like I have many many times! I work in the area and have never noticed this place. So today I stopped at their to-go window with a co-worker for their gelato. Oh my. I am not a big gelato fan, but this gelato is great! After trying the bacio and pistachio I finally decided to go with the carmel. The best way to describe the flavor would be the whipped cream and carmel that's leftover from a carmel frappacino (from starbucks). In the time I was deciding what to order (like 2-3 minutes), at least 3 people stopped by to order their coffee, so it must be good! Especially since Starbucks is right down the block. And you know NYers with their Starbucks (loyal and/or addicted).Anyways, I'm looking forward to having lunch there soon - especially after all these great reviews I've read. The customers there did seem a little pretentious and snobby - but hey, with $3.50 small gelatos what do you expect? Oh yea, that's another thing. They serve the gelato in this small cup and fill it up to the rim and flatten the top out. I'm not sure if that's how gelatos are traditionally served but I found that a little weird. I guess that's the ""neatest"" way to serve it. Well, I forgot all about that once I dug my tiny spoon into heaven and had my first taste. Mmm, what a great after noon treat.Ps.

3.0,7/13/2007,"This Italian restaurant/wine bar is really conveniently located - very close to the Union Square train station. This in combination with a high rating from Zagat was enough to make me want to try it.I really disliked the decor of this place. Normally, I don't give a hoot about such things. But they've obviously paid a decorator to create a certain ""look"", and what they wound up with is an incredibly simple combination of rustic with retro. A combination that is just silly. But because it is so minimalistic and bare, you have to be really vigilant to pick up on it. I guess I was in a scrutinizing mood.Another thing that didn't escape my scrutiny was the lack of bread on the table. So the minimalism extended beyond just the decor.All main dishes had two prices next to them about ten dollars apart. I figured they were the lunch vs. dinner prices, but it turned out they were the small size vs. large size prices. That's cool, it's pick-a-size dinning. How innovative! It lets the restaurant charge more for a regular size entree because it looks large next to the smaller version of the same thing.The extensive wine list was completely lost on us. I like white wine. But details like bouquet, tannins, and body are lost on me. To compliment the wine we got sea food entrees, which were very good. In general the menu is balanced enough to appeal to a variety of preferences - there's pastas, fish and meat. Everything we got was very good. The dessert was outstanding. We had a warm chocolate cake and little donuts filled with zabaione cream (which kicks the crap out of Boston cream) with chocolate dipping sauce.

I had the salad w/ the oranges in it which was ok but I think I should've gotten something else.
