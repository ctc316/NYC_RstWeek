5.0,4/14/2019,"The House is my go-to happy hour place in Manhattan. The staff is always attentive and friendly and the manager - I believe he said his name is Adrian - is super nice, hardworking, and professional and makes customers feel very welcome. You just can't beat the upscale, but very comfortable atmosphere. Great place to bring friends or a date as the music is low enough to actually hear one another talk. The cocktail list is great, but I'd love to see some new drinks on the list as it's been the same for years now! Overall I highly recommend. Come for the cucumber martini & happy hour snacks (the deviled eggs are amazing) and stay for the truffle mac and cheese & brownie sundae.",0,0,0,Ella G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0
5.0,4/7/2019,"Hidden gem!  So glad we found it. Charming setting inside a town house, servers couldn't have possibly been more pleasant and professional. And the food was absolutely delicious. We had French toast, flat breads, lobster club, soup, and home fries. One dish was better than the next. We will definitely be back!",0,0,0,Jennifer S.,"New York, NY",0,28,0
4.0,3/11/2019,"I'm not usually one to think about making it to Happy Hour (I still say it's kinda sad when you really think about it, but I'm prone to overthinking things). Our small group was celebrating a colleague and if I have to do HH anywhere, I will say The House is the place to do it... and do it with style! I love this place. I can't speak to the food (there's sadly nothing vegan nor the possibility to veganize anything), but quality craft cocktails and wine at a significant discount has me all gaga. What's more? It's both elegant and cozy at the bar area, which is next to a crackling fireplace. Yes, I will winter here. I started with a positively delicious blackberry fizz, made with beloved Mezcal and something about the smokiness of the Mezcal mixed with the sweetness of the berries and, uh, ""fizz"" is pretty dang magical. Not to mention the bar goddess of the hour was a pleasure to speak with. We couldn't even overwhelm her with our requests for more and more, even as the place filled up around 6pm. The environs and the offerings of the House really made me feel... at home (and possibly at peace with throwing a couple back before dark).",16,6,13,Joi B.,"Hudson Valley, NY",3982,1796,1305
4.0,3/11/2019,"I used to associate ""happy hour"" with $2-5 (depending on the level of class we were going for) well drinks and beer, standing room only dives, lascivious women, questionable decisions, and hangovers.The House (and my old age) has me rethinking what it can be. High quality cocktails, good wine, refined appetizers, and relaxing in a beautiful room with a fireplace...times have changed. The House is a very classy restaurant that just happens to offer half-priced cocktails after work, and didn't realize that they were going to bring riff-raff like us in with such a deal. We stayed too long, had too many, cramped the bus boy's style in the small space...and I'd do it all again. If only for the grilled pineapple and jalapeño margarita, and the deviled eggs.",9,5,13,Peter D.,"Brooklyn, NY",4675,3021,10459
5.0,2/26/2019,"I should just let you know that this review is only for the cocktails and the deviled eggs. Not like there is anything else that is vital to a successful happy hour. I can only speak to the main floor, the one with the bar and gorgeous fire place that makes you feel like you are in your dream living room. It is cozy and warm and our group of 6 fit perfectly around the bar. At half price cocktails starting at 4:30, I think this makes for an ideal little spot to grab drinks. Granted, they are normally $17 cocktails but still -  They are strong and tasty and the setting is beautiful, so the happy hour price is well worth it. I got two drinks: The blackberry fizz (you can realllllly taste the Mezcal) and the grilled pineapple and jalapeño margarita. The margarita stole the show. Highly recommended. I tried my best to keep my excitement under wraps when my group ordered a few rounds of deviled eggs.  I apologize for not doing so well. But they just looked so great, and each order came with four different flavors: caviar, bacon, lobster and jalapeño. Get. The. Eggs. The bartenders were wonderful and friendly, the ambiance was cozy, and the drinks were great. I highly recommend for Happy Hour!",6,3,7,Katarina L.,"Whitehouse Station, NJ",487,143,311
5.0,2/17/2019,Loved this cocktail bar. This is a hidden gem in the union square neighborhood. Perfect place to go for date night or catch up with a friend.

Would definitely recommend and come back!,0,0,1,Jannatun N.,"Queens, Queens, NY",1,25,5
4.0,2/17/2019,"Stopped in here for Winter Restaurant Week on a Tuesday night for dinner. We were seated right away and went through the menu. I ordered the Burrata with peaches, Scallops, and Royal Dome for dessert. Everything tasted very good. I loved how all the flavors blended together unexpectedly; like the saltiness of the burrata with the honey covered peaches. The only think i will point out is that it may not be diet/food allergy friendly. My friend has an allergy to dairy and she had some trouble finding things that she was able to eat. Ambience is very cute. The first floor of the house has a bar with a few high top tables, while the second floor is filled with 20 or so smaller tables. We were lucky enough to sit upstairs right in front of the big window (a fun view!). Given the proximity to others, it's a little tight in there, but not annoyingly so. Service was equally as good. Our waiter and the other guys working were attentive, friendly and not pushy at all. They let us sit and enjoy without feeling like we needed to leave as soon as dessert was done. Overall, I highly recommend this place for a date night or a catch up with a friend. It's a fun setting for a nice cozy meal and drinks.",0,0,0,Marelle C.,"Manhattan, NY",192,154,0

2.0,2/1/2019,"Only thing going for this place is the historic ambiance. Hosting staff was rude, service was poor, food was low quality.

5.0,12/9/2018,Very intimate and quite a find   Had the burrata salad and as a main course the short ribs which were very very tender you can cut with a fork. My husband had the octopus salad and the cassoulet which he said was excellent. They were very attentive and were so kind to give us champagne and dessert because it was our 50th anniversary.

3.0,12/4/2018,"It was a surprising choice for a brunch but a good friend came here a couple years ago and she wanted to revisit because she had such a good time. The House menu for brunch isn't anything super unique. It's slightly elevated version of typical brunch. The price is somewhat average for brunch around the city though it only comes with the entire (as some places around the city usually offers a brunch drink with the meal). I had the House Burger ($21) - it was really good, went way above my expectations because other Brunch review of the restaurant seemed lukewarm at best. The fried egg's yolk was too runny for me and it was quite messy, but it ended up being great sauce for the tasty buns to soak up and deliver straight to my hungry belly. I would not suggest it for anyone who is trying to impress somebody sitting across from you. I would suggest it if you only care about flavor. My friend had the House Benedict ($17) - that hollandaise was fabulous. I do feel the need to say the service is painstakingly difficult to receive - the waitstaff took about 20 minutes to take our order. The food took another 20 ish minutes to come out. It was hard to grab their attention. Maybe they were shortstaffed. Overall, maybe not the place for stress-relieving brunch gathering to look outside and be super hip. More for friends who need a secret place to eat messy food while dishing some gossip behind the scenes - as we all need to on glorious weekend.",1,0,0,Joanne K.,"New York, NY",203,79,165

4.0,11/12/2018,"An exceptionally cozy, little spot in Gramercy. The layout and design create an intimate environment- perfect for a date or special dinner. There are two floors- we were seated on the second floor, which had a nice, tiny bar in the back and about 8 tables. The food and service overall were incredible. We got the charred octopus to start, which was well seared and served with olive hummus. For my main I got the scallops- they were tender and came in a delicious creamy sauce with mussels and chorizo for extra flavor. The braised short ribs were also great and came with farro, my grain of choice. My only complaint was that the side dishes were a bit underwhelming. The roasted fingerling potatoes were a bit bland, and the sauteed brussel sprouts didn't have a nice crunch and texture to them. But on another bright note, the restaurant gave us complimentary champagne to celebrate a special occasion, which was incredibly nice. Would highly recommend The House!",0,0,0,Audrey T.,"New York, NY",4,219,4

The food however, is really lackluster. We came here for brunch, everyone ordered a different dish, none was very memorable. The eggs were dry, toast and pastries were stale, potatoes were old.

2.0,2/12/2018,"Ugh wanted to like it, but the other reviews hold try. Came here on a Friday night for dinner with my boyfriend during Restaurant Week. We easily made a reservation on open table and were seated promptly. The restaurant is super cute and intimate and romantic, but that's honestly the best part. Our waiter was very friendly, but management honestly had him over staffed and he was trying to serve the entire upstairs all by himself. This was about 5 tables too many. He basically got half of our order wrong. There were three options for the entree. I got the risotto and my boyfriend chose the chicken. The server brought out two sea basses...they took them back but we had to wait a bit for them to be replaced. For dessert, we both ordered the creme brûlée. The waiter somehow remembered we both ordered the apple galette instead and came over to offer us something else from the menu since they had run out of that dessert - kind but we never ordered that in the first place! Overall, the food is still pretty tasty. My mussels as my appetizer I enjoyed as well as the risotto and creme brûlée. Portions were satisfactory. However we also ordered the choice of 5 cheeses to start, and I kid you not, two of the cheeses were the same...they served us 4 different cheeses and a second piece of one to make 5...we could never get the waiter's attention so we told another server. He said that wasn't right and would tell the waiter. The waiter never apologized. When he asked how our food was while cleaning our plates, I mentioned the issue and he then apologized but said he didn't know what to do about that. I said it was fine, but wish they could've just paid more attention to give us the correct spread in the first place- doesn't seem that hard! At the end, the waiter forgot to give us our check so we were waiting until the entire restaurant cleared out and had to put the credit card on the table to remind him...he ended up giving us each an extra glass of wine (we had bought a bottle of prosecco for the meal), but it honestly was too late for all the missteps. One or two would have been fine but four significant ones just proves definite flaw in the way things are run at this restaurant. Management need to hire more staff and train better to be more attentive for the prices of the restaurant! Because of restaurant week, our meal was less than $100 pp all in, but regularly is definitely expensive for this sort of service :/",4,0,1,Dana H.,"Manhattan, NY",766,296,1380

It was a small table, near the bar, and the seats were barstools with no back. I immediately asked for a different table, since I don't want to perch on a barstool to eat dinner. Host went to check and told us we could sit at a table downstairs, but he had a reservation for that table coming at 7:30 (It was just before 6 pm then). We said ok. The whole time  we were there the place had several open tables that remained unused, so they didn't seem that busy. The food was just ok, and the service was sloppy and not polished. A food runner brought our orders and kept handing my plates to me across the table, rather than coming around to my side. We ordered desserts and an espresso. The warm apple gallette had a warm outer crust but the apple filling was cold. The espresso came- no lemon rind or inquiry as to if we wanted sugar. Just a cup with espresso. The creme brulee was in a tiny ramekin with mediocre presentation.

We shared the deviled eggs and burrata and both were delicious and shareable for groups of 3-4. The lobster roll was also the perfect amount of food. The only criticism I have is that the bread was a little too hard to bite. At the end of the meal, we were given three scoops of ice cream on the house (fig, basil, and a creamy flavor). If this wasn't great enough, we were offered one of their umbrellas to bring home with us because it was raining outside.

Our waiter was so friendly, attentive and really went out of his way to make the evening special for us. The ambience is very romantic and intimate, with dim lights-perfect for a date night. The truffle mac and cheese was creamy goodness, it's a definite must. My boyfriend ordered the steak and I got The House burger. Although both were delicious, I definitely regretted not getting the steak! As for cocktails, their dirty martinis are perfectly balanced. The cucumber martini is sweet and refreshing-perfect for a hot summer day. Their passion fruit mule was also one of my favorites!

1.0,5/18/2017,"The buzz about this place must be the sound of the bugs.   This place was awful.  Broken air conditioner and an ugly oscillating fan on the wall as a replacement.  Hostess audibly talking about what bars she used to go to in the area when she was under age.  In the middle of my second glass of pinot noir, I looked down and realized there were 6 full dead bugs in the glass.  When I finally got the waiter's attention he said it was not his fault.  (Not concerned with me or an apology.) He said the bottle must of been left open from the prior evening on which he did not work.  No apology, no shock, just walked away to get a replacement glass.  When I spoke to the manager she seemed unclear what the issue was, as we had been offered a new glass of wine.  Yuck.  After I said I would expect effusive apologies, rather than none, she gave an  apology and said there was a bug problem due to the current air conditioner problem, but assured us it does not impact the kitchen.  YUCK.  For what it's worth the flatbread app was good if you are willing to subject yourself to rudeness, classlessness, overbearing heat, wine being left open over night and a bug problem.  You can likely just do that for free on the front steps of any other little ""charming"" building in the neighborhood.",0,0,0,Scott U.,"Manhattan, NY",1,1,2

3.0,1/2/2017,"This is the review of afternoon tea only. Since my mother was coming for a visit during Thanksgiving holiday, I looked for an afternoon place that we haven't been to. Then, I found a coupon that will get us the afternoon tea for two at half the price! So I bought two coupons; one for my husband and I, and another one for my mother and I. So, this will be a combination if my two separate visits.It has two stories, and both floor has a full bar. Not very large space, so reservation is recommended. They have a beautiful fireplace on the first place, keeping the space nice and warm. The interior is simply but elegant, decorated differently with each season.Their afternoon tea comes with a choice of pot of tea, two scones, a choice of sandwich, assorted cookies, and a choice of dessert presented on a 3-tiered serving tray. Right off the bat, the waiter told us that they are out of couple of teas... Our reservation was right at when they opened, so it was not like they ran out after so many customers ordered them. I guess they ran out of the inventory and didn't order more teas? The food was good, not great. I prefer the ones that comes with several kinds of finger sandwiches, instead of getting just one kind of your choice. The teas were made at the bar by bartenders, which was kind of funny. They strained the tea leaves before pouring it into the pot, so it had a minimal amount of leaves left in the pot. The dessert was not so good. The Red Velvet Cheesecake needs some serious makeover. Same could be said about our waiter. He was not friendly nor attentive. We realized there was no ""assorted cookies"" on the tier. When the waiter (finally) came by, we asked about the cookies. He said strongly ""it was on the plate."" Well, if it was not the plate, why are we asking about it? I guess he caught up to this common sense situation, and he said ""oh, they weren't? I will get some for you."" After another 5 min or so, he brought us three cookies. Chocolate chip cookie, jam filled cookie, and more like a brownie type one. They were all just ok, nothing much to say about any of them.Our second visit was much better, with different server this time. She was very nice, attentive, and took care of us better than the first guy. Everything that we supposed to receive was on the tier, so that was another plus.Overall, it was just ok, not great. If we had the female server the both visit, our total experience would have been better for sure.

4.0,12/15/2016,"The House is a converted carriage house, and you can definitely tell its roots by walking in. The area is homey and cozy - you really feel as if you're walking into someone's sitting room!My company had a holiday party here, so we were in a private room downstairs, in their house cellar. The space was a little small - we had 14 people and weren't all able to sit easily at the same table. We had to do some rearranging so that we were all together. But the food and drinks were the real highlights! The House's cocktail menu is extensive and creative - unfortunately, I didn't order off it this time around, but I did get a hot toddy (hot tea, lemon, honey, and whiskey) which was very good, and perfect for the chilly weather (strong too!). We had a prix fixe three course menu. I ordered the burrata, cassoulet, and warm apple galette with mexican cinnamon gelato. I expected the burrata to be warm, and although it wasn't, it was delicious! Thick, rich cheese that was perfectly seasoned, atop toasted bread, and sweetly marinated shallots and onions. I also tried the octopus and market flatbread from the very generous people sitting next to me. Octopus is notoriously difficult to do right, but the House does better than just right. The octopus was grilled to perfection! I only wish the portion size was bigger. The entree - cassoulet - is a sort of stew made with duck sausage, lamb shoulder, and beans. It's brought to you in a cast iron pan and is amazingly delicious and smoky. It really is comfort food. Again, my generous neighbor shared a bite of her braised short ribs and farro risotto with me. The meat was super juicy and soft - like it had been cooked in a stew for hours. The farro risotto was a perfect complement - lightly flavored, and plain enough that it didn't overwhelm the rich short ribs.Dessert was the warm apple cake - it was simply apple slices cooked in sugar and cinnamon and arranged in a puff pastry shell. At this point in the meal, I was incredibly full, but I kept going - I mean, it was already in front of me, and it was so good! The mexican cinnamon gelato was wonderful as well, with a light, sweet flavor that wasn't overwhelming at all.The House is all about comfort and comfort food - which makes its name all the more fitting.",0,1,0,Rachel S.,"New York, NY",8,39,54
4.0,12/6/2016,Went here for brunch. You literally feel as if you are stepping into another world when you enter The House. It feels very old New York or perhaps even reminiscent of a Bed & Breakfast in Vermont. The food is not cheap but it is good. The food matches the restaurant - it's traditional  & refined. The House offers a nice combination of upscale cuisine in a relaxed but elegant setting. The bread that morning was so delicious! As it turned out it was from another place I love - Balthazar bakery. The eggs were ok. I preferred the French toast.  The waiter forgot my drink but it was such a nice place to just sit and relax that I didn't mind. I definitely did not feel rushed at all. I left a generous tip. Really enjoyed the experience. Afterwards I took a walk over to Union Square. Great location too.,0,0,1,Marie S.,"New York, NY",52,270,196

The House is beautiful and cozy but that's about the only positive thing about this place.We came here with a 50% off afternoon tea from Pulsd (as was EVERYONE ELSE at this place) but it was still not worth what we paid. Can't imagine what we would've felt if it was full price...Basically, you get a pot of less than average tea, mediocre sandwiches, and unappetizing desserts for $50pp (or $25 if you got the deal). Oh and did I mention you have to wait 45 minutes just for your tea set to come out?! Yeah. We timed it. The service was absolutely HORRENDOUS. They didn't check in on us even once. We constantly had to flag down the waiter, and it was completely empty downstairs. Really inefficient operations here. They did comp us a glass of prosecco, but that still doesn't make up for the terrible experience we had. The lobster sandwich was edible (the BLT was not), and the red velvet cake and chocolate mousse were sad excuses of what they were supposed to be. Even the scones from Alice's Tea were not that fresh. Overall, I would never recommend anyone to come here. They are heavily overpriced for no reason at all.

Otherwise the House was well decorated and the noise level was perfect to hold a conversation. For our dinner we started with a half dozen oysters and the plating was well received. For the entrees, I had the scallops and felt that the presentation was very well done But the serving size was a bit meager with four scallops, three petite roasted carrots, and a crispy wafer of pancetta, dressed with a semi glaze and sprinkling of hazelnut. While perfectly cooked, it was more like an appetizer portion. My date had the Chattem Cod which was beautifully plated and a healthy serving for an entree.Desert was top notch between the Chocolate Mouse Cake and the Red Velvet Cheesecake. Both were plated equal to some of the top restaurants in the area.Overall the staff was superb and did not hover or ask if everything was good when in mid bite of our food which made us both feel as if the staff was well aware of their timing and kept things moving in a fashion expected of a fine dining experience.

I would say that the mac n cheese was insanely good - however I'd really recommend adding some more gooey cheese on top as it felt very creamy but didn't satisfy the cheesy level I wanted.

5.0,5/29/2016,"LOVE everything about The House. Outstanding ambiance, service and food in a beautiful, charming restaurant that is a restored 1854 carriage house. I passed The House several times and was curious to try. Having a drink to start a girls night out nearby, I called and asked if one of their few outside tables would be available for dinner and made a reservation.A room for everyone who appreciates charm, character. Different floors of The House suitable for different occasions and preferences: perfect girls night outside or at the downstairs bar, perfect date night downstairs, perfect for private parties or gatherings. More formal feeling upstairs, more cozy and a little more lively downstairs. When we arrived, our table was not available yet so we ventured upstairs to check out the mini bar and use the restroom while waiting. The upstairs  room while very nice with interesting Windows has a more formal feeling, suitable for a quieter date or formal get together. Even the bartender at the small bar upstairs had a more formal demeanor.  Not what we wanted for our Thursday girls night so we went back downstairs. The hostess asked if we wanted to have a seat at a table while waiting for ours to clear, and ordered us a drink. Very attentive and sweet.The first floor is cozy, charming, very pretty with a fireplace in the back. A slightly livelier feel with some people having conversation at the bar, and several tables for less formal dining than upstairs. The ambiance felt perfect for a date which I said to my friend as we were seated across the table from each other with a small candle in between us. But, not being on a date, we were looking forward to our outside table... A number of people were walking in and heading downstairs so there is another area downstairs as well likely for private parties. Finally our table was ready - the server sweetly apologized that it took so long and said the first round of drinks were on The House. Very nice gesture. There  are only 3 outside tables so this is prime at The House, near the sidewalk of a charming Gramercy street, festive feeling as people walking the sidewalks pass by.  Service. The hostess and server Brendan were wonderful. Personable, friendly.  Brendan had a great personality with wit while also being knowledgable about the menu and with great recommendations. The food. Everything was Incredible and really well  presented . We had:- gourmet deviled egg sampler, so pretty and the lobster deviled egg was my favorite of the four.. Others were Caviar and crème fraiche, jalapeño, bacon.- grilled octopus carpaccio. Both our first time having this amazing dish that when looking at it initially we were a little apprehensive, but it was delicious. We both loved it. - Long Island duck. This may be the best duck I've had, and my friend loved it as her first time having it, saying it tasted almost like steak - which it did. Tender, cooked perfectly and the light sauce was wonderful.  - brownie Sunday dessert. This was just divine and a perfect ending to the meal with my sambuca. Drinks. Brendan recommended a spicy Martini off their special drink list which was great and served with a jalapeño slice giving it a kick.My friend pointed out that everyone who passed looked up and checked out the lights. No wonder as the charmingly lit House restaurant is more charming looking at night. Just as my friend pointed out that everyone who passed was stopping to take a look, a couple walked by, and the woman slowed asking her date, ""what is this place?"" He was on his phone but looked up to see the name and said, ""the house; write it down."" Yes, I thought, write it down. Or yelpers Bookmark it.

The food and and cocktails were really what stood out.  The cucumber martini was PERFECT!  As were the green toast and the roasted vegetables!  But, do not - I repeat, do NOT - skip the truffled potatoes.  Good lord.  I love anything and everything that has to do with truffles and I think it's safe the say that there were the best potatoes I've ever had in my life.  The staff was also great - friendly, but not overbearing - and super knowledgable.  Don't wander past The House like I did!  Go inside and check it out!",0,0,0,Abbi H.,"New York, NY",0,1,0

5.0,5/17/2016,"It's too crowded and too expensive but so is everywhere else good in NYC so just drink a little and you won't feel so stressed about how damned crowded it is or the fact you're spending $80 for Mac & Cheese plus two glasses of wine.  You could feed an African Village for a month for $80.But considering that you're not moving, and you probably won't donate to Africa either, I would suggest the bar here, on a weeknight, on the early side like 5pm. Nice nice atmosphere and good wine selections. Bartenders don't have much personality or conversation skills, but it's not that kind of place. It's a place where yuppies go to feelat home and they don't want the help to talk to them.If you get any food here I definitely recommend the roast chicken. You'd be surprised how many places in NYC like this one that serve chicken for over $30 actually screw it up.  Not these guys. This chicken is juicy.  It's pretty good. And the veggies they serve it with must be local because they're really good.Ok, I might sound misanthropic but that's my review. Five stars. Go to House!

3.0,5/13/2016,"A cozy and welcoming respite in an area where Casa Mono and Pierre Loti pack 'em in on the reg, The House was the perfect setting for a long overdue mid-week double date - and did I mention the fireplace? The cocktail list is a succinct mix of classic twists and seasonally-inspired sips and the beer/wine offerings sufficient enough to satisfy any palette - though cheap they are not.And then...the food. It's hard to keep your eyes from getting to big for your stomach as every single appetizer sounds just plain delish - we opted for the octopus carpaccio, deviled eggs (BEST CHOICE EVER), the burrata and fennel and celery salad. The octopus was a bit under-seasoned and dainty as dainty can be, as was the salad despite our waiter's insistence that it was by far the top salad choice -i think feeling was both sounded far better on paper than in execution; the burrata however was spot on and the rich textures and flavors played incredibly well alongside the sweet and slightly savory morsels of figs and pickled onions. The quartet of deviled eggs was an absolute standout - and let's be honest, with a roster of lobster, bacon, caviar and jalepeno, it'd be hard not to! Still starvacious, we were ready for more. Two of us opted for the duck while the other pair was split between the scallops and the cod. While the cod was portioned well, I almost came close to asking where the other half of my duck was. (whoops :-)) The duck itself was outstanding and incredibly well seasoned, as was the dish in its entirety - w/ its silky sunchokes and garlicky undertones...but for 30 plus buckaroos, and for a dinner portion, 2 slices was unfortunately not nearly enough to keep my eyes from wandering to other tables..and my mind from wandering to what might or might not be waiting to hijack from my fridge once back home.Finally, we all excitedly dug our spoons into the warm apple gallette after poring over the dessert menu and idling over the mouthwatering descriptions, each better than the next. The tart was a bit of a let down, but the mexican cinnamon gelato was unreal...Will I go back? Absolutely! (especially during the holidays when the twinkly lights play so well with the fireplaces)Will i over order? Yes. And i urge all of you to do the same...unless you too would like to fall victim to hankerings for late night pizza or the good ole corner bodegaWill I try both the burger and the truffled mac and cheese? Yes and definitely yes...bc there just so happened to be a lucky son of a gun next to me enjoying one all to himself...good thing he was just out of arms' length.Parents in town (you can actually hear each other? crazy....) or biz dinner appropo...Now go forth and dine",0,0,0,Victoria G.,"New York, NY",34,136,21

I only came for drinks, but the previous reviews have convinced me to come back for food (and of course, more drinks).One thing about the drinks: a *bit* expensive for what they are. I mean, the cocktails are wonderful. Delicious. Divine. But $15 each? Seems like a bit much to me considering the other $15 cocktails out there. That was the only downside to this place for me. Considering the area that it's in, I'm sure The House does fine with their pricing - obviously it didn't deter me from ordering something.But this is not to knock the cocktails by any means (just the prices..): my cocktail left me wanting to try the rest on the menu. I can't remember the name of my drink for the life of me (and I can't find it online either - sorry Yelpers, I promise it exists), but it had gin, vodka, I believe basil, and one or two more ingredients. Shaken and served in a martini glass (see photo). My friend got the Hemingway. I'm not a rum fan so I personally didn't like it, but he seemed to be very pleased with his choice.Ambience: A+. According to my friend, The House used to be a cottage. I know, shocking, given the name of the establishment. I always applaud bars and restaurants that seem to effortless combine classy and homey to create an altogether pleasant environment. This is a great place to go with friends who want a more upscale evening but still want to just eat, drink and be merry. My friend and I sat at the bar but I'd love to get a table next time. One more note: They have a coat check. Very grateful for that.

I tried the punch also, had a strong bourbon flavor. It was good but not my thing. The bartender was extremely nice. He made conversation with us like we were all friends.

There were a few akward dates, tourists and a smattering of wide eyed burb'ites. The Hostess was accommodating, we had a reservation for two but picked up a straggler so they were nice enough to give us a cozy table for four upstairs by the window. Our waiter was very nice and not overbearing. The food was good but again, not that interesting. Here's what we had:1. Special flatbread - this was very good2. Deviled egg tasting - these were great if youlike deviled eggs, the jalepeno lobster being my fav.3. Kale ceasar - meh, I've had better4. Braised short ribs au poivre - now I'll admit, this was an outstanding dish 5. Brussel sprouts - your standard with lardons, very goodThe wine list is a bit small and since we were a few cocktails in, I didn't want to spend a ton on a bottle so I went with the perfectly serviceable Bonarda.Like I said it was a perfectly fine evening but with all the choices in NYC I don't like to spend my going out $$ on just fine.

After maybe 10 minutes, the waitress came to seat us. First, we split the Bibb and Endive Salad, and then both got the Truffle Mac and Cheese. The salad was pretty good, I just wish it had had more Gorgonzola, since I'm not a big fan of pears (my boyfriend picked the salad). The mac and cheese was amazing, but it came in such a huge bowl!

All of the staff expressed their eagerness to provide nothing less then top notch service. For the majority of our meal we had the quaint patio to ourselves and it was picture perfect and you couldn't help but think of how Manhattan must have been in the late 1800's especially since the restaurant used to be an old carriage house (which we really got a kick out of).  The restaurant also has a restroom on each of its 3 floors which I found to be such a luxury since in Paris not only are restrooms hard to find but they are wretched.

I asked about it and found out that it just re-opened and is under new ownership. Now unfortunately I did not get to try this place under the old owner, and I'm not sure if the food has changed as a result, but I felt disappointed by my dinner here. It simply was not that good. Given I only tasted two entrees, and perhaps their appetizers or other dishes may have been better, but I was not impressed by the two that I tasted. I had the wild boar lasagna. While cheesy in parts, and the boar was interesting it wasn't good enough for me to finish it. The short ribs were good, but standard.

4.0,3/30/2014,"Stumbled upon The House last winter with a friend shortly after it's opening & it made a lasting impression. Glad to see that other local yelpers have caught on to the hype. The House is called by its name for a reason; whether you're wining or dining here, you feel as cozy and 'at-home' as though you were doing so in your own home but with the added convenience of being attended to & serviced. Came here for drinks one night & then lunch on a weekday. Cocktails here are delicious and bartenders are professionals at making them. The upstairs dining section has a small bar area where you could seat possibly 4-6 people, if that. Very dark & sexy - perfect for dates. The upstairs dining experience looked very intimate and also perfect for a dinner date. For lunch, we booked a res using the Savored phone app (where we also received 20% off our meal). We sat downstairs and the lighting during the day in the restaurant is completely different than evening. There is a fireplace though I don't think it is used. We ordered the Truffled Mac & Cheese ($18) w/ winter truffles, asiago, farmstead cheddar & the Montauk Tile Fish ($19 @ lunch) - came with side salad & Brussel sprouts. The dishes were so well prepared - the truffled mac & cheese was one of the best m&c dishes I've had. The lunch crowd on a weekday is a bit slower than what you will find on a weekend night. Note: prices for dinner are variable different (more $) than lunch prices. Great experiences here & I must visit again soon!

4.0,11/24/2013,"The 4 stars are almost all for ambiance.  This is a fantastic date restaurant.As the name suggests, the place looks like a house.  It's cozy and romantic and not too small since there are 2 floors (like a house...get it!).  I also liked that the tables are not on top of each other so you can have a conversation without your neighbors hearing every word.The server was really nice.  He was helpful with the menu but also not too pushy.  He gave us time to make a decision and didn't rush us out of the restaurant.Overall the food was good, but some were better than others.The apps may have been the best part, the Mushroom Flatbread and Deviled Eggs were delicious.For the entree, I got the scallops and I thought they lacked a flavor punch.  My boyfriend got the Taccozette and it was the better choice.It's also pretty pricey, so save your money before you go!",1,0,0,Nicole P.,"ASTORIA, NY",80,151,9
3.0,11/20/2013,"As some of the fellow yelpers said, the place is indeed romantic. My husband and I went here last week to celebrate our anniversary. It was a Tuesday night, so I didn't expected the place to be full - and it wasn't. Even though I had a reservation, there was no need for it.The hostess was very friendly and accommodated us in a nice and warm spot. But the quality of the service ended there. Waiter was soooooooo slooooooow... Food came quickly - but I HATE when the entrees arrive when you're still half-way through the appetizers. Chill out, kitchen! But I do think this is, in part, the server's fault. He should be the one guiding the kitchen about when to serve the food.I had the short ribs, which were good but not as hot as I expected, and my husband tried the lasagna, which came out at room temperature. Apparently it was sitting on the counter waiting for the ribs, then, waiting to be served.Finally, server didn't bring enough water and, when he did, he threw water all over the table and didn't apologize OR cleaned the mess. We had to dry the table ourselves or we'd get our clothes wet. For any restaurant, this is a no-no. For a $$$ restaurant, this is unacceptable.Bottom line: romantic, food is ok, but service is awful.

The food however, is a bit pricey if you are a true New Yorker. Also, the food portion is very small, and the taste is alright, not the best but better than average.

This was the best martini I've had in a very very long time. Well made and they didn't fill it to the rim with gallons of liquor. The waiter was on the ball and very friendly.

We decided to share two appetizers, the deviled egg sampler and the parsley root veloute. I must admit I wasn't impressed with the quartet of deviled eggs: one with bacon crumbles, another topped with a mustard seed and lobster salad, one with a dollop of fresh caviar, and finally a dice of pickled jalapeno. A nice selection, but the filling itself tasted predominantly of mustard powder and the flavor of the toppings all seemed to taste the same. The soup was very well executed. The flavor of parsley root came through and was duly complimented by a drizzling of a sherry reduction and toasted hazelnuts.For my entree I chose the Pulpo a la Plancha. The dish was gorgeous, featuring four pieces of lightly charred octopus atop a neatly arranged bed of thinly sliced raw vegetables, which were dressed in a light vinaigrette. It wasn't the most tender octopus i've ever had, but the crisp sweet vegetables added a nice bit of texture to each bite.

Deviled Egg Tasting  - Caviar and creme fraiche, jalapeno, lobster, bacon and eggs - $12 - MY FAVORITE was the caviar...  I usually don't like caviar but the combination of the saltiness mixed with the subtle flavors of the egg yolk and boiled white was terrific!  I thoroughly enjoyed every single bite of this plate and would order again.Black Olive Hummus, Tzatziki, Avocado Puree - Warm pressed flatbread - $12 - VERY INTERESTING and they had such beautiful plating!  My favorite was the avocado puree but maybe that's because it reminded me of guacamole and I love guac!  The boyfriend LOVED the tzatziki and I think we ate every little last piece to the point of almost being TOO full before our entree.  They are happy to give you more pita bread if you run out but it's VERY plentiful.Lobster Club On Sourdough - Arugula, tomato, crispy pancetta - $22 - DELICIOUS!  Keep in mind that you're not having a HUGE meal so $22 can seem on the higher side but if you focus on the quality and taste, this is one amazing lobster club!  It was the perfect size for sharing.  The whole concept is unique because normally you think of a lobster in a baguette but having triangle sandwiches was cute and tasty!  It became a very interactive eating experience and kinda reminded me of ""high-tea"" style if you know what that is.  Brussel Sprouts - Heritage bacon - $8 - Just OK.  It's meaty brussel sprouts but I prefer more ""crunch"" on the outside and the bacon taste didn't really come through.  I would pass on this item the next time.Salt Roasted Fingerlings - With truffle oil - $6 - TASTE BUDS GO NUTS FOR THIS.  I love truffle oil and thought this was a nice side to add with our lobster club.  Some of the fingerlings were a bit overcooked but overall a very nice side and am happy that they had this on the menu.People kept mentioning that there was bad service but we had TERRIFIC service.  Our server was friendly, funny and attentive.  Thank you for a wonderful evening!",2,0,1,Sandy L.,"Redondo Beach, CA",245,438,785

1.0,10/6/2012,"Ive lived in Gramercy for years. Have always admired The House from its exterior. I even saw it on LX TV a while ago. I work in Entertainment and was thinking this would be a Great Spot for an event I am hosting that will be filled with Celerities and other Famed Personalities. So I decided to check it out 1st with a few friends as I always do before just booking a place. The other couple I was with were stuck across town in traffic. So I explained to the hostess that our (6pm) reservation would not be met since our entire party was not here. I get that. Thats totally cool. So in an empty restaurant she said she needs to give the table away because others r booked for that table at 7:45. But you can sit at a high top at the bar which is first come first serve. Still. Im ok with that. Not complaining. we sit at the high top. Waiter comes over we order our drinks.  Again 3 people at bar. We are the only ones sitting at a table. Im looking at the Bartender for a good 7 minutes as he is in conversation with a co worker on his cell phone talking about FACEBOOK.  Its now 12 minutes. He hasnt even noticed the drink ticket yet. I see our waiter talking to the hostess finally make eye contact with him. He looks at the bar and tells the bartender theres a drink ticket. anyway 15 minutes later we get our drinks. Our friends arrive we order more drinks. Suddenly about every 3 minutes the waiter says R you ready to order? I was like no t yet were gonna finish our cocktails if thats ok. Do you need this table? Were sitting in the bar section and was told it was 1st come 1st serve. He taps our table and says. No these tables are reserved too. So take a look at the menu and Ill be back. ( is this guy fkn kidding me?? ) The other high tops were empty. Im ordering 4 Bellvedere Martiinis at $16 a pop. Im not ordering bud light! He comes back and says ...So what you decide on.. My friend got annoyed with his attitude and said.. Well take the check.  (We felt bullied by this waiter it was ridiculous!) I looked for a manager.. nowhere in sight..He comes back. drops the check. And I notice automatic 20% gratuity on it. I was in the service industry at one time. I called out the waiter and said. ""Im sorry but 20% gratuity is on our check isnt that for 6 or more people. He said. Oh yeah...its the check from the people before you. ..Ummmmm....there was noone before us it was an early rez and the restaurant was EMPTY. Like I said. I was in the service industry. I know its an annoying ass job dealing with all kinds of demands and people. However, I appreciate their struggle and always tip AT LEAST 25%. But this guy was just an arrogant fool. I was pissed he tried to pull a fast one. The check came back. It was $112.40 he deducted the $34 gratuity. We left $113.  Yes. He got a 60 cent tip. I tip on what I receive. I received nothing but attitude and a very demanding Stalin type waiter. If we ate there our bill would of probably been close to $500 with a bottle of wine at dinner. His tip would of been about $150. However I did see the Bus Boy and gave him $20 in a hand shake because he was the only attentive one there. We left and he comes out chases us grabs my shoulder and says ""What No Fucking Tip?"" I said Im sorry but you were very rude to us made us feel uncomfortable and basically chased us out and tried to pull a fast one on us. It was ok for me to wait 15 minutes for a martini but not ok to take 15 minutes to drink it?? He says too bad Fuck you and walks back in the restaurant. I wanted to look for a manager but didnt want to mess up the rest of the night.  We went down the street to  Mario Batali's Casa Mono. Were we were welcomed with open arms and treated with respect and appreciation. The service and food was stellar. Its so unfortunate that this happens. But its life and sh*t happens. And The House is not a Home and explains why its always empty. People reading this who appreciate dining out. Dont be Bullied by your servers. Times are tough for people everywhere its fortunate to eat out at nice places and to choose a restaurant that you may like is great. They should appreciate you choosing them instead of the othe 5,000,000 restaurants out there. But this is a prime example as to why restaurants close down.

I'd like to think it was the latter because otherwise it would make me sad.I tried the lamb sliders and they were really unmemorable.

4.0,7/12/2012,"3.5 starsThis may be a pretty interesting review since Buo Z and I came here and ate backwards.  Meaning, we started with dessert. The plain Lady M Crepe Cake to be exact. The famous UES bakery offers its delicious, unique layered crepe cake at various establishments, and The House happens to be one of them. At $10, this is a must-try!  It was creamy, crepe-y and yummy- minus some points considering that it may have been a bit hard to eat and that I couldn't tell whether it would have been better chilled or warm. Parts of the crepe layers came in a bit dry.. Buo then decided to go for the Truffle Mac N' Cheese- because we smelled that delicious aroma coming to us by way of our neighbor sitting at the bar (P.S. Wed 8pm made for a tight crowd at The House- forget getting a table upstairs without a res- they were even running behind on their res's from what I heard.. if you're lucky you can snag a bar table or bar stools like we did). I had just one bite of the Mac- it was deliciously truffle-y with lots of strong cheese, with crispy, burnt large elbows. It was a big bowl, too. Most of the stars are for the cute decor- the fact that it's in an old townhouse. It definitely has quaint feel.  And ALSO SHOUTOUT TO THE BARTENDER. He was awesome! He left my bf sit with us without ordering anything for two hours..gave me my second cranberry and club for free (it was only $3- yay a place that doesn't rip you off for those!), brought out sharing plates for the cake and Mac and gave us dibs on the free breadsticks.He also looked like Penn Badgley a little (:D :D :D)If you (bartender) are reading this, please note that YOU ROCK.

Upon arriving 10 minutes early, we were immediately seated (a plus). Unfortunately, we were ushered to the upstairs room which remained empty throughout the entire dinner except for us and our server. We quickly realized why - the only air flowing upstairs on this 100+ degree day was a small fan behind the upstairs bar. My husband had asked why it was so hot and was told that ""it should be cooling down soon."" Well, it never cooled down. We quickly ordered, ate and got out of there ASAP! It was so obvious that they weren't seating people upstairs because their air was broken. I was pretty pissed about their thoughtless actions.

3.0,5/4/2012,"I had been to The House twice in 2010 and went back a few weeks ago for my fiance's birthday.  Our 2010 experiences were great, probably because we had the truffled mac and cheese and were there at odd hours and it was quiet and our server was awesome.  This time, not so much.  We sat upstairs for the first time, which was actually very cozy.  Because the downstairs bar was full, a whole group of people came to the upstairs bar and were kind of loud.  Our server was nice enough but kind of meek.  Not super attentive.  She had to be flagged down for another drink, the bill, etc.  For our drinks I ordered a martini and was asked what type of gin I wanted.  I asked what she had and chose Hendricks.  Upon receiving the bill, they charged me two or three bucks extra per drink for that brand on top of like $14 for the actual drink.  Good to know.  For the appetizers we had the deviled eggs assortment and the cheese plate.  Our server told us what kind of cheeses they were and it was clear that she had just memorized the names and if we asked further questions she'd be at a loss for more info.  So they arrived and they were unmarked, so maybe it would have been nice if she swung back by to tell us which cheese was which.  Both appetizers were very tasty.  For our entrees I was going to get the venison, but they were all out, something not remarked upon when seated and handed our menus.  I was disappointed but the short rib I got instead was tasty. My fiance got the strip steak which was fine, but remarkably tiny.  These  portions are small.  So be prepared to spend a lot for a little.  It was fine.  Not awesome for the amount spent.  I was gonna give it two stars, but gave it three because of that truffled mac and cheese.",0,0,0,Christina P.,"Astoria, NY",3,15,0

1.0,3/3/2012,"First, we had a reservation, but we were seated downstairs.Compared to upstairs it's a bit cold and cramped.My real complaint lies with the dismissive manager/ perhaps owner who sat in the corner with his laptop taking up a great table. He could not be bothered to get up and greet us when we walked in and we were the first guests in the place. He instead motioned to the busy server to come out from the bar to greet and seat us. Our server was nice but he forgot to give us spoons for our""chowder"" The spoons were literally right next to the owner/manager and he could see us looking around for assistance, yet, we had to wait for the server to finish with the other table to bring us the spoons.We were not impressed with the food. A bowl of warm milk with truffle oil and two oysters thrown in does not make an oyster chowder. After our first course had been cleared, we waited 25 minutes for the second course ... Again, manager/ owner could not be bothered to check. And, at this point we hardly saw the poor server who was alone with tables upstairs & downstairs and seemed to be the bartender as well. Finally we got our ""entrees"". My 2 small scallop sliders (the picture shows 3)were lackluster. My husband's lunch entree (mushroom truffle flatbread) was good but normally it is a lunch appetizer, so a bit of a scam offering it as a lunch entree.Our server was upstairs as we paid up and began to leave... I waited to see if Manager/owner would have the sense to at least say goodbye or thank you, but of course he was consistent in not caring one bit about the patrons. And now I know why everyone who walked in that day had an open table or living social deal.Also, it should be noted that their prices for the quality and quantity of food is ridiculous. The 2 sad scallop sliders should not normally cost $19. Maybe in a restaurant with stronger execution and service.Good luck staying in business with this economy.

They then ignored us for a few more minutes until I finally got the attention of the waitress. She came over and my sister said ""we have reservations."" The waitress then looked around the downstairs area, which had about 5 tables, most of which were taken. She pointed to the empty table, and said ""is this ok?"" nonchalantly.

I got the eggs benedict, my sister got the panini and my boyfriend got the scallop sliders.  I didn't mention the appetizer-- because the waitress never brought it!

Any entree under 30$ is not really a full meal. for example, my friends ordered sliders and got two small sandwiches that looked like they were mostly bread. 25$. but the real issue is the service. i went here for dinner with four friends, we all ordered alcohol and entrees. there was a ton of space upstairs when we arrived, maybe one table was occupied, but my friend who organized the dinner was apparently required to sit in the basement. i wasn't in charge so i just followed.the basement is the WORST. if they try to seat you down there, leave! it's two tables, an a/c that blows air but doesn't cool, and the open kitchen. in one tiny cramped space. i do not understand why they even tried to use the space. upstairs has tall ceilings, beautiful windows, etc. downstairs is like a dungeon. we paid a premium for the beautiful space and didn't get our share.the worst was leaving the restaurant at 8 pm, to see that there were still two empty tables upstairs. lucky my friends are awesome and we had a good time regardless.",2,0,0,A T.,"San Francisco, CA",4,64,2

Because then I will have to declare that it is NOT that ... but a good to above average house, that is more accurate!A legit house in manhattan with fairly good food and lots of wine.  The space is cool and very black and white.  On mondays there are wine specials... very much appreciate the waiter telling our table that the wines we were about to order by the glass for $14 was actually $25 for the bottle.  Thanks for the $ save!  A lot of waitstaff wouldn't be so kind.   Where this place goes wrong is in the execution of the vision.  I would expect it to be homey but actually it felt really COLD.  Black and white all over - marble, tile... very cold. My friend and I came here on a casual Monday night and we were seated in this awkward nook table in a crevice between the wall A/C unit and staircase.  If you can invision sitting with an A/C unit blowing air onto your back during your meal - yes, it was that uncomfortable!  mind you, the ENTIRE ground floor of the restaurant was EMPTY so it was weird that they sat us in this strange nook.The food was decent... if not a bit overpriced.  I ordered the Octopus salad which was good, but it really was an $18 salad.  My friend ordered the mushroom pizza - which was just a basic mushroom pizza.  Nothing to write home about.  The waiter was friendly but also had tables outdoors so we ended up filling our own wine glasses most of the time.  All in all, a mediocre dining experience.  I'd come back if I was trying to impress a date... but with a gf, this place is NOT worth it.",2,2,0,Diane C.,"Hoboken, NJ",244,531,7

2.0,2/27/2011,"My girlfriend and I were having dinner at Zenkichi two weeks ago and I was looking for a cool spot to take her beforehand. I can't remember how I stumbled upon The House, but coming here also afforded us a chance to walk around Greenmarket beforehand. I was especially looking forward to trying The House since I read that it used to be a carriage house, just like One If By Land, Two If By Sea.Upon walking in, we were greeted by the friendly staff. I said we just wanted to have glass of wine or something, to which they said that was fine and said we were free to walk around and find a place to sit. We checked out upstairs first and asked to sit at a table by the window, but they said that tables were reserved for dinner reservations only. Not only that, but we could not sit upstairs at all since the bar was not ready. So, we went back downstairs and asked to sit at a table, which was more of a bar-style table, with its tall table and two chairs. However, these were also reserved only for dinner guests. Asking if we could sit outside, we were told the only free table was also reserved.Once the chaos subsided and we ended up just sitting at the bar, our drinks were quite good. I had a glass of prosecco and my girlfriend had a blood orange martini. The bartender was very professional in his preparation of the martini and pouring of both that and the prosecco. He did, however, ask both us and the next couple who sat down if we'd be joining them for dinner. When we both said no, he couldn't help but to give a little jab about The House was ""the place you go before the place you go.""The other thing I didn't like about this place was that the staff was preparing the evening's menus and more or less arguing at the bar, right next to where we were sitting.Don't get me wrong, this place has a very nice interior and is also very attractive on the outside. The drinks were also quite good. If it weren't for the chaos trying to get seated, the bartender's jokes about not eating dinner there and the staff arguing next to us, I'd give this place three stars.

They even called me to confirm my seating request that day. However, much to my dismay, when I arrived at the restaurant they had already gave the table to another couple. I think that was the only major negative I took out of the night. Server was very nice, never felt rushed at all. Its not the BEST food I've ever eaten, but the food IS pretty damn good. I got the Strip Steak, she got the Mac & Cheese (amazingggg), and we shared the hummus plate to start. We each had a small desert, with a free glass of desert wine from the server to make up for not getting us our seat. All in all, the bill was around $110.

1.0,1/24/2011,"Because I am a surly asshole, I am lumbering out of my long yelp hibernation to bitch about how absolutely horrible my meal at this place was. Here's the story:  being the clever the person I am, I thought there would be no problem finding a restaurant in Gramercy around 8 with 3 people and no reservation. Like I said, clever. At any rate, when forcibly returned to reality, i.e. an hour and 45 minute wait at Casa Mono, I asked the host there for a good alternative in the area. He suggested The House.  If what I hear about karma being a bitch is true, then I predict he will get gout.  After taking the short walk there, we get seated with no problem, which, in retrospect, was the first sign of trouble.  The second was the relatively high price point for a place with a Ruby Tuesday's ambiance.  I thought to skirt this by just ordering appetizers and sharing an inexpensive bottle with my friends.  There the horror began.  Now, before you write me off as a grumpy crank, let me say in my defense that I was merrily drunk and absolutely starving at this point, so I was primed to be positive and like the food.  No such luck.  Firstly, our waitress didn't even bother to present the bottle (Prosecco, the only tasty thing I consumed that evening):  she had begun opening it before she even got to the table.  She also didn't bother to let anyone taste it, she just let 'er rip. Nice.  Next came the food, clattered onto the table by 3 different bussers and shoved in front of us with all the ceremony of sanitary workers loading a garbage truck.  Promising, I know, but the food surpassed even this elegant introduction.  The deviled egg trio, or whatever it was called, was variations on a theme of suck:  salty, bland, and cloying, yum!  The wild mushroom appetizer was also gloriously terrible:  oversalted, overcooked, leathery, and sodden with grease.  The some-sort-of-flatbread was, in fact, cardboard with a trio of crappy international dips:  guacamole (off-tasting and oily), hummus (boring, but also salty--yay!), and the last thing, which I can't remember (I'm sure it was really good...no wait, it was tzatziki or something, and it sucked).  The last tantalizing appetizer was beets with goat cheese cream or somesuch, which was okay.  Of course, its lack of suck made it taste ambrosial in such disgusting company, but that's really not a great coup.  To top off our enjoyment of the meal, the waitress never checked up on us (like this:  how are you enjoying everything?  Oh, it all sucks balls, thanks for asking!), so I was denied even the opportunity to promptly air my grievances.  Pff, like I'd let that stop me.  But seriously, don't eat here.",2,5,0,Scott P.,"New York, NY",10,19,0

I couldn't help but to say how much I loved it after every single bite. It is served as an entree and I could very well eat the entire thing myself.

5.0,5/17/2010,"We came here last minute for sis in law's birthday dinner for a party of three.  She recommended this place. From the outside, this place really looked private and sort of a members only club. There were people enjoying cocktails outside the house. Just few tables and chars outside. Once inside, it was very cozy and intimate. We went up the stairs and were seated by the window. There was a small bar on the opposite end.  Sis was in charged of ordering. As I looked at the menu, it is american fare with $$$. As first I was skeptical, because it is your normal foods trying to be fancy. Anyway, I give it a chance and I was won over with its intimate setting. We received a good selection of breads to start off. We ordered spanish red wine to go with our meal. We started with three appetizers, - duck three  ways, deviled eggs, and a salad of beets and goat cheese cream.  Each was very unique in its own way. I like the duck three ways - it came with foie gras on the side.The presentation on these plates were simply beautiful. See the pics posted. Our entrees were Truffled Mac & Cheese, Steak sirloin sandwich, and seared diver sea scallops. I loved the mac and cheese. It was not your ordinary mac N cheese. Yes, there was sliced truffles but I can do without that. It was the just the best mac N cheese I have ever tasted. There is something that dish. The cheese - it was tasty and creamy. Also, the pasta they used was not your plain elbow pasta. I did not know what pasta it was but it was circular and twisty in shape. This dish was so mouth watering and a complete surprise to me. The seared sea scallops were large and really good. The steak sirloin sandwich was disappointing. The steak was good but being between two flatbreads was not so good. We also got a side dish of veggies. This dish was very savory and good too.I gave this place 5 stars due to the awesome mac n cheese. I would go back just to only order that dish. Also, five stars for the ambiance of this place is very intimate, quiet, and private. This is a great first date place. There is romance in the air as I saw more couples seated than groups.

4.0,4/15/2010,"I've walked by this quant little place a number of times and have always told myself that I would stop in some day. I finally decided to do so on one gloomy Sunday afternoon for brunch.I was a little confused after stepping through the threshold as there were people on the main floor, but they looked to be working or setting something up. Not seeing any diners, I looked around and found a staircase leading upstairs to where I could hear the faint clatter of silverware and glasses. Up and away we go.The two of us were seated at a slightly awkward four person table, but after a few moments the server sincerely apologized and asked if we would mind moving to a two person table in the corner as there was another group coming in shortly. We were pleased to do so and the server felt so embarrassed that he gave us a complementary bloody mary and bellini.Having a moment to peruse the menu, we settled on starting with the Trio of Crostini. This consisted of two crostinis each of marinated tuna belly and white bean, eggplant pinenut and raisin, mortadella pate and sicilian pistachios. They were all delicious, however I didn't take too much a liking to the marinated tuna belly. For my brunch entrée, I couldn't resist but to take up my cause of trying to consume every type of Eggs Benedict in this city. So I opted for the Prosciutto Eggs Benedict. The deliciously salty ham paired with buttery hollandaise sauce and creamy poached egg were very good. My friend's curiosity got the better of them and they were drawn to the Deviled Egg Tasting. Consisting of caviar and crème fraiche, jalapeño lobster and bacon and eggs. I have to say that they were all well received, but my favorite was probably the bacon and eggs.The upstairs interior is nice.

2.0,12/19/2009,"Management, specifically Alexander is the WORST. Two weeks ago I went to House with some friends for a birthday celebration, had good food and a nice atmosphere.... really no complaints even after our $400.00 bill for 5 of us..... no problem. What I do have a problem with is that i left a shopping bag there filled with stuff (it is Christmas season) and inside the bag was a gift too, left it there. I called that night, Alexander said ""we found the bag, don't worry we will put it downstairs for you"". I was so happy, that was on Thursday, Monday I go to pick up the bag and no one knows where it is. Alexander was not in, I asked the girls working to call him since I made a special trip down there, they would not. Okay, no prob, I will call tomorrow. I called the next day and spoke to Alexander and he was the RUDEST person I have ever spoken to (not rude the night spending $400), he told me it was a ""courtesy that we even held the bag, it is not my responsibility and i don't' know where it is"". I was flabbergasted, is it not your responsibility if you take it in your possession, tell me you have it and not to worry about it? THAN he told me ""you had 24 hours to pick it up"".. WHAT THE WHAT, he never told me that! So, he basically told me someone stole my bag, even though it was downstairs where customers cannot go. If he would have said, ""listen, I am so sorry and what can I do""... I would have said, don't' worry about it, I don't want anything (except my gifts since I just came from Christmas shopping). BUT he was SOOOO rude and had an attitude right off the bat, VERY defensive... hummm wonder why. Seriously, he was not rude when we spend $400... but asking him for something he said he has in his possession and to say ""don't worry about it, i will put it downstairs"" than treating me like a jerk by telling me it was a courtesy that he held my bag at all and that I had 24 hours to pick up""... I just wish he would have told me this on the phone, I would have gone straight back. Strange thing, I was on a plane this weekend, meet a lady who lives near there and said that she had problem with management too, but she did not know the guys name.

4.0,11/19/2009,"The House is a hybrid wine bar/restaurant that gets the job done every time. It's actually much smaller than it looks in pictures, converted from what must have been a relatively modest sized house for a prominent 19th Century New Yorker. As you would imagine, the wine list is expansive, but the staff is knowledgable and happy to help out. The one draw back is that the wine is somewhat pricey, and if you're ordering a bottle it's likely to cost you no less than $50. The price gauging ends there though, with all the food relatively reasonable.I've been here twice, both times getting the truffle mac & cheese, which is on the appetizer menu but is a full sized portion. Sharing it is an instant bonding experience. They're not stingy with the truffles, and the cheese has just the right intensity. The main course selections include a variety of meat, chicken, and fish, so there's something for everyone and it's all good. Veggies can make a meal out of the mac & cheese or other appetizers and still leave satisfied.

The space is really charming and cozy in a really nice way. Since we were both hungry, we decided on dinner and drinks. Started with the mushroom ragu on polenta (tasty, but not too memorable - the polenta tasted more like brioche to me) and the hummus, baba ganoush and tziki platter; I'm a total dip snob and I thought the dips were fantastic - really well flavored. If I hadn't been on a first date I would have housed the whole thing myself. I had the pork belly appetizer as my main course and it was delicious. The skin was beautifully caramelized and the parsnip puree was great. Date had the house lasagna with wild boar ragu - I had a bite and it was pretty tasty as well, though after he tasted the pork belly I thought he was going to steal my plate. The wine was really great as well, but I could have done without the desert.

The interior is very inviting and welcoming providing the look and feel of a house.  Unfortunately that feel comes with a price.  I searched the menu for something that didn't cost north of $10.  Alas, I found two beer options for $9, and I chose one. Shannon was great and once she realized my friend and I weren't the uptight type she was extremely friendly and outgoing.  When we first arrived there was a couple, who didn't appear to be enjoying themselves - heaven forbid they enjoy themselves in their Burberry clothing.  Is there anything more grotesque then a couple that matches?  Not to mention, it's embarrassing to see a man wearing clothing that his S.O. picked out like a f*cking Ken doll.  I really enjoyed the jazz vibe and the music playing on this particular night. I agree with other reviewers who commented that it appears to be more of a wine bar.  The prices were outlandish in my opinion.  Then I remember that I live in NYC, and what isn't overpriced?  I wouldn't be surprised if I returned in two years and The House no longer existed.  It just doesn't have that ""it"" factor that would make me feel like I needed to return.",4,2,2,Chris J.,"Manhattan, NY",215,231,0

Inside was small and cozy - fireplace wasn't on but i can imagine how much more intimate it woudl get. It was dark and perfect for a date spot, but maybe too personal for a first date. Appetizer - get the seafood cocktail platter!!! Amazing. Lobster tail, clams, and oysters of your choice (the waiter tried to describe all the different kinds and we chose the Prince Edward  Island ones). One of the best appetizers I've ever had. Main course - here I erred. DONT GET THE TROUT. What I was thinking - I still mentally slap myself everytime I think about it. I wasn't hungry, so didn't want to get a main course, and basically closed my eyes and chose an appetizer. My finger landed on the trout, I liked fish, so why not? It was ALL BAD. Too salty, dry, the vegetables that came with it were too creamy and the dish was left 95% untouched. Really sad; I can say it was the worst main course I've ever had at a restaurant.My bf loved his meal though. I think it was a steak of some sort. And the wine! Oh it was lovely.

(moi moi),  so all in all, a great evening.N.B. - A star was knocked off because they lost my reservation - which I had made from my Hotel in my ""official"" capacity (not good under any circumstances, but if it had been a guest on a Friday or Saturday would have caused serious trouble).",12,2,6,Michael C.,"New York, NY",105,35,0
4.0,12/23/2007,"So apparently theres been this streak of me going to simplistically named restaurants. First ""The Place"" and now ""The House"", next you'll see me reviewing ""The Apartment"" and perhaps even ""The Toilet."" Who knows anymore...This restaurant has an impeccably designed interior. It has a very warm and cozy feel to it, perhaps of a 1950s hotel. One of those atmospheres that warms your heart with the sound of live freestyle Jazz -- just like tonight actually.Service here is very comforting, fast paced, and attentive. A few mistakes made, but can bypass any lack of stars due to the yummy yummy in my tummy lasagna and oyster chowder I believe it was.The wine selection unfortunately did not include Cabernet, and do not ask me why. I can't imagine why... I'm not a Pinot Grigio fan, but they didn't have that either. Ouch, star knocked off.Overall, delicious food, convenient location, a wonderful place for a date or special event, and I had the pleasure of enjoying dinner with our very own Michael C.

3.0,4/6/2007,"Something about this place is just off. It looks adorable from the outside, but the interior and the food is just, well, okay. Not bad, but nothing unique or spectacular. It lacks that extra something. The servers were nice, but the food was very mediocre. We sat on the main floor (fireplace floor), but the fireplace wasn't working. The place looks great on the website, but once you actually step inside, it's pretty misleading. The food was overpriced for what we got.",0,0,0,Susan P.,"New York, NY",19,89,4
3.0,2/21/2007,"Nice place to camp out from the chilly weather. From the outside, it looks like someone's upscale house.  At 6:30pm without reservations, we had to leave by 8 pm.  We were seated upstairs in a small corner.  There wasn't much to select off the menu but the waiter suggested we order a couple of plates to share since ""we are a wine bar environment where the plates are small, tapas-style eats.""CY ordered the Lobster Club on Sourdough.  It came in four triangular pieces and after trying it we both agreed that Pearl Oyster Bar did more justice.  HF said she tasted more sauce than lobster.  HF got the Rigatoni con Guanciale with chick peas, san marzano tomatoes, and peperoncino, and she noted that even though it was a small pile in a humongous bowl, it was filling.  The House Lasagna - I really liked the sauce, reminded me of a bolognese sauce but it was actually wild boar meat.  The size and shape were like the pancakes from Mc'd's - not what I expected. I was either famished or the portions were really small but I devoured my dish.  I would order this again.  Desserts were a selection of either sorbet/gelato/creme brulee/hazelnut cake.  We ordered the hazelnut cake and it was nothing spectacular. Note: check the daily rotisserie specials online. Overall service and decor were better than average.  It started off quiet but eventually it got packed and the glasses tinkling and the chitter chatter created a cozy and homey atmosphere.",1,0,1,Tiff C.,"Harrison, NY",86,57,28
3.0,1/12/2007,"One of my favorite hobbies / exercises in frustration is walking around idyllic NYC streets at night and looking inside other people's apartments. No, I'm not a voyeur. Just call it apartment envy. Live in a 450 square foot box for a little while and you will understand what I mean. One of my favorite homes/apartments is a little carriage house  on 17th Street between the quiet of Irving and chaos of Union Square that used to be lined with books floor to ceiling. (ugh ... check out that dangling modifier... oh well)Well in its newest incarnation it is a restaurant called... (and the creative gods may strike them down on this one...) The House. Apparently the ex-book editor owner sold and now the two story carriage house is a restaurant serving mostly American food. Having opened on January 3rd to no reviews in NY Mag or TONY that I can find, the place is still quiet. (Yeah, I came across it on one of my apartment voyeur walks.) But though the setting is gorgeous and romantic, the food... well, er uh... Definitely needs some work. My lobster club was average and my friend got some sort of fish which she said was fine. The little vegetable side was passable. The duck 3 ways appetizer (mmm... duck) showed promise but the juxtaposition of textures and temperatures they were going for didn't pan out.... and all ""3 ways"" ended up pretty much ""1 way"". My friends who got the meat dishes were very disappointed with the small portions and large price tag, and they busted a hasty retreat over to a pizza place after dissecting out what little meat there was on the bone.I'm hoping that this place outgrows its growing pains and steps the food up since the setting is so nice. Given the choice, right now, I'd just scoot across the street to Casa Mono. But if you're in the neighborhood and if nothing else, take a walk by, peer in and have apartment envy... or just walk in and have a drink at the bar.",3,0,2,Courtney P.,"New York, NY",105,220,4
