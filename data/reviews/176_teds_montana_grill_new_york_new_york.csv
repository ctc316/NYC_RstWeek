1.0,4/24/2019,"On the menu, it lists that happy hour ""drafts"" are $5. When I received my bill, with each draft beer billed as $9.50, I kindly asked our bartender Hunter to explain the difference. He told me that each individual customer has to ask the staff which beers are considered happy hour (even though it makes no specification on the menu), and then proceeded to tell me that ""Ted's patrons are mostly loyal customers who know that only Yuengling is the happy hour beer."" The menu nor the waitstaff made no clear effort to tell customers the price difference, which leads me to believe they are attempting regularly fool customers into paying double the original price for a menu item.",0,0,0,I H.,"Manhattan, New York City, NY",0,1,0
1.0,4/8/2019,"Friends and I have been going to Teds for years.  This past Saturday, after the 2 Cellos concert at Radio City, our group of 9 had reservations for dinner.  We were all very disappointed in the food quality served to us, in that: I asked for a medium bison filet, and it came out RAW, in the middle, and was sent back to correct.  It came back still way under cooked!  I have never had this happen before at Teds. Other guests had issues with the food being only barely warm, as if the food had been cooked, then left on what ever cooling rack there is.  Plus, all 9 of us were not served ""at the same time"".   I am extremely disappointed in this experience and will think thrice before returning for another meal.  My fiancé and I were in Teds about an hour before the concert to have a beer and some bison sliders ( late lunch), and there was no problems there.  We thought at the time, that our dinner later would be great, but it was not to be.",0,0,0,Tim M.,"Stone Harbor, NJ",0,21,0
1.0,4/7/2019,"Although the food was good, the service was not. We had a reservation for 30 people and specifically told them on the phone that we needed separate checks. After we had finished our dinner, they gave us a bill for the entire party and then when we asked for separate checks, they refused to change it and said it was impossible to change. When they realized the probably weren't getting paid of they didn't do something, they finally agreed to split them by seat number, which meant the person at seat one table one was on the same bill as seat one table two. So we as the customers had to go around and find our match and divide out the bills while the manager kept reminding us not to forget that 18% gratuity. There were also several bills with drinks that were never ordered. The manager was rude and tried to blame us for the situation claiming that they never agreed to separate checks on the phone.",0,0,0,Amy S.,"Estes Park, CO",0,2,0

2.0,3/3/2019,"Third time eating here, it will be our last mostly because service is abysmal and food just mediocre. Crab cakes are fantastic - thick lumpy meat with minimal filler and very tasty. Tiny portion though for $20, and the scoop of guacamole that came with it was brown. Yes, brown. That's just gross and an obvious no-no. Bison pot roast was fine, somewhat bland, and the mashed potatoes were super lumpy and also bland. Hubby had the sirloin which was tasty but VERY grisly, which has been his experience before. Disappointing overall. Our waitress was super slow even though the place was barely crowded at 7pm on a Saturday.

I started with a cup of chili.  It really wasn't very good.  Like warm, but also just too weak.  I must disclose I'm a chili snob, so wasn't expecting the best...but not this either.I then had the skinny bison burger...it was pretty damn good.  It was cooked exactly as i requested.   The kale salad was a nice compliment, although the tomatoes were kind of tasteless.  But tis the season, so it was ok The server was attentive throughout.   The one and only issue was asking once i put my fork down if i wanted the check or did i want to wait until i finished my wine.  I had a full glass.  I truly don't know how to answer that question.  So i said do whatever makes you happy.   She said she didn't care and walked away..fair enough and I'm ok.  2 minutes later i grabbed my wallet to find a phone number and the check was in my face within 10 seconds...with the comment, no rush.   Like seriously...So not a big deal...but kind of tacky.  Anyway, i would recommend the place...maybe not the chill.   But the bison burger was outstanding.  Cheers",0,0,0,Chris G.,"Chicago, IL",1,262,25

Service is fine but very slow... it took us over 40min to receive the burgers during a workday lunch, which isn't acceptable. The burger itself was fine. I couldn't really detect much difference versus a regular beef burger. I think because they had salted it so much, it was hard to taste the flavor of the meat. Also I actually didn't like the bun... it was a little too dry and flavorless.Probably wont return.",3,1,2,Angelo B.,"Westfield, NJ",206,710,700

What's worse, as 6pm approached, we asked our server if we could expect our food soon, as it was over an hour since the order was placed, and her response was (in a snippy tone): ""It's very busy, the kitchen is backed up, and it hasn't been an hour yet"".

Found this place on Yelp very close to our hotel. Had good reviews so reserved a table for 10. We were greeted promptly and seated. It was a busy weeknight. It took a while to take our drink order, and a little longer for the food order. We were kind of hangry but had good company, so that helped. We each ordered different kinds of steaks - New York, filet, etc. They had it, we probably ordered it. Steaks came out juicy and cooked very well.  Probably one of the best steaks I've ever had. Side orders were also very yummy.  All of us were stuffed afterwards. Drinks were good. Small beer selection though. Wait staff was very good as well, given they were short staffed.

I came here for a work lunch (with a large party reservation made just minutes before arriving) and everything ran smoothly. Our table was set up, our waiter took good care of us, everyone left happy and very full.Do the burgers live up to their ~$20 price tags? I can't comment on the signature bison burger, as I had a turkey burger ($18) at the suggestion of our enthusiastic waiter. It was indeed peppery as promised, from both the pepper mixed into the patty and the arugula piled on top. The sriracha aioli combined with the pepper jack added a touch too much spice, or maybe the former was just applied too generously. The patty was super tender and flavorful though.My side salad of kale was good, though overdressed; the fries I tried were average. The ambiance is nice and surprisingly quiet for Rockefeller Center. Clean and beautiful bathrooms, with powder (?) soap. Again, good service, though a touch relaxed on the back end. The lunch ran about an hour and a half start to finish but I would imagine that's largely because we were a group of 15.Very solid pick in Midtown, though at a price.",2,0,1,Liz S.,"New York, NY",952,772,1843

2.0,11/27/2017,"I have eaten at Ted's more than half a dozen times since my friend Fred first recommended it. It's relatively near my work, and I like bison, beef and the american theme. It's a meat eater's venue-grill.In the past, I have usually had the bison rib eye.While not a huge piece of meat, it's always been very flavorful and good. On several occasions though, I've had the bison burger.  I enjoy sitting at the bar, though occasionally I'll take a table or booth if I am with a friend. Casual, relatively quiet, good service and quite a lot of space.But now I must write my last experiences -yes, the last couple. I think something has changed and, to my mind, they are taking it out on the meat. Unless my last two visits were together an anomaly -and one shared by my companions, the staple is not as good as it was or ought to be. And, of course, and in the end, that's all that matters here.I had the rib eye about two months ago. It was a tab skinnier than ever before. And perhaps I'd have let that go -I have until now-  but it meant that it did not come to the table as medium rare. So it was a smaller cut and not cooked to order. Ah well. That however pales in comparison to my last visit, two days ago. I had the bison burger as 'Avalon.' It showed up on my plate as a thin puddly bit of meat  under gruyere, bleu cheese, garlic aoli and some greens. I looked forward to the cheeses and aoli; and I was aware it would make it somewhat oilier. But you needed a burger that could stand up to those toppings or condiments. This was just a small dark pool of meat -not well pressed together, and less than a fifth of a pound. You had to hunt! The meat was so thin that, like it's older brother the rib eye of some months back, it did not come to the table cooked to order. Not a bit of pink. Neither I nor my wife could taste the burger meat in any case.So Ted's gets a two-star rating, based upon my earlier prior happy memories. I hope to raise it up again. I know I'll visit -though perhaps I'll wait long enough that the kitchen is back in order. If it gets back to old form, I'll raise my rating by two stars.

Strong too, with bourbon and bitters I believe. Highly recommend. I had a few of those. The nachos are very hearty, with beef that has a chili flavor on top and cheese. The chips taste pretty fresh. The potato chips are good as well, slightly chewy and thin but overall nice crunch. I ordered a bison burger with fried egg. The bison was very hearty and tasty. Ordered it medium, as was suggested to me by the waitress since I don't know how bison is usually best enjoyed. Brioche bun complimented the bison well. Nice ambiance of rustic and ranch decor, made me feel like I was on Ted Turners ranch and they just wrangled the bison that was now on my plate.

When we got there, a large party had just left, so the waiter came over and cleared off our table and gave us menus. Then he disappeared.  We arrived around 6:40, plenty of time to order by the time happy hour was over.  When the waiter didn't return and it was getting close to 7, my friend went over to the bar and placed a drink order.  The waiter suddenly reappeared, and I asked if I could place a food order.  He directed me to the bar, since we'd already started ordering there.  I don't understand why he couldn't just take the rest of our order, did we offend him so badly? So I go and wait at the bar (it was a little busy) until a bartender served me, and I asked ""Can I place a food order here for that table?""  He turned around and told the waiter that I wanted to order. The waiter essentially blew me off with an attitude, saying we'd already ordered drinks at the bar, so as far as he was concerned we weren't his table anymore. The bartender caught an attitude, made a show of taking my order. When the food came, a cook delivered it (not a server).  He didn't give us silverware, and a different server gave it to us. Our original waiter came back with ketchup nobody asked for, and then disappeared again. No drink refills, no ""how's the food"", nothing.

I tried the carrots, they had nice texture and flavor.  I had the veggie burger and salt & pepper onion rings.  I liked that they had horseradish cheddar cheese available for the burger.  Don't come across it often and I jumped at the chance to have it on the burger.  Burger held its consistency well, compared to other veggie burgers.  Overall, the food was decent to good with the one exception of the Caesar salad dressing.Service is where this visit gets bad marks.  Upon being seated right away (good), there was too long of a wait for our first contact by server. Around 6-7 minute range.  Other servers not ours were continually coming in the general area.  It was getting to the ""do you know who the server for this table is"" question to anyone who could be flagged down when our server appeared.The server got our orders correct.  The issue was in the service itself.  After delivering our order they largely disappeared.  Proactively checked on us only once the entire meal.  Had to flag down twice for condiments, flag down another time for water.  I also noticed at one point they disappeared around the corner by the bathrooms, and didn't appear again for about 10-12 minutes.  Smoke break, phone texting/call break?  When they did come to our table, theiir disposition was hurried and rushed, instead of inquisitive and service-oriented.  Example:  we were in the latter half of eating but weren't finished yet.  During the one time they checked on us, they approached and asked, ""All done?"", instead of ""how is everything?"", ""may I get you anything else?"", ""will you be wanting to look at a dessert menu?"", ""Will you be needing a to-go box later?"", etc.    Later, during another extended absence from our table, another server cleared our places.In short, the service was largely absent, and when server did come by there was verbiage and nonverbals of rushing us.  Food overall was decent, service severely lacking.  When back in the area, first look will be for somewhere else to eat.  Wish the establishment the best, the service was a bit too paltry for an establishment with this atmosphere and this price range.",0,0,0,C C.,"Little Elm, TX",1,41,9

At first glance it looked beautiful and very exciting.  Unfortuanately, it did not taste as great.  The meat was a bit unidentifiable (lobster?)...although the dough the meat was held in was quite unique...almost a pastry shell.  Then there was a dollup of guac or some other whipped avacado concoction.  Overall...all the components didn't really work well together...it sort of just blended in without any discernable flavors.  I was a little disappointed because I had seen Ted's all over Denver and hoped it would be good.",0,0,0,Chad R.,"New York, NY",231,505,8

4.0,4/25/2016,"Went here before seeing ""School of Rock"" on Broadway with elder parents, two kids, and a wife who doesn't eat carbs. Found it to be a great place - upscale without being pretentious, and something for everyone on the menu.The decor is classic steakhouse, with private booths, white tablecloths, and large windows that look out onto the street.The service was excellent- we told the server we had a short amount of time due to arriving late (and needing to make the show time) and she was attentive, responsive, and friendly throughout. The kids menus included Wikki Sticks, which are fun, bendable pieces of plastic (instead of crayons + paper) that kept the kids entertained throughout the meal. Better still, the kids menu food was above average with good portions and quality.The adults' meals were all great - salads were large and fresh; veggie burger wasn't a standout, but was definitely filling and well-sized. Yes, we came to a steakhouse and ate salads and a veggie burger, though my 12-year-old son ordered the child's menu steak and gave it 4/5 stars.",0,0,0,Jason C.,"Orono, ME",66,60,46

5.0,2/24/2016,"How Yelp knows where we've eaten from California to New York City is beyond me... okay it's my phone I know but I find that impressive. Ted's Montana Grill was awesome! We were there last month to visit the NYU's dormitories (my daughter's new home for the next four years) and we all felt like eating steak. We noticed the restaurant was adjacent to NBC Studios so it wasn't a surprise to see a few familiar faces and a couple Exec's chowing and downing both food and wine right before our eyes. We all had the steak dinners only because we did not understand where Bison came from until we looked up and saw a huge Buffalo derma on the wall. So then we tried it, not only does TMG have steak from cows that are naturally raised from organic farms but they have Bison. The succulent texture feels, taste and goes down like steak yet smoother and probably easier to digest but I'm no gastrointestinal doc-but it felt different. The servers were pleasant and on-point, this was a surprise to us considering NYC is pre-dominantly about speed and not courtesies and salutations, needless to say the server earned himself and healthy tip, especially since he was so pleasant when it came to serving the red wine.",0,0,0,Maile C.,"Phoenix, AZ",116,63,51
4.0,2/16/2016,"Ted's Montana Grill is located steps away from Radio City Music Hall & Rockefeller Center. It has a very ""low key"" facade & you can almost walk right past it. Don't. This restaurant has a lot to offer. Founded by philanthropist & environmentalist Ted Turner, the eponymous Ted's Montana Grill offers authentic American fare at reasonable prices (especially for this Manhattan neighborhood).  Bison is the main draw here & it is a great place for that. If you don't already know, Bison has less saturated fat than regular beef. It's a nice change from the regular burgers offered at most places. Ted's Montana Grill's menu is basic yet offers something for everybody. Healthy and gluten-free selections are available. In fact, there is a meal nutrition calculator on the website that allows you to create a meal taking into account dietary & calorie restrictions! (See link tedsmontanagrill.com/men…) As for the food, it is consistently good. Keep in mind that it is traditional American, don't expect anything exotic. It is a great place to bring visitors from overseas who have never had Bison before. It also a great place to go with people who have issues with food & cannot handle spicy, fatty foods. I usually go here in the evenings when it is less crowded. I always get the iceberg wedge salad. I'm addicted to the homemade dressing, I want the recipe! Also good are the burgers & cedar plank salmon. The sodas are a little too sweet for me, but that's just a personal preference. The service is consistently top notch. The staff is super friendly & accommodating. It's a low key place, so don't expect lightening fast service but they don't try to rush the meal and pressure you to leave either.

3.0,1/31/2016,"I had been here before for an event.  I couldn't wait to return.  I am sad to say my own visit was nothing like what I had expected. We thought the price fix menu for plays was a great option.  I didn't see any times online so I assumed it was available any time.  We had to eat after our show due to an occasion we attended before.  So we switched our reservation to 10:30 instead our initial 6pm reservation.Upon arrival I asked if we still could do the price fix.  The hostess was very friendly and said yes.  She gave us the restaurant week menu.  This menu is $3 more than their price fix menu and didn't have the crab cakes and steak on it that sounded good.  I asked the waitress if we could do the price fix menu for before shows.  She said during restaurant week they only run the restaurant week menu.  So let me get this straight, they downgrade the menu and charge $3 more?! In my mind I thought that's poor business.  I asked the waitress if they could honor the items on their regular price fix.  She appeared annoyed.  I said I don't eat much steak so maybe she can explain the steak options to me.  In a snarky tone she barely described the items and was rushing us to order.  She said her manager wouldn't honor their normal price fix and we had to order ASAP.  We rushed to order so much so that my boyfriend felt guilty ordering a drink but I insisted he order. To begin they bring out pickles.  The pickles were good.  I had a Caesar salad, it had a very light dressing with tasty croutons and some cheese.  It was mediocre.  The meat dish I ordered was chewy/grizzly at points, but mostly tender.  Both our meats were a bit rare which we didn't order.  The fries were just warm not hot.  The highlight for me was the brownie dessert.At this point I'm sad to say I'm not sure we'd return.  The poor attitude, raised/revised menu for restaurant week and snarky waitress less left than a desirable taste in our mouth for our $130 bill.  I'd like to think my first experience was more true to what they are, but I'm not sure we will return to ever find out.",3,1,1,Chrissy H.,"Manhattan, NY",135,399,1291

There was so much to try! - the trout dip was first and perfectly paired with corn chips and baked toasts. - then came the crab cakes- delicious and very meaty! - the corn was good but it was my least favorite...- the salmon was delicious, could definitely taste the woody cedar flavor in the fish! - the steak was the piece of resistance! Medium cooked and generous portions! Yuuuuummmmmm- the fries could have been a little crispier - the sliders were paired with the onion ring. Yummy! - dessert was warm chocolate brownies and we all left with bags of homemade cookies!! The event was amazing! Thank you so much to Ted for hosting such a magnificent and generous table for us! I am a big fan :)",2,0,0,Juliane L.,"New York, NY",386,643,1412

I ordered the veggie burger and it was the best I've ever had!!! My husband ordered the cheeseburger and loved it. Service was phenomenal, restaurant is CLEAN, roomy, and fairly quiet for a NYC restaurant. We're both from the west where a 10  foot booth for two people is very common, so getting used to the elbow to elbow dining spaces on the east coast has been a bit of an adjustment.

3.0,7/18/2015,"I would give Ted's a 3.5, based on my experience last night. I have dined at a few TMG's, and they are all excellent in respect to attentive staff, and fresh food. The drawback last night was twofold: unseasoned (supposedly spicy) appetizers - and they were bland, no two ways about it. Secondly, I had a steak salad in which the steak was a pitiful cut - it was rare, and you needed a table saw to cut through it.  I did, however, have a bite of my companions steak...it was phenomenal.   SO, that being said, I think I just got a bad dish. I chose not to send it back, and did enjoy the remainder of the salad, aside from the steak.",0,0,0,Jerrold T.,"Hagerstown, MD",121,113,9
4.0,7/12/2015,"I came here for a Yelp elite event, was extremely pleased with my experience. The atmosphere has Western vibes. Or rather, the American Great Plains. The restaurant is located in an expansive room with a bison head mounted on one of the walls.For the Yelp event, we were offered a tasting menu with highlights from Ted's. Every menu item was quite good. My personal favorite was the crab cakes, which had generous amounts of crab meat. Also, the hamburger and bison filet were delicious. Or perhaps it was a bison burger and meat filet. I couldn't tell the difference, but both were very good.I also got to sample some Sangria from their bar. It was quite good, and the maitre d' told us that all of their juices/mixes are pressed in-house. They have a Happy Hour from 5-7pm on weeknights that with $5 martinis. Given the neighbrhood, this is a steal.I'd recommend coming here if you want an atypical steakhouse experience.",0,0,0,Zach D.,"Manhattan, NY",105,96,35
4.0,7/10/2015,"Here for an elite event recently and the place blew me away for the most part. The servers were very attentive and very very nice. The place is huge and gorgeous. The restrooms are the size of bedrooms. The food being served in small portions for our huge elite party was still very generous. I had crabcake with guac, that was amazing. They had a burger it tasted like beef but coulda been bison or are they the considered same thing? Anywhoo that came with an American flag and a huge onion ring on top. The burger was great the onion ring was too deeply fried. They also served fillet steak that was cooked perfectly, but I do like a bit more seasoning on it or have it come with a sauce. Salmon was average as it was overly dry but the mod mayo sauce thing they had was very good. I mean if you're making a 100 pieces of salmon it will probably not result in the best effort but they still did a decent job. Finally they gave us a ton of dessert, cookies (best snickerdoodle lemon flavored cookie ever) and ice cream over brownies...Also their house wines were great. They also gave us bottomless sangria which objectively is probably top 3 best sangria I have had in the city.",1,0,0,Xi L.,"New York, NY",176,484,179
5.0,7/10/2015,"Love this place!  I used to work at NBC and would eat at Ted's pretty frequently. Now that I have no reason to be in that area, I kinda forgot about it. I was lucky enough to attend a Yelp event at Ted's this week and got a reminder how great it is. Everything is super fresh and made on site. No processed foods at Ted's! They have a great variety on the menu and everything I've tried has been amazing. My fav is the steak with the bison burger being a close runner up. The sides are all great too. They have a great happy hour and lots of yummy cocktail options. Even their cocktail mixers are fresh and made on-site! I definitely see more trips to Ted's in my future. I hate the commotion of the area where Ted's is located, but the amazing food you get there makes it all worth it! Oh yeah, the prices aren't too bad here either!

5.0,7/8/2015,"This review is based on attending a Yelp event at Ted's Montana Grill where we got the opportunity to sample a selection of their food and drinks.  Bison has long been something I wanted to try and although it is a red meat very similar to beef, there is a subtle flavour difference (probably due to the reduced fat content of bison meat).  Let me tell you, ""Ted's filet"" did not disappoint!  The bison sample was delicious and perfectly cooked for my taste.  To me, the filet was the highlight but we also sampled: * ""St Phillips Island Crab Cakes with avocado"" (generous amounts of crab)* ""Southwest corn"" (although not something I would normally have it was very good and spicy without being over the top)* ""Bar None Sliders"" (beef and bison burger in a ""biscuit"" bun - we ended up in a long semantic debate about scone vs biscuit vs cookie but as the weird foreigner, I really had no chance ;) )  The sliders were excellent although the ""salt and pepper onion rings"" were not really my thing as I'm not a huge fan of deep fried crumbed stuff* ""Cedar Plank Salmon""  Noticeable cedar flavour, which worked very well with the salmon* Brownies (which I generously helped others finish).  Had it not been for the bison filet, this may have been my favourite...They also had red and white sangria, plus wines and fresh squeezed lemonade.  I drank the ""Bison Ridge Cabernet Sauvignon"", which paired well with the bison in more than just name.All in all, a very enjoyable evening with excellent food and extremely friendly staff.  Granted it was an organised event but I would definitely return for a pre-show meal, especially the three course ""Theatre Menu"", which seems a reasonable price for Manhattan.",1,0,0,Allan R.,"London, United Kingdom",137,94,103

5.0,7/8/2015,"This place definitely exceeded my expectations. I came here last night to attend a Yelp event so I was lucky enough to be served a variety of food options. For apps, I would definitely recommend the crab cakes which come with a guacamole and kale salad - something different and such a great pairing. The bar none sliders were perfectly cooked and served on a moist biscuit like bun instead of the standard dry white bread buns. For dinner entrees, we sampled the cedar plank salmon and the Ted's Fillet. Both were great but I would definitely recommend the steak over the salmon (it is a steakhouse after all) as its very tender and was perfectly cooked. The restaurant has the feel of a typical steakhouse inside with a spacious dinning room and a large bar area with additional seating. Even with our large party, the wait staff was friendly and I could tell they were rushing around as quickly as possible to make sure that we were all taken care of (they did forget my water but made sure I had plenty of wine so I will forgive them).I hear that they also have a decent happy hour at the bar so that's always an excuse to pop in and check this place out.",5,4,4,Jennifer W.,"Rocklin, CA",643,280,72

During the event, the waitresses brought around 6 different menu item samples so everyone could get a good idea of the whole menu. I have to say, everything I tried was great, but the bison burger was PHENOMENAL. The drinks were also great- I recommend the white sangria, or the fresh squeezed lemonade for a non-alcoholic option. Both drinks were from a truly fresh batch so they tasted great!The waitstaff was also really nice and accommodating. The manager of the restaurant even came out and told the whole group the history of the restaurant and its founders, which I thought was a nice touch.All in all, Ted's is a great casual place with phenomenal food and drinks.

What began as a hearty, fun eatery has in the past two years become a rude, officious, poorly-staffed, and low service restaurant through what appears to be mismanagement. The host's vagaries appear to determine whether incomplete parties will be seated or not. The host has claimed not to have reservations available which, when checking online, were readily available.

5.0,2/16/2015,"Here for a convention, so finding a place where everyone would be happy is not easy, and it's usually left up to me. We were walking, so close to the HIlton Mid-town was important, esp as it was bitterly cold. Since last year, the restaurant that we would have gone to was closed (same place, I think), so after looking at the menu, I had the concierge make reservations for 5. It was a quick walk over and nice and warm and welcoming when we got there. Whether it was because it was a Sunday night or everyone was at either the SNL celebration or the NBA All-Star game, they weren't very busy, so we were seated right away. Nice open space and everyone wasn't crammed together. Lots of room at our table of 5 so we didn't put our elbows in each others space, but were able to talk and enjoy comfortably.The wine, liquor and beer selections were plentiful enough that we all were able to settle on something. There are even two Adult milkshakes on the menu, one with Jack Daniels, that sounded intriguing. The specials consisted of a Bison Strip Steak, like a Delmonico at 16ozs, fresh grouper and something else that I can't remember. The offering gave and option many times of beef vs. bison. I like bison, so this really made me happy. Around the table we had the 16oz Bison steak with roasted mushrooms and a side of garlic smashed potatoes, medium rare and huge! I didn't realize how hungry I was and had planned on having cold steak for breakfast. That didn't happen. It was tender,juicy, great tasting and cooked to perfection. I don't feel in the least bit guilty eating it all. (Note: I had been up since 5am, shoveling and then driving to the city in nasty weather and had't had anything but coffee and a bagel all day).Hubby ordered the No. 11 burger- slow braised bison with horseradish cheddar, mushrooms and horseradish sauce. I stole a bit and it was very good- not at all dry and nice and thick.Also ordered were the planked salmon, steak salad and another burger. No one had any complaints and I was told it was a good choice by everyone. None of us had any room for dessert.For my husband and I, two beers, the steak and burger, with a side of mashed potatoes was $89 including tax.

We ordered a bottle of red wine, and sat for a bit and enjoyed it. My boyfriend ordered the bison ribeye and I went for the bison short ribs, as I'm not a steak-eater. He had never had a bison steak, but honestly said he couldn't tell the difference. Saves you a couple hundred calories though! We were both VERY happy with our meals! The short ribs fell off the bone and I didn't even need a knife to cut them. Everything was perfectly cooked, as ordered, which was excellent.

Adult size = double kid price. We ordered a basketful of onion rings and homemade potato chips which came out with house-made ranch dressing and horseradish dressing.  I never got a chance to taste the rings because the kids inhaled them.  The chips were OK, but I have had better from the plethora of Portuguese places in Newark.I chose to get a naked burger with avocado, tomato and roasted Brussel sprouts (with bacon!) which was the veggie of the day.  The burger could use some seasoning but otherwise fine to satiate me.

2.0,12/14/2014,"Happy hour and light bites review:Popped in for some happy hour action before heading to Radio City Music Hall for the Christmas Spectacular and it was pretty much a fine experience, nothing crazy.I went with the $7 fancified boozy Arnold Palmer - although it really wasn't boozy. I had two and in most cases after two drinks, I'm raring to go however, I left feeling nothing. Booo. Tipsy YoSteph is a much more fun YoSteph.The bison nachos were disappointing. I know buffalo may have been extinct at one time, but I thought they were back in business; apparently not on these nachos. The cheese, the small amount that were on the chips, was barely melted and all other toppings (think some tomatoes and jalapeños) were sparse. Overall, these were some pretty pathetic nachos and nachos are pretty much the easiest thing to make. The fried green beans were delicious, so I'd suggest those.Overall, if you're desperate for somewhat affordable fare in the neighborhood, I'd say be hesitant but come by, but maybe stick to the burgers. Ambiance is nice and the staff was pleasant, but overall food and value just wasn't up to snuff. I'd rather of spent a little bit more and enjoyed everything and left with a buzz!",8,4,4,Stephanie Y.,"Berkeley, CA",4999,1763,3377

Not only great food and service, but they are all about sustainability, recycling, and support the American bison herd.I've had the Bison burgers, the Bison Filets, and the roasted Brussels sprouts and fries. The burgers are the best in the city that I've had by far. There's only one other restaurant that comes close to the quality. The fries are quite good. It isn't cheap, but in midtown, it's priced correctly and is quality meat.The filet was a good size cut and was priced well. Loved the Brussel sprouts which were flavored and roasted well. Had a few mixed drinks and they were done just right. All in all, the temperature is always right and the service is exemplary. I've been to this location 4 times.

Check the verdict below.Flavor: 6My first bite of the beef rib eye was a nine, but it went downhill from there. The steak was nicely cooked and all, but the meat was a bit tough, a bit over-salted and wet. When I say wet, I mean there were small puddles of grease on the top of the steak. Also when I say tough, I mean the grain of the meat was tight and a little difficult to chew. While it did have a decent flavor, I had to drop the score because of these things. There was also a good deal of grizzle on the cut, and a shitload of bleed-out once I got down on it. If it weren't for that and the grizzle I might have scored this a seven.",1,0,0,JohnnyPrimeC.

4.0,5/29/2014,"Midtown Manhattan isn't know for brunch. However, Ted's Montana Grill on 51st Street is looking to change that. With a newly-launched brunch menu, Ted's is looking to pull some of your traditional Village brunchers up above 42nd street.I was invited to check out Ted's new brunch menu. Ted's Montana Grill is known for two things 1) Ted Turner 2) bison, bison and more bison. On the brunch menu this is evident as your eyes are immediately drawn to the Bison Short Rib Hash, called out in enormous font and dominating the other dishes listed.Some of our brunch highlights:Subtly spicy Bloody Marys were served with a slice of bacon.The Bison Short Rib Hash came served with breakfast potatoes, roasted cornand avocado, topped with fried eggs. Don't let the pictures fool you. There were mounds of melt-in-your-mouth slow-braised short rib bison underneath those eggs that were bursting with flavor. The bison delivered a flavor punch (that's right, flavor punch) directly to my taste buds. This is an unbelievably rich dish.The Crab Cake Benedict consists of St. Phillip's Island crab cakes, wilted spinach,poached eggs and chipotle hollandaise served with breakfast potatoes. For those of you looking to cut some carbs, this Benedict was unique in that the crab cakes served as the English muffins. Hailey had no complaints here, greedily devouring this dish. (I didn't even get any!)Next up, savory corn flapjacks with oven-roasted ham, cheddar cheese and chives, served with honey butter and maple syrup. I was expecting these to be heavy pancakes. What we got were light, fluffy and buttery flapjacks. I was stuffed from my bison hash but somehow I found room to fit these guys. The edges had a buttery crispness to them and I'd highly recommend these for those that aren't into eggs as much.Finally, a boozy mudslide milkshake capped off the brunch. This was made with Baileys, Kahlua and vodka, and filled with huge scoops of ice cream topped with lots of whipped cream. If I had known I would be drinking a milkshake during brunch I would have worn my stretchy pants!The best thing I heard during brunch came from one of the chefs. He told me that they're experimenting in the kitchen to come up with the perfect brunch menu. How are they doing this? By checking out popular brunch spots in the West Village to see what's working. (By the way, this sounds like an awesome part of the job.)The VerdictI'm looking forward to seeing how Ted's menu evolves over the coming months. They're just starting out with brunch and it sounds like the team is committed to making it work. The only critique I have is that compared to other brunch spots, prices are a little steep and drinks aren't included so this may be a brunch to check out when your parents are in town. Regardless, I highly recommend giving Ted's Montana Grill a try - you won't regret it!",2,1,2,David B.,"New York, NY",60,141,2

2.0,11/14/2013,"Came here with 2 family members that highly recommended it. I went in not knowing what to expect and given how underwhelmed I was, I think that's a good thing. As an appetizer, they insisted on ordering the Bison Nachos. They would've been ok if the kitchen hadn't been so skimpy with the toppings! Literally after the 5 chips right on top, all the chips underneath were just bare and unappetizing. I was hoping my actual entree would be better (I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger Bison Burger with half fries and half onion rings) so I just opted to wait for that. The burger itself was good but nothing mind-blowing for me. As for the french fries (kinda soggy - I've definitely had better; I didn't finish them) and the onion rings everyone raves about (they were crunchy but a bit too on the greasy side for me - I was only given 3 and could only manage to stomach 2 of them, which is crazy because I generally love onion rings), I was disappointed. After eating all I could, I actually felt queasy (I I think the greasiness of the fries and onion rings had more of an affect than I'd anticipated, and that's saying a lot because I can down a burger and fries with the best of them). In terms of the restaurant itself, the ambiance was nice and seemingly more on the upscale side (there were quite a few suits in there, which I'm sure is largely attributed to the location) but after sitting down at the table, I got the impression that Ted's is a bit confused as to what exactly it wants to be: upscale or ""down-home"" style? The huge salt container (like the ones you buy at the supermarket to cook with that was sitting on the table; there were no salt and pepper shakers on any of the tables) especially gave me this impression. That was definitely off-putting (especially since whenever you attempt to use it, salt just pours out in a steady stream). Overall, Ted's didn't offer me anything I'd come back for.

The food was quality, the clientele was mixed with locals, tourists, and business folk, and the staff was super friendly and attentive. On this visit, I had their New Mexico burger with beef (they also offer bison for their burgers). This delicious and tender burger was topped with pepper Jack cheese, roasted Anaheim peppers, spicy tomato jam, and yummy guacamole! Definitely worth getting again!! Fries were served on the side with the burger, and these were super tasty as well. I didn't taste any of their cocktails, but I did order diet coke, which was the fountain variety... and served with the small crunchy ice pieces that you find in Sonic sodas. What a treat! Also, the sodas were all-you-can-drink as they should be at every restaurant-- don't you just hate it when a restaurant is so high and mighty that they don't offer free refills on soda?As for atmosphere, the place has a very masculine feel inside (lots of wood) but still very fresh and up-to-date looking and neither stuffy nor pretentious.

We had a 12pm reservations and it took a while to get seated as it seemed a lot of people came in at the same time. The hostess area is not located in the best place so it gets a bit cramped and awkward waiting to be seated and you constantly have to try to get out of other people's ways.The 7 of us were initially seated at a 5 person table round table and we were quite cramped. Per our request however, they moved us to a booth, which was much more comfortable.We all had burgers and there were no complaints made. I had the bison green and hot and I thought it was ok. My burger tasted like bland meat, the guac added nothing to save it and the jalapenos were barely grilled. I also had the 50/50 and the fries were way better than the onion rings.

Being in the restaurant business myself, the food was absolutely appalling. I usually don't complain, but I felt this time I had too.  First off, it took forever to get a simple round of beverages. Secondly, when the ""mini"" plates of salad we ordered finally arrived, the lettuce was brown and wilted. A bowl of soup we ordered arrived with the meal lukewarm and salty as sin. You could wake the dead with it ! Furthermore, food was overcooked, loaded in salt, ice cold French fries, dried up baked potatoes. Some of the saddest looking plates I have ever seen. Now I understand they are in the backyard of Rockefeller center, but heck, put some pride in the dishes you serve. My roasted chicken dish, as tasty as it was, was ice cold, and missing a vegetable it was supposed to come with. I mean really, for $166.00, I expected better food.  The waitress as sweet as she was, seemed overwhelmed with tables and was probably exhausted since it was 9:30 when we were seated.

We had 6:30 reservations but the weather kinda sucked n we were done walking around so we went in at about 5:20 n figured we'd sit at the bar for a while. The bar was very crowded so the hostess sat us in a booth which worked out well. Initially our waiter came over, I don't remember if he told us his name. He took our drink order n walked away, one of the women changed her mind about her drink n he kind of rolled his eyes n told us he'd have to run n tell the bartender to cancel it out. Everyone got their drinks n we ordered our food. For apps we had grilled shrimp which were awesome n the bison nachos which were also good. Our main course came out while our appetizers were still on the table which wasn't really a big deal except that he didn't clean all the dirty plates from the table before putting down our food. I had the Avalon bison burger which was delicious n juicy, my mother had a bison burger as well with bacon n a fried egg on it, she loved it. The other two women had a filet n a fried chicken sandwich. No complaints, everyone thought the food was great. Somewhere in between bites of my burger the dinner rush came in n our waiter disappeared. We weren't in a rush by any means but we did want more drinks n when we finally found him n ordered he smiled politely n walked away. We got a coffee, tea, my sangria and a frangelico. The coffee and tea came out but there was no sugar. My sangria came out n we had to ask 3 times for the frangelico at which point he told us ""well, some people havent gotten their dinner yet."" Guess who's problem that isn't? Mine! The table next to us also had a problem with the same waiter n the manager had to come fix things.

Not that we needed it after stuffing ourselves, but still.Portions are definitely good, but the prices aren't cheap, either.  I guess for NYC it's pretty decent (maybe $15 for a burger).  However, this was the nostalgic, tasty end to a really memorable day :)  Thanks, Ted!",1,0,1,Robin K.,"San Francisco, CA",22,100,0

3.0,7/18/2011,"I Soooooo want to love this place. I'm a big Bison fan. Maybe comes from my days in Denver rooting for CU. It's healthy and tastes as good or better than beef. Ted's specializes in Bison (some mistakenly call it Buffalo). They offer steaks, burgers meatloaf and chili. I've been here twice now and they're just not consistent enough to recommend. The bison ribeye I just finished was perfect. Juicy, tender and cooked to perfection (medium rare, careful - don't go past medium on Bison or it'll dry out.) But my daughters tenderloin was overcook to medium well. Yet her potato was raw? And my sweet potato (yam) was about the size of two golf balls. The asparagus still had the chewy bases on them. I had to cut them off myself. The server did not come back after dropping the dishes off to inquire how things were until we were done eating. Then he asked how things were. Too late now pal. Where were you 15 minutes ago when we cut into everything?To be fair, the last time I was here, everything was fine, but at these prices you just can't depend on the quality you will get here. When it's good, it's great, but  I'd rather go around the corner to Del Frisco's, pay a bit more and know I'm going to have my world rocked.

If you want value for your $, Ted's is the spot with generous portions and plenty to choose from.Bison meat is very gamey. I had it in the sliders we ordered and wasn't a fan of it. The Bison Nachos we had were kinda luke warm. The chips didn't seem to be freshly fried or anything. Relatively skimpy on the bison chili on our order and had non existent pepper jack cheese on it. When I dug into the middle, the chips were lukewarm and a bit soggy. Makes me wonder how long it was sitting in the kitchen.Ordered the Kitchen Sink burger and yes they do throw everything at it! A ~1400 calorie burger approximately and I was only able to get through half of it before putting up the white flag. When you try the beef itself, it's more on the salty side.

Accordingly, the drink served had plain olives. I ordered the Spikebox bison burger which comes with monterey jack cheese, jalapenos and bacon. Sadly, there were only three jalapenos slices and the fries were barely above room temperature. However, the food overall was pretty tasty. The bartenders were, on the whole, inept. I asked for mustard, it never appeared. I asked again. My cocktail was finished, I was extremely thirsty (the didn't offer water at the outset) and had to flag them down to get a beer.

In fact, the blue plate special concept has been scrapped with variations of those plates now available on a regular basis.Menu quibbles aside, what results in the 3 star rating was the quality of the food. We started with sliders, all three of them, and they arrived quickly and not exactly medium. Pink and rare was not how we requested the sliders but that is how they were delivered.Next up was a pulled pork entree that was high on salt and low on taste (besides the taste of salt). The other entree was bison meatloaf served with mashed potatoes that was acceptable, if presented in almost record time. We were still finishing up the sliders when the entrees arrived. Move 'em in, move em' out!The availability of bison meat is one of the draws of Ted's and having had the bison meatloaf and bison burger, I can comment that the meat is sweeter than it's beefier counterpart. It's allegedly healthier too as the lower calorie count on the menu indicates.Dessert offerings include fresh baked cookies and strawberry shortcake. The shortcake is worthy of the 4th star, a tower of three shortcakes and two scoops of ice cream and cream. Large enough for two to share or one to pig out on, the shortcake is highly recommended.I genuinely like Ted's and will dine there again.

The place is crowded as heck on a weekday during lunch. You're sitting almost elbow to elbow w/ neighboring tables. The waiters offer to hang our jackets to make a little more room. Had the onion rings for appetizer, they are huge and delicious. Try to order a Malibu Cranberry, and the waiter came back and said that they don't have malibu. That's the ding of .5 star. I should have tested them and asked for a mojito (and see if they had mint), but I didn't.After the drinks order, I decided on a Bison strip steak, medium rare. They are about $10 more than regular steak, but I had to try it (again, not on bill, so why not?). Waited about 30 minutes, out came a decent size steak that you really can't tell if its really a buffalo. I expected a really lean, dry meat, but instead got a decently juicy, yet, extremely fatty steak. It definitely taste different than a regular steak, but that could have been psychological (you want to believe you're eating something else when they tell you its something else). The steak was cooked as requested, which was good, but still, at the end of the day, if its not healthy for you (and it wasn't), then why the heck would you pay more for it when it doesn't taste as good as the real thing?

I also substituted my fries for some onion rings. The burger was really nice and tender. I loved flavor and the meat was really tender and juicy. The onion rings were good as well.",1,0,0,Celina H.,"Los Angeles, CA",305,39,2
3.0,8/4/2008,"Ted's is an enigma.  They have a great looking interior, a clean if not antiseptic bathroom, nice ambiance and a courteous staff and somewhat decent prices for a genre steakhouse.  But the food sucks.  It's salty or bland but always cool to cold. If the Corporation spent some money on making an interesting menu cooked more professionally then they would have a hit.    So what did I order?  Chili and Salad, Onion Rings and a Iced Coffee.",3,0,2,David B.,"Brooklyn, NY",55,424,139
3.0,7/24/2008,Our server was quick and efficient but he didn't make up for the food. He recommend their burgers so we both tried a bison burger. The meat was tasty and a lot more lean then a beef burger but I have had better burgers at Barney's in SF/Berkeley.,1,0,0,Catherine S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",33,50,1
3.0,6/19/2008,"I decided to be a bit adventurous after the waitress pressured our group into trying the bison.  I have to admit my bison burger was really good, and so were the fries.  However, the service was a little sketch.  Not really somewhere I'd go out of my way to go to...but at least I can say I've eaten bison? (I think it freaks me out because I keep picturing the animal when you say ""bison"", but when you say ""beef"" I don't really picture the actual cow in my head).",0,1,0,Lisa L.,"San Francisco, CA",22,114,0
2.0,6/10/2008,"A real good burger and I heard the bison burger was also good.  Got half fries, that were good, and half onion rings, that were really good.The service was definitely poor at best.  Just an overall bad waitstaff.  I don't know if they're just constantly stretched thin, but everything takes too long to get from seemingly unnattentive waiters.  The same goes for the bartenders, although one was an absolute dime.Never had any bad food here, but I'm through with the place.  Considering the service and price, there are much better places in the area to hit up.",0,0,0,Matthew C.,"Long Island City, NY",3,31,0
4.0,5/14/2008,"Last night, the Man Friend and I were headed to Ben Benson's for a special occasion dinner (after failing to make Peter Luger reservations early enough... oops!), but when we peeked in the window, the restaurant looked really old people-y.  So we decided to try our luck elsewhere, and when we passed by Ted's Montana Grill, we decided to give it a try.I liked the ambience a lot-- it wasn't uptight or stuffy, but it wasn't like stepping into an Applebee's, either.  Our waiter was really nice, although the service was a bit slow (but hey, it's not fast food).  We both opted for the Kansas City strip (bison, of course, the restaurant's specialty).  My steak was kind of fatty, but once I carved away the fat, it was really juicy and delicious, albeit much firmer and denser than regular beef.  Everything was seasoned perfectly, and even my baked potato and the dinner rolls were delicious.  This seems like a great place to take visiting Midwestern parents.  All in all, it was a very enjoyable meal!",1,0,0,Sonja B.,"Astoria, NY",5,27,0
3.0,3/4/2008,Whoever hires the wait staff at Ted' should find another job. I've eaten here about 8 times in the last year. The food is always pretty good.  If you're a seasoned NYC restaurant go-er you will be completely insulted by the way the wait staff treats you.  There's nothing worse then going to eat at a NYC restaurant and having a waiter try and get over on you. I've been treated like some dumb tourist  almost every time I come here. This kind of service seems to be a trend in midtown.,0,0,0,Paul M.,"New York, NY",156,42,6
4.0,12/26/2007,"For a pre-theater dinner, head to Ted's Montana Grill, located just outside of all the Times Square hullabaloo but still close to all the Broadway shows. While this restaurant from Ted Turner is a chain, it has a unique feel.  The buffalo heads on the walls create a down-home Western atmosphere...it's quite relaxing at Ted's Montana Grill.  The servers are very friendly and not overly intrusive.  The meals are very reasonable priced for steak and chicken.  It's a great place to take any visitors who are coming into the city to have dinner with you.  You can have a good meal in a not-too-crowded New York restaurant.",2,0,2,Krista J.,"Brooklyn, NY",749,1181,35
3.0,12/23/2007,"NYC has plenty of places for great burgers, but this joint hits the spot with the option of bison instead of beef.  The meat is lean and tender with a subtle flavor that makes this place worthwhile for a quick lunch once you're seated.  You may want to hold out on the starches, such as chilli cheese fries, because you'll get an ample serving with your burgers.",1,0,1,Jenny L.,"Millbrae, CA",181,994,983
4.0,12/12/2007,"I was walking uptown, girlfriend got real hungry so I was like, ""Hey now, let us stop here, at Ted's."" I have passed this restaurant a couple of times, and definitely wanted to hop in and see what it was like in there. It always looked like a good time with all the families. So we went in. I liken the atmosphere to something like Houston's mixed with The Cheesecake Factory. Frankly, the decor was that of a concept that could be thrown all over the country and taken public. Ted?I had the beer chicken and the lady had a beef burger. Regardless of the fact that she was majorly hungry, she ate the whole dang thing. Including practically all the fries. She never does that. I ate my whole chicken and all my onion rings. My chicken was a little dry, but I kind of expected it not to be totally 100%. The onion rings were real good though. The waiter was quite attentive.One discrepancy. Since I am not a billionaire, I normally look for prices on menus. So I see that if you order the onion ring appetizer, you get 10 for $8 bucks. HOWEVER, if you order two sides, 5 onion rings each, it is $6 total...$3 each. Do the math.",0,0,0,Andrew W.,"New York, NY",13,108,0
3.0,11/6/2007,"Even though we were in no rush, service was still painfully slow and uncoordinated. We had two waiters for our large party of 16, but service was slow, they messed up an order, and it just took forever to get additional drinks, etc.The food was fine - nothing spectacular but the prices are very reasonable for midtown. Bison is leaner than traditional beef and the taste is a bit different.This time around I ordered a chicken sandiwch with swiss cheese and mushrooms. Very taste. The reason it was so tasty was that the bread was practically coated in butter. The secret to deliciousness is butter.",1,0,1,Brady H.,"Chicago, IL",62,312,268
3.0,9/1/2007,"The environment is important to Ted Turner so the wait staff will ask you if you want to use a straw.  If you do, you will receive a paper straw.  The take out utensils and boxes are made of corn instead of plastic.  I have a hard time picturing that.  And if you're gonna slaughter living creatures, you should do it the Ted Turner way, and not freeze it.  You should ship it fresh and have them grind it at that restaurant.  Hell, why not have bison roaming through midtown and have patrons kill their own with an arrow?I'm not on a high horse.  I had a chicken sandwich.  I just think it's funny how they were bragging.Oh, and some idiot girls stole a bunch of gift cards during the grand opening so an entire batch got deactivated.  Guess who had one of the gift cards?  Me.  How?  I got it in a gift bag from a party.  How do I know it had nothing on it?  I tried to use it and they told me that it was empty and I told them it was 10 bucks and they told me the story of the idiot girls.  In my mind, good customer service would be to take five bucks off my bill because I didn't know about the thievery.  However, that didn't happen.  Still, it was cheap--40 bucks for two meals?  And one of them involved fresh meat!",1,1,0,Christina M.

3.0,3/23/2007,"Let's call this review Close Encounters of 3 Kinds at Ted's Montana Grill.Close Encounter #1 - When it first opened last year I was thinking what balls Ted Turner has to open his bison burger saloon right next to Cite and across the street from Heartland Brewery. But that's Teddy media mogul mentality...you lay down cable and I'll launch CNN and TBS...you open an upscale and a downscale burgers/meat joint and I'll plop my rootin tootin grill smack in the middle of both of you. Eat it! On my first visit, I guess they were still trying to get their act together...the service was friendly but discombobulated...my medium-rare bison burger was medium toast...they were giving everyone free chocolate brownie ala mode to divert your attention from the mess they made...oh, the homemade lemonade was pretty refreshing...I'll give them one more chance...Close Encounter #2 - fast forward month later...I took a client there for an early lunch around noon and my timing was impeccable! Ted himself was there eating lunch at the table next to us. 60 Minutes was just in there filming a piece on him, so he decided to stay and enjoy his own grub. I guess the wait staff really had to kick their game up in front of Ted...which was good for us too. This time around my bison burger was superb - it tasted fresh off the ranch and really hit the spot. It was also fun watching Ted walking around the restaurant shaking hands, kissing babies, and signing napkins. That guy will do anything for attention. Close Encounter #3 - I call this encounter ""The G-String Incident."" A friend of mine emailed me a bunch of $10 gift certificate coupons off the purchase of two lunch or dinner entrees at Ted's (5 year anniversary promotion)...I figured why not use 'em so I took a colleague to lunch there the other day. We wanted to go gonzo and sat at the bar top tables where you get box seats to all the kitchen action...the grill-meisters multitasking with their tools and waiters speedily gathering up their orders....it's inspiring stuff for a foodie. All of a sudden, these two middle-aged women sit down on the stools at the next table with their backs to us. This is when things went terribly wrong...Let me start out by saying that I absolutely love when an attractive woman has on a pair of low-riding jeans with a sexy g-string showing a hint of visibility...But this one woman sat down and I swear it was like looking at a the butt of a plumber trying to fix the leak under your sink...and wearing a g-string too!!...Why do some middle-ages women dress completely inappropriately for their age and body type? Don't bother, I know the answer...Anyway, I digress from the review...I decided to skip the buffalo ride this time and ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with Monterrey Jack cheese melted on it and fries...my friend ordered some salmon dish.I give the the meal a B- for taste and chew ability, a C+ for the service (friendly but slow), an A for the price (w/ the coupon $22)...and an F- for the side show. BTW, I heard that Cite is closing. The end of a culinary era. Damn you Ted!",1,4,2,Scott K.,"New York, NY",21,52,0
5.0,3/3/2007,"Even though I'm not a big fan of red meat, I love this place. I've been twice for lunch, and the service was great both times. I had the salad topped with ground bison and vinaigrette, and the pecan encrusted trout. I'm a matchbook collector and sadly, according to my waiter, Ted doesn't believe in them so you won't be able to take any Montana Grill matchbooks as souveneirs.",1,0,0,T T W.,"Duxbury, MA",35,90,5
3.0,2/22/2007,Went here with my family. Got me the burger that has bleu cheese. Also said bacon and mushrooms on the menu but never got them. I guess you have to ask for them??? Burger was cooked right but the meat lacked flavor. Also with the bleu cheese the burger was salty. I'd rather eat a burger somewhere else.,1,0,0,Keoni U.,"Ewa Beach, HI",56,235,38
2.0,2/7/2007,"Went here last Friday for lunch.  OK food and atmosphere, great service, but only 3 stars because: 1) Bison Burger was decent but pricey - Got the Bison George's Cadillac Burger.  Bison is supposedly healthy for you, and it was pretty tasty.  But, for the price you pay for a burger (over $10), it's expensive and outweighs the health benefits. 2) Fries were not spectacular3) Tablecloth was still a little stained from the last table 4) Atmosphere - Definitely a guy's kind of place.  Dark lighting, wood paneling, buffalo heads hanging around the ceiling, etc.  Also pretty loud. BUT, we did see Jane Fonda sitting at one of the tables!  Funny, because she and Ted Turner got divorced in 2001.  Maybe they're still friends.",1,2,1,Robyn F.,"San Francisco, CA",62,463,1
