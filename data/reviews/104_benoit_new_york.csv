5.0,3/14/2019,"My lovely bride and I stopped in for lunch today for her birthday.  We had an incredible meal. We started with a mesclun salad and steak tartare.  The steak tartare was absolutely stellar, probably the best I've ever had.  She ordered the Maine sea scallops and I ordered the duck l'orange. I can never order duck anywhere again. Dessert was creme caramel and a baba with armagnac. Finally, they surprised us with several warm madeleines, straight from the oven. The service here is out of this world, meaning just enough attention. This is what all French bistros should aspire to be.",0,0,1,Jack H.,"Atlanta, GA",33,249,14

1.0,1/21/2019,"Thank god we came here during the Restaurant Week so we didn't pay the full price for this poor service and mediocre food. Octopus salad was too sour with literally 3 pieces of octopus in it. We've been waiting for servers to get our empty plates for 20 minutes after we finished appetizers. No one even showed up.You don't have to be Alain Ducasse to sear a salmon. But if you are Alain Ducasse, you're expected to accompany good salmon with something special. This was not a case. It came with ridiculously acetic bearnaise and shaved carrots stuffed with pumpkin puree. Just bad. Dessert. If you ever seen a poo emoji you've seen a portion of chocolate mousse in Benoit. Minus the eyes of course. The mousse is okay but the way it was served... Hmmm... Seriously guys? Bottom line - overpriced worse-than-average food with zero service. Not even worth $42 as a NYRW special. The only good thing about this dinner experience was the wine. One extra star to your sommelier.P.S. Clean your toilets, they are filthy which would be good if it was a gay bar, not a pretend-to-be-chic establishment...",4,1,1,Nick G.,"South Pointe, FL",120,23,2
2.0,1/4/2019,"Food spotty.  Some dishes excellent, others indifferent or uninspired. Decor a second thought.  Not what I expected from the worlds best restauranteur.  Service adequate but waiter got my order wrong.  Beef is not close to Prime.  My steak was quick replacement for the wrong order so it's possible they gave me someone else's mistake, because I had it in 3 minutes, but it was not a prime strip.  Very expensive for what you get.  My cocktail was horrible, too.  Go to any variety of other higher end French bistros in nyc to get your Francophile on.  We had a great meal at Balthazar.  And always do.  This Ducasse place is resting on its laurels in my view.",0,0,0,B W.,"Salem, MA",0,19,0

We loved the mushroom and onion soup with a few shavings of the black truffles- surprisingly not overpowering, the chef balanced the flavors perfectly! I had the cod, which was delicate- just divine!

But do not let the mediocre reviews stop you, you HAVE to come here. This place was amazing. I'm not an expert, but I do absolutely love French food and this was the most authentic, delicious French cuisine experience I've had in New York thus far. The service was so on point, the sommelier assisted us in picking the perfect bottle of wine that we all loved, and the food was just over the top outstanding. I can't wait to come back here soon.

2.0,12/19/2018,"For the price,  which is high even for NYC, one should feel cosseted.  Food should be extraordinary and service impeccable.  Instead, food is merely very good and service borderline okay. Our party of 4 waited about 10 mins after being seated in the dining room on a Saturday night to get drink orders, and only after flagging down a waiter.  Twice during the meal, waiters appeared with wine that our table had not ordered.  At dessert, orders for a glass of sauternes and cup of hot tea were forgotten.  The food is delicious, well prepeared, bistro style. We had the duck and the quenelles, both of which were very good.  The hors d'oeuvres ($15/3, $22/5) were good as well but on the small side.",2,0,1,P C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,36,0
3.0,12/17/2018,"The food was delicious; for appetizers we had the charcuterie board, onion soup and tart flambé. Entrees were scallops and beef tartare. The service was very erratic, neglectful and disappointing. The food was definitely worthy of a four star review, but the service was so poor it ranks only a two star. Drinks that were ordered were served only after reminders. One drink took three reminders before it was served. When the chocolate soufflé was ordered we were told it should have been ordered sooner.

5.0,9/16/2018,"I booked a room here one week before my wedding. The chef, captain, manager, staff, and entire experience surpassed my expectations. It was such a romantic and fabulous lunch. The menu included the country salad, octopus and quinoa, NY Strip Steak with bearnaise and pommes frites, sea scallops with truffle, and a chocolate cake that Chef Rouabah specially made for our wedding reception. The cake was amazing--not too rich, not too light, cool with mousse and a little crunch. The room was beautiful, with a bar, and plenty of space for 33 people. Even better, working with Jeremy, the Captain, and Olivier, the Manager, was delightful and easy. They were so accommodating before the event, and made me feel so special on the day of the event. Madam Chef Rouabah came out to greet me and my husband after dessert. And the staff was meticulous, engaging, and so pleasant.

4.0,9/11/2018,"Elegant and posh, Benoit NYC provides a classy example of what fine dining in Paris may look like. Located in the Midtown Manhattan area, my best friend from college and I decided on this restaurant as a home base for never ending catch up and reminiscing over dinner. We decided on sparkling water, a martini, and a flat bread to start our with. There were also complimentary bread puffs as well. We each ordered the salmon dinner accompanied by an asparagus/vegetable medley and mashed potatoes. Everything was cooked to perfection and delicious. We stayed for over 3 hours and truly enjoyed the ambience. Much like French restaurants, tables are seated close together. We made a reservation ahead of time but not sure we needed it. There is a lovely bar/lounge area when you first arrive. If you needed to wait for a table, it would be a nice place to wait and enjoy a cocktail. That area was very busy with a post-work/happy hour crew present. The service was great and on our way out the kind hostess offered to take photos of us, which we embraced to the max. (See photos). Overall, this restaurant is pricy but worth it, in my opinion and by my experience-I would return to eat here.",5,1,4,Addy G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1112,667,3139

Excellent service, reasonable prices in midtown Manhattan where the prevalence of chain restaurants and tourist joints make it tough to find a good meal. Pleasant atmosphere.

2.0,7/19/2018,"This restaurant has a nice atmosphere and staff and is the only reason why I'm rating it with two stars. If you're big on flavor I wouldn't suggest going here because the price WAYYYY more than what was offered. I'm vegetarian so there wasn't that much choices for myself except one dish and a garden salad (which barely had dressing or taste). Others ordered the fish which was small and not filling (~$40) and the rotisserie chicken tasted like Costco's $5 chicken lolI wouldn't go back.

4.0,7/9/2018,"Reservations were easy to come by for a Thursday evening, and my friend and I were promptly seated on arrival. While there were many seats still open at 6:30PM, by the ~7:30PM mark, the place was substantially more packed.We ordered the charcuterie board to start, and it was pleasantly surprising in a few different ways. There was one strong selection (think liverwurst sandwiched between salami), but the other four varieties of meats were flavorful. What really won me over was the abundant pearl onions and cornichons - they give you a whole bucketful of them, so no need to worry about asking for refills. On top of that, it comes with your typical bread, along with lentils and a potato salad.For mains, we opted for the king salmon and skirt steak (medium and rare, respectively). Both were good, but I wasn't a fan of the bearnaise sauce they came with. They have the courtesy to lightly plop some on your plate and leave the rest in a sauce dish, so I'd keep it to the side and see if you enjoy it before letting them pour it over.Their profiteroles were a perfect way to end the meal. The melted chocolate comes out fondue-style for easy dipping, and the dessert comes with vanilla ice cream for two.",5,2,6,Dan C.,"Manhattan, NY",24,128,24
5.0,6/16/2018,"Alain Ducasse recently transformed this French bistro restaurant into what it is today, complete with a lovely wine bar. It is traditional meets contemporary, Paris meets Manhattan in its design and feel, but it retains a certain charm. We were lucky enough to try several items on the menu, but the star of the show was the Poulet rôti (roasted chicken). It was very succulent and quite flavorful. The escargot were generously sized and perfectly cooked. They served great cocktails, with my pick being the Le Jardin (skipping over the obvious French 75), a lovely concoction of cucumber infused gin, elderflower and lemon juice. I'm a huge fan of refreshing drinks on a warm NYC day. And to top off a lovely lunch, everyone was simply over-the-top nice. It felt genuine and was very appreciated by my elderly mother. We'll return soon to try brunch and dinner.",0,0,0,Gene C.,"Pensacola, FL",95,57,8

I loved the calves liver .. it was tender and mild flavored , just the way I like it .. it was perfectly prepared . Medium rare . I will go back just for the calves liver . However back to a complaint rather than a compliment .. the restaurant has ""mood lighting "" which means you can't see real well , but I have absolutely no idea what the side dish was .. it was very greasy and slimy at same time .

5.0,5/1/2018,"Benoit is open for late dining and I decided to try it after a show.   Mixed reviews on yelp but many of the negatives seemed to be about the service during the very busy times and not the food.  I love good french food, so I don't mind if the service is not the best.  I had the pate en croute (pate baked in a lard crust) and it was excellent.   It came with a pot of French cornichons (small pickles) and white onions.    They were tart and great!  Also came with a side of French Dijon mustard.  This dish was served as it would be in France!    I then had the filet mignon with peppercorns sauce and French fries.    The steak was cooked medium rare and peppercorn sauce was ""peppery "" and creamy.   Absolutely delicious!   French fries were the real French ones and came out hot and delicious.   I could not believe my luck!   I had a nice dry rose wine from the French region of Provence.   The bread was very good.   A great meal and worth the price of $130.00 but then this is New York.  At 10:30pm on a weekday the restaurant was almost empty.    The service was very good.",1,0,0,John M.,"Colorado Springs, CO",10,257,165

4.0,3/19/2018,"Swung by over restaurant week, and this restaurant delivered a surprisingly non-corporate and solid experience that will make me come back in the future.While this place has the old fashion French charm, it is not a high-end French restaurant. It's not shown in the price tag, nor is it ever claimed by the restaurant itself, so drop that expectation before walking in.All three courses featured a more safe, yet classic spin on some ingredients most readily available in New York: cod fish, meat, and milk-based desserts, to be specific. We liked them all, and they provided a reasonable preview of what's on the regular menu.This is definitely not a downtown sort of place; but that's just about the case for all French restaurants as they don't need to do any Avant garde upgrades to attract traffic. See that as a plus and you'll like this place.",1,0,0,Wayne C.,"New York, NY",165,84,61

4.0,2/13/2018,"Flavors were great.  Pricey, but worth the price.You want that feel of a classy Parisian bistro, this is the place.  The main dining room is deep into the building, away from the street, so you can almost forget that you're in New York thanks to the very French decor and service.  It was a Friday night and so dinner was busy, but the service was impeccable and very attentive.  I almost felt a little bad that I didn't get wine with dinner just so they could give us full service.  But having had my wine for the day during lunch, I had to politely decline.My husband went for the Restaurant Week menu and I went for their winter seasonal dish, cassoulet.  We also shared a choice of 3 hors d'oeurves.  Onthe carb front, bread service included baguettes and chese gougeres and dinner was finished with lovely madeleines.Our hors d'oeurve choices were the eggplant, the rabbit, and squash with cured duck.  Eggplant was okay as I tasted the cheese crisp more than the eggplant.  Rabbit roulade was great with the bits of pickle that came with it.  Pureed squash with duck was our favorite, though it would have been better if it wasn't stone cold.Hubby loved the sweetness in his French Onion soup.  His steak was good, but it lacked seasoning.  Never a fan when we have to reach for the salt shaker.  Frites were perfectly cut, fried and crispy even after they'd cooled off.  The tarte tatin was beautiful and it came with a quenelle of creme fraiche instead of a sweeter ice cream, which made us happy.And then we have to rave about the cassoulet.  Awesomely thick, rich, gelatinous bean filled stew.  Perfect for the winter weather.  And enough to feed two or three people.  Which meant we took it back to the hotel room and I snacked on it on and off throughout our week long stay until it was gone.  You better love all the meat bits, flesh, fat and bone, if you want to eat this.  Fatty, meaty hock, slice of pork belly, duck confit and a lovely sausage (our favorite meat bit). And I saw little bits of pig ear and pork belly in the stew which just made my inner foodie glee.",0,0,0,Miladel P.,"Chicago, IL",17,12,0
4.0,2/10/2018,"Caught the last day of Restaurant Week and scored a last minute 7:45 reservation. The 2 prix fixe menus we ordered were the hanger steak and duck, preceded by a grilled octopus and pate.  We added a dozen escargot to our starters.  don't distinguish who had what because my bf and I picked off of each other's plate so that we can have more variety.  We finished with a tartine and profiteroles.  It was a satisfying meal, very standard fare for a place like Benoit.  It was a safe middle ground meal and one I expect Ducasse to present to RW patrons.  The hanger steak and frites were a little tough and bland.  The duck had more forethought in it with the olives.  Both lacked something and I guess for lack of a better term, soul.  I know, not eating soul food but there was nothing exciting about our meal.  Glad finally went and as French bistros on RW go, it's a great value.  Next time, we'll order off the prix fixe and get the crispy trotter or pied de cochon!",0,0,0,Wailana W.,"New York, NY",59,309,1103

3.0,2/2/2018,"Went for lunch. Welcome was friendly, got a decent table. Service started out great. Food was very good. Had a great very rich Tarte Flambee followed up by the very large Cassoulet then the Baba dessert. My partner had the special restaurant week menu starting with a lovely salad followed up Boeuf Bourguignon with Spaetzle and Ice Cream. All went well until the waiter asked me if I wanted to take with me the rest of the Cassoulet (which was more than half left) and I said, ""Yes, please."" Then it seemed as though they offered fresh baked madeleines after the customers meal. And, they kept walking all over the dining room offering them to everyone but us!! Were we bad boys, were we undeserving?? Who knows?? I paid the bill and asked for my Cassoulet and everyone got silent and ran away. Did they throw it out by accident?? Everyone hid. Such silly behavior I have never seen. Oh well, it appears that they would rather not have us back ever again. Too bad as I like the place and live 3 blocks away. Anyway. I recommend highly the Cassoulet, but, make sure you eat the whole thing before you leave, lol!!!",1,1,0,Joe B.,"New York, NY",26,45,1

5.0,1/31/2018,"Totally underrated - do people not like French dining in Midtown? After just getting back from Bordeaux the month prior and staying at the St Regis NY for a wedding, we wanted a later lunch before a nighttime Peter Luger reservation that was close by. Mission accomplished! After a flight delay we had to cancel our reservation, but were able to walk in without one on an overcast Friday in January and get seated right away. The wine list both by the glass, by Coravin, and by the bottle is spectacular - we recognized many of the gorgeous reds of Bordeaux (Pape Clement, Lafite Rothschild, Chateau Haut-Brion). The service was typically French (which is a compliment, I find the French lovely and helpful, but not obtrusive). We sat in the indoor ""courtyard"" near the bar facing the street. As it was cold in January there wasn't much to see but the overall bar, ambiance, service, and food was spot on and made us miss France. Highlights: the salmon dish was beautifully cooked medium rare per our request, and the table bread, butter, and brioche + pate was to die for. Escargot were also wonderful.

We made a quick reservation walked to Benoit New York. When we got in they asked us if we wanted to sit up in the front parlor area, which we agreed to. After looking at menu for 15 minutes without being served, we went up and asked if we could sit in the dining room instead. The gentleman was accommodating and he sat us right away.The décor is beautiful, the pops of red and fun French-inspired posters made the feel of the place fun and a little fancy. We ended up ordering wine, lattes, cheese and a bread/pastry basket. Our server was nice, but you could tell he was annoyed we weren't ordering a full lunch. He brought out our coffee, and either forgot our wine or just got sidetracked (totally understand how this happens, I've worked in the food industry before).The cheese and pastries were nice, it was the perfect amount of food for just a quick lunch snack. It was extremely expensive however - we almost spent more here than we did at a Michelin Star restaurant we were at the night before for dinner!

2.0,12/10/2017,"We had a reservation for 4 people last week and frankly feel that a typical Parisian bistro at any location does better French food and especially service.  Since we frequent France often, we consider ourselves Francophiles who love to dine in the French way.  Yes, dining in the evening is supposed to be enjoyed leisurely, but when you don't get attention to the table, it makes the dining experience at most so-so.  We ordered three course meals with cocktails & wine.  We waited quite a bit to get the waiter to first come to the table and take the order.  We got the drinks and bottle of wine. He kept the white bottle chilled, but our glasses were totally empty for most of the meal.  We actually had to get up to get our bottle and leave it on the table.  When asking for the after dinner Ports, the wine waiter had no idea about the Ports or region made.  He had to refer to another waiter who just brought out the drinks without asking.  As for the meal preparation, it was only fair of an inexpensive brasserie.  The sweetbreads were over cooked and the other dishes lacked some flavor.  With this being an Alain Ducasse restaurant and the prices paid for food & service, one would expect much more.  After we went back to the Hilton on 57th, the concierge asked about our dinner.  We mentioned these comments and others and she promptly called to speak with the manager.  She informed me that the manager had my contact information and was going to get back with me.  I have given this manager a full week to make contact and I hadn't heard from him.  I was hoping that they would redeem themselves with some apology or concern. It appears that this restaurant is just holding onto past reputations and fail to be concerned about today's dining guests.  If we want French food in NYC, there are so many other restaurants offering better food & service.",0,0,0,Bill B.,"Provincetown, MA",85,3,1

5.0,11/11/2017,"Great place for brunch!! Good service, food was absolutely delicious. Everything was cooked right and seasoned really well. Being French I may be biased but this place is definitely in my top 3 for breakfast/brunch!After reading some of the comments and reviews I had to explain a few things. This place is NOT a gastronomic restaurant but it's a bistrot. The purpose of a bistrot is to do food right, simple and following the original recipe. Complaining that a rotisserie  chicken taste like a good rotisserie chicken but nothing more. Did you expect it to be stuffed with foie gras and truffle or what? The kind of person who could write a bad review on Amazon that sounds like that:""Oh I ordered online a blue dress and I received a blue dress. I'm so disappointed"" Complaining that the millefeuille it too flaky is the same thing!! A millefeuille has to have a very simple filling/cream and the star of the dish is the flakiness of the pastry. It's not made to be easy to eat. The more layers and flakes you have shows the quality of the dessert. That's why it's called a ""millefeuille"" which means ""thousand layers"" in French... And the best for last. The escargot that doesn't come in ""their"" shell. The escargot to come in a ""escargot plate""Is a really good sign of quality. Escargot coming in a shell is 95% of the time a bad frozen product coming in a fake shell with bad butter mixed with margarine. That you don't like the food is one thing but complaining about what the food is supposed to taste or how it's supposed to look like when you obviously don't know anything about French cuisine is beyond funny. Please travel a bit and judge a restaurant for what it is. Don't go to a bistrot and expect innovative gastronomic French cuisine. You go to a bistrot to eat French typical recipes cooked the right way at a good quality/price ratio. And at this, Benoit is doing an outstanding job. I think I'm going to go eat Mexican and complain that my fajitas came with beans and guacamole and since I had Chipotle one time I think I know how Mexican food is supposed to taste and look like!",0,0,1,Alex B.,"New York, NY",34,50,0

Appetizers were ehh and main course was just the same. SMALL PORTIONS .. So do not expect to feel left full-- again, the wine may be the one filling you up. Their Wait staff was the least favorite of the night. I am unsure if it was due to being in a the corner; however once we were seated, and placed out orders- our wines glasses were taken away-- Our Waiter never entered our drink orders-- so we were being served water in Small size glasses until minutes before our ENTREE was served to us.

3.0,8/26/2017,"Went here today with my partner off the street. Didn't know anything about it but wasn't terribly excited by the menu. But it's an aesthetically pleasing dining room, and me and my bougie ass firmly believe in dining for the eyes. I'm a person who likes to sit in a fancy bar and drink soda water for hours if they'll let me. I'm also the type of person who will buy small plate after small plate if I like a place enough. If I bother to go somewhere for lunch or dinner, I'm looking for something akin to comfort and the illusion of leisure. Even if it's just 30 minutes, I want to feel taken care of or something. Especially for higher prices ( I think 30 dollars for poulet roti, 20 for a ham, gruyere and egg crepe). Pah. What hopes. Didn't like that - despite there being a nearly empty dining room - someone was seated directly next to us.So first thought is - it's cute. It's nice to be in there. red booths, mirrored everything, beautiful curved wooden chairs...Every waiter and host exquisitely uniformed. I loved the fucking little knife the waiter used to scrape the breadcrumbs off the table. Attention to the details. But it's kind of generic at the end you know? Too perfect, too symmetrical, too new, made for instagramming, for posing on a backdrop, for saying you've been there. Little character, no sense of a past. Like so much stuff that's around cities all over. For tourists and out of town visitors coming in off the street. That's largely how I feel about extensions of a chef's empire. French cooking happens best in the kitchen, and this food has no particular character. It's fine. You're paying for the name, the cute uniforms and the location. They have a good wine list though, and the waiters didn't rush you which is a plus. There's a crepe station and a sweet pastry situation. Didn't eat anything, but I felt for the chef standing there brandishing their dry spatula. If you can still eat sugar in 2017, this seems like the best deal. Sat next to a couple that was dressed to the nines about to go to the theatre - at lunch. And it added to the charm and the fantasy of it - Paris in the middle of Midtown, starched white napkins in the middle of the day. But fantasies are just good for a minute sometimes.

2.0,7/13/2017,"While I can't judge the authenticity of the food served at Benoit, my dinner here was underwhelming.My family made a reservation here for dinner on a weekday night because my parents knew this was an Alain Ducasse restaurant. The interior of the restaurant resembles a typical bistro found in Paris, with tiled floors, large mirrors and dim lighting. The staff are friendly and helpful. They offered us some complimentary cheese puffs while we were looking at our menus. They seem to know their roles inside and out, demonstrating the French hospitality. Unfortunately, the food here was disappointing.We started off with some French onion soup and a dozen escargots. The French onion soup was very flavorful, it was packed with onions and bread and topped with melted cheese. Unfortunately, I felt that there was too much cheese making every bite very chewy. I found myself trying to get rid of the cheese so I can get a mouthful of just the onions and soup. But without the cheese, the broth was very salty. I didn't get to try the escargots but I was surprised it didn't come in its shells. For our mains, we shared a poulet roti (chicken) for two and the roasted cod. The presentation of the chicken was very nice but it tasted just like a regular rotisserie chicken, nothing special. It comes with pommes frites (fries) and I found myself eating more of them than the chicken. It was also stated on the menu that the portion was for two people but even with three of us, there was more than half the chicken left, so I definitely recommend sharing just the single serving if you're having appetizers too. The roasted cod was very nicely presented. The mango/ passionfruit rougaille sauce was quite interesting but the cod didn't taste very fresh. The texture was also quite rubbery. I didn't think it was worth the price we paid.Lastly, we had the vanilla mille feuille for dessert. The pastry was overly flakey and the vanilla mousse tasted very one dimensional. It was boring and a bigger pain to eat.I left the restaurant feeling more of a need to try the Benoit in Paris but the one in New York unfortunately does not do Alain Ducasse justice.",2,1,0,Jacqueline C.,"New York, NY",421,209,372
3.0,6/27/2017,"KenScale: 7.5/10""Oh man, I thought the escargots were going to be served inside the shells. Now I don't get to ply them out from the shells."" My wife Jun was bummed the moment she saw the escargots already plucked from their shells. I have seen escargots served either inside or outside of shells in different French restaurant (actually, my preference is servings outside of shells since I don't have to risk burning my hands with the extremely hot shells). What mattered for me was that the escargots that the kitchen at Benoit served us didn't have the level of smooth, chewy texture that I would normally expect from a classic French bistro. Actually, our meal at Benoit, a bistro owned by the acclaimed chef Alain Ducasse (although it's uncertain how much involved he is in day-to-day affairs at the kitchen), on a recent Friday evening had one common theme: lack of sound texture.The menu at Benoit is more or less a straightforward assortment of French bistro classics. New York City certainly has a great number of awesome French restaurants showcasing traditional dishes of the country that has often been considered the culinary leader in the Western civilization. I'm not sure I would give that distinction to Benoit. Sure, tarte flambee, that Alsatian thin crust flatbread with onions and bacon had predictably delicious flavor, but the escargots that came in garlic and parsley butter turned out to be overly buttery while lacking the optimal level of texture as I had noted above. I distinctly remember ordering sweet spiced Rohan duck breast at medium rare (Jun and I both love duck dishes, especially in the juicy, tender state cooked at that level), but I had to wonder after taking the first bite of the meat whether the kitchen mistakenly brought a well-done dish. The texture of the duck was so underwhelmingly tough that I focused my meal more on the king salmon accompanied by seasonal vegetables and Béarnaise sauce, even while Jun, whose favorite meat is duck, continued to march on the poultry. King salmon itself was quite aptly cooked medium rare, on the other hand, although I couldn't remember much beyond the texture that made this dish particularly special compared to other outstanding seafood dishes I've had elsewhere in the city. Even the dessert lacked the textural attribute it is supposed to have; when we ordered chocolate soufflé accompanied by pistachio sorbet, we were expecting silky smooth texture of the inside that would melt in our mouth. What we got instead was a surprisingly dull dish that lacked any textural punch to give us satisfaction. Jun, who certainly knows a thing or two about sweet dishes, actually got pretty irritated at the end that the kitchen could bring a soufflé of this quality. Getting a reservation at Benoit is pretty manageable, and the restaurant was not nearly full even during peak hours on a Friday evening. It probably doesn't help that the restaurant, despite its charming décor making you think you're sitting at a café somewhere in Paris, is located nearby the stale neighborhood of Midtown West stuck between Columbus Circle and Times Square. There is full bar with extensive French-centric wine selections. I was hoping to find a gem at Benoit, which has already gone through multiple chef turnovers since its opening, but it seems like these turnovers are rather hurting the consistency of execution in putting together sound French bistro classics.",5,1,2,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738

I spoke to Maitre d who was very understanding and very new on the job and told him that it was not right that the waiter did not inform us of the ""market price"" when he told us the special.  Would I still have ordered it if he told me it would be $85?  Absolutely not!

This is nothing close to it.)It started when we were first seated at the table reserved under our name -- the manager came over and ""asked"" us to move to a smaller table -- and went downhill from there. We were moved from a lovely table tucked near the back corner of the large dining room to a smaller table in a tight space smack in the busy center of the room.Then after waiting for a long time for service, it took us asking -- literally -- 5 different staff people if we could order. Each staff person said ""yes"" with a cheery smile, then disappeared never to be seen again. (Especially odd since our new table was in the middle of a high-traffic area.) No one waiter seemed to be responsible for our table the entire time we were there. After our meal, we waited another endless length of time before asking (again, multiple staff) repeatedly for our check and waiting even longer to receive said check. The food was fine, nothing memorable.In a city with plenty of great brunch options, there's no need to come here for food that is simply fine when the service -- even at its most basic level -- is far below sub-par.

The duck was ok-nothing special, but then again, I prefer a crispy duck and this was skinless. I have enjoyed many non-crispy duck servings, though, and this--with its flavor and sauce--rated about average. At least the duck came with vegetables, however, which is more than I can say for my daughter's filet mignon. It sat unadorned--with no offer made by the waitstaff to add side dishes.The pate--another appetizer-- was bland and lackluster. Probably the worst pate I have ever tasted. My daughter agreed.Yet...there are highlights: The wait service, despite a few language barriers, are superb. The wine steward was also attentive and knowledgeable.

3.0,4/30/2016,"It was the second time we dined at Benoit tonight. The first time, it was a very pleasant experience--we ordered the classic and safe choices as well (mine the cassoulet and my partner the salmon. The cassoulet was indeed the best in town. We dined at Cafe d'Alsace regularly, and traveled to Montreal and Paris just for food many times; however, it may be one of those unhealthy dishes that you just can't resist once in a while.) But this evening, I really in the mood of lamb, their special tonight, and had something lighter tonight. So I toggled between the choice of classic cassoulet and the lamp chops. So even having asked the waiter twice about how the lamb chops are being prepared, I went for the lamb chops. Finally, I was disappointed by the lamp chops--for $52, I got a total of 3 small chops with meat no more than 4 oz in total even though the waiter did indicate it would be a portion of 8-9 oz of lamb (may be including the bone then.) To be fair to the waiter, when I asked, he did indicate that the portion would be small and clarify that they were not double chops. Anyway, I thought for $52 (vs. their regular dishes ranging from $28-35), the lamb dish shouldn't be too bad. As a result, I found the portion so small that I was reluctant to share a portion of my dish with my partner (we normally share our dishes for tasting. He would give me some of his dish, normally fish or something lighter, to taste. But, for tonight, if I share, it would leave me only 2 oz of meat for my entree.) When the waiter checked in with us, I was very honest to him as well, and he didn't do anything to it (keep in mind that we ordered two cocktails before dinner, a bottle of Burgundy red, bottled water, two appetizers, two entrees, and dessert, the bill before tips was more than $300 for two).Nonetheless, the dinner was okay, the lamb was good, but nothing to write about. I had it better at Becco, Table d'Hote, Lavagna, JoJo, Jean George, or even outside of NYC, e.g., in Lake Placid. Union Square Cafe had a very good lamb chop dish as well, but I had the same problem there once. The waiter at USC did revise the bill and charge us only 1/2 of my dish after asking me how was my dinner (also their price was only about $39 for the lamb chops).Anyway, next time if I go there, I would just go for the classic dishes.

3.0,3/7/2016,"My husband and I needed a quick bite to eat before a show we were seeing at The City Center just down the block. The Indian restaurant we wanted was closed so we decided to try Benoit right across the street. Much better choice. Benoit is very beautiful and elegant. I had the chicken and frites and my husband had the salmon. Both were delicious but the salmon dish seemed a tad skimpy for the money. Luckily the frites that came with my dish were enough to feed an army. My chicken was also enormous so at least he didn't leave hungry. We were too stuffed for dessert, but ordered a mochaccino just because. Dinner with 2 drinks came to about a hundred twenty bucks with tip so if you're looking for cheap, keep looking.

3.0,2/15/2016,"Disappointing overall - not what the recent New York Times review led us to expect.Despite the 3 degree temps outside, four of us went for Valentine's Day brunch featuring a $65 prix fixe menu. It started well. Service was friendly and the restaurant was charming and cozy, just the neighborhood bistro we expected. The bread basket and gougeres came. They were a nice mix of lemon bread, croissants, and rolls, but a little dry and served cold. We tried three different entrees. The Club Benoit, a multilayered sandwich with slices of chicken breast and smoked salmon, served with salad on the side,was delicious. It turned out to be the best entree on the menu. Two of us ordered Steak and Fries. The fries were crisp and lovely, but the hanger steaks were tiny, 2""x4"" in size, and under seasoned. They looked lost and lonely on their serving plates. The Scrambled Eggs with Truffles came in a bowl, looking like yellow porridge with dark specks and tasting bland. Adjacent tables complained about the Soufflé with Lobster which looked like inverted bowls of pudding with dollops of lobster on top. One diner said it tasted floury, a bit like a crepe.We ordered both dessert options to share. The Ms Berry/Mr Chocolate were layers of cake and mousse - one raspberry, the other chocolate. They were moist and satisfying although the berry cake was a neon pink that bordered on being garish. The Chocolate Eclair was a mistake. Its passion fruit cream filling didn't work well with the chocolate and left a vague, unpleasantly sour taste in the mouth. The coffees and lattes, however, were very good.Yes, we had champagne - a bottle of La Caravelle Brut Rose - to share.

When we did, he and everyone else was attentive and knowledgeable , but the restaurant seemed to be a bit understaffed of servers, with a full house and not enough to attend appropriately to each table.  That said, there are worse problems having than too many customers!  Benoit is a splurge (for me at least) but a worthwhile and a romantic one.",0,0,0,Ele D.,"Queens, NY",1,55,10

3.0,1/4/2016,"Benoit is the second Alain Ducasse restaurant I've sampled on a Christmas day, away from home. The last time was over a decade ago at Spoon in London, a forward thinking and precious restaurant that owed a great debt to Ferran Adria's refinement of molecular gastronomy.    Benoit, on the other hand, is looking steadfastly backward-and that is not at all a bad thing. Ducasse is attempting the Keith McNally trick of opening a classic French Bistro that aims to appear as if it had always been there...in Midtown. Ducasse should have gotten McNally's decorator, because while Benoit is a lovely evocation of a classic haute bistro, it simply looks brand new, more or less. I love that is glowingly gold and beautifully lit and open and my wife and I enjoyed the charming caricatures of (presumably) famous French personalities from another era. The fin de siecle era champagne posters are beautiful, but maybe trying too hard? Ditto for the handsome brass coat racks with ""luggage"" strewn on top.    As mentioned, Paige and I had Christmas lunch here, so there was a prix fixe menu that offered a decent array of options. My lovely wife started with the VGF consumme', which was pastry topped mini-tureen of veal consumme' enriched with foie gras and duck meat and she loved it-her new preference for ""under-the -weather-need-soup"" situations. Her roast organic chicken was enormous and delicious and came with textbook frites that were enough for three hungry people. I started with a lobster salad with fingereling potatos and frisee; perfectly cooked, if a tad bland. My steamed loup de mer, however, was not only silken in texture but redolent of the aromatics and broth that accompanied the tender fish in the cast iron brassier.    My sweet had an upside-down pineapple tarte that was delicious while my white chocolate opera was overly sweet but otherwise nice.    Service was very friendly and fairly efficient or such a busy day ( the place was packed with mostly families with children) and I (as usual) wich Yelp allowed half stars because I would definitely add one to my rating.

You spend the first few minutes snacking on Benoit's gougères and baguette slices served in a floppy, red sack. Peruse the menu but take my advice - The Celery Root Rémoulade, Curried Crab & Apple is refreshing and the curry control is beautifully light. Crispy Pied De Cochon, Tartar Sauce has an addicting, masculine chew to it. The Tarte Flambée is a fun nibble for the table but be wary of getting full off this because other menu items deserve the spotlight. Plan to pack most of it to-go or share with a party of four or more. Pâté en Croûte served with a bucket of endless cornichons and pearl onions was memorable. Just a classic, beautiful order worth your time and money, especially if someone at the table is already drinking a red. The Foie de Veau was incredibly rich, but I'd come back to see why every other table was ordering that chicken...Also, the ""White Truffle Experience"" lasts until the end of December.

3.0,7/17/2015,"6/10This is my second time coming to Benoit. Not sure if I came back for the food or because it is close to my office building. More so the latter.The price is more reflective of the location rather than the food. It is on par with some of the Michelin rated restaurants whereas the food/service isn't up to par. We had escargot to start which was good. I would've enjoyed more garlic but the pesto was great as well. I got the loup de mar. It was nicely cooked, but I thought there were some conflicting flavor profiles. The fresh bass taste was muddled by everything else that was going on with the dish. The cassoulet was very heavy and we weren't able to finish it. The beans were great but there was just way too much skin to get through the whole dish. The duck/pork on the dish were tender and fine. Nothing spectacular.The ambiance of the place goes after an old/antique French place. With the somewhat upscale vibe and price tag, you would expect there to be multiple wait staff with timely cleaning and progression through the meal. However, at many points in the meal, there were slip ups because our waitress put on all hats. The most memorable was not cleaning the bread crumbs prior to the entrees being delivered. Instead, I had a mess of breadcrumbs (Yes, I made a mess that day) throughout the entire meal. I don't mean to sound like a snob, but when you eat at a place like this, that is the least you can expect. I'm comparing Benoit on the same level as those other higher end places. There are some better places to go in the area, but if you're craving French, not a terrible choice. Just beware of the $$.

I have to say all of them were just mediocre... The swisschard and lamb raviolis were the best of those, though that's not saying much. The foie gras terrine and steak tartare were much better.

The other point I really liked about the restaurant was the options for Hors d'oeuvre. My party of three shared five and it was a perfect amount. The best two were the Egg mayo and the Crispy Swisschard & lamb ravioles. They were delicious. The main courses for the table included: Steak Frites (Good), Quenelles (Great) and the special halibut (bad). The halibut was a large let down. It seemed out of place compared to the other dishes and lacked substance/taste. We also had a couple cocktails which were ok. The French 75 was poor, but the bourbon drink was pretty good.

No, what was incredible was the low quality and high price of the food. My cassoulet was just gross, burnt on top, mushy and unpleasantly fatty (as opposed to crisp on top, beans properly prepared and properly rendered fats).

Everything was ate was incredible. Our service was magnificent!  Our sommelier was the best we've ever had - he recommended the best bordeaux we've ever had. I may never be able to drink another bottle of wine again. I had the onion soup gratinée, which was perfect. My husband had the maine lobster salad, which was amazingly fresh and crisp. It was like it they had a summer yard outside and picked the lettuce there and then served it seconds later.  (We have a garden, we know what fresh picked lettuce tastes like, and by God, that lettuce wedge tasted like it had just been picked.)  My husband had a duck for his entrée; it may have been a special. It was exquisite. We cannot ever we duck anywhere else. Ever. It was the best duck we've ever had. It makes us sad for all the other people in the world who think they've had good duck, because they really have not. It was just amazing - tender and flavorful, but the skin left on, leaving it a little crispy on the outside. It's why I know God loves carnivores just a little more than vegetarians, because he creates experiences like that for us.I had the filet mignon aux poivres with peppercorn sauce, and it was the best filet mignon I've ever had.

Tonight, I enjoyed the choice of appetizer or first course and choice of entrees. The 2 small soft shell crab was well prepared in buttery sauce on buttery potatoes.The rabbit porchetta as an appetizer was served on shaved or slivered caramelized carrots with mini carrots.I am very pleased that I switched my dessert for another salad - beet salad.  Thank you for doing that.  So skipped dessert in this pre-fixed dinner.",0,0,0,Bing R.,"New York, NY",149,544,3265

2.0,7/28/2014,"Came here for a business lunch, and it was the slowest service for lunch that I have ever experienced, paired with some of the most mediocre food in the same genre.  The waiter raved about the special of the day, halibut with roasted tomato stuffed with Parmesan.  I opted for the special, and another at our table ordered the loup de mer, after learning it was sea bass.  It was difficult to remember the last time I had such a bland rendition of halibut.  Highly disappointing, and we waited probably a full hour for the entrees to come out after a long lull between having our orders taken and receiving appetizers.  For an appetizer, escargot was nothing memorable - just decently done for a French restaurant, and the cheese was similar to the sort one might pick out from a grocery store.  Not bad, but certainly not special.  It then took them twenty minutes to ask whether we wanted dessert after clearing the entrees, and we opted to share over some coffee.  The desserts were probably the best part of the meal.  The raspberries in the financier tasted extraordinarily fresh, as though fresh-picked.   We were told the souffle would take twenty minutes to make, which is not unusual, but it would have been nice for them to remind us as soon as entrees were cleared so we had a chance to decide.  All in all, a very expensive, mediocre, and poorly serviced lunch.  Never again if I can avoid it.",3,0,2,Lu H.,"New York, NY",1218,411,1977

Unfortunately, the air conditioner was not fully operational the night we went which made for an uncomfortably humid beginning. But service was impeccable. Meal highlights were the lamb's brain which the chef sent out as a starter (delicate and delicious) and the framboisier (a lovely raspberry dessert with layers of pastry and cream -- beautifully presented, perfectly tart and sweet.)

5.0,5/17/2014,"Being that I've had the pleasure of experiencing Alain Ducasse's masterpiece cuisine at his opulent Louis XV restaurant in the Hotel de Paris in Monte Carlo, I was not expecting anything short of spectacular. This restaurant reminds me of the grande cafe's all over France...rich beautiful decor but with a somewhat relaxed feel of the clientele. However the serving staff always on point and excellent.Benoit starts you off with a mini platter of housemade cheese bread...like light cloud puffs and deliciously cheesy through every bite, I could have stood to have another 3 plays if just these. You are also served a little red cloth sachet of bread with a side of sweet cream butter. Off to a great start..For our appetizer we opted for 5 selections of hors d'oeuvres: the egg mayonnaise, the marinated mushrooms & pearl onions, asparagus done 2 ways, foie gras terrain, and rillette on toast points. The egg mayonnaise was done in two styles, half as a deviled egg with piped silky yolk that had been mixed with mayo and the other half just dressed with a herb infused mayonnaise on top of it. The former version reminds me of how egg mayonnaise is served in Ireland (I know we're in a French joint lol)...the latter how we Americans know egg mayonnaise to be, both very decadent and delicious regardless. The marinated mushrooms & pearl onions were a great accompaniment to cut the richness from the eggs as well as the amazingly delicious foie gras terraine served warm...the terrain had a slightly sweet wine sauce enveloping it in the small ramekin it was served in, just so silly smooth and buttery. Seriously who can mess up asparagus, half were cooked the other half fresh and so delicious. The rilette was very subtle in flavor but nicely balanced.For entree we selected the ""Classic of the month"" Vol-au-Vant and the Scottish Salmon Grand Mere. Vol-au-Vant being Sweetbreads were served generously plated surrounding a tall puff pastry with crisp asparagus and Oregon morels in a light veal reduction sauce. The Sweetbreads were a bit heavily breaded but fried to perfection. The asparagus and morels were a nice subtle flavor combo for the delicate Sweetbreads. The puff pastry was also a nice light and buttery accompaniment. The salmon grand mere was served with marbled potatoes, pearl onions and champignons de Paris mushrooms. My dinner guest said the salmon dish was the best they have ever had in a long time and everything was cooked perfectly.For dessert, since we're both fatty's :) and can't resist, we ordered the strawberry & rhubarb tart and the Benoit profiteroles for 2. The tart was simply served with a chilled sweet cream on the side and it was so delicious with the right amount of bite from the rhubarb. The profiteroles were elaborately served with a warm pot of chocolate sauce, individual portions of vanilla bean ice cream, skewers and 10 mini cold sweet cream filled cream puffs. The puffs were so light and melt in your mouth it was heaven in each bite. Service was fantastic, each course just exceptional, ambience lovely, I wouldn't expect anything less that has the Ducasse name associated with it. Will definitely be back for for more.",3,1,3,Jenn S.,"Point Lookout, NY",690,793,1628

The Duck Foi Gras with rhubarb chutney and toasted Parisienne brioche was yummy and filling. The Escargots with butter and garlic was the best escargot I've ever had. Even the Duck Foie Gras was the best I've ever had! I ordered the roasted organic chicken with garlic cloves and pommel frites. The Chef came out and showed it to me first to make sure it was too my liking. Yes! Yes! Juicy, wonderfully prepared in an iron skillet.Then came the dessert. The baba to die for. The vanilla millefeule to die for. The patisserie parisienne, heaven. Even the restrooms were fun. Very small with an old charm. Service was charming. Wine was delicious.

I wasn't mentally prepared to go to such a fancy place (I was wearing multicolored Nike sneakers) so excuse me for finding this place to be a bit pretentious.The gougeres blew our minds and reassured us that we aren't fancy enough for this place. My friend said it tasted like a Cheez-It and that's all I could think of after. Delicious though.We were very hungry and wanted appetizers but don't know French food well enough to order so we ordered the crab cocktail to start and we both thought it was pretty awful. It was a cylinder of crab meat doused in lime with even some pieces of inner shell mixed in. Not good. For my entree I had a grilled salmon. I asked for it medium and I found it a bit overdone but a I didn't mind because the seasoning was done well.

4.0,3/20/2014,"Benoit is Alain Ducasse's Parisian styled bistro that makes you feel like you stepped back onto the Continent. Although the beautiful interior evokes a bygone era, the food is an updated take on traditional French cuisine. Four of us selected from the Restaurant Week dinner menu which limited the choices to 3 appetizers, 3 entrees and 3 desserts. Price-wise it comes pretty close to Benoit's Pre-Theater 3 course pre-fixe menu. My salmon gravlax appetizer was a great start to the meal. It balanced well with the bottle of Rhone Viognier I had selected for us. My mouth is watering while I type this!My Brook trout filet à la Meunière entree was moist and delicious. It was lightly floured and sautéed. Lighter, tastier and not overdone like I had in France. I was glad I picked this because the other entree selections were a heavy looking roast loin of pork and Moules Mariniere, and I don't care for mussels. Dessert was a selection of colorful petit macaroons. It seems weird that I've never eaten macaroons (aside from the store packaged macaroon cookies). Alan L had told me to run out and try macaroons soon, and I'm glad I did! I think my friends were a bit envious that I lucked out with my three dinner selections. I'm biased but I felt my choices were the best of Benoit's Restaurant Week menu!Service was on par with what one would expect of a good French restaurant. Timing was impeccable, the sommelier appeared when needed, water was always replenished without asking, plates came and went with precision. Only my coffee could have come faster and along with my dessert. Patrons here were definitely dressed to go out and enjoy the evening with ""most"" of the men wearing jackets.

Having never been here before I was first struck with the lovely decorative parisien style interior and inviting atmosphere, out table was large for a party of four and the service throughout the meal could not be faulted, everything seemed timed like clockwork for a relaxing three course meal and you get the impression the staff are well drilled and on top of everything.On to the menu; the restaurant week menu was typical - a choice of three appetizers, entrees and desserts. My entree was Salmon Gravlax with fingerling potatoes which was delicious, however I was slightly disappointed that there was perhaps not a classic French Onion soup on offer. The entree was the loin of pork with creamy pollenta which was very nice but nothing to write home about, and I see it has now been replaced (I wish I had opted for the moules marinere and was envious of the other diner in our party who had). The french pastry dessert was delicious as was the selection of mini macaroons, to me the best dish of the meal. The wine was a reasonably priced and delicious vigognier that complemented all three dishes.All in all a nice meal, though I would have been somewhat disgruntled at having to pay anything over the restaurant week price for the same overall menu.",3,0,4,Howard B.,"Manhattan, NY",43,51,29

You really do feel like you are in Paris. Food: Right away the waiter arrived to take our drink order.

A staff person brings out the whole chicken in a pan to show you, before cutting it up for serving. And, when I tell you this was the most succulent, delicious chicken, you must believe me. It comes with a head of roasted garlic and a basket of delicious pommes frites! We ordered steamed green beans on the side too. I work in the area and have lived in NYC for quite some time.

The decor was beautiful and the service was attentive, but the food was so lackluster.The mache salad was nice, though the black truffles were completely indiscernible from the leafy greens. After doing a little reading the issue might be with them being the wrong kind of truffles, or perhaps that they weren't cooked beforehand, but either way they were tasteless. The lobster bisque was good, but very understated. We waited 45 minutes for our entrees to come out. We were good sports about it, fine dining is meant to be savored and we were in a nice atmosphere. We both ordered the filet mignon in a bordelais sauce, which is supposed to be a demi-glace with butter and shallots and other delicious things. The sauce was bland, but more unfortunate was the steak itself. Completely unseasoned and very tough for a filet, it actually tasted more like a sirloin and required a lot of back and forth with the knife. The potatoes it came with were good, the ""frites"" were just skinny french fries, and the haricot verts were completely overcooked to the point of being mushy. For $17 I also added foie gras to my steak. It was hands down the highlight of the meal, but unfortunately it was a SLIVER (see my photo). It was my first time having foie gras, so I didn't feel comfortable asking if that was the appropriate amount for the price, but I was let down. We waited another 20 minutes for our desserts to come out, only to see a table that had been seated after we arrived receive theirs. By this time we weren't interested in sticking around and really wanted to leave. I flagged down the waiter and told him to forget the dessert, we were fine with paying for it but we had to leave and could he please bring the check. He apologized and said he knew it was taking awhile, that he'd already spoken to the manager about it. They came out a moment later but I still asked for the check. I took two bites on my way out (was not impressed). He did offer me another $18 glass of champagne, which didn't make sense to me because clearly I want to leave, not stay longer. My original glass wasn't comped, which would have been a nicer offer considering our sub-par meal took two hours from start to finish.

Although Benoit has been on my radar since it first opened and I somehow always find myself passing by it, I wasn't tempted enough to visit until I found out about its unlimited pastry/dessert brunch menu for less than $20 a person. Even before we sat down, my eyes found themselves from gazing around the half-empty dining room to the dessert menu already sitting on every table. A quick glance at the regular brunch menu made it so much easier to decide on the unlimited dessert menu. With our healthy appetite, we managed to navigate our way through eleven out of the twelve available desserts on the menu. The reason we didn't try the twelfth one (a chocolate mousse) was that it sold out already. To my pleasant surprise, only two of the items we tried were less than stellar. Most importantly, many of the desserts were well-balanced in terms of flavors and sweetness. Some of my favorites include the Fraisier, Saint Honore (don't' let the foreign names intimidate you), Red Berry Charlotte, and the Chocolate Raspberry Tart. As plates of dessert continued to arrive at our table, the friendly patrons at the next table kept expressing their collective disbelief.

Luckily I knew I was getting the steak frites and my ""date"" was getting the roast chicken.   After three attempts to flag down a waiter, we had our orders taken.  What was odd was he said ""Oh, I saw your menus were gone so I assumed you ordered"".  Um, okay.My steak was pretty good, I ordered it medium but the ends were a little over done.  It was still fine and fries were good.  The roast chicken looked great but my date said it was a little dry.  However, since it was a half chicken he couldn't finish it so he did take the rest home.Overall a decent place if you want to drop $80 for dinner for two people with no drinks (I had water, my date had Diet Coke).   The service was weird but if I have a craving for steak frites, I would go back since this is only a block and a half from my apartment.  And to be honest, I'd love to fill a jacuzzi tub with their cheese puffs, jump into it and then eat my way out.",3,4,1,Bill T.,"New York, NY",1361,2290,9300

Only people frequenting here are those who haven't been exposed to quality French food or are more interested in atmosphere. First the wine recommended by the sommelier was bland and flat and when we voiced our concern she responded ""you said you didn't want something spicy"". No we said we didn't care for the Malbec you recommended it didn't mean we wanted a watered down Pinot. The escargot was probably the biggest disappointment it had absolutely no flavor and the saucy was barely existed so the snails actually tasted tough. My quenelle literally looked and tasted like someone placed two clam cakes in a bowl and poured canned lobster bisque over them there was no authenticity to the sauce. My boyfriend's cannella came with cuts of ribs that were so fatty he was having a difficult time finding edible pieces. I would venture a guess that there are no French chefs cooking in that kitchen or producing authentic sauces instead their just cranking out imitation items. Even the ""Valentine's Day Menu"" was a rip off and we heard several other diners complaining about how the prices were higher on that menu compared to the regular one. Weird thing is after the meal me and my boyfriend both felt sick almost as if we had eaten something bad. We even felt sick the next morning too and that memory alone would keep someone from returning.In terms of food the only positive note was duck foie gras which was excellent (should be for $26) and came with a flakey brioche bun. The decor is beautiful and the restaurant is very well laid out. We found all our servers to be attentive and knowledgeable (except for the sommelier). I just can't get over the prices they are charging for subpar food but I understand some people dine out for the ambiance rather than taste. Our bill came to $150 for a small carafe of wine, 2 appetizers and 2 entrees.

So uniform were their appearance, I was left with the impression they came out of a frozen box of prepared COSTCO appetizers. The menu is as it should be for a French Bistro; all the expected choices and then some.  So far so good.  We chose the roast chicken for two served with frites.  On the side, an order of Haricot Vert.  Our server told us they were delicious and really fresh tasting.  Much was made of the presentation of the chicken.  They bring it out for you to view as if it's truly a special offering.  It's then brought back to the kitchen to be cut up. Only it wasn't so special.  It was roast chicken.  Nothing more.  It obviously wasn't seasoned.  So, while juicy enough, it lacked deep and intense flavor. It was served with a baked half head of garlic.  Too bad it wasn't used in the preparation..  A fresh sprig of rosemary was added as a final touch for presentation.  On the other hand, the frites was quite good. The Haricot Vert was over cooked and made with a ton of butter.  Not the usual presentation, and not really good either.  The dessert cart choices looked like the pastries you'd find in any run of the mill pastry and sandwich shop here in the city.

Plates range in price a lot - the cheaper ingredient plates are cheap, the expensive one are expensive. The prix fixe is an excellent deal. On the dessert list, the 2 choices from the dessert cart for $8 is also a steal. The crowd when we go (usually earlier) leans very old in the dining room. The wine list is great and has a lot of good values from Southern France (Languedoc). Also a lot of wines by the glass ranging from downright cheap (had a picpoul for $9, good pour too!) to very expensive (1 oz pours for $40). This isn't a destination restaurant, but if you are going to a show or find yourself in midtown it's an excellent option.",4,0,4,Ethan A.,"Manhattan, NY",66,34,0

I recently had the oysters followed by a steak tartare. My wife had the sea bass. Both were scrumptious. We had profiteroles for dessert with an excellent espresso.This place is a bit pricey, but the room is beautiful and the service excellent. So why 4 stars instead of 5?? Well, this isn't Daniel or Nobu, which I would consider the benchmarks for 5 stars.

1.0,11/7/2012,"FoodFood was good, no complain about it.ServiceWe were a group of 8 people who dined at Benoit on Thursday Nov 8.  Since we didn't have a reservation, the host told us that the wait would have been 30 mins to get the table.  Therefore, we waited at the bar.  We ordered two bottles of wine and some appetizers.  After 30 mins the host informed us that we had to wait an additional 30 mins.  However, in the end we waited 90 mins to get the table.  Very poor time management.  In the meantime, the coat of a person in our group was stolen while we were waiting at the bar.  The host, the bartender and the manager looked around the restaurant but didn't find it.  Despite that fact, we still decided to dine at Benoit because we had waited for so long.  At the table, the waiter (I don't remember his name, but he wears black glasses) had a bad attitude.  He was very pushy, wanting us to order as much as we could (to get a higher tip, obviously).  We already had 2 bottles of wine and some appetizers at the bar, plus we were upset for the stolen coat, hence we just ordered a main course each and a bottle of wine.  An example of his bad service: we asked 3 times to get some more bread, but he didn't bring it to us.  We had to ask it to the Maitre.  When the bill came, we were charged the full amount.  I would have excepted that a well-known restaurant would have placed customer satisfaction as his first priority.  Unfortunately this was not the case (the first priority was to make some few extra bucks).  I asked the Manager if we could be compensated for the inconvenience of the stolen coat (taking off a bottle of wine from the bill, or offering a couple of desserts would have been a nice gesture).  He said he couldn't do anything.  I found his behavior rude and disrespectful, a behavior that does not acknowledge our business (we decided to stay despite the coat was stolen).  Just to give you another example, at Café Boulud, someone took my umbrella and after I explained it to the Manager, he  immediately offered me a complimentary dessert. While the food was well prepared, the entire experience was ruined by the very disappointing service, lack of attention to customer needs and arrogant attitude.OverallAt the end of the dinner someone magically found the coat (my guess is that the person who took it decided to give it back).  This obviously mitigated the bad experience we had.  However, we cannot forget how we have been treated, how unprofessional was the waiter and how disrespectful was the Manager.  We won't come back.",1,3,1,stefano d.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0
4.0,10/14/2012,"So after our exquisite lunch at Le Bernardin, celebrating the beginning of our reunion, me and my two gal pals walked all over the midtown area drinking in the city.  V. had made us a reservation at Benoit, a very traditional French Bistro, perfect for a relaxed first dinner.We started with 3 small plates, which can be had for $12.  Each of us selected one of the options.  V. chose the Egg Mayo, which is apparently is one of their specialties.  It was good, but not really at all out of the ordinary.  The presentation, with one egg half turned yolk up and the other yolk down, was a little odd.  K chose the eggplant caviar, which came with croutons to spread it on.  It had a lovely, not overly pureed texture, a little eggplant bite and lots of garlic flavor.  Very good.  I have to say though that my choice, the rabbit porchetta, was the tastiest.  I've only had pork porchetta before.  This rabbit version was perfectly seasoned and whimsically tiny (only about 2"" in diameter.  As tasty as it was, I came to the conclusion that porchetta should be made of pork, because you need the fat.  Rabbit is a little lean, even the belly, so can't carry as much flavor.We then shared the Charcuterrie Plate ($22) which consisted of San Daniel ham (A), sopressata style sliced sausage, sliced so thin one could barely get enough on one's tongue to really taste it (B-), some kind of a cooked and shredded veal pate with the texture of tuna fish salad, but a good mix of salt, pepper and garlic that almost redeemed it (B), and then the star of the whole night in my opinion, a slice of multilayered smoked (?) tongue alternated with foi gras mousse... heavenly and beautiful (A+)  This plate came with a crock of cornichons and pickled onions, a great dijon, and a small serving of potato salad, which was very bland, and had an odd crunchy element every so often, that seemed kind of like toasted bread crumbs.We also shared a Salade Nicoise ($24), which was very traditional - good, but nothing to write home about.  They also provided complementary cheese puffs, which I think were supposed to be gougeres, but were more like savory doughnut holes with a little bit of cheesiness.Just as we were contemplating whether or not we had to add a sweet ending, the table next to us (as we later discovered a family of Austrians) turned to us with about 1/3 of a tarte tatin they couldn't finish, and asked if we'd like it.  We said yes.  What a lovely surprise.  Probably not very New York of them to offer or us to accept, but great fun.Food: 34/40Service: 17/20Atm/Intang:  18/20Value:  17/20Overall:  86/100=B=4*",9,7,8,Diane B.,"Moss Beach, CA",306,361,637

First, we had an Indian waitress that insisted on speaking with a laughable French accent, throwing in a ""merci"" and ""madam"" and ""monsieur"" from time-to-time. It got annoying very fast. Wine glasses were overfilled and when the bottle was empty, no offer for another bottle or glass of wine. I had the Cassoulet and two of my friends had lamb stew. All way too salty. My girlfriend had the skate which was well done. Lastly, the room was way too hot. Overall, the experience was disappointing on all levels.

3.0,4/25/2011,"Just want to stop the madness here and correct a misconception.   La Côte Basque was indeed on this spot for a few years (during a downward spiral towards being closed by the health department), but in it's heyday it was located on 5 E55th Street.  Yes, they brought the paintings and the waiters, but it quickly lost it's mojo and food tates changed.  Benoit is an ok bisto not unlike the lackluster places you will find in Paris.  It's namesake is not much better.  If you really want something special and old style, save your money (don't even consider the wine list!) and go to La Grenouille.  Bring a spouse or a date and remember what fine dining once was.  You must go, if only once.",0,0,0,j s.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0

2.0,3/21/2011,"What is it about Midtown that makes the dining/drinking options so reprehensible? Is it because people will flock to this area regardless (for tourism, employment, and the Apple Store), so restaurateurs feel they don't have to try? Does it have something to do with the Abercrombie store (I think that would make anything suck)? Is it that expensive/poor quality food is actually what people want? I don't get it. Anyway, Benoit is the epitome of Midtown. Despite the ""celebrity"" chef tie-in, it's lazy. The atmosphere (French bistro! How unique!) is lazy, the menu is boring and uninspired, yet extremely expensive. When you order a couple of drinks, they bring you a basket of puff pastry! How nice, you might think, until you learn that the basket of puff pastry is essentially a basket of phyllo that has been cooked...with nothing in it (except possibly a hint of cheese). Totally lazy. And for a French restaurant, the wine list (by the glass) is pretty sparse (there are varietals of French white wine other than Chardonnay, Benoit!). The reds are a bit better, but still expensive (when did it become acceptable for the median price of a glass of wine to be $12?).

5.0,11/12/2010,"Benoit had high expectations from the monied locals of the fringes of Midtown and the Upper East Side when it opened on the site of famed local favourite La Côte Basque in early 2008. The 'venerable high society temple of French cuisine', as described by the New York Times had been purveying classical French fine dining on the spot since the late 1950s, an eternity in such a rapidly changing city. Ducasse has kept much and made more of l'histoire and l'heritage of both the site and the venerable French bistrot style typified by the original turn of the century Benoit in Paris. The screen dividers in the light, airy oak panelled room are 19th century Parisien imports, the rotating trolley from a similar period carries desserts such as his signature Rhum Baba and the lightest macaroons round the room and one of the private dining rooms is decorated with authentic decor from a turn of the century apothecary. Modern touches such as the mid century Danish chairs and contemporary tableware fit. Buzzy for lunch even at an early hour, the service was a touch less formal and strained than its neighbour, efficient and attentive, but without excessive ceremony. Delicate, moreish parmesan puffs arrived before my guests did, and almost didn't last until their arrival. The menu is classic bistro. Starters go heavy with terrine and tartes flambee (signature of the Alsatian bias on the menu, likely to change slightly with their new chef as he beds in). I'm a sucker for fat and buttery snails whenever I see them on a menu and these beauties hid under their crouton lids bubbling garlic and parsley, waiting to be mopped up with fresh crusty loaf. It was followed by a faultless steak tartare, chosen from among other rustic mainly meaty treats including a couple of classic steak cuts, roast chicken with garlic, pork chops and an intriguing looking Boudin Aux Pommes, blood sausage served with apples on a bed of green salad.

FOOD:1. CARROT SOUP was delicious. I don't really like carrots (carbs!) but i was really surprised at how much I liked this. it's really plain and light but so tasty. I thik this might have been a seasonal item on the menu so if you're expecting to order this, check first!2. ESCARGOT is okay. i'm picky with my escargot because I like it in the shell, with not too much butter, but more salty & garlicky. this came in the typical escargot plate and drenched in garlicky butter. 3. LAMB was REALLY GOOD. I love lamb chops - only if it's super tender & if the sauce works. this is a really good dish & everyone should try it.4. SCALLOPS were good except they overcooked it a bit (i really hate that). if only it was taken out of the pan like half a second earlier, it would have been so much better.SERVICE: service was great - our waitress was really nice. she was very polite and my wine glass was never empty for more than a minute. she wasn't too fussy but very accomodating.PRICE: I think that this place is actually pretty cheap. I mean, they have a lunch menu that's like $20 each for two people! when we went, it came out to around $70 per person, which I think is not bad for french in midtown.

3.0,3/20/2010,"3.5 stars. It's difficult to be a vegan in a French restaurant, when most items are prepared with butter or cheese.  But the waiter was very accomodating and spoke with the chef to create a salad entree for me...for a high price of course.  Our lunch meal started off with some cold cheese puffs, toasted French bread (score!) and a block of cold butter.  Not bad for the lunch crowd.  My friend went with the $25 lunch prix-fixe and went with the butternut squash soup.  Wow, that soup was piping hot! It went great with the French bread.  Let the carb soak up the orangy goodness.  Then the salmon arrived along with my salad.  The salmon was eloquently dressed up a pastry crusted, while enveloping some diced vegetables.  Details were well attended for this dish.  I appreciated my customized salad; unfortunately, I asked for dressing on the side, but everything was mixed in.  I hoped to have the dish sent back, but apparently, the ""French"" don't keep dressings on the side.  The waiter was being apologetic about it (there was a language barrier), so I didn't want to cause any trouble and ate it anyway.  The dressing was a bit too sour (lemon vinegarette), but I guess I could tell myself at least the salad didn't go into the trash.  Throwing food out might negatively affect my karma.  Finally, there were 3 dessert selections and the cake of the day was this dark chocolate coated cake.  It was quite dense, so it's not really a 'cake' per se.  A dessert. Sorry. My French is poor. The waiter repeated several times during the course of my meal, but the name still didn't stick with me.  Lastly, our meal ended with some spiced nuts and a little bag of meringue to take home.  $25 is a good deal for lunch, considering the salmon costed at that time a la carte.  I'm just a little frustrated with the dressing thing, but maybe I'm a little picky.  But I must applaud the attentive service and all the goodies they probably even for the lunch diners.  Usually, these extras are only offered to the dinner crowd.  As a vegan, I probably won't return, but if you're into French good, it's a reasonable restaurant to visit.",0,0,0,GarGuPi L.,"Flushing, NY",87,496,1696

3.0,2/18/2010,"THIS REVIEW IS SPECIFICALLY FOR THEIR TARTE FLAMBEE:Okay, so when it comes to Tarte Flambées, I am definitely a little bit jaded.  For those uninitiated, a tarte flambée is an Alsatian flat bread with smoked bacon, softened onions, and créme fraîche.  I feel like I'm at work. You see, at The Modern (where I work), our Chef Gabriel Kreuther is Alsatian and his tarte flambée (which made Time Out's list last year) is by far the most popular item on our menu.And if you've never had the Tarte Flambée at The Modern, you really must.  It's like a very thin-crust pizza (don't tell my managers I said that) with just the right amount of smoky bacon balanced with those sweet onions and the slight tartness from the creme fraîche. And because I feel like I've been ruined by Chef Kreuther (I have tried two other flambées in the city with much disappointment), it was with trepidation and curiosity that I went to the French brasserie Benoit, which is strangely just two blocks away from The Modern, specifically to try their tarte flambée.I've never been a fan of these big brasseries.  They strike me as the French man's diner, with menu items all over the place.  And I feel like if you've been to one, you've been to them all (it all seems to be the same few dishes).  But we sat at the bar at Benoit and it did feel very warm and comfortable.And then came the flambée.  I can't help compare it to The Modern's (and if you've tried ours, you would do the same).  First off, it was rectangular instead of round.  The crust was thin, but not as crackery as I come to expect.  The problem was the lack of varied and balanced flavors.  It tasted like white pizza and nothing more.  The bacon was a bit too thick, the onions were not sweet or flavorful enough, and the creme fraîche didn't have that bite I hoped for. There was nothing wrong with this version, but I know how much more spectacular it can be.  Once again, work has ruined me.-eatthisny",0,0,0,Brian H.,"Astoria, NY",41,121,0

I also had the Colorado lamb, which was yummy but slightly overcooked. The potatoes that came with it were yummy.Overall, it was really good and I'd gladly come back.

2.0,2/4/2010,"From a technical viewpoint, the food was very good, yet by the time the meal finally ended, I felt drained and crawling into bed. We had 1:30 reservations and arrived a bit early. I was shocked that the place was packed on a Sunday afternoon. My biggest problem with French food is that it tends to be made well, yet it doesn't POP or leave you wanting more. That was exactly the case at Benoit. The lentil soup was fine, could have taken it or left it. I had a chicken cordon bleu entree, which was supposed to come with the sommeliers choice of wine. Instead, I got a glass of the bottle of red that the hostess was walking around the floor with. The chicken tasted good, but the side of cabbage and mashed potatoes was entirely too small. The desert was this rum-soaked crepe with citrus sherbet. I feel that they didn't let enough of the alcohol burn off because it tasted very strong.By the time this was all said and done, over two hours went by, for LUNCH. Considering all we ate was a small soup, an entree that consisted of one large protein and minimal sides, and a wet crepe. There is no reason we had to spend such a long time there. I really don't see myself going back to Benoit. I would rather eat something edgier and more experimental because I'm always chasing layers of powerful flavors. I can cook-by-numbers at home. All I need is Julia Child's Joy of Cooking and I probably could have cooked the meal myself and eaten it in less time than we spent sitting there.",0,0,2,Rob M.,"New York, NY",4,67,0
4.0,1/30/2010,"Oh Oh OH!!! I loved my goose and pork fat filled lunch here sooo much! This is Monsieur Alain Ducasse's very casual~in comparison to his other restaurants~ bistro, and it did not disappoint!  It reminds me very much of some of my favorite places in Paris.It was a pleasure from beginning to end. The crowd tends to be well-heeled tourists and business folks during the week, but don't let that stop you! Its still a special experience and it was an interesting mixed, young and old, foodie crowd.Its very classic bistro in atmosphere, decor and design, but~and this is why I liked it better that the McNally downtown bunch of bistros~the tables are not shoehorned together and the noise is blessedly under control. Ya could actually do bizness here if you wanted. Or propose....or breakup...but lets stick to the proposal idea, 'kay?Service is perfect and French~a bit fussy so you feel special and looked after.  Professional servers, not staff who wishes they were acting or dancing on Broadway~and, unfortunately, a bit slow....I had to ask a couple of times for this or that. However,  the very nice, but too busy, waiter attend to me as well as he could given the lunch rush and the maitre'd even filled my wine glass once. So this is only a small complaint.Now, I have matured to the point that I just order whatever I want from the menu. See, I cannot be contained by any archaic notion of app-entree-dessert. No, if I want two cold fat filled apps for my lunch, I shall have them! Convention be damned!So, I had the wonderful Lucien pate in croute~which is a huge slab of cold, wonderfully flavorful meat formed into a terrine, wrapped in pastry along with an aspic condiment. Then, I had a huge slab of the most silky but perfectly flavored foie gras I have had in a very long time. It tasted like goose liver, not disguised to tone down the organ meat tang. Just exactly the way it should be. It was served with its own special little brioche, nice touch, and a thick apricot compote.Wine list runs from reasonably priced and good to outrageously expensive, which would be appropriate for the above mentioned business deal or proposal, I imagine. I had a nice shiraz but there was also a nice malbec that I am sure I would have enjoyed.For dessert, I chose a wonderful caramel petit religieuse which is a wonder of French pastry, all creamy and beautiful.The meal was finished with a nice bowl of sugared nuts, which helped sooth paying the rather large bill(you could very happily eat the prix fixe for 35 bucks which looked like a great bargain).Then, at the door, while getting my coat, the greeter handed me a little wax paper bag with a big white Merangue cookie inside!I obviously really loved my lunch here.

Though not really cheap, you won't go home hungry (the two of us even had some left overs to take home).  Despite the so-so entrees, the appetizers and desserts are strong and well-worth a try.",0,0,0,John T.,"Portsmouth, NH",19,50,20

It was so relaxing. We started with drinks in the bar because I wanted to enjoy the music and I wanted to stay there but my friend wanted to sit in the main dining room. We both opted out of the prix-fixe but it looked like a fantastic deal. I started with a Caesar salad and then had the puff pastry crusted salmon. They were both fantastic! The portions were large too. A little too large for me but my friend loved the food so much that he ate his plus most of mine. He started with the escargot then moved on to the cod casserole.

For my appetiser, I ordered the pork cheeks with a frisee and lentil salad. The pork cheeks were extremely tender but slightly under seasoned for my liking. The frisee and lentil salad was a nice and light accompaniment and served to balance the richness of the cheeks. For my entree, I enjoyed the lamb with Dauphinois potatoes.  I especially liked that there was not just one cut of lamb on my plate - there was a lamb chop, a small medallion and a piece of the fillet.  The lamb was cooked perfectly to the requested doneness (medium rare) and was very tender.  The Dauphinois potatoes were also beautifully creamy and rich. To end the meal, we shared the Tarte Tartin. We asked the waitress if we could substitute the creme fraiche which normally accompanies the tart with vanilla ice-cream.  The apples on the tart were meltingly tender and cooked to perfection. I would have liked a bit more pastry but with the creamy vanilla ice-cream, I was pretty happy!  I finished off a very nice meal with a strong cup of espresso.",1,0,1,Irwin H.,"New York, NY",3,1,0

The dish was light and refreshing, and was a great summer starter. For my main course, I had the skate wing meuniere with capers, lemon, tomatoes, and brown butter. The skate was perfectly cooked - slightly brown and crisp on the outside, while the meat stayed moist and succulent. It was delightful. The tangy-ness of the capers and acidity from the lemon also helped cut into the rich and buttery flavors of the skate.For dessert, our server recommended we share the classic tarte tatin.

Absolutely delicious. My husband had a lemon chicken which he also enjoyed.I am not a fan of sweets, but was pleasantly surprised with my choice of dessert...Raspberry vacherin with whipped cream...ice cream frozen as cold as possible without being rock-like in a casing of white, sweet, candy-like substance (I know this does not sounds appetizing, but oh my God was it good, and drizzled with raspberry...topped with whipped cream.I love French food because even though one is full, the food does not lay heavy on the stomach.I enjoyed every delicious bite and highly recommend this establishment to others.",0,0,0,Maura M.,"New York, NY",2,46,0

I searched Yelp and other restaurant sites and found Benoit, a French style bistro on 55th.We decided to sit in the bar on this cool afternoon (my favorite place to sit); we were offered both the bar and dinner menu to choose from and selected the BB Slider, Mini Burger and the Salmon sashimi. They do have an extensive list of drinks and wine and she wanted a glass of Pinot Noir and I a Stella Artois beer. Now, the first thing that I was impressed with was the bar itself. It is made of zinc and very typical of French bistros. Our bartender quickly set up the utensils and shortly later, she served the bread; Benoit uses a heavy cloth pouch to carry the bread to the guest, toasted and warm. Soon, food in front of us, we started the tasting and sharing. The BB Slider is made from blood sausage and was protein sweet and crispy on the outside: something very different. The mini burger was not ""mini"" by any measure and cooked to medium-rare as we had requested. And, the salmon was fresh, finely chopped with dill and honey on a narrow crostini. Fresh ingredients, simple plate presentation and cooked to our liking, everything was good. Benoit is an average value for your dollar. It is a nice reproduction of a modern style of bistro and a fresh departure from the familiar French haunts like Balthazar. The food was straight forward and fresh.

4.0,5/1/2008,"Benoit starts with a vestibule where no less than 3 hostesses greet you.  To the immediate left is the bar, where tall bar stools and tables fit trios.  The bar counter is plated in chrome and the ceiling has a glass rendition of a classic angel on cloud painting.   Straight ahead is the main dining room.  In light brown wood with arial floret lamps and partitioned booths, await white linen lined tables.  On this particular evening, at 6pm, the dining room was completely empty and the staff stood anxiously for the crowd to show up.Everywhere there are signs that Benoit is in the process of discovering itself.  The liquor license has not been acquired yet and as such, the bar shelves find themselves empty, making the current bar more of a waitroom than anything.  There is anxiousness and an eagerness to please, reflected in the staff's resplendiscent black vest over white shirt, black pant and to the ankle white apron, all highlighted by the red tie.  The ratio staff to clientele on this particular evening was close to 3 to 1 though it did balance out closer to 1 to 1 by the time we left.Giselle and I were grabbing an early pre-dinner dinner.  Really, we wanted to see what the newest member of the Ducasse family was like.  Soon after we were seated (sans reservations), we were served a little plate of the house cheese puffs.  Ducasse does not skimp on the cheese and despite being light and airy, the cheese puffs are delicious and were gone in two bites.  It bode well for the rest of the evening.  We both started with the egg mayo and both had to agree that it has to be one of the best egg mayo we've had anywhere.  The mayo is obviously homemade and is the shade of a very light mustard.  It's rich but not overly so.  And at $1, it's a definite must.  We followed that by a dozen of the escargots.  Here we were let down.  The escargots came with croutons on top but the lack of butter/garlic rendered the snails stringy and tough.  Luckily, the onion soup came to the rescue.  This is a must.  Ours came bubbling away with a nice sized slice of gruyere on bread topping our soup.  The broth is perfectly seasoned (though I wouldn't mind a tad bit more onion-ness) and if the rest of the menu is anything like the onion soup then Benoit will do very well.  Giselle spotted a mountainous concoction of Benoit's version of pomme frites.  When we inquired about it, we were told that it was the side the chicken came with.  And so we tried the chicken.  It's an entire chicken and they brought it to the table in its pan for presentation before taking it back to the kitchen to be carved.  It came with a side of jus and two big sprigs of rosemary and thyme, perfuming the entire dish.  I'm a dark meat kinda girl and the dark meat was tender while the white meat was somewhat on the dry side.  Skin was perfectly crispy.  I'm not a big fan of fries.  Usually, I ask for another side but these were quite delicious.  They were neither too crispy nor too tender.  They were just right.  They're not the size of shoestring but they, on average, are about the size of 1/3 of the normal french frie, in what they call ""L'ami Louis Style"".  Prices are not quite bistrot with the roasted chicken for two at $44.  The crowd is decisively older and while we started at 6 with the early bird crowd, when we finished around 8:30pm, the average age of the clientele was still probably in the 40s.  There are a lot of suits and most of the tables had come bearing their own bottles of wines.  Benoit is not charging a corkage fee and I don't know how long it will take them to acquire their liquor license, but we were quite happy with the current BYOB policy.  Interestingly enough, their website already sports a wine list.  Overall, Benoit shows a lot of promise.  A lot of care has been paid to details here but in a way, Benoit is almost trying too hard.  It is scared of making a mistake and inadvertently in its caution manages to miss the ""Just right"" bar.  I can't wait to come back in the next few months and see how it develops.  The menu is short and I'll definitely be back to sample some of the other classics like the charcuterie plate, the duck and some of the desserts.  Most people had reservations but at this early stage, it's still quite possible to just walk in.  Take advantage of their current BYOB situation.  It might be the cheapest Ducasse meal you've ever had.",1,0,1,Mog C.,"Hoboken, NJ",172,411,92
4.0,4/27/2008,"Many of the staples of the Benoit in Paris seemed to be on the menu in NY. While the food is very good, there seems to be something lost in translation in this American version of the famous french bistro. We had the escargot, the cassoulet,  the foie gras terrine, and the pork chops. Yum. Overall, we still had a great time out at Benoit. I think its just a notch below the Parisian version, but still very good.",1,1,1,Alden H.,"San Francisco, CA",37,133,3
3.0,4/15/2008,"The grand opening is on Monday, April 21st. Benoit is French food from Alain Ducasse for the rest of us. More bistro than fine dining; expect the classics of his Paris [and Tokyo] restaurants transposed to midtown. Perhaps this new midtown outpost will save me - and others - from a trip south on the 6 to Balthazar. We'll start with three stars and go up from there once I've had an opportunity to sample the cassoulet. Bon appetit!",5,1,2,John B.,"New York, NY",4790,651,196
