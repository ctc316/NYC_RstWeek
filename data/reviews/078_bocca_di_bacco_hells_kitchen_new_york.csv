5.0,4/28/2019,"My family and I ate here prior to going to see Wicked.  We had 5:15 reservations for the 8 o'clock show. By 5:45 the place was packed. Our server Nunzio was amazing and very attentive. The food, service and ambiance were exceptional. The grilled squid, beef carpaccio and arancini balls were delicious as was the rest of the meal. The Sea Bass was buttery and flakey, I had pasta with lamb Ragú, which had chunks of lamb in. The bolognese sauce was also very tasty. We had a very nice bottle of Sicilian wine which completes the whole meal. This is the perfect place to go prior to going to the theater.  We will definitely eat eating here again and highly recommend it. Definitely make reservations if you plan on going",0,0,0,Donna R.,"Higganum, Haddam, CT",15,10,0
5.0,4/25/2019,"We had an amazing dinner here on our last night in New York after it being recommended via the Lonely Planet app. I had the Gorgonzola penne and my husband had the grilled salmon. Both dishes were outstanding! The service was impeccable as well; the server was serving numerous tables at the same time, yet he continually checked in on us and refilled our water. I've been to Italy three times and the pasta here truly rivals Italy! The ambience is super chic and romantic, and prices are extremely reasonable. We also thoroughly enjoyed the complimentary bread basket with fresh bruchetta which they repeatedly refilled. Would HIGHLY recommend to everyone, even if you have to go out of your way to get there!",0,0,0,Lauren K.,"Richmond, Canada",44,11,0
4.0,4/14/2019,"Had the fresh ricotta and spinach tortellini in butter sage with asparagus and Parmesan. It was wonderfully made. For appetizers, we had the tray of prosciutto and a plate of grilled octopus. They had a Nebbiolo Rosato which was a huge plus. Lastly, for dessert we had the lemon, raspberry, and mango sorbet and the vanilla bean panna cotta. The panna cotta had too much gelatin in it and was thick as a result. Overall, great food.

3.0,2/22/2019,"I came here on my last visit to New York, I was with a group of 10+ and it was difficult finding a restaurant that would take reservations to accommodate. Bocca di Bacco Hell's Kitchen was one of the few restaurants that offered us this option. We were seated about 15 minutes after our reserved time due to another party taking longer to close out their table.Staff were friendly, handed us menus and gave our group some suggestions. As a table we ordered several appetizers, the most memorable appetizer was an item that was not on the menu, but suggested by the waiter, Special Appetizer which came with Burrata, Tomatoes and Prosciutto. The cheese was so creamy and flavorful. For my entree I went with the suggestion of our waiter as well for the Special Pasta. This came with Lobster, Clams and Squid Ink Pasta. I was not a huge fan of my entree... the sauce came out diluted and the pasta had a chewy, gummy texture. I would stick to the other more traditional dishes, I had a taste of several other dishes around the table and the sauces and pasta were alot better... the Orecchiette with Sausage was really good!Overall I would suggest this spot to accommodate large parties. The food was decent, but not amazing. The price point is average and portions are plentiful so if I were in the area again with another large group I would return :)",1,0,0,Lina T.,"Rockville, MD",360,374,1805

4.0,2/4/2019,"I dined here on a Saturday evening, at 8:15pm, and liked that I didn't have any problem getting a reservation same day for a table of 4. The restaurant was packed and bustling and it's very tight with guests and waitstaff moving around constantly. Thankfully, I didn't notice as much once we were seated. I ordered a cocktail to start which wasn't worth the price tag of $16. For appetizer, my husband and I shared the Bresaola & Pere salad which was delicious with plentiful meat. The bread with the tomato (bruscetta-style) that came at the beginning of the meal was also delicious. For entree, my friend and I shared 2 pastas: the Fettuccine alla Bolognese & the Gnocci alla Sorrentina. We both agreed the Gnocci was better than the Bolognese. My husband had the Salmon, and our other friend had the Lamp Chops. Everyone cleared their plates. Overall, we enjoyed our meal and the prices were reasonable. Definitely a decent spot in the area to hit up for dinner. Reservation recommended for sure.",1,0,2,Kara M.,"Manhattan, NY",480,227,524
4.0,2/2/2019,"I had an excellent time here with friends and family. Our party had not seen each other in quite some time and the servers let us have as much time as we needed. The wine selections and bottles were reasonably priced and the cocktail list didn't wow me, but there were some interesting choices, of which I did not partake. My only real complaint: everything was TOO SALTY. The bread was salty. My grilled octopus dish was salty. It came out different than what I expected: a potato salad was part of the description and it was not a salad. It was not a chilled, composed melange of potatoes bound together with mayonnaise or other light dressing.  It was slices of potato, heavily salted (I could feel the grains against my tongue), drizzled with olive oil and layered beneath the pulpo and sauteed celery cut on the bias. The knife work was impeccable, but the potatoes were almost inedible. My lamb ragout pasta was probably the 2nd or 3rd most memorable pasta dish I have ever been blessed to have. Only, it was SO RICH I could only eat 1/4 of it. I'd order that dish 10 times over, even knowing that the dish will be incredibly rich and filling. Everyone from the host (who was accommodating after I asked to be moved to 2 different tables after the first was under a heat vent, blasting the hottest air imaginable on me) to the servers were kind. The perfunctory service was exemplary, actually. The way service should be in a place like this. I'll be back. If only for the lamb.",0,0,0,Nikki M.,"Winston-Salem, NC",705,238,223
4.0,1/14/2019,We read the reviews and decided to try Bocca. Beautiful place.. great for pre- theatre.. food was good.. we had fired calamari .. eggplant rolatini app.. and pastas .. definitely fresh made pasta as presented.. sauce was good. Calamari was cooked properly but had excess oil after frying and seemed that the oil should have been changed since there was a bitter taste to the coating and it appeared dark yet wasn't over cooked.. the eggplant was tasty but difficult to cut - again i Believe was due to cooking technique since it was cut thinly .. great atmosphere.,0,0,0,Dennis O.,"New York, NY",23,58,11

The music was abnormally loud, the food was part hot, part cold- some seemed straight out of the refrigerator. The staff was focused on speaking more to the manager and less to the customers. The ""manager"" was quite visible but did not interact or check on the customers. The wait staff were OK when you could get their attention (from the manager).

It was good, but not $22 good!One person had the monkfish, which he liked, and another had the risotto special, which was with mushrooms and truffles. The rice was nice and chewy, and the dish was full of flavor. I had the orecchiette with lamb ragu, which was tragically overcooked. However, the server was very gracious about taking it back to the kitchen; I got a penne bolognese instead, and this time the pasta was perfect.The service was very friendly and helpful, so I'd up my rating to a 3.5 if I could.

I'm no avid coffee-fanatic (I see myself as more of a hilariously, stereotypical tea drinker given my U.K. background) but the brew I had was amazingly balanced with sweet, creamy and bitter. Nonetheless, the restaurant was so kind that they let me have the coffee on the house!

3.0,8/17/2018,"Bocca di Baco is the story of Italy before and after the 2010 Eurozone crisis. Pre crisis, everything was so expensive - handbags, flights, hotels. Post crisis everything got smaller - budgets, national sovereignty, sense of standing on the international stage. However throughout it all, the Italian ethos and culture still shined through, like a beacon to history. At Bocca di Baco, the food is great and the service is caring and friendly, however the prices are through the roof for portions that could generally fit on the credit card (or 3) that you use to pay for the mealSitting down for a restaurant week Prix fix, I picked the crab cakes, spaghetti pescatora and bomboloni, all of which paired with the delicious white wine we had for the table. Trying to have a conversation was a little challenging with the dim lighting and loud house music. When the crab cake came out I assumed it was part of a bigger serving. Nope, these should be classified as crab cupcakes because of the size. Adding to my confusion, there was a giant scoop of guacamole next to the mini crab cake, leading to an confused discussion of if the orders from the nearby Chipotle got lost in delivery. While the spaghetti was delicious if not a bit on the shrimpy side (pun intended), the real travesty was when dessert came to the table. The bomboloni, which were described as zeppolis, or deep fried dough, came out the size of a quarter and overcooked to a hardened crisp.

We found the service excellent and the food delicious, but were a bit disappointed when we were charged $12 for a child's serving of spaghetti noodles with butter and $14 for a child's serving of spaghetti with meat sauce.

I went for a birthday brunch and arrived much earlier than the rest of the group. The bartender and another gentleman inside were super friendly and helpful while I sat there waiting. The group was running late and the bartender even poured me a glass of champagne to enjoy while I waited. Which was just a thoughtful gesture, and greatly appreciated. I had eggs with bacon and toast and home fries. The eggs were really good, especially with cheese added to them. The home fries were different from what I'm used to, they had some type of tomato sauce on them. But the sauce actually complimented the potatoes well. The bacon was a bit more crispy and salty than I prefer but paired with the eggs and toast, it wasn't too bad. You could get a carafe or mimosas or a bottle of champagne with your brunch meal and the mimosas carafe was more champagne than OJ, the perfect ratio!

I ordered the spaghetti langostini. Wow. First off after that night we made a unanimous decision to let my husband pick my food from now on because his dish was impressively tasty. It was perfect. Every bite you wanted to take another. Mine was so big and filling. The langostini was sweet and it had the perfect amount of clams and mussels.

Cocktail menu had a nice selection but we opted for a bottle of proseco! Our appetizer was the grilled octopus which was like butter. Flavor had a hint char from the girl and a light tomatoe flavor with thinly sliced potatoes. There was a hint of crunch from the sliced celery but it did not over power the octopus flavor. Entre included homemade fettuccini with Bolognese sauce...excellent.  the other was gnocchi in red sauce. Both were authentic and flavorful.

Just to note one of the wine glasses we were served smelled foul and maybe it was not cleaned well. It did not ruin the meal, but I felt I should mention it. For an appetizer we started with the Calamari e Zucchini which was quite tasty. For my entree, I had the Panino di Gerrero. I was not a big fan of this dish as the skirt steak was a little fatty and too thick to be part of a panini. Two of my friends had the Spaghetti alla Carbonara which looked delicious.

Portions are generous. Started with the burrata appetizer and bruschetta, but due to shellfish allergies I couldn't eat the other appetizers. First course was started with pappardelle pasts with lamb ragu - sauce was delicious and the lamb was not games at all. The can taste that the sauce has been simmered for the right amount of time. Main course - salmon with caramelized onions. Dessert - tiramisu was meh.  Would come back when I'm in town.",0,0,0,Michael Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",685,217,49

1.0,11/10/2016,"I will start with the pros:The service is nice, the ambiance has a rustic/intimate feel, and the bread is good (though it was cold). My friends had the short ribs, and lamb shank, both were tasty and well cooked. The wine was all good. My friend asked for a suggestion (based on his taste) and our server picked the perfect glass for him. For the cons, the calamari was disgusting. To be fair, half of it was. It seemed like half was old, and the other half more fresh. The old half was very chewy and had a fishy taste. The fresher half was pretty good, as was the marinara sauce. My lamb chops were way overcooked even though I asked for them to be rare. They set the three tiny lamb chops on a mountain of tasteless mashed potatoes. My other friend had the noki and it was bland. It tasted like a college freshman bought a bag of noki and added unseasoned canned tomato sauce to it. The desserts were terrible. The chocolate lava cake was dry as a bone. The apple dessert was microwaved to the point where the crust and apples became chewy and dry. Another con, my friend snagged his sweater on the splintering wood by his shoulder. He moved and the splintered pulled the threads out of the sweater. We told our server and he didn't really care. He apologized, but didn't offer any solution. We asked for another napkin to cover the splintering wood. My friend was very nice about the whole thing. I would have thought they would at least have offered a free glass of wine, or dessert for damaging the sweater. I've been to this restaurant before and have had 3 star experiences, nothing to yelp about. This time, too many things went wrong, most of them in the kitchen.",3,2,1,Clint B.,"New York, NY",3,4,0

I went on to my second course which was Veal Milanese this was actually a Veal Chop butterflied and pounded out to the most tender Veal Cutlet you could ask for anywhere. It came with Arugula with a balsamic dressing. This is a must place to go when you are in NYC. I have no need to go any where else when I am in the city.

Even before we got there, we called a million times with a couple of different questions and the woman on the phone could not have been more friendly. Once we got there we ordered the ribeye steak entree for two which is part of the restaurant week menu but it counts for two entrees because it's so large. For the appetizers we got a salad with arugula and feta cheese and also a dish with jumbo shrimp and beans. The salad was delicious but we were especially impressed with the shrimp dish. My dad actually said it was one of the best things he has ever eaten. The ribeye steak was HUGE and amazing and came with arugula and cheese and fries. The steak was so juicy and flavorful. For dessert we got the warm chocolate cake and profiteroles which were both awesome even though we were so full. The food was seriously amazing. And what made the experience even better was our waitress from Milan. She was so friendly and helpful and we had great service. We were happy to share our positive experience with the manager who was also so friendly. Before we left the waitress was so sweet and offered us complimentary limoncello.

5.0,6/19/2016,"This was a long awaited review but I came here on Valentine's Day and this is hands down, the most amazing Italian food I've ever had. The ambience of the restaurant is perfect for a date night, and the staff was incredibly nice. I highly recommend making reservations because they can get busy during dinner time.To start the meal, they gave fresh pieces of warm bread with a tomato in olive oil mixture. This bread was INSANE! It was so buttery and oily instead, and they didn't butter it which is weird. When I ripped the bread pieces, my fingers were oily, and how can anyone resist this. To start for appetizers, we ordered the Calamari Fritti and Gamberoni. The Calamari was delicious because it was nicely seasoned and perfectly crispy. You can definitely tell that the seafood is fresh and I love how they had pieces of fried garlic, and fried potato slices. The Gamberoni was basically large pieces of shrimp with sautéed lima beans in a tomato sauce. These shrimps were enormous! I absolutely loved the lima beans mixture and they were cooked extremely well. By this time, I was already full. However, I ordered the Tortelli Ricotta E Spinaci for my main dish. This was the most delicious pasta I've ever had. These tortelli pieces were enormous and they were jam packed with ricotta and spinach pieces. The pasta was in some sort of butter/oil sauce and I loved how well it all blended together. I was really surprised at how they added asparagus into this. It was thin slices of asparagus that had a nice hardiness to them. Whenever I make pasta, I definitely want to add this vegetable to it. For dessert, we ordered the Creme Brûlée. It was huge and wasn't too sweet which I love. I highly recommend this restaurant for a nice dinner date or a GNO.",0,0,0,Joy P.,"Aurora, Canada",213,43,146

The restaurant definitely had a good crowd, but wasn't too crowded so we were able to be seated right away.To start, they served little muffins with butter and jelly. They weren't anything to write home about, but they were a nice little snack to whet the appetite a bit. For my main meal, I decided to go with the carbonara. Though this carbonara lacked some of the typical ingredients--mainly peas--the flavor was quite good and the portion was a great size for the price. Furthermore, the pricing of everything on the menu seemed to be pretty reasonable. Our crew also went through countless pitchers of mimosas during the brunch and the manager was kind enough to provide a couple free ones on him.Overall, this place is a great space to bring large groups and the food is tasty, yet affordable.

Even more so when we arrived at 830 to see the placed packed to the brim with guests! I highly recommend a reservation for weekends here. The ambiance is cozy and very Italian, I loved it. We arrived and were seated at our table within 5 minutes. Our waters were filled and drink orders taken, and the waiter was very friendly. They have a wonderful Italian wine list, and their cocktails were pretty awesome as well (my gf's drink had red pepper flakes on top!)For appetizers we ordered the arancini, mushroom bruschetta, fried calamari, and meatballs. Well, those plates were licked clean. The arancini were so cheesy and delicious and they tied as my favorite with the bruschetta. The meatballs were hearty and the marinara was amazing too. For the main event, I ordered the fusilli with sausage in a pink cream sauce which was phenomenal, i highly recommend it. The sausage especially made the dish. Other honorable mentions included the bolognese which was SO good, as well as the seafood squid ink pasta. Other at the table got different varieties of fish and everything was really just top notch and filling. We had plenty of leftovers as the portions were large, and prices weren't bad either.For dessert we shared the cheesecake, which came with both a raspberry and peach sauce on the side - it was very very light and fluffy, not dense at all which made it a nice ending to the meal.

4.0,1/8/2016,We ended up randomly strolling into this restaurant on a Saturday night after searching the area tirelessly for something to eat. What a great surprise! We had a excellent meal here and will absolutely be coming back. We weren't looking to eat too much and mostly came for the drinks (the negronis were very good by the way) so we split two dishes.We started with the mussels which were amazing. The sauce was so delicious (we were using the bread to mop it up by the end) and we really enjoyed these. We tried the special which was a risotto that evening and it was mouthwatering. Besides the food our waiter was fantastic as well. This is an excellent spot to have a nice meal in an intimate setting.,0,0,0,Brendan R.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",2,2,0
4.0,1/5/2016,"So I ended up coming here with my boyfriend and his family. We had originally wanted to go to either Tony's or Carmine's but both places had really long waits. So we walked around for a while and came across this place. The main reason we stopped was because there was no wait for 7 people. But we ended up being pleasantly surprised! The atmosphere was a little dark and loud. When we first walked in, the music was really loud and it almost seemed like house music was playing..kinda weird for in upscale Italian restaurant. But after a few songs it changed to more calm, soothing music. The restaurant in general was very dark so kind of hard to see the menus but maybe different during the day or under set rain lighting. The service was ok. We asked or waiter a few questions and he didn't seem too enthused to answer them. He forgot a few things but maybe the manager or owner (not sure who) apologized and all in all it wasn't a huge deal. The food on the other hand was awesome! What I really liked about the food was the serving size. At Italian restaurants we all tend to indulge not only because it's delicious but also because the servings are HUGE. And then don't end up saving room for dessert or feel like we're waddling out! But the servings here are perfect. Not too big, but not too small. I felt so content after eating my meal and had just enough room for some dessert. I got the Tortelli Ricotta E Spinaci. Heaven in my mouth!! So creamy but light at the same time. And it had just enough of veggies to taste somewhat healthy! Everyone else really enjoyed their meals as well and agin they were all just the right sizes. We ordered some desserts: cheesecake, chocolate cake, and tiramisu. They were great, the chocolate cake was moist and chocolatey, the cheese cake was actually very light for a cheesecake which was great, and the tiramisu was rich and flavorful!

1.0,12/19/2015,"Worst dining experience in quite s while. The waiters wine recommendations were only for bottles over $100. When we agreed on a 2008 brunello, he brought us a 2013. My husband asked him about this, and he shrugged and said vintages change. Three out of four of us ordered the seafood special with shrimp, scallops, and lobster. Entrees came out with only shrimp. We were told the specials change halfway thru the night - it was the kitchen's fault. Two of us ordered something else as the dish was basically spaghetti and shrimp. Our food came out 20 min later, our husbands had finished eating and were ready to go. As I was still eating my beet salad, the waiter asked if I was done yet (my fork was still going towards my mouth!). The bill came and the special was $35 (almost 1.5x the price of the pastas in the menu). We asked to speak to a manager about our experience. At this point a nice AGM came out and suddenly the waiter wanted to give us complimentary prosecco. The actual GM rushed past our table and took the bill without saying a word to us, and he took off $5 of the bill and said that covered not having the lobster. No apology about our poor experience, no desire to have us come back. On the way out I spoke to the AGM she was sweet, as she said, ""I am so sorry you had a bad experience tonight. If you come back, I know we can make it up to you and make it right.""  Mmm. Customer is in your restaurant now.

My friend noshed on the Caprese as his main dish and I had the Neri Tagliolini. It was just basic. Nothing spectacular. I was looking forward to the black ink squid linguine and crab meat being outstanding, but it was not. What blew my socks away you ask? The martini I enjoyed. The Amaro. It was delightful. Not too sweet. Just enough alcohol. Chilled to perfection. It was great. The ambience of the place was nice. The hostess was very sweet and welcoming and the waiter was great and attentive.

3.0,11/9/2015,"Good but not great. Were shown to a nice table when we arrived, which turned out to be wobbly. Took two tries on the part of one of the under-wait staff to fix it. As to the food, my husband had a mixed grill kind of dish that was accompanied by broccoli rabe. I didn't taste the meats but the boccoli rabe was well cooked although a little too liberally covered with olive oil. I had a simple dinner of fava bean soup and a melange of warm veggies. They were attractively served in a melted parmesan basket. Scrapes of salata ricotta that looked like they were fresh off a standard issue box grater greatly lessened the visual appeal. The small size of the bits were overpowered by the tasty parmesan basket.  Ricotta salata needs to be in medium-sized bits that show a bit of the cheese's grain. These looked like generic white cheese shavings.  The perfectly cooked brussels sprouts were somewhat spoiled by being badly trimmed. Tough roots don't taste good. Desert was a tasty ricotta cheese cake that had a hard caramelized top reminiscent of creme brûlée. It unfortunately overpowered the delicate flavor of the cheesecake itself.

5.0,11/7/2015,"This place is my new spot. After being in the neighborhood for a few months now, last night was the first time that I wandered in. I've been missing out! The ambiance was what drew me inside, and everything that followed is what will keep me coming back. First: the drinks. WOW. I've never been to a place where every single cocktail that I ordered was made to perfection. I had the Acai Bellini, Ginger Lychee mojito, and a Moscow mule with a twist... topped off with a delicious shot from the bartender (I'm not quite sure what it was, but it was fruity and simply phenomenal). That's another thing... The bartenders are great. Friendly, quick, knowledgable. Grab a seat at the bar and watch them work their magic with your drink(s). Next: The food. I cannot think of a single thing that I didn't like! We had the calamari and the cheese plate to start (and to balance out the effects of our delicious cocktails). The calamari was fried up nicely, and the sauce that accompanied it had a slight spice to it... Which I enjoy. The cheese plate was perfect as well: 4 cheeses with jam, honey, grapes and bread. The cheeses were all very different-- flavorful in their own different ways. I'm dreaming about the next time I can order it! Next, we had salads: the bresaola and pear, and the mixed greens. Again... We were not disappointed. Personally, I can only speak to the bresaola and pear salad... As soon as I started eating, I couldn't even pay attention to anything else. Let me tell you: I'm not the kind of girl who lives on salads. So for me to tell you that this salad had my complete focus and attention says something. It was the perfect size, the bresaola was tender, the pears were chopped to the perfect size to be able to enjoy some in each bite, and the arugula was crisp and fresh. I can't wait to go back and try more of their cocktails, some of their pasta dishes, and a few wines that I haven't tried before. I noticed some reviews mentioned that the cocktails and food are high priced-- I wouldn't call this a ""cheap"" place, but you will 100% get your money's worth.

Definitely recommend the Carbonara pasta (They even took the bacon out for me so I would eat it!). Also.. prepare yourself for the mini corn muffins they give you to start. Absolutely to die for.

The drinks: they can make any cocktail at the bar, and it all shakes out brilliantly.  It's the wines by the glass that clinch it though.  Plenty of options, all fabulous in quality, at a good price.  The food: real Italian food.  The mains are fantastic (pasta and fish dishes are my go-to) but I rarely get to them -- tips are the calamari/zucchini mix, the bruschetta, the carpaccio.  With 3 glasses of wine, and a cheeky dessert, you don't need much else. The atmosphere:  the place is set up to feel like a living room.  You have a big bar, a big communal eating/standalone-bar table, and tables adorning around.  The music is lively but not invasive.  The staff - are - phenomenal.  It's a group effort on their part, a team effort.  And it shows.  You feel like part of the family.  The food is comforting.  The drinks flow endlessly.  There's a discreet tv showing the game for anyone that's interested.

The oysters were really good, plump and fresh. We got a few small plates to share, the mushroom bruschetta was good, especially for sharing. The quail stuffed with sausage was tasty, but small. The meatballs were on the dry side, even with all of the sauce that came with it; the meat wasn't very well seasoned, either.

3.0,1/14/2015,"I wish Yelp would allow us to give half stars because this is one of those times I would genuinely review with a 3.5 instead of 3. The ambiance & the service was fantastic. The bartender John was truly exceptional & although I forgot the name of the cocktail I had, it was seriously so incredibly delicious I would go back just for that!! Blueberry vodka with fresh muddled blueberries with lychee purée & a lychee on top. I'm sure I'm missing an ingredient or two but it was fantastic! I love anything with lychee. Now, on to the food & where the level of stars begin to decline. We ordered the appetizer mussels in a white wine sauce yet it was far from what we anticipated since the sauce was red. And the mussels were cold. I mean, not even lukewarm :( I hate nothing more than receiving food that should be hot cold. Next we shared the Raviolini di Pesce. The concept is great & the ravioli stuffed with seafood was tasty but they only serve 3 raviolis with a few pieces of clam & mussels on it...also not the hottest. I'd say this slightly warm though at least but I was surprised because for the price, I thought it was on the small side. Maybe that's just me. Then we shared two sides: spinach & Brussels sprouts. Both vegetable sides were very good & more on the hotter side at least. Overall, I'm not too upset & I probably would even go back but I would specify to the waiter to bring my food out piping hot. I did just read another review where someone wrote she received a free glass of wine for showing her theater tickets. We ordered wine too & had mentioned going to see a play after dinner & did not receive that same extended offer so I'm curious if that is consistent or what.",0,0,0,Lesley O.,"East Meadow, NY",1684,746,2006

Our waiter offered some suggestions and was able to indicate whether certain wines were dry or sweet which I found helpful in my decision.Food was overall good. The lobster bisque was just ok. Spinach gnocchi was nicely proportioned, but slightly to much cheese in the sauce. Taste was good overall however and had a good firm yet slightly chewy texture that I was expecting. The Branzino (sea bass) was perfectly done and very nice with a good beet purée as the sauce. Dessert was slightly lacking in the apple samosa, two bites and it was over. The flour less chocolate cake was good but unremarkable.Prices were very reasonable considering most dinner prices for similar atmosphere and food. Wine was also fairly priced overall.

Mussels are always good, never noticed any with a bad smell or taste.Salads -- All fantastic with good, fresh ingredients.Pastas -- Again, ALL of the options here are great, but we frequently go back to the Taglierini neri con grancho. If you've never tried black squid ink pasta before, I think this is as good as place as any to try it. My cheese fiend boyfriend is also a fan of the gnocchi sorrentini.When one time we were unhappy with our delivery, the management went above and beyond to correct it by remaking everything and sending it over immediately, free of additional charge. It was certainly not our intention when we called or something we demanded, we'd only even called to comment because we so loved the food every other time and were surprised. But the manager made it clear that it was very important to him to make sure his customers were fed with good food, and I very much appreciated his dedication and pleasantness throughout the exchange.

If you're a mussels person, I definitely recommend getting an order just for yourself!Wasn't the biggest fan of the gin cucumber cocktail I got.

The venue itself and the service were both lovely -- the decor is very rustic but trendy and our wait staff was super friendly -- however, the food was sub par. I ordered the lobster risotto which was a special that evening and it was drowning in butter, but barely had any taste. I was tempted to ask for salt! Even the entrees of my dining partners were sub par. They tasted better than mine but again, were doused in butter and had little to no flavor. Needless to say, I had a huge plate of potential leftovers, but I didn't even take it home. Who leaves lobster at a restaurant?! That says something about the food... I would recommend going to this restaurant for a drink at the bar, but beyond that, go somewhere else because the food was meh.

5.0,12/16/2014,"Had dinner here on Sat 12/13 after a day roaming around the city. We picked it at random on our quest to find a delicious Italian Eatery in NYC the week before heading up, and boy were we happy! Let's start with the place itself, shall we? This is no large Italian restaurant, but a little ""hole in the wall"" type place. Very unassuming from the front, and cozy, gorgeous, and quaint on the inside. The ambiance of the restaurant was great - good lighting, the music was a bit interesting (italian techno pop, the sporadic christmas song, and the random pop hit all played), and the decor was great. Kind of like eating in a little italian bistro - very rustic, cozy, and homey. The food was amazing - the menu was small (only one page of entrees and apps!), but still hard to choose what to eat - it all looked delicious. However, they had a VERY extensive Italian wine list - it seemed like they had something from every Italian wine region. We ended up settling on a nice Chianti (that I can't for the life of me, remember the name of). For dinner, I had the fresh (and made in house) Gnocchi with a beautiful tomato and basil sauce, and ricotta chunks. My fiance had the lamb chops with a side of Brussels sprouts. Our friends had the rosemary chicken, crab cakes, and a caprese salad. All of it was fantastic. And the wine complemented each dish perfectly. For dessert, 2 of us had their warm chocolate cake, served with a raspberry sauce, decadent chocolate sauce, and a scoop of vanilla ice cream (that tasted home made).

I decided not to complain as I had already waited for the second steak and my guest and I had a theatre date. When the server noticed that I had not eaten the second steak he asked what was the problem. I showed him the steak and he said he would speak to the manager. The server returned to say that the manager said they would not make any price adjustment because the steak was medium-rare. The server explained that the kitchen put a thermometer into the second steak to guarantee that it was medium-rare. It wasn't. If it was, I would have devoured the steak and not gone hungry.

I went back today during dinner service and I had the caprese salad for an appetizer. The buratta was delicious and the beefsteak tomatoes were refreshing. The basil gave it just that little bit of UMPH. For my main course I had the grilled halibut on top of a bed of greens that were sautéed with garlic and olive oil.

We had a great dining experience & I will definitely return here or to one of the other Bocca Di Bacco locations in the city. Their house bread was very fresh & tasty and loved the tomato bruschetta-like dipping sauce that it was served with - I could have eaten this dipping sauce with a spoon!! We enjoyed every one of the dishes we ordered & they came out relatively fast. Vast wine selection, affordable prices for main courses & good energy in the restaurant as it started filling up during prime time dinner rush. This restaurant does get on the louder side so FYI - not a quiet spot to get to know someone. We started off with the Bruschetta Ai Funghi - toasted tuscan bread, wild mushrooms & truffle oil - came out of the oven with 6 pieces @ $12. I'm not in love with mushrooms & usually don't order mushroom dishes however I really enjoyed this appetizer & would definitely order it again. My colleague & I shared the Gnocchi Alla Sorrentina (fresh chopped tomato, basil, bufala mozzarella) @ $17 and the Costata Di Manzo Brastata (braised beef short ribs, stewed cabbage) @ $21. The gnocchi was tasty but the consistency was different than other gnocchis I've had (not as chewy - less texture). The beef short ribs were delicious & so was the stewed cabbage it came with. The cabbage had a sort of smoky flavor to it - really enjoyed this dish! I don't think I'd order the gnocchi again but would definitely order the beef ribs - especially for that price. Our server Alan was great and came to check on us often. Spacious clean bathrooms - 2 single unisex stalls.

We came across this restaurant while seeking a place to eat after attending a taping of The Colbert Report, a few blocks away. We were hoping for something edible and relatively fast, and this spot exceeded our expectations. All of our dishes were great, and served amazingly quickly. I highly recommend the tortelli ricotta e spinaci. Fresh homemade pasta, stuffed with just enough spinach and ricotta, and augmented by crisp sage and sweet butter. Delectable!  My fellow diners were pleased by their selections, including short ribs, pasta bolognese, and pasta primavera. The Caesar salad was crisp and properly dressed. And the desserts we had (warm chocolate cake and tiramisu) were terrific. The only negative things about the place are minor...  It was pretty loud, possibly due to the mostly brick, rustic interior. There's nothing to buffer the sound. Also, we were disappointed to learn that they were out of profiteroles that night. I have no doubt they would have been great.

3.0,6/23/2014,"Good atmosphere, but the food needs serious improvement. The appetizers did not disappoint, but the main course left a lot to be desired. To start, we had the mushroom and truffle oil bruschetta which was absolutely amazing. Also, we enjoyed the grilled octopus and gazpacho, both of which we enjoyed very much (Octopus was the best part of the meal!). For the main courses, we had the lobster risotto and the pork chop special which came with mashed potatoes and broccoli rabe. The risotto was hard and undercooked, with only a few scattered pieces of lobster. The pork chop honestly was one of the worst I have ever had. Very bland and underseasoned. The potatoes and broccoli rabe were good though. For the price of the items on this menu, there is a lot to be improved upon. I guess with this place, it really does depend on what you order if you end up liking it or not. Service was good, but I will not be going back.",0,0,0,Dana H.,"New York, NY",0,4,2

Because the music is so loud, people have to yell to each other which makes it louder.  Once we were all done with dinner I got the check, no way I am having dessert at that restaurant.  We went to a local diner to have dessert so I could hear my company.  So if you don't want to hear your dinner party speak, go to this restaurant.  If you don't have hearing problems, you will when you are done with the meal.  This morning my ears are in pain.  Thank you restaurant for listening to your customer requests.",0,0,0,William A.,"Tarrytown, NY",0,8,0

4.0,1/26/2014,"We had an 8pm reservation on a Saturday night to celebrate a birthday. The place was bustling but it didn't feel crowded or loud. We started out with a bottle of white wine, which one I can't remember but our waiter helped us select. We all enjoyed it and polished it off quickly. From the  ASSAGGI section we all shared the BRUSCHETTA AI FUNGHI, a toasted tuscan bread, wild mushrooms and truffle oil. While everything we had was good, this was amazing and probably our favorite part of the meal. We also shared the FORMAGGI MISTI, a taste of four cheeses with honey and fig jam. The cheeses would have been good on their own but the honey and jam made the cheese plate which can sometimes feel boring seem more special. The table also shared two items from the INSALATE section. One was the BRESAOLA E PERE (arugula, imported bresaola, bosc pear, parmesan cheese, balsamic vinaigrette) when we ordered it the waiter made sure we knew that bresaola is a meat. Since we hadn't known that we confirmed with the waiter that it would be ok without it. We also got the INSALATA TRE COLORI (endive, arugula, radicchio, bacon, mushrooms, lemon dressing) without the bacon. Both salads were great but I was partial to the BRESAOLA E PERE. To go with dinner we ordered a bottle of red wine which again I unfortunately don't remember the name but was also lovely. From the PASTA section I shared the GNOCCHI ALLA SORRENTINA (fresh chopped tomato, basil, bufala mozzarella) which was good.From the SECONDI section I shared the STINCO D'AGNELLO (herbed roasted lamb shank, pearl onion, mashed potatoes) which I enjoyed very much. I also tasted the BRANZINO GRIGLIATO (grilled branzino, roasted potatoes, broccoli rabe) the branzino tasted very light and fresh but perhaps a bit too plain and the broccoli rabe a bit too bitter. For DESSERT we shared the CHEESECAKE which was good but nothing special and a delicious WARM CHOCOLATE CAKE served with ice cream and a special happy birthday message!We enjoyed our dining experience here and would definitely return!",0,0,1,Sarah F.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,13,9

I would recommend to stop here for late afternoon cocktails during weekend, not for dinner as this place is usually packed and very loud. Agree that their italian wine selection is very good, but also their cocktail menus definitely beat my expectation. I once stopped by at 4pm ish in Sunday afternoon and took a seat at the bar table. It was not crowded yet and not loud - perfect ambience for boozy Sunday afternoon. Also tried some of their bar menus, and our favorite was crab cake. Soooo good! Contray to my afternoon cocktail experience here, our Saturday dinner was horrible. Without reservation, we just walked in and put our name on the waiting list. The server told us ~30 min waiting time and added that the would call us when our table is available. We were waiting for her call, just walking around near that place in Hell's kitchen, but we didn't get our table for more than an hour! Not very happy with this delay, we stopped by the place again asked the server. After waiting an extra 20 minutes, we finally got a table. Italian wine was great as it was before, but squid ink pasta dish was a bit disappointing. Moreover, as soon as we paid our bill, the server took us to a bar seating area to serve another group of people, even though we didn't finish our wine yet!Well.. overall, very disapointing service.

We arrived 5 minutes early. When we got there, they told us it was for 4 people. Okay, a mistake. No big deal. The hostess was very nice and sat us right away. The waiter was great. Took our drink order. Took our food order about 15 minutes later. We didn't receive our food until 6:30. We were not put out by this. We were having a great time, and the restaurant was busy, so we understood. We finish our food about 20 minutes later. We are asked if we wanted coffee and dessert. We say no. They bring the check. It's now about 5 minutes to 7. I would say a typical reservation is about an hour and a half, so by no means have we prolonged our stay, plus we waited FOREVER for our food, without complaint. I take the bill, to divvy up who owes what. And this is where Karim comes into the story (I'm not sure of the spelling of the gentleman's name, as Karim can be spelled a couple different ways). He walks over to our table (and I assume he's a manager), clearly distressed that we are still there, as he's pacing back and forth behind our table, staring at us. I look up, and I am about to say - ""don't worry, we're just taking care of the bill!"" I understand the restaurant is busy and I don't want people to wait either. He doesn't see me look up and I see him roll his eyes at us, and stalk away. He comes back over to me one minute later and says, ""I have people waiting!"" And I said, ""yes, I'm aware. and I'm trying to take care of the bill, would you like me to do that?"" I'm always the customer that, if we have more than one credit card, I write down the amounts on the back of the check for each card, so as to help the waiter. Having worked as a waiter, I can tell you, it's much faster that way. This is what I'm doing when he walks over to me. After I answer him, he walks away in disgust. We were out of there 5 minutes later, after I asked him for his name.We just spent $175 at your restaurant, before tip. We had a normal meal time of 90 minutes. We waited an hour for our food. We skipped dessert and coffee because we saw how busy it was. You're going to tell me to get out of your restaurant? We still tipped well on the $175, because it was not our waiter's fault.

She wouldn't even allow us to put in our appetizer and drink order before our dinner order ""because the kitchens too backed up tonight.""  For the rest of the evening she hurried us along in the most obnoxious way.

The red snapper is fantastic and a very large portion, though is lacking a hearty vegetable to go along with it so I'd recommend ordering one on the side. My girlfriend's bolognese penne pasta was absolutely amazing, perfectly al dente and very filling.The kind server even brought us a slice of cake for her to blow out her birthday candles and didn't charge us for it, which was extremely sweet. That may have had something to do with the fire alarm going off for 20 minutes during the meal, complete with firemen bursting through the place to make sure it was safe.

The service was not service, it was simply order taking. No one was there to guide us through the wine selection, while that is not particularly necessary it is appreciated and to me say's above and beyond and helps ensure to make it a memorable experience for the guest. Service aside the food is cooked very well particularly the steak and the crab cakes were indeed very tasty. The food alone is why I gave it 3 stars.

There was nothing charming about the service; it was authentic Italian guys ignoring the guests. The food was average (even though we got one of the recommended specials that was supposed to be amazing), and in no-way made up for the crappy service. Additionally, the wine is kept in vacuum sealed bottles behind the bar, so if you order by the glass it tastes pretty horrible. Because the service was so poor, I tipped $10 on $80.

My friend and I did not want to drink THAT much and when we ordered single mimosas they were huge pours in wine glasses, not dainty champagne glasses.  Like I said, not messing around!  Very reasonably priced, even outside the bottomless deal. We ordered the brunch calamari and zucchini as an appetizer. The calamari rings were great, but the ""legs"" weren't very good and the zucchini was actually very thin chips. Would order again but just calamari (which I think is on the lunch menu).  For main course we got the brunch carbonara and penne zucchini. Both were the perfect sized portions at the perfect price ($10) and tasted great.The brunch menu spans breakfast food as well as other Italian offerings at excellent prices, which was exactly what my friend and I were looking for.

It was quite some time after we were seated before we were visited by the server. Our drinks took forever.

My boyfriend tried the meatballs and noted that they used more lean meat in them. He thought they were pretty good. For my main I ""created"" homemade fettuccine with crab meat.

4.0,11/11/2012,"A business colleague recommended this place so we made pre-theatre dinner plans the night of the N'oreaster. Loved the place from the minute we opened the door. Rustic. Italian. Warm. Homey. I was excited to see the menu. We started with a bottle of Valpolicella off the wines by the glass list. I had no idea there was an entire long wine list spanning the entire spread on the interior of the menu. It all worked out just fine though because my dinner companions LOVED the Valpociella. There were so many items to tempt us. We settled on a few shared appetizers, salads and pasta course. We did the mushroom bruschetta. It sounded much better on paper than it tasted on the plate but that was the only let down of the night. The arancini balls were creamy and crispy with a green pea thrown in for good measure. The Bresaola salad was incredible. Everyone was fighting over a shared serving of bresaola, shaved parmesean, balsamic and pear. Really incredible. I loved the Tortelli Ricotta e Spinaci, The tortelli were so light and flavorful. The butter sage sauce was a perfect match and the asparagus a lovely crunchy opposition to the creamy cheesiness. I would highly recommend and would definitely go back the next time I find myself in the city for any reason.",1,0,0,Tracy A.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",126,392,344

I'm not a fan of change, but I like what you've done with yourself!Came here before for brunch, but right after that they stopped offering it. Then came for dinner, had a terrible experience, wrote review. Wrote it off. Found out they offered brunch again, ran right over with my girlfriend and that is how we come to getting the stars again!Had brunch and, wow, whooo, whoa, WHOA. First, order unlimited bloody marys or mimosas and you are going to have a difficult time walking when you leave. Not that I would know. Ahem. On second thought, it's fairly common to see people face down in the streets here, go for it. I had bloody marys, my friend, mimosas. I do not like champagne, I can only judge by the way she was walking when she walked out. They were really good. The bloody mars were out. of. this. world. The only thing missing was olives. I would have loved olives. If you told me no bloody mary if you need olives, me and olives would break up. That's how good they are. For a starter we ordered the Tortino de Granchio. That's a really fancy word for the world's best crab cakes. Melted in the mouth, they did. So perfectly perfect. Perfect. I mentioned perfect, right? I then ordered the Frittata alla Peperonata and it was incredible. I really got the taste of the mozzarella in every bite, the peppers were a great compliment, it was just a really good egg-based dish, of which I'm generally not fond unless it's done Italian style. They did it right.My friend had scrambled eggs. She's lives on the edge. They looked really good. I'm sorry I didn't ask about hers, I had food in my mouth the whole time. The thing I really disliked about this place before was it's abysmal service. Let me tell you something, someone came in changed this place UP. I really appreciated the way my bloody mary was always full. I'm sure the people stepping over me outside were equally as grateful. The food came a little slow, but they gave us somet amazing little corn muffins with divine strawberry preserves so we were too busy putting those into our mouths hand over fist to notice that, yeah, the food was slow coming.

I was meeting a couple of friends here after work, and luckily I don't work that far because wine was definitely on the menu for me that night. It's located right in the middle of the block and the huge glass windows allow full visibility into the wine bar from the outside. Dimly lit and a nice marble bar right up front allows you the choice of either cozying up to the bar or having a seat at the tables in the back. Once I met up with my friends I had to look at the menu because  I was told it is quite extensive. For any place to have one full page of food and then 3 full pages of wine, that's an A OK place in my book.I must say the wine list was extensive but also expensive. It's not one the most expensive places in the area but be prepared to spend at least $40 for an average bottle of wine and at least $100 for a good one. The food was delicious. I had a bruiscetta with mushrooms and truffle oil. I paired that with a nice Montelpulciano and a Barbera, yes I know two glasses of wine but hey they were good and I deserved it after the day I had. Plus who doesn't love wine. It's a nice date spot because it is not overly loud and a beautiful romantic vibe to it as well. Definitely a nice gem in the heart of a concrete jungle.Will I go back??

3.0,10/8/2012,"Sitting alongside a slew of restaurants located in New York City's Hell's Kitchen, Bocca di Bacco, gives many reasons to choose them versus their competing neighbors.  The vibe is great and the contemporary rustic feel contributes to the overall warmth and lively atmosphere.  Initially we tried to get a seat after walking into their 54th street location, but ended up at their 45th street location on the recommendation of the matride.  Im glad we did, because the service was great and the food was just as good.  I will definitely go back when i am in that neck of the woods.We tried dishes such as the Herbed Grilled Octopus with celery and red potato salad, which was tender and not chewy, the way it should be.  The Quail and polenta with a balsamic reduction was moist and sweet with the polenta doing a good job absorbing the juices.  The Cozze Al Vino Bianco (Mussels in a white sauce) was packed with flavor.  The dish comes with pieces of incredibly crispy chewy bread that does a great job in sopping up the sauce of the mussels.  A real winner here.  Then I tried the Orecchiete All'agnello, which is a little ear shaped pasta with a roasted lamb ragu.  The pasta is made on the premises and was perfectly cooked; absorbing the earthy flavors of the sauce, with bite size pieces of lamb that were tender and sweet.  We then finished the night with a warm chocolate cake that was pretty extraordinary.The wine list is pretty extensive and they offer many varieties by the glass if a bottle is too much for you.Although they may have a few locations, this is a great neighborhood joint, .  Its a great date place or just friends getting together.  If your in their neck of the woods, give it a shot.",1,0,0,Paul T.,"Staten Island, NY",79,58,3

We called the restaurant the next day to report the incident. The manager Alex was shockingly nonchalant. He denied they had any problem, suggested we probably got the bug bites somewhere else, but that if we'd like we can go the pharmacy to buy some cream and give him the receipt for reimbursement. I was insulted and demanded a refund of our dinner. After some back and forth, he accepted. When the refund failed to appear on our credit card statement several days later, I called back.

Took the latter as we were hungry and it was actually fine since we were seated at the end of the table instead of being stuck between diners. Decent wine menu. Eggplant with ricotta and mint leaves were in tomato sauce and was a great starter. I asked if the Fettuccine alla bolognese could be made a little spicy and it was done without a problem. The bolognese was great with the added kick but I feel like most Italian places can do this sauce right - that being said, the fettuccine was one of the best I've had, perfectly al dente yet thin.

4.0,3/26/2012,"I've only ever been here for brunch, so can't speak to the lunch or dinner service / menus. Overall, I love the venue. It has a very rustic country look, yet still maintains a slightly modern feel. While I've only been here with small groups, I've seen them accommodate some very large groups in the past, do you can definitely round up the whole crew and bring them along. For those of you into ""boozy brunches"", Bocca offers a nice option. For $18 you get two hours of bottomless mimosas, screw drivers or bloody marrys. Unlike some restaurants, they'll get you started with a nice big wine glass and fill it up high. The waiters are also good about making sure you don't see the bottom of that glass and constantly top you off. This is a nice alternative to a lot of venues out there where you need to chance the waiter down just to get one refill. Needless to say, you'll defiantly get your money's worth. The food is pretty good, if a little bit inconsistent. Fried calamari, which one time was delicious and tender under a light battering was chewy and flavorless on another visit. Steak and eggs is on par with most other brunch offerings in this price range, and, perhaps depending on the chef's mood or stock in the pantry, can sometimes be an enormous portion. I'm a big fan of the smoked pork sausage and broccoli rabe, which is smokey and delicious in a tangy sauce.  It's especially great if you're looking for something on the lighter side, as the portion is fairly small. However, I think the dish could really use a starch of some kind, I usually order a side of fries to go along. Ultimately, I would give this place 3.5 stars if that was an option. I love the venue and think the bottomless drinks are a great value, however the food is nothing I would consider spectacular. I'll defiantly continue to go and will perhaps reserve final judgement until at least trying them out for dinner sometime soon.",0,0,0,Peter R.,"Manhattan, NY",3,28,0

Just went here this weekend with a friend after wanting to go to bottomless brunch at The Film Center Cafe in Hells Kitchen and am now a fan. EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE!!!! I have never been treated this way in NYC. The general manager, John, greeted us at the door and although we didn't have a reservation sat us quickly and everything was perfect from then.The ambiance of this place is relaxing and a little romantic with candle lit tables and wooden furniture throughout the restaurant. Brunch prices were in the range of $14-$20. Bottomless drinks last for 2 hours but it's so worth it. Not like your typical places where they ignore you just to not bring you another drink. No, our waiter would seriously wait for our drinks to be halfway and would bring another bloody mary before we were even finished. They were all so attentive. Our waiter noted we asked for Tabasco to add to our first bloody mary and after that just requested the bartender to make them a little spicier from then on. Each bloody mary was made fresh...not some pre-made mixer. I had the eggs benedict with smoked salmon and an english muffin topped with hollandaise sauce. My dish came with home fries and a side salad, honestly best potatoes of my life. I am so happy to have found this gem in Hells Kitchen and am very impressed. It couldn't have been a better experience. John the manager even gave us a shot and 2 mimosas as we just sat there and chit chatted. Not once did I feel rushed to pay and free our table.

They have a 4 page menu, and 1 page was for food while the other 3 pages were of various wines. We did a family style of apps: we ordered the grilled octopus, crostini misti, pucola e taleggio salad, and i believe that we also ordered the prosciutto di san danielle. My fave apps were the grilled octopus and the costini misti. The crostini misti were of 2 types: 1 with prosciutto and the other just sweet tomatoes and cheese. The salads were a bit soggy.For entree, i ordered the Costoletta Di Maiale. It is a big thick meaty cut of a bone-in pork chop. It came on a wooden cutting board. My friends eyes all bulged as the beast was presented in front of me. It was seasoned beautifully. You could taste all the italian herbs on the outside of the pork. The inside meat was a bit dry for my taste, but it was cooked through and through. It did get juicier as I worked my way toward the bone. Unfortunately, the plate was too beastly for me, and I coudln't finish it.Overall, the food is nice and decently priced. Some of the desserts sounded nice but i was too full to try them. Apps were solid, and the staff refilled our waters quite frequently. A nice casual Italian place in Hell's Kitchen.",3,0,1,Thomas A.,"Watertown, MA",329,895,435
1.0,7/10/2011,"G-A-R-B-A-G-E.  This was one of the worst restaurant experiences of my life.  I've lived in this neighborhood since 2004, and have seen many restaurants come and go, and I hope this one doesn't stick around much longer.   I'm with 6 other people, and we know we're going to have to wait for a table, the place is busy on a Saturday night.  The awkward hostess who's attitude is similar to that of Wednesday Addams says the wait will be 20-25min.  She will call us on our cell when the table is ready, as we're going across the street for drinks because this bar was also full.  Patiently we're sipping on our cocktails at an asian-fusion place across the avenue.  We receive a phone call over 40min later, and when we return to the restaurant Wednesday Addams tells us that the table is NOT ready yet, and they're ""just waiting for the people to get up"".  20 minutes later, the people get up, table is cleared, and we sit.  This was over an hour wait, for a restaurant that is already rubbing me the wrong way.  The sexy waiter approaches the table with thick brown curly hair, his shirt unbuttoned just so, and a sexy Italian accent that could quite possibly make up for everything that just happened.  Nope, it doesn't.  As he begins to introduce himself, and explain the specials, he stops abruptly to bid a farewell to each and every person of a 12-top table leaving the restaurant as we are eagerly and patiently waiting for him to finish his good-byes, so we can get on with OUR dining experience.  We're sitting at the large table at the window, and it's almost as if they sit us here to display what poor service they can give to the world!   After saying goodbye to 12 people, he turns his head back to us and finished explaining the specials of the night.  We quickly give him our drink order.  20 minutes, the drinks arrive.  20 minutes later, realizing that our waiter has not come back for our food order, another waiter by the name of Carlos was kind enough to notice the lack of service at this end of the restaurant and takes the food order for our scumbag of a waiter.  We give him our food order, and I ask him to remove the empty wine glasses from the table that's been sitting there for over 40 minutes, since none of us ordered wine. (Someone WILL break them too)  We get our food, it's not GREAT Italian, and not once were we approached and asked how was everything.  NOT once.  The service was akin to that of a tired old MTA bus driver who does NOT want to let you off on the undesignated stop because it is only 9:57 and not 10:00.  4-star prices with 1-star service.  To top it all off, the 20% gratuity was INCLUDED in our bill.  Though the deserved 11%, we didn't argue, as the ambiance and energy of this bootleg Italian restaurant left us all eager to get the hell out of there, and drink our sorrows away.",1,0,0,Mr. R.,"New York, NY",4,36,0
3.0,7/4/2011,"Pros:I would highly highly recommend the sea scallops (melt in your mouth!) and the trennette al pesto. The appetizers were solid: specifically loved the mussels in white wine and garlic and the bruschetta with wild mushrooms and truffle olive oil.Cons:With the exception of the above, the food was mediocre - particularly disappointed in the gnocchi (way too much tomato sauce; tasted kind of like it came out of a jar) and the asparagus (drowning in brown butter sauce).  Though none of the food was particularly bad, few of the dishes were impressive.The worst thing was really just the incredibly slow service.  Maybe it was because we came here on a holiday, but it took us 25 min to get our orders taken and 30 minutes to even get bread.  We were at the restaurant for a total of 2 hours, with perhaps 15-20min of actually consuming food. In summary, I would come here again just for wine and appetizers, but the slow service and price wasn't worth it for dinner (at ~$18-20 per dish).",0,0,0,Anne L.,"Manhattan, NY",160,70,23

4.0,6/9/2011,"Stumbled into this place by chance. My girl friend and I were in the mood for drinks and we passed by Bocca Di Bacco. The exterior and the crowd (Wednesday night) drew us in. We ended up sharing a special home-made pasta with seafood ($26) and some really good and strong cocktails! We fell in love with the pasta completely and were already talking about coming back while we were finishing the plate in record time. $26 for a pasta entree is a bit much but the portion was big enough to share with my girl friend. We also saw people ordering antipasta, baked scallops (4 giant scallops!), braised short ribs...man, I am hungry already! The atmosphere was lively, decor was pleasantly Italian, a bit loud but good for big groups. I am actually considering coming here for my birthday. Service was friendly but waiter forgot our drinks and had to remind him after the entree came. The place was packed on a wendesday night, what did that tell you? It is definitely worth a try.

Then we each had main dishes included penne, raviononi (with shellfish), trenette al pesto, and grilled pork. I would recommend the raviononi to whom love seafood.

3.0,5/12/2011,"Having dined at the Hell's Kitchen location, I had high expectations when I dined at the new UES location this past Tuesday.It was a Birthday celebration and we called ahead to make an 8pm reservation for 5 ladies. Having just opened on Monday 5/9, they were still working out some kinks. The first kink. Over the course of 40 minutes, a very attentive Maitre'd continuously checked in with our group to give us updates on the stage of the dinner  party that was apparently holding up our reservation. ""They are just finishing a final glass of wine"" ""They have decided to order dessert"". I mean, thanks for the updates.. but last time I checked a reservation is supposed to help you avoid this exact situation? We were finally,  very apologetically seated by our Maitre'd at 8:40. Upon learning that it was a Birthday celebration, he immediately whisked over a bottle of Prosecco and toasted the Birthday girl - earning back some points for the 40 minute wait. Second kink. We proceeded to order a bottle of the house red from a very extensive wine list representing almost every region in the country (and assortment of prices), and got caught up in conversation. Little did we know,  another 40 minutes would elapse before the Birthday girl grabbed the Maitre'd to alert him we were still waiting on the wine to which he responded "" I think he (the waiter) is sleeping"". The wine finally arrived, we toasted the birthday girl again and settled in for the meal. First arrived a basket of Italian stretch bread accompanied by sundried tomato paste. We nibbled the bread and agreed the meal was off to a good start. Next, we shared the toasted artichoke parmesian appetizer, served in a brown paper bag that made the flaky toasted artichoke layers reminiscent of french fries..only gourmet and not too greasy. The artichoke was perfect, was our parties consensus. Third kink. When the entree's arrived, the appetizer plates still had not been cleared by our ""sleeping"" waiter, who was actually very handsome and charming Italian (accent and all) whom my friends nicknamed ""Fat Kerev"" after the Grey's Anatomy character. Despite being a little slow, the authentic Italian accent and pace of life rubbed off on us a little.. and we were not annoyed by the slightly delayed service. Fourth kink. Once Italian Kerev scurried around the table to clear the appetizer plates, we dug into the entree's which were slightly disappointing. 3/4 of the group ordered the ""Water and Flour"" pasta with cherry tomatoes and crab, only to discover that we could have opened a can of tunafish and mixed in some pasta and saved $30. The other quarter of the party ordered the scallops which were succulent and delicious.Despite the rusty kinks, possibly the best decision we made all night was to follow up dinner with a second bottle of wine. Having waited 40 minutes to be seated, another 40 minutes for the wine, by the time we had finished dinner the restaurant was almost empty, other than a couple on a blind date and a Italian Kerev with a host of waiters hanging around the wine bar. Almost on cue, the warm cozy room turned into ""Club Bacco"" as the speakers started pumping some early 90's tunes. By now, my friends and I were having a blast (glass of prosecco, two bottles of wine deep) and we concluded that despite the 40 minute wait, Club Bacco has won over our hearts and stomachs (at least the artichoke and scallops) and we will be returning customers!",0,1,0,Anna G.,"Manhattan, NY",10,2,0

I ordered the tortellini and M had the trennette al pesto, but after a few bites we knowingly switched plates and I devoured his pasta. He didn't complain and finished all the tortellini. The meal, although good, wasn't worth $80. I can't see us coming back here too many more times.

This is a particular treat because lots of places that have great wine lists still have terrible offerings by the glass.

The atmosphere was nice and the wine selection was really excellent.  However, some minor things like cleaning the giant mirror would have been nice to get rid of all the smudges especially in the middle of the dining room.  And, playing a pop music station in a small Italian restaurant really was not the right music choice -- better for sports bar.The service was good overall but our server did not check on us to ask how the food was until we were done with out meal. The salad and the eggplant starter was very good but the bread on the table really should be warmed up and the olive oil needs some herbs added to it. The entrees were delicious. I had the lamb shank which was in a spicy red sauce and fell right off the bone -- one of the best lamb shank meals I have ever had. My wife and mother-in-law had the pasta dishes which they said were very good and home made.

It came with some clams and mussels which were all undercooked and not seasoned either.  (I actually did the ""spit this back into my napkin"" thing)  My friend had the spinach ravioli which was much better than mine, but still nothing to brag about.  We had a tiramisu for dessert also good, but nothing special.  My biggest problem was that they sat us next to the server station.  I asked if we could be moved but they were saving a number of tables for 4-tops so , and my feet got stepped on at least 4 times, and I got knocked in the shoulder once while I was eating.  Apologies were offered but why would you seat someone in a place where they  will be jostled the entire time?  All in all, if I were looking for a place to meet someone before a meal the bar is nice enough, but would not recommend eating there.",0,0,0,nicole h.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0

Everything needed a little more salt on it--the sardines, the pasta, the lamb. And bread at an italian restaurant should come hot, or with something special (sauce, olives, something).

3.0,1/11/2011,"Cute Italian restaurant, nothing fancy but nice, great date spot. I went to Bocca di Bacco for a NYE dinner date with the bf - it was busy but not crowded. We had to wait about 20 minutes even though we had a reservation, this was fine we had a drink at that bar, we weren't annoyed with the service until we were seated and waited to be greeted. and waited and waited. Finally our waiter Fabio comes over, it takes forever just to get drinks, we had to ask for the bread and when we wanted to finally order apps and the meal we could not get Fabio's attention if our life depended on it. The restaurant is not very big and we could see him walking around very clearly - but it seemed as though he was purposely avoiding eye contact - the bus boys did most of the work and they however, were very helpful and accommodating. I did really enjoy the food. Did a prosciutto spread for an appetizer as well as a meatball appetizer - the prosciutto was a much larger portion than the meatballs (they only give you 2 meatballs - this alone was not enough to split). For entrees we stuck with pasta - bf ordered a spinach tortellini which I thought was delicious but was a fairly small portion - not enough for my large guy with an appetite. Luckily, my pasta bolognese was quite large and I could barely dent it. Homemade pasta - which was delicious. Desserts were great as well (warm chocolate cake and cheesecake). I would definitely go back with hopes of having a less aloof waiter (dinner took about 2 hours for the 3 courses) . I don't know if it was just the night because it was NYE but they were bumping hip-hop/top 40s dance music on the speakers - it was a little bizarre.

My meal was delicious and the wine was very tasty. I did sneak a peek at the bill and WHOA was it big but it was a special occasion, right? Regardless, it was a nice time and there were absolutely no complaints about the meal. ALL of the appetizers were delicious -- i think they may have outshone dinner a bit. We got several-- an olive dish and a delicious creamy mozzarella and tomato dish were our favorites---  and there was plenty to share amongst 7 of us from each plate. It looks like they have a seasonal menu, which is always a plus. I'll be going back as soon as another special occasion comes up! I imagine it would be a wonderful date spot. Only reason it gets four stars was that they were a bit unattentive when we arrived. We had to stand awkwardly around waiting for the host even though the restaurant was empty during early dinner. We wondered if we should just grab a table or wait.

4.0,12/8/2010,"My girlfriend and I had 5:30 dinner reservations here on a Sunday after the Tut exhibition (no big whoop). We both liked the rustic look of the exposed brick wall and wooden, metal-strapped tables. There were hundreds of bottled wines on shelves that wrapped around the restaurant. It was a tiny bit trendy, but the dim lighting gave it a bit of a romantic feel away from the bar. This was just a small, private celebration of my girlfriend's 50th birthday that we would share together; without family or friends and we felt, afterward, that this place was just right for the occasion. We each started off with a glass of St Francis Chardonnay, I'm no connoisseur, but it was a nice, refreshing, middle-of-the-road chardonnay and a crisp taste with a hint of green apple. After looking at the menu, we ordered appetizers. We really wanted the grilled octopus, but they said it wasn't available so we opted for the Bruschetta Ai Funghi (toasted tuscan bread, wild mushrooms and truffle oil) and we also ordered the Quail with Polenta. Both appetizers were delicious, but the taste of the wild mushrooms and truffle oil on the focaccia was outstanding; we couldn't get enough of it.After appetizers, I was in the mood for red wine, and so I went with the recommendation of our waiter who was very nice and, since we both spoke Italian, I explained to him that I enjoy deep reds that are dry with a rather light finish and he brought me a glass of Montepulciano which is exactly what I had been looking at on the menu; that was the ticket! It reminded me so much of the wine my Nonno Peppe used to make RIP. Entrees were so delicious. I ordered for my lady and me and we shared the Branzino Grigliato (grilled sea bass filet, roasted potatoes, and broccoli rabe). The skin on the Branzino was crispy and the filet was moist and flaky. The broccoli rabe was nice, but could have used more garlic (hey I'm Italian). The Penne Gorgonzola, Noci, Piselli (penne pasta, imported gorgonzola cheese, green peas, walnuts) was decadent and outstanding. We both love gorgonzola cheese and surprisingly, it was not as overpowering as gorgonzola usually is and I think it was because of the addition of the walnuts. The subtle nutty taste along made the bite of the gorgonzola.It was a very nice meal for the evening. We walked off the meal by walking over to St Patrick's Cathedral and then over to the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Plaza to end a nice evening. We both decided that we would come back again.*NOTE:Has anyone noticed that the tables in many restaurants are getting smaller and smaller?

I wanted it all for myself!  These four items plus three glasses of wine ran us almost $90 before tip.Halfway through dinner, our server (who was a little odd, but appropriately attentive) offered us each a glass of the same blend I'd ordered when I first arrived, but at a discounted price ($11 per glass.  He said something about it being opened on accident or someone didn't like it.  It was a nice upgrade.   The service was pretty good.  MY chatty friend and I took forever to actually order and sat and talked a while after dinner, but we never felt rushed.

I asked him if they had any specials and he said yes. But I had to ask since he would not have given to them if I didn't. No other table around us received specials. We started off with the cheese appetizer and this was excellent. We love cheese and this cheese course was described as the chef's choice. We wanted to know what we were tasting but the waiter was no where around to describe the cheeses. When he arrived he wasn't sure until he went back to ask the kitchen what he had served us. Our bottle of wine that we had ordered was not even opened at the table. He opened in the wait station which was is poor in any restaurant especially one that touts itself as a wine bar. After opening the wine we proceeded to enjoy another appetizer and then our entrees, all were excellent. We never saw our waiter again until the check was presented.

The only weird thing was that the cheese didn't come with any bread or crostini, which made trying some of the cheese difficult (especially the soft ones). That being said, we asked for bread and it was swiftly delivered to our table. Which brings me to my next point- love the service here. Everyone is sweet and friendly and really good at their jobs. So refreshing! For mains, there are a ton of great options, though I highly recommend the penne w osso bucco. One of my favorites!

Food and Drink - this is where they shine.  i was impressed with every dish we had, including the bread.  a number of antipasti dishes i wanted to try but stomach wouldn't have been able to handle it.. so we got the following..Involtine De Melanzane E Ricotta - eggplant involtine with imported buffalo ricotta and mint leaves - very tasty and filling appetizerProsciutto and Melon - special off the menu but very good and presented nicely.  but very pricey.  $18 for something that could be done at home..Tortelli Ricotta E Spinaci fresh ricotta and spinach stuffed tortelli, butter sage, green asparagus, parmesan - nice summer pasta dish that was light and tasty but portion size was small. fortunately apps were much larger sizeGarganelli Ossobuco home-made garganelli pasta, braised ossobuco - excellent dish that was hearty and fillingDessert - walnut tartufo - very good. great great dessert/drink i believe it was calld Sgroppino? like an italian slushie..this could become a signature dessert for them (not sure if its common elsewhere?)Overall - good restaurant for the hells kitchen area.  food is excellent but service could be a bit better.  wine selection seemed to be pretty good although i need to improve my knowledge of italian wines.  i would definitely go back and try some more of the menu and hope to bump it to a 4 star",0,0,0,Douglas L.,"NY, NY",19,15,0
1.0,5/20/2010,"My parents and I decided to try this restaurant as a celebration for my mom's 60th birthday on Saturday night (May 8, 2010). It was recommended to us by a friend of mine, and since we're Italian, I figured - let's give it a shot. The restaurant is nice enough inside - very quaint, wine-bar-esk ambience and cozy. Unfortunately, we were led to a table in the back that was conveniently located right next to a large canister to catch the water that was dripping from the ceiling. Classy. First red flag.We sat down and the busboy greeted us, filling up our water. About ten minutes later he returned, again filling up our water. I asked him about a few things on the menu - I mean, was he our waiter??? I had no idea since NO ONE else had approached our table. He came back a few minutes later with some answers. A bit befuddled, I asked if we should order from him. He said, no - our waiter would be with us shortly. Did this mythical creature actually exist??? A few minutes later, the red seas parted and ""he"" did finally emerge. He quickly took our orders and that was essentially the first and last time we saw him. The busboy delivered our order later on, and of course - filled our water glasses. This guy was seriously hussling around the place working his tail off - many props to him. Perhaps a promotion is in order???So..the food. Nothing special  here. I had a pesto pasta which was a bit boring - very heavy on the pesto. My mom had the steak which was a little overdone. And my dad had the stuffed ravioli, which was the best out of all of ours. Although...there wasn't much competition.In all honesty, up to this point and the below average experience we had, I could have let it go. This review would probably not be written. HOWEVER. This last experience set me over the edge. This is what happened. We paid the bill and my mom - the birthday girl - went to use the bathroom, and my dad and I were catching up...especially since I haven't seen my parents in 5 months. In my experience dinner has always encompassed talking, catching up, etc.. If this is a crazy concept....someone, please set me straight. Apparently, the hostess was took this as her mission, because no more than 3 minutes after we had paid the bill, she came over to us and said ""I need this table."" EXCUSE ME??? I have never, EVER, in all my years dining at restaurants had someone tell me to essentially LEAVE. And keep in mind we got there at 6, and it was just over 7:00 at this point - about 7:10. Dinners typically run an hour and a half, and I am someone who - again, crazy concept - ENJOYS sitting down, relaxing, and talking to the people I am having dinner with. Enjoying my time, not looking at my watch. I am paying for this experience after all, I should be able to fully enjoy it without one-hour time constraints. Anyhow, I digress. My father and I were absolutely appalled at this, especially because this was such a momentous occasion for us. The ironic thing is, we were going to leave in about 5 minutes anyway, so if she would have just been polite and waited a few minutes, she could have had the table, sans her rude words. And don't get me wrong, I understand that sometimes things can go unplanned. Whoops - you booked someone for a 7pm table, thinking everyone likes to wolf down their food and jump out of your restaurant just as quick as can be. Whoops....you were wrong. But guess what - there is a much better way to go about this then telling me ""I need this table."" Why don't you invite us to move to the bar and give us free round of drinks? How about moving us to a smaller table to enjoy a dessert - on the house? Crazy concepts, I know. A win/win situation?? Who would want that? After all, at the end of the day, we're just 3 people. Unfortunately though...we are just 3 people who will never go back to your restaurant and will continue to tell everyone we know what a terrible experience it was. It's a shame that this one hostess essentially left this lasting impression on us. She had no tact whatsoever and had no idea how to handle a situation - if dealt with in one of the ways I described above, the mediocrity of the evening would have been trumped with ending everything on a positive note. I would have probably still wrote a review...but it would have been positive. A little friendliness goes a long way.",0,0,0,Gabrielle W.,"San Francisco, CA",3,13,0

2.0,5/12/2010,"I was in the area on Sunday and noticed their menu.  I was impressed by the rich selection of primi and secondi dishes.  This seemed like a nice place to have a robust, leisurely Italian lunch.  Unfortunately, when I sat down and was handed the menu, it bore no resemblance to the menu posted outside.  Apparently on Sunday, they use a different menu, a brunch menu.  Say goodbye to the garganelli ossobucco or the stinco or the branzino.  My choices now were scrambled eggs, pancakes, french toast, etc.  Really?  I asked if it were still possible to order from their regular lunch menu, but I was informed that was simply not possible.  Really?  So my vision of a delightful, traditional Italian lunch has been reduced to whatever Italian dishes I could manage to find on this largely American menu.Truth be told, there were still traditional Italian appetizers like prosciutto and melon or an Italian cheese plate, but culinarily these are hardly interesting dishes.  They are the sort of small plates I routinely prepare at home to have a snack.  I opted simply for the spaghetti e gamberi.  How disappointing.  The spaghetti was nicely dressed with the sauce, but the sauce was not especially good.  It was flat save for the flavors from the slivers of garlic and the less than fresh arugula.  The shrimp were small, shriveled, and notably overcooked and unseasoned.  This dish is so easy to prepare well at home, I was surprised to see this inferior version on display at an Italian restaurant.The restaurant itself has a lovely decor.  The detailed use of wood lent a bucolic ambience to the restaurant.  Visually everything was striking.  I think this would be a great place to meet a girl for a glass of wine,  I would just suggest having dinner elsewhere.",3,0,2,Jim U.,"Washington, DC",690,1303,3044

Not an insignificant amount of cash to be pulling out for a meal. Seriously? You can't get your shit together for credit card acceptance? Most establishments of this type would have about three machines running. Overall, I was not that pissed, but not that impressed. It might be a place for drinks, but not if you want serious Italian food for dinner.Pros: great selection of wine (an entire menu spread of vino), nice ambiance for post-work drinks and if you want a quick meal.Cons: short of spectacular food, entirely detached staff, very long and narrow sort of restaurant setup which stopped me short from enjoying the ambiance.",2,2,2,Renee K.,"New York, NY",217,69,15
5.0,11/23/2009,"Delicious!  Dined here on Saturday with a large group and everything that everyone got was great.

4.0,11/17/2009,"Bocca di Bacco is nothing like Buca di Beppo. There's no huge portions, no red/white checkered table clothes nor statues of chubby chefs looking down on you while you're eating. It's a small, narrow restaurant with a warm ambiance (think dim lighting and dark wood) with a great bar in the front (huge selection of wines on tap and well-executed cocktails.)My friend Jenni K. recommended this restaurant for appetizers & drinks (thanks JK!) and said that it had some really good dishes, so we checked it out on a poppin' Saturday night.Instead of waiting 30 min for a table, we decided to eat at the bar. There was only 1 bartender & 1 barback, but man they move fast. I've never seen 2 pairs of hands work so quickly - it was as if I was watching them in ""fast-forward"" while my lazy ass sat there in amazement.Below is a review of only appetizers and desserts - no entreesHighlights:-Wine selection: huge & easy to have a taste from the tapped wines-Grilled Octopus: Yum! great consistency - very well cooked-Crabcake: REALLY good, and the mushrooms were a great addition-Italian Smoothie: Very light and refreshing. Supposedly hard to find outside of Italy.-Warm Chocolate Cake: good semi-sweet chocolate that oozed from inside.Mid-lights:-Crostini: ""fancy pizza"" as a friend called it. It was tasty, but not amazingLow-lights:-Quail & polenta: The flavors were there for this bacon-wrapped quail, but it was overcooked and too dry to eat. Service: -2 hostesses w/ 1 who didn't seem to have a clue. (possibly new)-The bartender was not the friendliest at first. We even commented to ourselves ""if he just smiled even a little bit, it'd be nicer."" But as the night progressed, and the restaurant mellowed a little bit more, he began to loosen up and became more charming. He makes some really fantastic-looking drinks!

Having traveled throughout Italy I so excited to see a restaurant with the atmosphere that reminded me of Tuscany and Umbria. And excited about food from different regions. Well on that visit I was guided to the communal table. Ok...I played along. The food was not what I remembered from Italy but it was decent until dessert came. I ordered their homemade Tiramisu which was rather hard and crunchy. Hmmm. I complained and they were apologetic saying that they served it too early, it was not ready as yet. Hmmm...grumpy me left never to return...until today for brunch. See my neighbors and friends rave about this place so I figured that I should give it a go.Unpon entering everyone was friendly and polite...YES!I ordered the Belgian Waffle...sorry, out of it.And also out of chicken...oh well...cheese omelette I said.They serve a nice assortment of mini muffins instead of bread. They were rather cold...and..burnt on the bottom.  The omelette arrived with lovely looking potatoes...cold too.The omelette while warm had no taste...lots of salt and pepper helped but with four different types of cheese, there should be some flavor. And the omelette was almost rubbery in texture almost looking like it was a pre-made store bought omelette.  (I am not sure such a thing exists but if it did, this would be it.)Everyone I know raves about this place...but so far, I just don't get it.I will try it again, for dinner one night.

My fiance and I ended up having a great meal although the service was mediocre.  There were long pauses in between each plating and the check took forever.I went again a week later with a friend. The same hostess was there and of course was cold as usual. My friend and I sat at the bar and shared appetizers. The cheese plate was AMAZING. As was the wine.  What was inconsistent was the polenta appetizer dish-something was undercooked and off when compared to the week before.My friend was unfortunate enough to have to sit next to some guy at the bar who was chatting it up with this hostess. The hostess just stood there and talked loudly in my friend's ear for half of our meal. (so unprofessional) We were going to have dessert but my friend was so disturbed by the conversation going on next to her that we left and had dessert somewhere else.The decor is simply amazing-I love the warm ambiance-it is unfortunate that the staff does not live up to the inviting atmosphere.,1,0,0,mere s.,"New York, NY",1,2,0

I sadly cannot remember the name of the dessert, but it was WONDERFUL!  It was chocolate ice cream rolled in a walnut chocolate powder on top of freshly made whip-cream and chocolate syrup, and a custardy-vanilla in the middle of the chocolate ice cream.  My description does not do it justice, especially because their presentation was so beautifully executed.  On top of my fabulous four courses, you also get bread and bruschetta with your meal... as everything else, the bruschetta was fresh and delicious!  Other pluses, the service was friendly and gave good recommendations, the atmosphere is very cool, and although I don't usually spend as much as I did for this meal on dinner, my meal was still under $50 with tip... in other words, things weren't cheap... but they also weren't over-priced.",0,0,0,Jennifer S.,"New York, NY",16,692,0

Our sommelier helped us pick out some wine and we were given a bread basket to start with.  Things were going ok until the waiter came to take our order and was incredibly unhelpful and downright rude to one of my (girl) friends.  Later, when the bus boy brought out the appetizers, he snarled at another friend because she was talking and did not see that he was trying to squeeze a plate of salad onto the table.  The real treat came when our mains arrived and there were bones, yes that's right BONES, in my lamb pasta.  Absolutely disgusting.  I did not want to create a fuss and was already pretty full by the time the multiples bones went crunch under my teeth so didnt say anything.  Everyone at the table thought the food was ridiculously greasy and mediocre.  The desserts were significantly better ... or maybe it was just our low expectations at this point.  Anyway, the most compelling reason for giving this place one star is this : we split our bill across three credit cards and three days later my friend discovers from her online statement that she's been charged THREE TIMES more than she paid.  She calls the restaurant and gets nothing but RUDENESS and is told that one of the cards did not go through and so she was charged instead.  This is utter BS since she calls us up immediately, we all check our bank statements and see the correct charge from the dinner.  She calls back and ends up arguing with the restaurant for 10 minutes, eventually hanging up with no assurance of a refund and no apology.

It serves solid Italian (don't know if it is super authentic or not) cuisine and also has a good wine list (not a wine expert, but trying to learn). The door itself is pretty heavy, so you need to give a good yank at the door handle! =) but as you get in, you would be pleasantly surprised by the warm and rustic ambiance. In the front, there is a long bar with bar stools. A cool place to hang out with a quick glass of wine. The bar food/appetizers are great, especially the cured meat platter and bruschetta (mushroom). For the main dishes, fettuccine bolognese and ravioli was pretty good and I really liked their scallops. Lamb wasn't as good as I thought it would be but it was alright. One thing of note is that everytime I tried their specials, I was always disappointed. Last time I was there my date ordered the salmon (daily special version). She gave me a taste and it was bland and dry. Maybe that was the reason why the date didn't go well? Hahaha...;) But overall, I really like the food here. Some of the wait staff can be a bit overbearing (in a sense that they try to push you to order more than you would normally do) but overall, they were attentive without hovering. Most were knowledgeable about the wine they had and were able to give pretty good recommendations if you give them a description of the type of wine you want and the price range. If you are taking someone out for a date (which I do recommend), please make sure you do not sit near the door leading to the kitchen (the door makes a rather large noise when it closes) and one of the cash register (right next to it a door leads down to the basement/storage).The restaurant did start to accept other credit cards (well atleast visa) but make sure to call and check.",1,0,0,Tae Hun K.,Hong Kong,4,67,0
5.0,3/17/2009,"I made a reservation for 8 at 4pm on a Friday evening for 6pm. They accommodated me. I showed up at six with two other folks and waited a half hour for everyone else in our group. They did not throw a stink about it and in fact were really nice to us. I came here fully expecting to be disappointed, as I usually am trying a new Italian place -- especially over in Hells Kitchen, which I find hit-and-miss and usually the latter.But this place was great. Everyone in my group was very happy with the choice. I wasn't the biggest fan of my gnocchi (should've gotten the black pasta seafood special or the ravioli di zucca, which were both phenomenal) but I didn't even care. The pear/beet salad was a big winner and so were the meat and cheese plates. And the bill was not bad at all...three bottles of wine, three apps and dinner for 8 was $480 with a good tip included - $60 per person. I dunno about you, but to me that was a great price for a quality Manhattan dinner.The wine list was extensive and the bartender was even able to pinpoint a wine for my wife that she loved just based on her tastes. And wait til you see the many bottles available by the glass due to their (probably very expensive) ""wine on tap"" refrigeration system thingy. If you love wine, go see it...it's neat!So yeah, a five-starrer for me. Great night, nice atmosphere, good food and wine and lots of fun. Highly recommended.",0,0,0,Rich O.,"Astoria, NY",1,18,0

4.0,2/13/2009,"I decided to try Bocca di Bacco before going to see Placido Domingo's performance because it's located fairly close to the Lincoln Center. Loved the sophisticated and rustic ambiance! Me and my friends ordered different dish so that we can try each other's food and compare. Our favorite was ossobuco alla milanese - a braised beef shank that's served with risotto.  The meat was so tender and delicious, and risotto was so flavorful and yummy! It was expensive ($32!!!) but was worth it.  And our second favorite was spinach tortellini, oh so good!! I don't recommend their linguini alla vongole because it was too salty. Their desserts are sooo delicious too! Again, we ordered different desserts and our favorite was their chocolate souffle, hands down!!  This place is going to be my favorite pre-theatre dinner restaurant!",1,0,1,Jewel Y.,"New York, NY",33,789,3513
3.0,2/4/2009,"To be fair, the food turned out to be a 'four star', in my book. However, the service and ""ambiance"" were both on the 'three star' side.Firstly, I was greeted at the door (without having a reservation) very nicely. But after requesting a table for three, the hostess told me they only took American Express and Cash. Ummmm?? That's not a problem for me. In fact, I knew that before coming, so why is the hostess telling me now?? It just doesn't scream 'welcome and enjoy dinner'. Slightly tacky, I think.We were seated by the bathrooms, which really isn't a problem for me at all (any seat is a good seat without a reservation), but there was an ATM shining brightly between the bathroom doors. That, too, cried tacky to me.The server (his name was Geza) was definitely not my cup of tea. He treated my friends and me as if we were nothing but another cover to add to his night. I could tell he was aggravated that only one of us ordered wine, and I could tell he was even moreso aggravated when we didn't each order 3 courses. I've always been a great tipper, so that shouldn't have concerned him anyway, but I could visibly see his frustration. That was probably the most disappointing aspect of the night. But onto the food. I started with Chef's selection of Crostinis which were absolutely delectable. (Although the waiter failed to identify what Crostini varieties the Chef had chosen for us, so I can't tell you exactly what was on them). The tomatoes (San Marzano, I think) were very fresh, and the cheese (pecerino, maybe?) was very high quality. The procuitto was to die for-- soft, but intense with flavor. For a second course I got the Homemade Linguine Bolognese, which was one of the best pastas I've had in quite some time. There was just the right proportion of veal, pork, and beef atop perfectly al dente pasta and tomato. Definitely the highlight of the night.I ended with the Lamb Chops with Mashed Potatoes. They were certainly nothing to write home about. I enjoyed it, overall, but it certainly wasn't a memorable dish. Adequate, at best.The wine list really is exceptional, though. Although I don't think my waiter paired my description with the best glass, I was very impressed by the selection. I also very much appreciated the 'tasting' option (3 oz. glasses for very reasonable prices).Should you still be reading, I'll touch on the ""ambiance"" problem. The place is just over-the-top, in my opinion. The tables are clothless, boasting a rustic wood, faux antique type look-- that's fine, I guess, but I felt like there should be wood chips on the floor or something tactless like that to go along with the themed tables. The servers wear potato sack aprons (far too cheesy for my taste), and the photography decorating the walls is black-and-white New York circa 1960 glamor shots -- they certainly don't blend with the ""rustic"" atmosphere the restaurant all too desperately tries to pull off. Definitely a solid three-star, A-OK, experience, but it's the food that is to thank for that.",1,0,0,Seth A.,"New York, NY",0,6,0

2.0,1/3/2009,"My husband and I had walked past this quaint looking restaurant so many times we started not to notice it, but it was 17 degrees outside and we needed to kill an hour, so we hurried into the bar for a drink.We were immediately impressed with the extensive wine list and cozy surroundings and enjoyed our drink.  We had made plans to come back and have dinner and wanted to try several things on the menu.  Then it came time to pay the bill and get to our reservation.  It was difficult to get the bartender's attention ( we were one of four people sitting at the bar - he was deep in conversation with a co-worker) and when we put our Mastercard down we were then informed that the restaurant only accepts cash or American Express, but that they have an ATM for our convenience.  He then left us and returned to his conversation without dropping a check while my husband went to the ATM in the back.    I flagged him down once again to ask for a check so we could be ready when my husband returned.   This is not a pizza place or deli, so excuse me, a nice restaurant doesn't accept all major credit cards and has an ATM in the back so they can charge unsuspecting patrons another two dollars per transaction?

4.0,12/13/2008,"I came to Bocca di Bacco last night for dinner on a Friday night at 7pm. This place is truly hidden - there are no signs outside, you just have to know where you're going. The place had a decent amount of patrons without being too packed, and we were able to sit down without any wait and there were still a good number of tables available thereafter.This place is very cute and has a romantic intimate feel to it. Their space boasts of hundreds of wine selections stocked up around the perimeter of the restaurant. The tables are dimly lit with candles on each table. The bar countertops are also very roomy in case you'd like to dine at the bar.Our server, a girl, was extremely nice and helpful and offered her opinions and advice numerous times. She let us have a taste of two different wines before even deciding what we wanted to order. We opted for the Primavera red wine which was great - a perfect medium bodied wine. She was very knowledgeable about the selections.We skipped out on ordering appetizers and went straight to the entrees. I ordered spinach and ricotta tortelli in a buttery sage sauce, and my bf ordered the saffron sauce seared red snapper with clams and mussels. The food came out quite fast, and I was pleased because I was getting pretty hungry. Both were tasty and excellent, but our only qualm was that the portion sizes were kind of tiny and not enough to make you full. We ate all the bread in the basket and we don't normally eat carbs like that!All in all, a pretty enjoyable experience, and pretty convenient as it's only one avenue away and one block away from my bf's place. The decor is great and so is the vibe. I would come back here again to try the grilled octopus that everyone has been raving about here.

But once the food got there, it more than made up for it.Started off with the grilled octopus, fresh and tasty, not rubbery like I was fearing. Had the sweet sausages, served over steamed broccoli and spinach. Great flavors together. Also had the raviolini de pesce, which was fresh as well, featuring clams and mussels. Topped it off with the chocolate souffle served with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream. The souffle was rich, but a bit heavy. The ice cream paired well.Be prepared to read the menu in almost complete darkness, they keep the lighting low to sustain the mood. A bit loud as well, but can't really expect anything else as it is a great place to eat with a group of friends. All in all a great meal. Funny thing was, service took a while to get to us, but once we raised our check, three people converged. Weird. But like I said, everything we had was worth the wait.

We were a bit lucky not to wait.The food: We shared an appetizer of prosciutto, tomatoes, mozarella with olive oil and basil.  The flavors of everything were so fresh and intense, it was basically amazing and I couldn't wait for my entree, the branzino.  Unfortunately, the fish was really good but didn't live up to expectation given the quality of the first course.  Maybe they should turn down the excellence of that appetizer a bit...  Anyhow, the branzino had crisp skin (yum!) and juicy meat, but was a little bland.  The dessert was tasty, too.The wine:Obviously, this is a wine bar so it has a nice selection of whites, roses, reds and sparkling at many price points.  My slight beef with the place is that we wanted rose (yes, it's a little cliche, but whatever) and the waiter gave us one that was a little too sweet to have with savory foods.  It worked with the tomatoes and cheese, but failed against my fish and K.'s gnocchi.  As we ate, we realized, that our rose was what every waited pushed on every indecisive table.  It made me wonder if they just pick a bottle and sell it... hmmm...Well, 3 stars is probably a little harsh, but my standards are rising (damn you, Yelp!).  This place is pretty awesome and that appetizer alone transported me to Cinque Terre, if only for a few minutes.  The menu has many more dishes that I am curious to try (white asparagus with prosciutto and poached egg, osso bucco) so K. and I will definitely be back.",2,0,1,Diane A.,"Manhattan, NY",30,145,0
