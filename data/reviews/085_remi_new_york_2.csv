From greeting to service to the end of dinner dark chocolate short bread cookie. Loved the tomato sauce and goat cheese bread dipping sauce that came along with the bread basket. I came alone and everyone was so sweet and the food was sooo good! I put 4.5 stars on the ravs only because the sage wasn't crispy.

5.0,1/18/2019,This is 10/10 my favorite restaurant to go to when I'm in NYC. My mom and I always make it a priority to eat here because the food is absolutely divine and the service is spectacular. They give LOADS of free bread and a darling appetizer dip on the house. You can't go wrong with any of their dishes but the Tangilini Lemon is by far one of my favorites! Finish off the meal with their signature cookies and you are set! I honestly adore this place and would recommend it to anyone looking for the best Italian in town.,0,0,0,Nicole P.,"Kissimmee, FL",315,2,1

The Bolognese was flavorful, the pasta is homemade and fresh. The lobster bisque came topped with a heaping amount of jumbo lump crab meat and the serving size was extremely generous.  I was in town for a girls weekend and Carlos was sure to provide complementary prosecco and a chocolate molten cake for dessert! A wonderful touch. I will definitely be back again when in town!",1,0,0,Ashley H.,"Atlanta, GA",168,8,8
4.0,12/28/2018,"My family and I came to Remi after a trip to MoMA. It's a pretty good choice for splurging on a family meal close to the museum and other midtown attractions, especially if location is one of your main selection criteria. Overall, the experience was fine, though if you're going to spring for an expensive meal in the city, I would say your dollar goes farther if you explore outside midtown for your meals.For entrees, my parents and I tried different pasta dishes, as Remi notes with pride that its pasta is made in house. I had spaghetti with clams, and while I did enjoy the pasta itself, the dish felt surprisingly heavy, with more oil and less wine/zestiness than I would have liked. My parents had an eggplant dish with a tomato base, and enjoyed their meal.My brother had steak, and I got to try a little. I was impressed with the taste, and the sides (potatoes and spinach) were a nice addition.We all got different desserts - I tried the cheesecake, which was rich but a little dry, with a mango sauce pooled underneath the dish that didn't add much in the way of flavor. My parents tried the tiramisu, which they enjoyed. And my brother got the meringue, which he also said was good. Like the entrees, desserts were fine, but nothing spectacular.The space is really nice, with high ceilings and beautiful artwork. Lighting is great, and the ambience is good for small groups without getting too noisy or stuffy. The service was solid, with multiple staff helping out at our table. I am not sure why they got dinged for service in other reviews, but I had no issues with our experience near the start of dinner service during a touristy time of year.",1,1,1,Cyrus A.,"Manhattan, NY",154,138,167
1.0,12/26/2018,Avoid Remi. The service was sub par and the food even worse. We had 3 pasta selections and the Osso Bucco - all lacked flavor. You would be better off getting pasta from your local pizza place and it would be cheaper too. Our whole party left wholly disappointed. We definitely regret dining here.,0,0,0,Chris S.,"Hillsborough Township, NJ",0,1,0
4.0,12/25/2018,"Had a delightful Christmas dinner with friends at Remi. My friends started with polenta and mushrooms (app #1) and a caprese salad (app #2) that looks great. I tried the polenta and loved the texture as well as the woodsy flavor of the mushrooms. I ordered a delicious mushrooms soup that was drizzled with my favorite, albeit predictable, truffle oil. I could have easily eaten two bowls, especially with extra focaccia. I no longer eat dairy, so I didn't try my friends' dishes - both the bolognese and the pappardelle in pink sauce looked incredible tho. I ordered the penne arrabiata. SAVE BREAD FOR THIS!!! The arrabiata sauce is so incredible, I am almost embarrassed to admit using my finger to discreetly eat every drop off the plate. Probably not as discreetly as I'm hoping. The pasta is served a bit more al dente than I am used to, but I adore that. Use your teeth, people. This isn't an issue for me, at all, but it is worth mentioning because many people might find it too undercooked. The service was excellent, albeit slow. That is the only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars. Based solely on food and service quality, 5/5!!",0,0,0,Jack W.,"North Bergen, NJ",3,17,45
1.0,12/25/2018,"Horrible attitude from staff and the manager. Unbelievably slow staff, took them 80 minutes to pit our food down on our table. Worst pasta we have ever had!

2.0,12/14/2018,"Wow. Packed but seriously hit or miss. The appetizer was amazing. Antipasto for two was well laid out and delicious. Our cocktails were perfect. The mojito my wife had was well made and my Johnnie Black was a fair pour at a good price. Meal went south after that. The pasta was to be al dente and more like undercooked. The fra diavolo was tepid and less than diavolo (bland) and the clams tiny. To cap an off night the wine (tuscan) had sediment in chunk form. Adrian our waiter graciously said ""oops"".

1.0,11/14/2018,"As a patron of this restaurant for many years, I was extremely turned off by how I was treated by the hostess upon entering the establishment. My mother and I had come from shopping and when we told the hostess we would not be checking our bags in, we were fine, she proceeds to tell us ""what do you think we are, a diner?, we cannot have your bags all over"". She also told us she would be seating us at the last table of the restaurant to not be seen as if that was a punishment for me not checking items in at the door. Meanwhile, as more patrons entered they all had bags and winter coats at their tables and were ""seen"". Esmee (I made sure to ask her name before I left) was so unprofessional and downright rude that I wish I  had walked out altogether because that interaction spoiled what should have been an enjoyable meal. No customer deserves to be treated the way I was tonight and they've definitely lost a long time customer. It's a shame that this is what has become of this restaurants service.",0,0,0,Amanda C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0
1.0,11/9/2018,"Service was a disappointment even at expensive Chef's TablePlease note that I first reached out to Remi via their Contact option on their website to give them a change to respond. It's been 6 days since I contacted them and I have not heard back. Therefore I am writing the same review here in a public forum. In summary, my waiter was unprofessional and snapped at me when I reminded him I had ordered a coffee 25 minutes earlier.   In a condescending voice he told me it was on it's way.  25 minutes later I never received my coffee and had to ask again for myself and my friend who hadn't received her Cappuccino.   No apologize was ever made and we were still charged for the coffee and Cappuccino.  From the time I ordered the Coffee and the eventual time that I received it almost and hour had passed. This behavior is unacceptable at a fine dine restaurant. To top it off my friends and I had splurged for the Chef's table to celebrate my friends 40 birthday.  I feel like the servers didn't care as they knew the tip would already be included and didn't have to try.One added note: Many of us had ordered the Chocolate Cake, Cioccolatissimo, that takes 18 minutes to prepare.  Most fine dining restaurants will take not of when people are getting close to finishing their main dishes and ask if anyone plans on ordering a dessert that take a lot of time to prepare to reduce the time in-between main dish and dessert.    Regardless coffee is usually promptly brought after ordering. This wait staff didn't bring any coffee out until after the deserts were  delivered.   For two of us, 30 minutes after desserts were delivered.",1,0,0,Michael S.,"Cambridge, MA",1,3,1
3.0,11/8/2018,"i have been coming to Remi since the early 90's . The food is always good and the ambience very pleasant . I was there recently on a rainy Monday with the restaurant one third full . The restaurant was darker than usual , the waiter said the candles were coming on Tuesday . We asked to move to a brighter table and were offered an unattractive  corner table where two of the four would be looking at a wall . We asked to have an empty table and were told no this table was reserved . This was a regular table with nothing special , not even in a special place just a regular table , nobody calls a restaurant and reserves specific tables unless there are views to be had and with the restaurant half full , the suggestion of a reserved table was hardly credible and I said so . the response from the woman maître d , ""are you calling me a liar ? "" had I not been meeting some business colleagues I would have walked out . Don't forget Remi ,we consumers have a choice where we spend our $400 for four and NYC has lots of choices so less attitude and more attention to making sure your paying customers are happy otherwise your days as a going concern are likely to be numbered",1,0,0,M J.,"Plainsboro Township, NJ",0,2,0

The venue is spacious with its own private entrance, a mini bar, lounge and private toilet for guests' convenience and to top it all you don't even have to pay for it.Our table ordered few appetizers to share such as Antipasto Misto All'italiana, an assortments of Italian cold cuts with parmesan, pecorino cheeses served with pickled vegetables, La Classica Caprese, fresh imported buffalo mozzarella, tomatoes, basil and olive oil and Polpetta di granchio con maionese di peperoni affumicati which is baked crab cakes served with smoked pepper aioli sauce. Our table truly enjoyed the appetizers together with a bottle of Rose (Castel des Maures).For main entrée, I selected Spaghetti ""Remi"" preparati al dente, while others chose ravioli, risotto and venetian style calf liver or Fegato alla Veneziana.

I was a couple of minutes late and I asked hostess if I could look around to see if I can't find my friend. I got a very rude response that no one is here waiting for me. That was it for me.

5.0,5/9/2018,"I went to the event location for a wedding rehearsal dinner. It was fantastic!  We drove into the city from PA so we were early for the event. The manager allowed us to come in early, while they were still setting up, to sit and have a drink. When the event started we had cocktail hour outside in the breezeway. They closed the breezeway off to limit foot traffic walking through. I could not try any of the passed hors d'oeuvres as none were vegan. However, everyone was raving about them and a few people said the meatballs were the best they had ever tasted.  When we sat down for dinner, I told the waiter that I was vegan and didn't want to make a big deal of it so I said that the side items from the other prix fixe meals would be fine. First, they brought me out the salad that everyone else was eating, without the goat cheese, which was great! Then, for my meal they brought a plate of assorted roasted vegetables and beets, which were very flavorful!  I assumed that I would not eat dessert because the choices all had dairy but they brought my out a big bowl of assorted fresh berries!  The staff really went above and beyond to make the dinner a great experience.

They were the only restaurant to call me by my name properly. I ordered the endive salad with candied walnuts, pears and gorgonzola for my appetizer. So good. If I'm picky, it could have used more walnuts, but it was as I wanted it. I ordered their pumpkin filled ravioli with a butter-sage sauce. A full portion is 10 pieces,   which for an appetizer is a main meal. Holy wowza... One of the best Italian dishes I have eaten. I will dream of this dish when not in New York. The service was awesome. I ordered a Manhattan, and was asked what type of Whiskey/Bourbon I like in it, if I prefer it neat or on the rocks, how, etc... They wanted to get it right. I like it with one large ice cube. Easy... The evening ended with an okay chocolate cake. At that point, I was still wanting the taste of the pumpkin ravioli, so the cake was not going to live up to expectations, even if it was the best thing since sliced bread.

The dining room is spacious and the high ceiling and decorative murals transport you to another place.

We sat at a table in the center of the long dining area.Cocktails were ordered and they were prepared precisely as ordered. A Gibson, two cosmos and a bottle of beer. My wife likes her Cosmo with tequila and she thought it was perfect.Bread came with an interesting dipping oil and bit of sauce.  Tasty.Our server was very solicitous if at times a bit difficult to understand. We all ordered appetizers I had the carpaccio which was very good but there was a bit too much accouterment for me. Typically I prefer a simple carpaccio with a few capers, and bits of parmesan this one came with many greens and an overabundance of cheese.  Others enjoyed their appetizers one of us got the meatballs which were described as delicious.For mains we ordered a couple of the homemade pasta dishes and I got the Osso Bucco, which was served over a bed of risotto.  I tried but could not finish it all. All wonderful. We recommend any of the dishes and in particular the homemade pasta.My wife ordered a bottle of Ripasso, $65., which was perfect with our meal.

3.0,1/9/2018,"I came here for a work dinner in a private room. I would recommend the same space for a rehearsal dinner or other private group gathering because the space and service were good. Was the food that memorable? Eh. Also, I'm judgemental based on wine glasses and theirs were cheap small ones. I had a few of the passed foods at the start, but unfortunately all I remember are the tomato/mozzarella (always a crowd favorite), risotto balls of something (meh fine), and some chicken skewer (too big to eat as a finger food). However, the staff was very good at bringing these and the other options around frequently. The drink service was also attentive. For a salad we had the ""Insalata di Spinacino Ecologico, Prataioli e Pecorino Sardo"". I saw other people ate around the raw mushrooms. However, I like raw mushrooms, so thought it was great! Oh and the complimentary bread they bring with tomato dipping sauce was also delish. However, since we were clearly there in a large corporate/group setting, I wasn't about to dip my bread right into the dish. I wish they had brought a serving spoon out to serve the tomato sauce. Instead, I had to rely on my fork :-/ (...and fork with sauce isn't too effective...)For my main I had the filet - tasty... as were the mashed potatoes and veggie sides. Actually, I think the portion was pretty big too. And for dessert I had the chocolate cake. It was good and freshly baked, and I'm glad I got it, but actually the center wasn't molten or anything so  -eh. It was a little dry and I wish the ice cream ratio was higher So, I'd recommend this place, but more because I don't know many options in the area vs that it was actually so great itself",0,0,0,Caitlin B.,"New York, NY",3,280,35

It wasn't so much what she said but how she said it! I quickly checked her and told her that we no longer wanted to order drinks from her. We were quickly seated, which was great but then we waited another half hour for our drinks and 45 minutes for our soup and salad (which were not good). Our meals arrived quickly after our soup and salad (which lead me to believe our waiter forgot to put our food order in) and it wasn't good at all.

We tried a couple of martinis and they were excellent and a fun change from someone who doesn't normally drink martinis. We liked the French Kiss and Midtown Martini. The bread and tomato sauce with goat cheese they bring out complementary are EXCELLENT-- nice touch. I had the pumpkin ravioli with butter and sage and I was blown away.

Expectations were measured because I have not been to the restaurant - even thought I had worked around the corner for many years.  Staff was very accommodating and looked after us from beginning to end. We had some terrific wine which was recently added to the list from Orin Swift-great accomplishment to the meal.  The dinner consisted of several pasta dishes and the veal special.  All were well prepared. The one adjustment I would make is the pasta I had which was a little too oily even though it was tasty.  It was the angel hair whole-wheat pasta.  The appetizers were a few salads and they were great.

4.0,7/26/2017,"Oh man. I just ate my body weight times 50 in calories plus a ton of sodium. But after traveling across coasts, it was worth it.I was in the mood for some pasta and the concierge recommended Remi. It's close to the Hilton and was still open at 9:15 on a Wednesday night. Rather than taking a table solo, I opted for the bar.The menu is full of Italian names foods. I for sure had to read every description so I could figure out what I wanted to eat. I settled on the Tonnarelli (pasta with calamari, jumbo shrimp, and clams). Coming from the West Coast, I'd say the seafood on the East coast has a different taste. I loved the jumbo shrimp, tons of calamari, and clams in my pasta. It made it worth the $27.Prior to receiving my meal, I had a nice bread basket. It came with a tomato sauce and goat cheese. The sauce was too tomatoey (is that a word? Meh, it is now). The bartender was Josue F. Friendly guy. Did a good job.If you're staying at the Hilton (at least on the Club level), you get a 15% discount here. Make sure you bring your discount card.",4,2,6,Sierra R.,"Alameda, CA",390,287,507

First of all, working with the event coordinator, Rachel, was a pleasure. Every question we had was answered to our satisfaction, and she was helpful with suggestions.We had our ceremony in the atrium, followed by our cocktail hour, also in the atrium. The staff arranged the seats and plants beautifully, and took every chair down quickly to get the cocktail hour started after the ceremony was over. It was great. The passed around food was delicious, along with the stations that came along with the package. We then went into the Rialto Room, an artsy room with paintings all over. There is a private bar and private restrooms separate from the main restaurant. A classy, unique looking room with a great chandelier. My guests all loved it.The food was great. Oscar, the coordinator at the party, was an expert. We had everything we needed and if we asked for anything it was done immediately. Plus, he was always cheerful and  friendly. A pleasure. The service staff was also wonderful.All this for a very reasonable price. Our wedding was small, about 45 people, and it was the perfect amount for this size room.

Murals of Italy; Black & white striped booth seating, White table clothes, Tea-light candles etc. Tables are pretty close together, but you're in NYC so this is the norm and wasn't too uncomfortable (like some other local restaurants). Definitely a good environment for a variety of parties (business, romance, family etc.)Service: The service is always VERY attentive. We once had a bit of a wait despite having a reservation, and we were offered complimentary champagne, a complimentary appetizer, and complimentary cookies with our after-dinner cappuccino. Food: The food is simply delicious. If you like Italian cuisine, it's easy to find many of your favorites on this menu, along with some different/creative dishes you'd be eager to try. Homemade pasta is always the first thing I look for, and Remi does it right. They also offer weekly specials that have yet to disappoint. I'd recommend the (listed in English): Pear and Endive Salad (w/ gorgonzola and caramelized walnuts drizzled with honey), Homemade ravioli filled with imported sheep ricotta and spinach (tomato and butter-sage sauce), Homemade pappardelle (in pink sauce w/ melted mozzarella and basil), Homemade Ravioli filled with roasted pumpkin (butter-sage sauce), and the Grilled pancetta wrapped pork tenderloin.

4.0,5/30/2017,"Walk too fast and you will miss this restaurant awning. Keep your eyes peeled and you'll find Remi located at about the 6 1/2 Avenue site. The restaurant is a combination of businessmen on work meals to impress clients to tourists wanting a bit of reprieve from the local sights. Either way, enjoyed the calm and chicness of the restaurant. Expect waiters in vests and helpful maitre'ds. The tables aren't right on top of each other, but it can get tight in there if you bring a topcoat, etc. We made reservations for 4 people at 7pm on a weeknight. We were seated very quickly and attended to, with water and drink orders. Remi likes mood lighting, so everything has a yellow hue. My order was a Beet salad with artichokes, fried goat cheese and some greens. This was definitely larger than your usual salad appetizer: quite filling. For my entree, I ordered a Balsamic glaze pork tenderloins wrapped in bacon on a bed of risotto. Creamy risotto, and perfectly seared tenderloins. After my appetizer, I wasn't too sure how much of my entree I would finish, but I powered through it: it was that good.

Our waiter was super great with leaving us to chat and really didn't push us to order quickly, which we really appreciated! Since we were doing a lot of catching up and eventually some business-related talk, it was really helpful and much-welcomed. I had their tuna tartare appetizer and a mushroom risotto. They have a risotto of the day, but it was much too heavy for me. They were able to whip up a mushroom risotto for me and a saffron risotto for my boss. Great customer service! The food was delicious and the wine just kept on flowing throughout the night. At the end of dinner, they gave us a plate of Italian cookies to nibble on.

At first, we didnt' think anything of it because we figured it happened because it was a nice summer day. So, we tell the waiter and he gives me another glass of wine. So, we continue to talk and i take another sip of wine and again, I noticed another nat in my glass in the wine. So, my sister suggests we change seats. The waiter orders me anoter glass of wine and again , it happens that another nat goes into my drink. Needless to say, god knows, i could have ate them in my food. So, i ask to speak to a Manager and when the Manager comes over to me he tells me that this never happened before. I explained to him, that i'm not wearing any purfumes or anything. He then proceeds to tell me that this never happened before and maybe this is not the restaurant for me! I eat out all the time and i have never been spoken or told that the it wasn't the place for me! I would strongly suggest not to eat here as you don't know what you're eating and they obviously do not care about customer satisfactory!",2,0,0,Veronica S.,"New York, NY",13,2,0

4.0,8/30/2016,"Had a delicious, filing Italian meal at Remi!!  I came with a group of girls on a Saturday evening around 6pm.  No reservation and we were hoping since it was early we would be ok, and we were right !!  We were all dressed to the nines since we were celebrating, and as soon as we sat down we were served glasses of champagne on the house !! Amazing and we didn't even tell them we were celebrating something, so it was a wonderful surprise.Next, they brought out a bread basket and some amaazingly delicious ricotta tomato sauce dip which tasted heavenly. We started with the burrata served with prosciutto, along with the meat and cheese platter.  Everything was delicious.  Our eyes were clearly bigger than our stomachs because we started to get full but had ordered tons of pasta !!!  For our mains I tried the lasagna YUMMMM and the Marco Polo Ravioli which was filled with tuna.  Both were super delicious and the tuna ravioli had this wonderful taste of lemon zest.  We were wayyy too full for dessert but they brought a tray of cookies out for us.  (How did they know about my sweet tooth??)The only thing I did not really like was the service was a bit spotty, we ordered martini's and did not receive them until we got our main dinners.

I got the tuna tartar appetizer as my main course, which costs $17.50. It wasn't small or big. An above average appetizer portion I'd say. The best deal is the $29.95 lunch special my dad got.

I also ordered sauteed spinach in order to get some veggies in.  The Bucatini pairs well with the Super Tuscan.Orecchiette - Definitely looked easier to eat than my bucatini.  Just stab with a fork and you're done.  Looked good and my companion who is a foodie vouched for itChicken Suprema - This is free-range chicken that takes abou 20 minutes to prepare (so just slightly longer than other dishes).  It's served over a bed of beans and spinach.  Two people ordered this and both gave it two thumbs up, so happy to recommend this dish for those looking for a non-pasta entree",4,1,2,Elle W.,"Santa Monica, CA",208,285,372

The waiting staff was very friendly and attentive, our meal was served quickly and yet everything was sublime. The pesto had a great flavor, the lasagna had a nice bechamel in the layers and had a beautiful sauce (not too red!, and the salads were fresh and had great flavor. There was a great goat cheese spread with served with the bread that was a great touch to the Rosemary focaccia served in the breadbasket.

However a few things were just bad. The bread was fantastic and the goat cheese marinara spread was awesome as were the shrimp, carpaccio and scallop passed items. For pasta course with zucchini ""chips"" shrimp and eggplant was great. We had. Choice of mains including a steak which I tasted was great, the lamb chops looked great too. The Chilean sea bass was so over cooked it was horrible. It was a beautiful piece of fish just way over cooked and the sautéed spinach it was on was way salty. The ricotta cheese cake tart for dessert tasted gritty like it was from the cooler at any generic grocery store. Overall we truly had a great time but for the cost it is unacceptable for a few truly bad courses. I didn't say anything as not to spoil the great mood everyone was in, but on the ride home my wife who isn't that picky brought up my same complaints. If she says anything then I know it wasn't my fussiness. Again greT time but some outstanding flaws for this price point.My sister inlaw put his together and put lots of effort into it.

The tuna tartare and beef carpaccio were ordered and both were alright, nothing exceptional about either. The breads were good as well. I ordered the shrimp pasta in a balsamic sauce because it sounded different and it was in the list of classic dishes. It was meh, I didn't love it and didn't want to finish it. It wasn't hot and the fried zucchini on top was too greasy for my taste. I ordered the mixed berry sorbet for dessert and there were lots of ice chips in the sorbet, wasn't particularly berry like and was just meh like my lunch entree.

1.0,3/14/2015,"If this was a normal place, it would have been 2 stars, but due to the price and expectation, it's left with one star. This was probably THE most disappointing dining experience I've ever had. Remi has more or less great reviews, was clearly a nice, very expensive place, and was located in the theater district. While maybe it wouldn't be the most amazing food we'd ever eaten, we thought it would be hard to go wrong. Well, we did.We started with the roasted artichokes and crab cakes. The artichokes were the best part of the entire meal, which is not saying anything at all. The pesto was extremely lemon-y and didn't really belong with the artichokes to begin with. Artichokes are so delicious by themselves, I was wishing I'd just been given canned artichoke versus everything they did to them, which left them with mundane, bizarre flavor and too much oil. The crab cakes were completely lackluster--zero flavor. They were each placed in a POOL of spicy mayo. Typically, I'm one to want a little more sauce than is provided, but in this case, I was wishing there was 60% less. They described it as a ""smoked pepper aioli,"" but it was more like chipotle mayo you'd find at the TGI Friday's down the block. I ordered the gnocchi, which was utterly INEDIBLE. The gnocchi in and of itself, was inedible, as I said, but further, there were excessive amounts of walnuts on top, which was just about the most bizarre flavor palate I've ever experienced--it made the already grainy gnocchi, all the more like dirt. I had about 3-4 pieces, and left the rest of the plate. They didn't even bother to ask if there was an issue--which one might assume there is, when you're taking away a full, nearly untouched, entree plate. My mother ordered the calf liver with polenta--again, inedible. It was 85% calf liver and 15% polenta--a little extreme. They asked how she wanted the liver done, and she said medium well--that she wanted it cooked, but to make sure it wasn't overdone. It came out with burned pieces and all of the meat was drenched in oil. Normally, this oil would be strained. She left more than half her plate. Considering we had a show to make, and considering how awful the food was, asking for any kind of replacement was the last thing on our minds. We literally just wanted to get out.The service was similarly forgettable and lackluster. No one asked how we were doing, and it took us 10 minutes of trying to get our waiter, to finally receive the check. $150 later, we couldn't wait to be gone.

Little did we know we would be in for an unexpected taste adventure. The cheese and sauce with the bread was the perfect appetizer and was followed by salad and entrees that got better and better. I had the beet salad and wanted to lick the plate, but saved myself for my lemon-caper chicken. Who writes about mouth watering chicken? Anyone who has had the pleasure of eating at Remi (me!). We had six people and you heard very little talking while eating because everyone was savoring each bite.Highly recommended - can't wait to go back.",0,0,0,Melissa H.,"Englewood, CO",92,16,0

Both of my choices were pretty standard and the Cab I ordered was decent as well. Everyone seemed pretty content with their meals, including my boyfriend who had ordered the seared tuna (which someone below had gotten food poisoning from). Highlights of the meal were definitely the tomato and cheese dipping sauce to start with and the absolutely divine cheesecake for dessert!

4.0,2/3/2015,"There are times, in life, when you find yourself in midtown Manhattan, and in need of a decent place to dine. You could do worse than Remi, an Italian joint that skews more Continental than local red-sauce style.Prompt, attentive & friendly service, plus delicious food with decent-sized portions for the price, make Remi a better-than-average choice for locals and out-of-towners alike. Also, they are allergy-friendly, featuring gluten-free pasta, as well. Only drawback- they are pricey, but one could easily fill up on an app and some of that delightful bread, and feel that the expense was worth it.This was my first visit to Remi, I live in Brooklyn but a friend of mine visits NYC 2x/ year and always stays in Midtown.

5.0,12/21/2014,"Very nice Saturday night dinner with friends from out of town. We hosted some friends from New England and decided on Remi. I've literally been here 20+ times over the last 15 years and it didn't disappoint. The atmosphere is always nice here, very vibrant. The place was fully packed but it wasn't a circus environment and was perfect for dinner with old friends. The noise never got crazy besides being totally packed which allowed us to not have to yell during conversations. Overall a really nice and inviting ambiance. We had an enjoyable 3+ hour dinner and we almost closed the place down. That said, we never felt pressured to order more quickly and never felt like we were being pushed by the staff. So hats off to the staff, they were always there and ready when we needed it (new bottle of Prosecco & wine etc). For the meal, the menu offerings were deep, fully enticing and really the best I've seen offered by Remi in over 10 years. Just a few of the choices we opted for was the seasonal special apptzr of the Chestnut soup with mushrooms. That soup was simply out of this world - best soup I've had in 2014!  Rich, dark, complex yet balanced - it was the real surprise of the night. Another person in my group had it and they echoed the same thought. So if you get a chance, get the Chestnut appetizer soup. For entrees, we ranged from the Pan Seared Double Pork Chop in a red wIne prunes sauce to the Pappardelle al Telefono in salsa rosa (wide ribbon pasta ""Pappardelle"" in a pink tomato sauce with mozzarella cheese) to the special Risotto with artichoke and sturgeon. Can't remember the 4th entree due to multiple bottles of Prosecco ;-) but everything greatly exceeded our expectations.  Everything was cooked to perfection, was visually enticing and even better, tasted great. Whenever I think of Risotto I always think Remi so even though I saw several other choices that I wanted, I had to go for the Risotto. Again, Remi didn't disappoint!In summary, food was simply outstanding, service was very good, and the ambiance was vibrant, warm, sophisticated and inviting.

When we sat down we were presented with the bread basket and their amazing dip that is mentioned in almost every review as it should because it is that good. For RW you get three courses which are good portions so you don't leave hungry.  I ordered the spinach salad which was served with raw bottom mushrooms, aged Sardinian Pecorino cheese and green apple-shallot dressing.  My wife went with the baked eggplant with mozzarella gratinee and a light tomato sauce. Both appetizers were amazing.  For our entrees I went with the spinach Gnocchi served with Gorgonzola cheese sauce and roasted pumpkin. My wife had the Orecchiette served with crispy salami in an olive oil sauce and roasted cauliflower with tomato breadcrumbs. It seemed a little dry but was delicious. Now to the kicker, dessert. Their desserts alone are worth the trip. I had Creme Brûlée which wasn't overly sweet and my wife had the sorbet of the day, Bellini sorbet garnished with fresh spearmint.  The service was on point not over bearing but attentive.

They better be memorable and exceptional, otherwise how can they thrive in a city of some of the best Italian outside of Italy? Remi does not meet the test. It is a beautiful space, the food isn't that bad, but the service ... just atrocious. Maybe it was due to the fact that I came during a busy Restaurant Week, but I just couldn't believe how bad the service was. I had to hunt down our waiter every time. When we first arrived, the waiter was eager to get our drink order, but then disappeared for what seemed to be over 20 minutes until I had to go find him (and a bit strange ... not to be racist ... that all of the waiters at an Italian restaurant seemed to be Hispanic). The menu promotes that martinis are $6 at the bar, and $10 at the table. So, I went to the bar to get my drink, only to find out that I could not take the drink to the table (so why put the bar price on the table menu?). These long waits and ""Where's the waiter?"" games continued throughout the evening, so much so that I just couldn't enjoy what was otherwise a pretty decent dinner. I loved the tomato sauce with goat cheese dip, enjoyed the pear endive salad, and the salmon was nicely done. The creme brule was not my favorite, but the sorbet was quite tasty.All of this is unfortunate because the very spacious room is quite beautiful and an attractive space. The service just needs some serious attention, and the food menu memorable.",0,1,0,Todd B.,"Midtown, Atlanta, GA",751,694,6

We all had our menus on our laps for like 20 minutes.   Then between the salads and the entrees was another half hour wait.  I just don't dig meals that take over 2 hours.   Not that I want to be in and out in 30 minutes but 90 minutes is fine.Bathroom is kind of tiny.If they could speed up the service so there wasn't so much waiting, this would definitely be a four star.",2,3,0,Bill T.,"New York, NY",1361,2290,9300

I have not tried the sandwiches, but there are a bunch of other lunch spots to go for that. They have ~5 pasta choices every day and 2 take-out sizes to choose from. The special pastas change almost daily but remi provides a good stream of standards that ensure you have something good to fall back on, My absolute favorite is the seafood risotto. I would trek halfway across midtown to get that for lunch -- the seafood is fresh and there is a lot of it (the calamari in particular wins over the dish). Their other risottos are really good as well, but seafood is by far the best. The baked pasta is a staple as well.Most (if not all) of the seating is outdoors (it's meant for take-out), so if you are looking for a sit down spot, come over the spring/summer when you can take advantage of the public outdoor space.

I had a red wine risotto with filet mignon, and I had wished that the pieces of meat were a bit larger in order to give the mushy risotto some added texture. I was not a fan of the osso bucco, but my man liked it a lot.  Again, Remi was good, but for the money, I could have cooked something just as good and still had a bunch of money leftover at the end of the night.

While the polenta was cooked perfectly, the dish had no taste whatsoever. My initial reaction was that this poor first course would foreshadow a poor second course, but I was wrong.My main course was the Cavatelli alla Pugliese con Ragu, which can be described as large ricotta cavatelli in a lamb ragout with meatballs and aged pecorino cheese. They were a HOME RUN and absolutely delicious! When I was done I thought ""ok, I'll take another one of those right now."" Seriously, I could have easily eaten one or two more.

4.0,9/22/2012,"What a surprise, really nice Italian food in such a touristy area. As I walked over to Remi, I passed numerous hotels and started to worry that this was going to be just another tourist trap. I could not be more wrong. The atmosphere is classic and the food was wonderfully prepared. To start they brought a bread basket and some delicious ricotta and tomato sauce dip to the table. It was a nice change from the regular butter or olive oil and vinegar that you usually have at Italian restaurants. It was warm and flavorful with some of the lightest and fluffiest ricotta I have had. For entrees, we had the calf's liver with polenta, the garganelli with lamb ragout, and the endive salad with pear, walnuts and gorgonzola cheese. The calf's liver was a bit underseasoned and the polenta was a bit on the drier side. The salad was very nicely dressed and very refreshing. Definitely a fan of this dish and nice to start dinner with or enjoy as your entree if you have a lighter appetite. The star of the entrees was the garganelli. It had just the perfect bite to it and the sauce was so flavorful. I wish that it was a bit of a bigger portion since it was quite a small serving. It still was a great dish and I am definitely a fan.For dessert we had coffee and the panna cotta. The panna cotta lacked the custardy creamy consistency that I look forward to, but it still had a nice flavor. Service was a bit spotty, we were surprised to get our drinks with our entrees and not before them for us to enjoy as we waited for our dishes. Also the coffees came a bit after our dessert was brought to our table, not sure if the bar was backed up or something. Other than that it was still a wonderful meal and having 30% off from savored.com definitely made it worth it!",1,0,0,Cynthia M.,"Manhattan, NY",351,1226,25
4.0,8/29/2012,"On a trip to NYC I had lunch with colleagues at Remi's. The lunch menu at the restaurant is divided into anti pasti ranging from $11.50 - $17.50;  insalate ranging from $9.50-$12.50; main plates (primi piatta) of homemade pasta ranging from $18.00-$24.50; and signature plates & entrees ranging from $19.50-$39.50. The place attracts a large lunch crowd of business men and women, and features a nice patio.  For lunch I selected the Atlantic Salmon.  Generally I prefer my salmon slightly rare and with as little on it as possible, but Remi's plate came with potato crust, which added texture that complimented the fish.  Under the fillet was a sweet bell pepper sauce that did little for my taste buds, but was visually appealing and a side of sauteed garlic spinach that was so unbelieveably good I inhaled it all: caveat emptor, if you're not a fan of garlic stay away from the spinach.I'm not sure if I would venture to Remi's on my own since I rarely choose to spend time in Midtown when visiting NYC, but based on my experience here I would suggest it for a business lunch or dinner.",1,0,1,Bos G.,"Boston, MA",96,63,0

The endive salad was delicious with smooth and creamy blue cheese and tasty honey-roasted walnuts. The taste of the ricotta filling in my ravioli was interesting and unique though I'm pretty sure the big secret was lemon zest.Remi is probably close to your office or your show or your hotel, and the food's worth it, but prepare for some hiccups along the way, especially since so many reviews seem to comment on service as well.",0,0,0,Steve B.,"Brooklyn, NY",66,206,0

The food was ok this time, nothing special (especially for the price), but not inedible either. The scallop appetizer was pretty good - three large scallops, a poached egg in the middle, and some uninspiring greens. The scallops were cooked nicely, but could have used a bit more flavoring (salt maybe?)The sea bass (at $33), was a bit disappointing. I couldn't tell what it was, but the fish was pretty soggy in texture. It was also very bland (I had to add salt AND lemon, and still couldn't force myself to finish it).The bread was warm, and OK..., but the rolls were a bit hard.The service was... interesting.I had asked the server to make it a fast meal (since an average business lunch can easily go upwards of 2 hours). The apps took a little bit, but that wasn't a big deal. We were finished with our apps, and had our plates siting there w/ our forks placed nicely while we waited for the entrees. The server came up, and was like... ""your entrees are waiting""... and I was like... ""well, we're done w/ the appetizers."" I was a bit annoyed because I felt like his attitude was kind of saying... ""you wanted a speedy lunch, so I got the entrees done early for you, but how dare you not even be done w/ the apps...."" While I was thinking, ""we were done w/ the apps a while ago, but no one came to clear our plates... and now you're trying to blame me for holding up the lunch...?""Anyway...The rest of the meal was fine, and my minor annoyance wasn't reflected (as much as it deserved) in the tip since it was a business lunch.

Not a big request but the host was very rude about it and reluctantly switched our table.  Next, no water for 15 minutes- I had to remind the busboys to bring us water.  Same story for the butter with the bread.  I asked nicely for butter and had to ask again until they actually brought it over.  The waiter we had, who apparently was also the manager, was a nightmare.  He made it clear that he didn't care at all about the customers in his station.  When he finally took our order (after trying to find the guy for 15 minutes) he brought my wife the wrong dish and she had to wait until everyone else was finished to then start eating.  Pathetic- when you make an error like that you take it off the bill (which he refused to do).  His big gesture towards us was to give us a free plate of cookies at the end of the meal which we didn't want.  Seriously- this place was a nightmare, I can't even express how horrible we felt when we left. This place is in the theater district and used to serving huge quantities of non New Yorkers rapidly.  That sort of crap service doesn't fly when you're paying top dollar for average quality food.  I will be reviewing this restaurant on other sites as well so as many people as possible choose not to visit this place.Ugh... just reliving that horrible waiter to write about him just stressed me out even more.",6,3,0,russell b.,"New York, NY",37,116,0

They use homemade pasta which really makes a difference in the taste. For an appetizer, we got the sliced ham with cheese and arugula. AWESOME! I can't recommend this place enough. The ambiance is great - gorgeous high ceilings and Venetian frescoes on the wall. The staff is attentive and never kept us waiting for anything.

I would have given Remi 1.5 Stars but since last year was such a great experience, I thought the restaurant deserves 3 Stars overall. I won't be returning though.The food was much blander this time around. In fact, it tasted like it was mass produced a la a University cafeteria. We were only given two baskets of bread for the eight of us. When we asked for more, we were given plain breadsticks.Our waiter was deplorable. He viciously grabbed menu's out of our hands, was very unfriendly and waited until he handed us our bill to tell us that they could only divide the bill up on three credit cards if we weren't all paying in cash. He claimed they have old technology which would not let them do so. We were a party of eight people all over 22 years of age. I would think it to be obvious from the start that we were not going to be paying all together and even if it wasn't, this should have been mentioned earlier so ATM runs could be made.I was very sad about this.

I'm in heaven before the meal even starts. I was with a large party, so we pretty much ordered every appetizer on the menu. The scallops and the grilled octopus were two of my favorites. We also ordered what they call a pizza, but it's actually a puff pastry with prosciutto, goat cheese and tomatos... can't go wrong with that.As for the meats, Half the table ordered the veal chop - just looking at it, I wish I had done the same. Everyone moaned over that one. My boyfriend ordered the ossobuco - it's so rich, I couldn't possibly eat more than a few bites, but my boyfriend loved it. As for fish, I ordered the branzino, which was perfectly seasoned. My sister on the other hand, ordered the sole, but was not impressed by the slightest. She felt as if it was bland. The service was okay... I think it would have been better had we had a smaller party, since I think he was a little overwhelmed.

There's outdoor seating, but if that area is full the inside is just as good because they have large windows from ground to ceiling that lets you get all the vitamin D you need. For the table, we've ordered the sea scallops with braised endive, citrus and ginger sauce topped with fried leeks. There were 3 scallops on this dish, but each scallop was so big and juicy that it was 2.5 bites each. Wow I can eat these kind of scallops like there's no tomorrow hehe.

I had to go through my menu 3 times just to decide on what to eat. I am a mushroom lover, so I kind of narrowed it down that way. My eyes were screening the menu until it came to a sudden halt at Fazzoletti ai Funghi Selvatici. What's that you ask? It's in Italian, so I don't know either. Luckily, it's written out in English underneath the Italian name. So this dish was a wide hand cut pasta with mixed wild mushrooms, garlic and white truffle oil. Mushrooms alone I am sold, but the thing is aren't mushrooms wild to begin with? I guess it's more exciting that they're wild and not calm. Then what's this about garlic and white truffle oil? This dish literally has my name written all over it. I mean I love garlic so much that I can never date a vampire. And truffle oil? I think this should be used in everything!Okay, so how was this dish? Amazing! It's really damn good. Can't wait to come back to try this dish again. How did the business lunch went?

The sommelier helped with our wine selection and then spent some time with us discussing various wines. All in all, a very nice experience. We put Remi on our list for a return visit. It has been a couple of years since our first visit. We weren't thinking of Remi initially, but we had trouble getting a reservation at La Masseria (recommended) so we decided to give Remi a try based on our initial experience. We were disappointed. The service was initially disorganized and slow to get started. When the waiter finally got involved we felt he was rushing us, so we explained that we had already been to a matinee and we were not in a hurry. That helped and things improved, but the service was never at the level we expected. The cocktails were OK and the wine was very good (three different wines by the glass) . The real disappointment was with the food. There were four of us. Salads were just OK. The special minestrone was thin and there were no beans (we advised the waiter who said he would advise the chef, but there was no attempt to correct the problem.) The veal scallopini was bland and the sauce looked and tasted like it had been thickened with flour. The Chilean Sea Bass, at the price charged, was the worst I have ever had. The portion was small and it was a bit over-cooked. The filet mignon was mushy.. The special pasta dish was very good. Coffee was good and the waiter brought a complementary cookie plate which we enjoyed.. We happened to recognize the waiter that took care of us on our first visit and he was very cordial and offered to help if we had any problems...very nice.

I am mixed on this review.We sat down and there was some hesitation on who was going to be serve us. We had 3 different people approach our table and finally one took our order and basically took care of throughout the night. There was a lack of communication though from the reservationist to the servers. When we had the nice lady take our order about 5 minutes later another guy came over to take our order and we had to inform him that it had already been taken care of. Later in the night we received a complimentary dessert plate from the hotel in which we work for..it wasn't annoying, simply just an observation that it didn't flow as it should have. I must compliment this place for providing cheese and sauce for the bread sticks. I hate arriving somewhere hungry and then them tempting you with hard bread sticks with no flavor at all. My app was the beef carpaccio and it was quite good just was too much for me to eat the entire plate. Then we had the lobster risotto and that was really delicious! For my main i had a gnocchi and it was pretty good but i never figured out what i was liking or disliking about the dish.

I work right next door and having a great gourmet Italian place for lunch in a ""To-Go"" style is awesome beyond words. Everything I have eaten from here has been so tasty I have licked my plastic take-out container clean (Not really, but I definitely wanted to). I don't know what they put in the food, but it must be a version of crack because I can't seem to stay away. You can get any one of their classic Italian dishes to go in a large or small plastic container, the small is right around $5 the large (which is pretty much double the small) is $9. The prices are ridiculously low for the quality and amount of food you get. With my paper bag in hand I rush back to my office and get flustered trying to open the lid because I'm moving so fast. I can't start eating soon enough. Then I devour the whole thing without regard for who might be watching and what I might look like. Favorite dishes to date: Veggie risotto - aborio rice is perfectly cooked and moist, veggies are finely diced and sauteed just right. Chicken Picatta - Sits on a bed of rice and they spoon so much sauce onto it, so the rice soaks it all up and the chicken is smothered in it. Baked Pasta - still piping hot so the mozzarella and ricotta is melting all over the sauce and bow tie pasta. This is so good that I suggest you come and try it even if you are not in the area.

2.0,7/16/2009,"Pretty mediocre, not gonna lie.  I'll say right up front that I was in a shitty mood before I sat down.  Remi was the scene of a business lunch that started with the company diversity coordinator confusing me with the one other Korean girl at our six-person table.  Nice.The venue is lovely and is probably Remi's finest asset.  The clean feel with the slanting mural interrupting a theme of white and open doors letting in summer air give me no cause for complaint.  The service is unobjectionable as well, if also unmemorable.The food is not terrible, but it is by no means good.  The bread basket came with a variety of breads, but the nibbles I had of the rock hard roll and the under-garlicked focaccia hardly left me wanting I started with the roasted scallops with braised endive and citrus ginger sauce.  The scallops themselves were okay, cooked without nuance but nothing disastrous.  The sauce was sort of dumped on as an afterthought, and it was not a good sauce.  The ginger was poorly incorporated so the thin flavor was punctuated by the occasional mouth assault of an accidentally bitten chunk.  The braised endives were straight up bitter and unappealing.  I didn't touch them after the first bite.  The pappardelle with mixed mushrooms, garlic, and white truffle oil was a vast improvement, but nothing I would order again.  The dish was very, very heavy, with the mushrooms drowning in an oily mush.  Most things taste halfway decent doused in truffle oil, but I didn't feel compelled to clean my plate.  The pasta itself was also problematic.  Homemade pasta is always impressive in theory, but I think Remi should rethink the egg:flour ratio in its recipe.  The pappardelle had something of a crumbly texture unmasked even by the massive amounts of wet surrounding each noodle.I don't complain about prices when I walk away well fed, but I'm going to gripe away here.  I would've been pissed if I'd had to foot the bill.  My starter was $16.50 and my pasta was $23.50, which came to a whopping $40 before tax and tip for an unsatisfactory lunch.  Since I'm nitpicking, the plating looked very catered-from-the-cafeteria.  I wouldn't normally care, but come now.  If the food isn't worth the prices, can't we at least see some pretension?",1,2,1,Steph C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3889,3532,94

4.0,6/9/2009,"I attended The Simpson's Movie premiere afterparty that was held at Remi. As a summer transplant to New York, who had never trekked away from the East Side, Remi was a nice treat. Especially in terms of ambiance, the restaurant was beautiful. It was a muggy, uncomfortable New York summer evening, so while I spent a lot of time outside -- that's where the bar was stationed -- I went back-and-forth because of the air conditioner inside. The food was so-so, not enough vegetarian options. The atrium is beautiful, and is great for entertaining.

4.0,4/13/2009,"Pretty solid homemade pasta joint with wide selections of menu and incredibly cozy decor. Service was great and food was good. I'm loving the bread basket. They are like a pu pu platter with all these different kinds of Italian breads. I had the calamari salad and tonnarelli (did I spell that right??) and it was delicious. Squid was grilled to perfection and the pasta was just great. On the other hand, my brother ordered a scallop risotto and it could definitely use a bit more salt, pepper & some love.But overall, I love the place. It's a hidden gem situated around the overpriced mediocre restaurants. The place is not packed so you can savor your food without overhearing some snotty skanks ranting about boys right next to you. The ambiance is good for conversations and the candles just makes it a pretty spot for dates. Remi isn't overpriced either.",1,0,1,N. R.,"New York, NY",67,88,9

4.0,2/2/2009,"Just got back from here for a business lunch. its good when you're the client and a company takes you out. anyway, onto the food. Remi is a really cool restaurant. it has lots of natural sunlight which makes it welcoming, and the hostesses and waitresses are all attractive. Remi specializes in pasta from what i see on the menu and man, there are an overwhelming amount of chocies. It was tough to decide, but I decided to pass up the ossobucco ($37) for the homemade pasta dishes. At first I was going to get the tagliolini with pink cognac sauce and lump crab meat, but decided to go with my favorite pasta dish in the world, which is homemade papparedelle with wild mushrooms and truffle oil. it was outstanding. the freshness of the pasta made the dish. my guest had the ravioli which looked good. we passed on dessert and apps because ya know, we're in a recession, but lunch for 2 with tap water was $60 after tip and tax.

4.0,3/2/2008,"Good business Italian lunch place. I only come for business lunches, so the prices are fine, but they're definitely pricy if you're on your own dime.  The spaghetti remi is delicious--yeah, it's spaghetti in a red sauce, but it's what spaghetti in a red sauce is supposed to be. Light, delicious, and filled with flavor, rather than drowning in oversweet/ bland/canned tomato sauce. Several of the other pasta dishes are also delicious, and companions have loved the meat dishes.Decor is nice, but it gets a bit loud, and the waiters really hit the Italian accent, so it can be hard to understand the specials.  But if you want an always reliable and tasty place for a business lunch in Midtown, Remi always works.

4.0,1/4/2008,"Nice midtown Italian. Last night was very cold and we didn't want to venture far - one coworker suggested Remi. Even though I've stayed at the Hilton on Avenue of Americas dozens of times, I had never noticed Remi. I was astounded there was such a nice place just next door. The high ceilings gave the place an airy feeling, even though the restaurant itself is in a narrow space.The food was delicious - everyone on the table finished their starters and entrees. I tried the veal scallopini which was perhaps one of the best versions of this dish I've ever ate. The panna cotta wasn't that good while the tuna tatar with avocado was delicious.Service was fine, though it was at times hard to understand our waiter.

4.0,11/25/2007,"This is my (possibly) future mother-in-law's favorite restaurant in New York City. Every time she comes into town, she insists upon eating here several times over a few days.  Considering that this makes Remi free for me, that might sway my opinion a bit.Another thing to know is that this woman is practically a professional restaurant patron. I've never seen her eat someplace and not become immediate BFFs with everyone from the maitre 'd to the busboy.  We always get the best service when we dine with my boyfriend's parents. It's more than possible our table has been responsible for Amikam complaining about Todd's poor service. I know Todd. He likes to chat. When you're the chatting party, he'll treat you very well.That said, the food is pretty good. Not as tasty as some of the more downtown fares, but still delicious.

Thinking we were tourists he'd added a gratuity to the check for two, without mentioning it. Unfortunately we only realized that back at the hotel.
