1.0,2/24/2019,I have never in all my years not left a tip - as someone who is a partner in a nyc restaurant this is by far the worst service. Most salty food and a waiter and worse the maître d' with an attitude simply because we spoke about how much salt was on the food. -  ( I will not say the name of my restaurant since I don't want this to sound like an ad).

Offering a wine by the glass list that starts at $16 and goes up from there is pompous and insulting. Just because I'm on an expense account doesn't mean I'm careless or stupid.

2.0,1/17/2019,"I travel to New York frequently and because The National is conveniently located to many mid town hotels, I have eaten there often, but EVERY time I am greeted and served by rushed, rude and frustrated staff that should not be in the servicing industry.  Today when asked to be seated, the hostess stuck a limited breakfast menu in my face and with a clear attitude told me ""this is all we are serving right now"" suggesting that I am wasting my time. I understand that thre is a limited menu between breakfast and lunch hours, but clearly if this was her restaurant she would have managed the communication differently. The waiter tried to convince me that my over well done eggs were still runny because they had less than half an inch of wetness to them,  and the food is drastically overpriced for the quality and volume (the food is decent but nothing more special than what you would get at any breakfast room of a high end hotel). OJ at $6 is NOT freshly squeezed and literally 10 berries are a $4 upcharge - who has the audacity to charge $6 for concentrated OJ?

4.0,12/28/2018,"This is a classy, beautiful brunch spot. The service is excellent. They are even open on Christmas, so we had a fancy Christmas brunch! As an appetizer we had Local Burrata Di Bufala, which did not disappoint, the eggplant and mozzarella were delicious. The real winning dish at this restaurant is the Zakarian Buger, it's juicy, tender, delicious and packed with yummy middle eastern flavors. We ordered the burger as an appetizer and split it four ways but man did I wish I had it as my main meal. I personally ordered the pork belly eggs Benedict which was pretty good, but not nearly as satisfying as that burger. My brother had steak and eggs, medium rare, which was cooked a little too bloody for his liking.

1.0,11/2/2018,"I couldn't have been more disappointed in our meal at The National. We had a reservation, but arrived about 45 minutes early. We were prepared to wait at the bar if necessary, but the dining room was only sparsely occupied, so we were seated right away. The host was gracious, but after that is where the experience takes a nose dive. The light fixtures and mirrors above our table were filthy.  Like they hadn't been cleaned in years. Our waiter was disinterested and rude. I wasn't expecting a conversation, but I don't think he even made eye contact. My wife ordered a cocktail and I had iced tea. We both received iced water from the busboy as well. We ordered the cheesy polenta with bacon (which is no longer on their menu). It was absolutely slathered in large pieces of VERY salty pork and onions. The polenta itself was wonderful. Creamy and cheesy and delicious. But the pork/bacon was so overpoweringly salty, we had to scrape it all off to the side to even be able to enjoy the dish. Our waiter did walk past our table several times and didn't ask or mention anything about the clearly ransacked appetizer. For entrees, my wife ordered the ""Ugly Burger"" with fries and I ordered the Cast Iron Chicken. When they arrived, everything looked great, however, the fries were soggy and tasted like old oil. The ketchup also tasted ""off"". We did ask the waiter to replace the fries with some that were fresher/crispier. He took them away without comment. The one outstanding item in the entire meal was the mashed potatoes that came with my chicken. They were terrific. But my chicken was undercooked. My wife's burger was also undercooked. And the meat was either under seasoned or poor quality. It did not taste like a $23 hamburger. The fries did come back somewhat fresher, but by that point we were so disappointed in everything else, we decided to call it a night. I did explain to the waiter what we did not like about our meals. He literally made no comment, didn't offer an alternative or offer to make an exchange or anything. I decided to go to the restroom before we left and there was what appeared to be drops of blood on the floor. I was so grossed out I took pictures and texted them to my wife upstairs. She was so angry about paying over $100 for a mediocre meal and still leaving hungry, we rushed out of the restaurant. The sweet busboy chased us down to return my scarf which I had left on the seat. TL;DR: the host and the busboy were the best part of the experience. The food was less than mediocre and the waiter was rude. And the whole place is super dirty. 0/10.

3.0,7/21/2018,"So this really is a 3.5 Star review... The food was amazing, but the service was a bit off, which was very surprising given who we know spearheaded this place (Geoffrey Zakarian).  We really like this chef and the menu we saw so we dropped in on a Monday night at 7:30pm with high hopes.  The Grey Goose martini was very well made; it was a shame it took the server an extra 15 min to get back to us with our request for extra olives (for $20 it should have come with more than 1).  We started with the grilled octopus (because who ever really makes that at home) and that was so tender and just a bit zingy from the paprika.  We shared the Tuscan Kale salad and Lamb burger and split them and THIS is where the server was FAB:  he made sure the salad was pre-split and served individually and then the burger came with the extra plate and sharp knife so we could figure out who would get a larger piece (hey - I'm the birthday girl!).  And the lamb was a most perfect, moist, flavorful ending to our weekend in NYC!  So I say GO, and be nice, but firm in what you need.",0,0,0,Maureen L.,"Stow, MA",3,62,8
1.0,7/10/2018,"Before leaving the city after a great birthday visit, we stopped here for breakfast. I'd always wanted to eat at a Geoffrey Zakarian spot. Total and utter disappointment. Flavor of the food was good (not great) but it is definitely overpriced. That's about the extent of the positives. Unfortunately, the service at this establishment was rock-bottom. From the hostesses who could barely be bothered to be welcoming (must not have been in the job description) to the near non-existent service, I'd say this was one of the worst experiences I've had in a restaurant in quite some time. No one could be bothered to smile or even say hello except for the man who initially filled our water glasses. After sitting waiting for ten minutes, our ""waiter"" failed to greet us or even give his name.  There were only 5 tables with patrons so it was far from busy. Servers stood around talking to each other to the point that every time we needed something we had to wave someone down. Breakfast for four came to $120. We knew the prices going in, but if the experience had matched the price tag it would have been worth it. They didn't even have a to-go box?!? He just dumped the food in some foil which is pathetic for a place like this. Not that I expected it after the dismal experience, but even as we left, not a single ""thank you"" or ""have a great day"" from the sad hostesses staring at us as we walked out. In a city like NYC with thousands of options for food served with warmth and personality, I'd run away from this place. Mr Zakarian and his crew have a lot of work to do here.

The bar was pretty empty, and the bartender was very attentive (I want to say his name was Russ). The drinks were very good. We ordered the cheese plate because the kitchen didn't close until 10 pm. All of the cheeses were very delicious. Overall this was a good experience. My lack of a five-star rating came from lunch. We had a reservation on a Friday afternoon. We were seated right away, and the host was very polite. However, our waiter was super slow and semi-rude. The place itself for lunch is very loud. I had to talk very loudly to my co-worker to hear me. The waiter asked us for our food order before asking if we wanted waters.

3.0,6/29/2018,"Came here for a work/team lunch (group of 10) so my review is a bit different than most others.  For a ""corporate"" and fancy lunch spot, I think the establishment is kinda average and strays towards that rating honestly.  I noticed a few odd things that stood out a bit.  First, we had to ask for a couple bread baskets when normally it should be standard/customary to automatically bring it out.  On top of that, the bread wasn't warm (although it was soft) and we were given basically a cup of butter, which seems kinda strange too as I'm normally used to the cubed/fancy style served at more formal restaurants.  Also surprised we weren't given olive oil or a more diverse set of breads.Additionally, the service seemed a bit slow honestly from the moment we were served to the moment where we waited quite a long time to receive desserts and our check.  For a large group, the wait staff should probably be more attentive.The main meals and dessert was actually pretty good.  As a vegetarian, I ordered the confit sweet potato and then the profiteroles for dessert.  I do wish there was another hot lunch option for vegetarians, but I'm probably too picky.  Overall, the food wasn't a problem.  Overall, I don't know if I'll be back for a work lunch, but the food options are not terrible, so it's something to still consider...",0,0,0,Vivek D.,"Queens, NY",142,251,127

We walked in to an almost empty restaurant. We asked to be seated and they said they couldn't seat our large party of 12 for unknown reasons or very unsatisfying reasons. We then asked if we could seat at the bar, they were unable to confirm since the bar had no great arrangement for large parties. Unable to understand the staff and tired of waiting in the front reception area, a small group of us started occupying the stools around the bar and ordering drinks. We never got these first drinks. They were unready for service and all we asked for was just a little service.This was 30 minutes into our arrival when they finally came over and said they had seats for us.

2.0,4/14/2018,"This place is a disappointment. If you're hoping for something better than average, this isn't it. The hostesses were very nice and accommodating. It basically went downhill from there. Our waiter for some reason didn't like our table- probably because we don't drink and had kids. So right after we ordered, he made a big show of telling us he was going to work in the kitchen, and would not longer be our waiter and someone else would be taking over. He then proceeded to not ""move to the kitchen"" and wait on every table around us and when I later stopped him, and asked him for a fork, he actually rolled his eyes and smirked at me. Unbelievable.Added to that the food was really barely even mediocre, but for the price, it was awful. Cesar salad that tasted like it had sugar in the dressing. Literally like anchovies with sugar. So gross. The short ribs tasted like something you'd get on an airplane; over salted, soggy, and with no discernible flavor other than salt. The burger was totally boring and the fries were cold. The branzino was one tiny filet and  tasted fishy. The shrimp cocktail had four medium sized shrimp that were chewy and tasteless- for 22 dollars. We had to ask for bread three times. It was stale.

This trip my boyfriend and I booked dinner at the National expecting a great experience at Geoffrey Zakarian's restaurant, but I have to agree with other Yelp reviewers. The food was terrific, but the service was totally substandard. Saif was our server and he basically ignored us throughout the evening. There was no offer from anyone to refresh our drinks, no one asked if we needed condiments with our meal or if the meal was even satisfactory. I was also quite surprised that the manager on duty (a tall gentlemen with a beard) walked by our table 6-7 times and offered no greeting at all. It was like being invisible. Despite the very poor service, I still supplied a decent tip because the food exceeded my expectations. I hope Mr. Zakarian takes a long hard look at his waitstaff because they are making a great meal experience very mediocre.",0,0,0,Lisa C.,"Miami, FL",0,2,0
3.0,2/27/2018,"I came here for breakfast on a weekday and ordered the steak and eggs. It was delicious. Absolutely. However, the rest of the menu felt more esoteric than practical. I really just wanted scrambled eggs, with bacon and some home fries. That was nowhere on the menu. There was one dish with scrambled eggs, which was $18, and if you wanted a side of bacon it would be an extra $7. $25 for scrambled eggs and bacon?! I don't care what you're doing but that is crazy. Their other choices were also meatless and expensive, like avocado toast and poached egg ($18 or $20 I think), or mushroom omelet (about $20), or oatmeal and parfait for $15. Then they also had a list of coffees to choose from, whether you want Arabian bean or Colombian. I just wanted coffee.I was brought here for work so I didn't really get to pick. But this goes down my list of another restaurant in New York that is way too fancy for its own sake, and doesn't just cook hearty meals for people to enjoy.

1.0,8/11/2017,"Truly astounded at how poor this dining experience was. First of all, if you're a vegetarian, don't bother. There was not a single vegetarian entree on the menu when I dined here. I ordered the world's tiniest, most lackluster salad as an appetizer. Because there were no vegetarian options for entrees, I asked the waiter for help. He half heartedly said the kitchen could prepare a ""vegetable platter"" but was unable to explain what that might include. The server more enthusiastically suggested I choose a salad with the pasta appetizer, which boasted of porcini purée and blue foot mushrooms. What I received was a plate drowned in cream sauce with two or three tiny pieces of mushroom. It was inedible. If I'd dumped a ton of salt, I might have improved it enough to eat but even then it wouldn't have tasted like mushroom. I took two bites and pushed it aside. Minutes later, the dish was removed from the table with nary an inquiry into why it hadn't been eaten.  Dessert (profiteroles) was mediocre at best. Total disappointment. I was not alone. Second, if you want to eat with the rest of your table--like have an actual meal together--this is not the place for you. The servers delivered our plates at the rate of 2 every five minutes. Dishes served first were ice cold by the time the rest came out. This was true for every course except dessert. Third, if you sometimes like to use the restroom before, during, or after eating, this is not the place for you. Did you just drop four figures on overpriced drinks and less than mediocre food? And now you want toilet paper, too?! Unreasonable! The bathroom is in the hotel and as they will tell you in the restaurant they don't control the bathrooms. So, sorry, you're out of luck.

From the beginning there were errors. As my wife had went to wash her hands, the waiter comes by and shares the specials to only myself. After that we ordered a number of dishes as we were excited to sample Chef GZ's awesome cuisine. Soup and salads were brought out by another server or runner and were auctioned off at the table, to top it off the server places my salad down first before leaving my wife with soup and no spoon. I would have expected to have had the cutlery placed before the food. I requested a spoon for my wife and one was brought. We ate our first course, and the bus-person comes and clears my wife's soup leaving me to eat alone in front of her. I was also served first with water, food, etc. Please remember it is still polite to serve the females in the party first. After this, the food is cleared and the next course is brought out and once again we have an auction going on. Please, there are table numbers and seat positions for a reason. Not once, throughout the whole night did one member of the staff inquire as to how the food was, if we needed anything, or even if we would like another drink when removing a glass. Missteps in service can be overlooked if the food is exceptional, this was not the case. Out of all the dishes we ordered, the only one that we said we would order again was the brussel sprouts. I rarely add salt to any dishes when dining out, however the dishes were lacking seasoning. The asparagus and fava beans had no flavor, the mac and cheese tasted like Valveeta, and the Branzino was placed on a bed of ice cold artichoke hearts, hearts of palm and other Mediterranean flavors making it soggy on the bottom. On the Petit Filet, the hen of the woods mushrooms were very slimy and bland. Chef, I know you are busy, but please head over to The National and see for yourself if this place truly represents you. My wife and I love experiencing the cuisine of our favorite chefs, and this was a huge disappointment. Even after we finished, and the bill was placed, not once did anyone inquire if we enjoyed the food, if we were pleased or how things were. I hope that Chef GZ or a staff member of his actually reads this as it is not how I believe he would want to be represented. We are leaving NYC and it is with this experience. Once again we love what Geoffrey Zakarian does, but the National Bar and Dining Rooms is not a place I would recommend to anyone.As a footnote and to be transparent, the manager of the restaurant called me after I left the restaurant and apologized, inviting us back.

4.0,5/26/2017,"Enthusiastic thumbs up. Decor: Long ago when I started to visit NY often, 1992, my father's friend would take me to places like Atlantic Grill, Gotham, Quatorze Bis and other grills. This is in the best tradition of a grill, but it's in Midtown and full of business people. Further uptown, at least on weekends, it's not all suits. I love the simple white/navy/wood decor. It's bright without being obnoxious. The bar area is killingly loud. At 7:30 I was quite anxious because I wanted to be able to catch up with an old friend and the bar is NO place for such a meeting. Happily, I had made a reservation and got the best table in the dining room, or one of them, a corner banquette. My friend was late and they didn't bug me about just sitting there 30 minutes. I ordered one martini but waited to order more till friend arrived. The entrees are definitely high. 30-42 about. The lower cost dishes: their famous burger and lamb burger. Not sure if it ranks with April Bloomfield's signature lamb burger or my friend's South African interpretation but I saw one go by while waiting and it looked delicious. But the appetizers are big and if you stick to those, you're in better shape. If you did entree plus appetizer, the bill would get high. 1) Steak Tartare: It's not in a patty as is traditional. Wonderful interpretation I'd have again. Nice portion. A bit heavy on the mayo or whatever they put in it but not overwhelming and plenty of flavor. 2) TRUMPET pasta! Blue note or some kind of fancy mushroom. This was more than enough for an entree portion and if not with friend going out after, I'd have taken it home. Service was good.

This gave us very high hopes!I tried the peach bellini which was good, although a bit strong/not so much peach flavor. My actual breakfast was delicious though - I got the eggs benedict. Eggs were perfectly poached and the flavors were marvelous together. The pork belly had a sweet/smoky flavor that I couldn't get enough of. My only complaint was how crowded it was. The really pack you into the dining area and it was hard to get out. Also, there were a bunch of ladies at the table to my left who clearly did the bottomless mimosas and they were incredibly loud. They were screaming and playfully arguing over the check, but it was so loud I couldn't hear my partner talking to me. I was seriously hoping one of the waitstaff would say something to them because it was very disruptive but they didn't. The ladies finally agreed on the bill and headed out.

2.0,3/19/2017,"For someone who holds himself out as a perfectionist, the Iron Chef should consider firing his front of house manager...I was greeted by the rudest hostess I've ever encountered, which is saying something in NY, who also happened to be wearing, no joke, what was very clearly a black half slip. It was not meant to be an outer garment. When finally shown to my table, for a 1:15 lunch reservation (i.e., it was NOT the rush) it took 10 minutes for the couldn't care less waiter to come over. No one filled our water glasses in the meantime. We just sat. And waited. He walked past us at least 4 times. He finally came and asked if we wanted a drink, then brought mine but not my friends, which took another 5-7 minutes -- it was a club soda. I ordered a simple app and a fish entree, he ordered a sandwich. After waiting 20 minutes (not terrible I suppose) both of our entrees came out, I asked the runner about my app, of course the waiter had never put it in. He never actually apologized, but as I'd asked for the wine list, offered to buy me a glass of wine, which was nice. Halibut was delicious, really excellent. Clearly all the attention is going into the food and none into service--but service makes or breaks the experience, cannot overstate how rude hostesses were- so I am not sure I'd ever go back.",1,1,1,Suzanne C.,"Manhattan, NY",5,5,0
2.0,3/14/2017,"TL;DR at the bottom. explaining why I only gave two stars. Why 2 stars? Start at 5... now...Poor Value = -1.5 StarsDisastrous Desert = -1 StarGood/Great, but not excellent food Quality -0.5 starsAs for the review itself...First, some backgroundAfter watching Chopped, I became a fan of Mr. Zakarian. Now, when giving my opinion on any dish, anywhere, my family and I lovingly refer to it as Zakarian-ing.When on vacation in NYC, I had to visit his restaurant. I knew it would be expensive, and I knew the reviews weren't great... I wanted to check it out for myself. My experience left me extremely disappointed. I was not devastated, only because I have read the Yelp reviews, and was mentally prepared to have a less than stellar experience. Here, it really comes down to an issue of value. Was the food good? Certainly! Was it great? The short rib was, the rest was okay... The price did not equal quality. It is NYC, but I feel prices as so high because it is Zakarian's place, not because of quality. I spent about $90 on my dinner (incl tax, excl tip)... while I do not regret the experience, I am extremely unlikely to return here in the future. Okay... food (and drink):I ordered:Grilled OctopusWine-Braised Short RibNTL Mule (Drink)Pecan PieEspresso (was able to try both the coffee and actual espresso) They also brought bread while I waited.Start with the bread... unfortunately, while this was not the undercooked play-dough many restaurants provide, it wasn't great bread either. I know this is a minuscule part of the experience, but a nice restaurant should have nice bread. They also took a little while to bring it out, because it was not terribly busy at the time, I would have hoped for it to be brought out sooner.Octopus came out relatively quickly, quicker than I was expecting in any case. While it was cooked perfectly, if it was seasoned, then it was very light on the seasoning. I did like that the taste of the octopus was not overwhelmed by anything... but I would have liked a nice spiciness to complement the flavor. Part of the dish was also a small salad, while it was quite delightful, I would have liked a little less beans, and a little more veggies in it.Short Rib was pretty great. This dish was more in balance. The short rib was awesome. The wine-marinade they use added a great, lightly sweet flavor to the meat. The meat itself was soft and tender enough to be cut with a fork. The mashed potatoes complimented everything well, they helped absorb some of the sauce, and added their own nice texture. I will say that it could have used just a dollop more potato. I also found those strips on top fascinating, they added a nice texture, but were a little heavy on the salt.The NTL Mule was quite good, but I would have liked it be a little stronger. Pecan Pie was appalling. I'm sorry, but as a lover of pecan pies, this thing was inconsistent with the quality I expected from this restaurant. A pie should be soft, slightly crumbly, and have a certain density of everything. This pie was a very small circular thingy... the crust was very firm, like that of crunchy cookie, but not as tasty. The crust is usually the best part of a good pie... not here. The pecans, and the sweet ""bed"" they were on were okay... but nothing at all special, nothing of a Zakarian level. Honestly, this felt like something they got at a no-name bakery, added ice cream, and pawned it off as their own... They also could have at least warmed the dang thing.Espresso coffee was an interesting thing... they bring you a coffee pot, milk, and some sugar. The coffee was strong and had a very good balance of bitterness to acidity. There is enough here for two people... so $5 is not a bad deal.I also had the opportunity to try a regular espresso. While the flavors of this are great, $5 for a shot of espresso does seem a little steep.Service was an interesting blend in my one visit. It could have been a little more attentive (for the kind of restaurant this was, especially since it was not particularly packed at the time). Some servers were great in the sense of taking the time to explain the dishes and make recommendations, others were still very nice and polite, but there is a little room for improvement. Portions were good, they won't fill you to the brim, but you won't leave hungry.~~TL;DR, as promised: Because this is Zakarian's place, I had high expectations, that were not met. The octopus was good, and the Short Rib was great, but these dishes were not as amazing as I expected from an Iron Chef. Portion wise dishes were good... proportion wise there is room for a little improvement, but not a lot. Pecan Pie is to be avoided... coffee is great, esp for two, espresso is great but overpriced. NTL Mule was good but could have been strongerService was good, but the TEAM could use some polishing. Value is poor, I spent $90 on food that did not meet the caliber of the restaurant.",1,0,0,Mark T.,"Weymouth, MA",254,484,585

All of the food was great and honestly we would have lingered longer, ordered more and had planned to have one of those signature Geoffrey cocktails.But the discussion at the cashier/wait station had escalated, as we watched other diners who were visibly frustrated and honestly no matter how great the food, service is king so we waited to pay our bill and finally left.Disappointed, because I'm always impressed when I see Geoffrey cook, but I would say he needs to shake his service team up some because Iron Chefs are held to a different standard.",4,0,2,Gc S.,"Belmont, NC",26,40,111

Better than many, but just a little too sweet for my palate. GOOD that it was not salty or too heavy on either the horseradish OR the worcestershire sauce.  The Ugly Burger pleased my new friend. Yes, it's a messy feed, but hey. I had the Salmon Salad, which was visually appealing and great tasting. Nice.  Fries with chipotle pepper dusting struck a pretty good note. No time for dessert or coffee, so....ABOUT THE SERVICE: There are issues here. In reverse chronological order: (1) When a diner asks for the check, IT SHOULD ARRIVE PROMPTLY. Ours didn't. We had to ask THREE TIMES. Just nutty. (2) Water glasses need refilling, particularly at this time of year. Ours weren't.(3) NORMALLY, the server checks in shortly after main courses arrive, to ask how the food is, ask if anything more is desired, provide condiments, etc. etc. This didn't happen, and although we had no unmet needs at this time, the feeling we both had was one of being overlooked. WRAPPING UP: I may come back -- the memory of a GREAT large-group meal served upstairs under a private dining arrangement looms large.

3.0,2/18/2016,"IN SHORT: When you get the feeling that there is nowhere to eat in Midtown, The National comes through with simple, but solid American cooking.THE STORY: Almost without fail, only 3 types of restaurants exist in Midtown. There is the 3-star restaurant where a jacket and corporate card are required; there is the themed, Times Square-adjacent, chain restaurant familiar only to Middle America; and, of course, there is the galaxy of fast-casual eateries that might as well close their doors on the weekends when every corporate employee tries to avoid the entire area for a few precious hours of freedom.That being said, a few restaurants have started to squeeze their way into an otherwise sterile dining scene, offering a cozier cafe and brasserie style that stands out amongst the typical Midtown joints.In the center of it all, just 3 short blocks from Rock Center and around the corner from the Waldorf, lies The National, Geoffrey Zakarian's all-day American bistro in the ground floor of The Benjamin hotel on East 51st Street.Though it still bustles with weekday power lunches, The National cools off and relaxes during dinners and weekend brunches, allowing diners to appreciate the comfortable, leather banquettes and old-timey, D.C.-like atmosphere.Staples like mussels, oysters, and the Steak Tartare with hand-cut sirloin, pickled mushrooms, cherry pepper, mustard, Indian sweet soy sauce, and a quail egg are always on the menu for every meal, but anything involving pork at The National is particularly worthwhile. The Pork Chop at dinner was recently served with red cabbage, black pepper spätzle, and baked apple for an exceptionally juicy and sweet bite, while the Pork Belly Benedict at brunch is a heartier, richer favorite, with its creamy béarnaise sauce and pickled fresno peppers.The Egg White Frittata with quinoa, sharp cheddar, kale, and ricotta is also remarkably flavorful and well seasoned for what could have been a basic dish, with the creaminess of the cheeses balancing the lightness of the eggs, preventing any distasteful dryness. Prices here are reasonable, too, with most items on the lunch menu coming in below $20, and entrees on the dinner menu hovering at $30 or under, a rare moment where prices aren't abused in Midtown.For what could too easily become a heartless Midtown establishment, the service is also surprisingly excellent and will make every guest feel well cared for. At a recent brunch, my otherwise perfectly chivalrous date ordered every woman's worst nightmare - something healthier than her - and opted for the House Made Granola with berries and about a tablespoon-sized portion of greek yogurt. He must have sensed my horror at having a dramatically larger appetite than him, because he then asked our waiter for more yogurt and warm milk, which they quickly brought without fuss.Those few thoughtful moments prove that even in an anonymous neighborhood like Midtown Manhattan, The National can be a power lunch destination that doesn't break the bank, or your spirit. And for the East 50s, that's pretty remarkable.",0,1,0,Ali M.,"New York, NY",31,234,245
1.0,2/15/2016,"Chef Jeffrey Zakarian, We will find it hard to watch you as a judge on food shows and watching you on Iron Chef when Your own restaurants service and food was sub par for one of the most important date nights of he year!!  We had an 8 o'clock reservation and they could only seat us in the bar which was ok because it was valentines day and they had an amazing live band. Menus were dropped off and drink order was taken for one of us. Eventually, about 10 minutes later, my girlfriends order was taken but the wine glass was filthy!  So it took a couple extra minutes. It took us multiple attempts to flag down our waiter for a second glass of wine. 6-8 minutes he asked me if I wanted another cocktail and I had to remind him that she was still waiting for a second glass of wine.The server returned to ask us if we were ready, but never once told us about any specials. We got an appetizer which was decent. Followed by the pork chop and the salmon.Upon arrival the sauce for the pork chop was literally ice cold, I tried one of the black pepper spätzle and it was also cold.   She cut into the pork chop and it too was like warm inside. When I mentioned it to the waiter, he told me it's because if the cold cabbage that is placed on top. I had to inform him that every aspect of the plate was cold! As for my salmon, it was decent but the skin was not cooked crisp enough to eat.She completely lost her appetite by this point, filthy glass and cold meal, so we ordered the  profiteroles which, according the the menu, were filled with mint, chocolate and espresso gelato. When it arrived, it looked amazing but when we tasted the gelato it was bland. The chocolate tasted like ice, the espresso was actually vanilla and the mint was simply colored green, not even a hint of mint. The last bite I took I bit into something and didn't realize there were chocolate chips in one of the gelatos!  Honestly the only reason I wanted it was for the espresso flavor which never showed up.Overall we were completely disappointed that an Iron Chef would run one of his signature restaurants in Manhattan so poorly.

If only our table had been large enough to give us a bit of elbow room to use our cutlery rather than pantomiming T-Rex's through dinner...I think the service and ambiance in the main dining room is better, but I would avoid the bar room.",0,2,1,Arjun S.,"Manhattan, NY",8,54,1

4.0,1/13/2016,"The national is one of iron chef geffory zakarins places that is located on 50th and Lexington. The easiest way to find the national is to look for the Benjamin hotel. National is attached to the hotel. There is a secret private entrance from the Benjamin to the national. I'm not going to tell you my secrets. But you can ask a manager at the front desk. One of the main reasons I like the national is its on my way walking from the UES to grand central. I can stop for a quick drink or a cup of tea. The national does not have a big menu but the food that they put out is very good and tasteful. I recommend making reservations for breakfast lunch and dinner. Lunch is around $20 PP. dinner is around $30 per person not including alcohol. The breakfast and lunch menu is separate from the dinner menu. In my opinion the best thing on the menu at the national is the ugly burger. Pickled jalapeños and NTL sauce baby lettuce House made pickles all for $19 + $2 for bacon which is house cured. This burger is great for the price. I have had it 3 times. I highly recommend the burger. The salmon dinner is very good and the salmon salad had a ton of salmon inside. The ambience at the national is nice. There are checkerboard floors and during the holidays x mas lights by the bar and wreaths in the Windows.  You could definitely take a date here but it's a bit too noisy if you want to have a convo. At dinner time they do put a candle at your table. The mood here is very nice it's not to dark that you can't see the menu but it's not to light that your not comfy. It's set just right. You can take a date here, I'm sure she would love it. Just keep in mind the noise and don't be surprised if someone is speaking another language at the table next to you. The national has a very good alcohol selection. On each table there's a little card with the signature drinks. Signature drinks are $15 A drink. I think this is very reasonably priced especially in Midtown where most of the drinks are $19-$20. I have had the midtown Manhattan and it was pretty good. The bar area is interesting. At the left side of the bar you will see locals reading the newspaper and relaxing. On the right side of the bar it seemed to me like it was mostly people that were staying at the hotel or they were just grabbing a quick drink. The servers are great here very tentative. The bartenders on the other hand have been hit or miss. I don't sit at the bar anymore. I will ask for a table and just have the server bring me a drink. My issue was a 1 time deal I have eaten in here multiple times and have never had a issue. I have been back since my issue and everything has been fantastic. This story does not reflect my review rating.  I asked one day for a double of brudaladdie 16 yr single malt please. I was at the national a few days before and had the drink. The bar tender told me scotch doesn't have a vintage which one would you like. I replied I know but last time I was here I had the 16. He replied scotch doesn't have a year it's not wine. So I pointed to the bottle that said that bottle with the 16yr on it. He gave me the drink seemed annoyed and told me wine has a year. I was a little annoyed I wanted to just put $50 on the bar and leave. I never get embarrassed easily but as he was bickering with me people were looking and my friend was laughing because he knows I'm really into scotch. Also the glass had water stains on it. I'm not saying the bartender gave me a water stained glass on purpose but... Sometimes I wonder. So if I go here to grab a drink. I get a table and have the waitress bring me a drink. I have been back and the service has been great no issues. Overall the national is a solid place to eat breakfast lunch dinner or to grab a drink. I highly recommend the ugly burger. It's close to grand central. Staff is nice. The private entrance is fantastic if your a local. I recommend the national. I will continue to go back. PROS:- close to grand central- I have never had a bad meal here- staff is tentative",5,3,4,Josh M.,"Manhattan, NY",540,547,2523

2.0,1/3/2016,"This is a drinks and service only review as we did not try any of the food because we were there on Christmas and all they were offering was a prix fixe multi-course meal and we were only interested in appetizers or small plates.  Nice facility, although it looks just like half a dozen other new-American places in the area.  Cocktails were excellent -- unique twists on classics yet still approachable.  My wife enjoyed the Sidekick Margarita and I thought their take on the Moscow Mule was excellent.  The bartenders were friendly but frankly not very good at being bartenders.  Perhaps because it was Christmas they staffed the bar with servers or less-experienced staff members, but you'd expect a place like this to have professional bartenders that know what they are doing.  Even though the place was not very busy, all of the customers at the bar had to get the bartenders' attention for initial drinks and refills, and several couples left without ordering anything because neither of the bartenders said a word to them for 5 minutes.  Host station staff seemed disinterested as well.  Menu looks interesting, and the cocktails were great, but the place feels like it needs a management or staff overhaul to really be top notch and compete with all of the other great options in the area.",0,0,0,Aaron M.,"Laingsburg, MI",49,141,98

Mushroom omelette with caramelized shallots, spinach and Parmigiano Reggio, thick cut bacon, fruit salad with a refreshing ginger lime treatment, coffee with rich flavor... all seriously good and in my opinion worth the premium price. Plus, it's New York. You really can't be shocked at $16 eggs. One crappy downside I have to mention was that the staff threw away our breakfast after we stepped out to the bathroom. We just got our food and took a few bites when my 4 year old decided that we need to take a bathroom break. Since I was doing some solo parenting, I needed to take all the kids to the can and leave the table unpopulated. However, we left our jackets and bag there, and of course, the nearly full meal we were just served. We go, come back, and of course, all the food is gone. When I explained it to the manager they sent out another meal toot sweet. Still, it was a boneheaded mistake for them to make in the first place. That aside, great breakfast spot.

Everything is delicious. Plus potatoes to die for. They also have great coffee and their bar is pretty good as well. This time we had the apple walnut pancakes and the smoked salmon benedict (not on the menu). Both were very good. But let me tell you the eggs benny was some of the best I've had in the city.

1.0,12/16/2015,Yikes! What a bad experience at The National. I can't believe a star chef attaches his name to this place.I didn't exactly have lofty expectations before the meal. Midtown East isn't lighting the culinary (NYC) world on fire. I ordered that kale salad which was a bunch of lettuce and hardly any of the other things listed in dish description. The lettuce leaves were so large it was hanging off the china. The waiter upsold me on some grilled chicken which I thought would be cut up and incorporated into the dish but instead I was served a massive and flavorless chicken breast thrown on the side of the bowl as an after throught. Everyone else at the table ordered burgers which were delievered incorrecly made. All of our fries were cold. I ordered another app that I can't remember.

The apps came about 2 minutes after ordering which seemed odd (we ordered meatballs) and when the drinks showed up several minutes later the waiter had brought my friend a mojito. She said she ordered the margarita and he said, no joke, ""try this instead and then if you don't like it you can order a margarita"". Um no. She wants a margarita thanks. Waiter took FOREVER about everything and also screwed up the dessert order so we asked him to just cancel dessert and bring the check.

3.0,6/28/2015,"I was really excited to come to Mr. Zakarian's restaurant for the first time and took my wife there for her birthday dinner. Overall, the dinner was really good. But I had the nagging feeling the whole time I was there that there was some restraint going on? Almost a feeling of disbelief that this was a Zakarian restaurant. Mussel appetizers were extremely fresh and could be the best I've ever had? Beer selection was spotty but decent. Why have Saratoga Lager when you can easily order Brooklyn Lager at a 4 star plus rating? All comes down to preference I guess. Grapefruit & Avocado salad was very fresh and my wife cleaned the plate. The Caesars salad I had was the best wilted salad I ever had and was delicious in spite of that fact. My pork chop entrée was on point, juicy and delicious, but why did I pay so much for what amounted to French Fries at $7 a pop? I expected something better at that price. Brussel sprouts were incredible! and I couldn't stop eating them. Branzino was a little dry and my wife wound up chewing on a rubber band which was probably mistakenly left on the cutting board during preparation. But even Zakarian himself would deem this unacceptable. But the staff made up for it who was also on point the whole night. Carrot Cake was standard issue and too much orange zest put it on the bitter side of good.

4.0,6/16/2015,"Cheese board, chicken wings and wine were delicious. My first visit came after a long day at work and my friend and I did not have a large appetite so we ordered 2 items from the bar snacks and a few glasses of wine. Initially we wanted the meat balls but they had run out so we got the wings. I am a lover of all great cheese and the selection they provided was fantastic. The chicken wings were savory, moist and saucy. I normally dislike ginger but i could hardly taste the ginger in their ginger sesame sauce so I was a fan. If you strangely like the taste of ginger (I know I'm part of the few that don't) then prepare yourself to miss the ginger taste (which the absence of makes the dish taste better so don't fret).When I came back a second time I had the pork chop with a side of polenta that was very good too. The pork chop was cooked well and tender. The polenta was delicious and probably one of the best I've had. My friend ordered the salmon and she liked it very much as well.Both times I came without a reservation and was seated fairly quickly. Although I did go during the weekday so I bet the weekends you'll need a reservation to avoid a long wait time.The staff were polite and made sure our wine glasses were always filled. The atmosphere is nice and not too loud so conversation is easily had. The dim lighting is pleasant but with my terrible eyesight it was hard to read the menu at one of the tables.

2.0,5/30/2015,"After a busy day while staying at the Benjamin, we were excited to just have to go downstairs to a highly acclaimed restaurant with a famous chef. They could have done better..We were  seated at a comfortable table a bit too close to the noisy bar. My dinner companion was not terribly hungry so we started with a wedge salad which was crisp but somewhat underdressed. She ordered the potato leek soup which was very good and beautifully presented. I ordered a pork chop being careful to specify medium. It came out well presented with grits and undercooked broccolini. The grits were the best part of the meal. The chop, which was huge -probably over a pound - was seriously overcooked rendering it beyond cutting with the knife provided. After failing with a second knife I returned it to the kitchen to be sliced down. I was hoping that they would realize their cooking error and send out a better one. No, I got the same one back, in quarter inch slices which were beyond well-done, tough, dry and nearly inedible. We did not order dessert.I do not like posting bad reviews until I've given a place two or three chances but I'm not likely to be back in New York any time soon.

Example: $11 oatmeal (I could have made better oatmeal in my microwave), pancakes are mushy, omelet seemed fine but not worth the exorbitant price.Ambiance is nice, not too hectic, and in a convenient location.Overall I'm glad my brother picked up the tab.

2.0,5/10/2015,"I happened to be back in New York as every end of March. As you may see, it is mid May right now. I took my time to review this restaurant because I did not want to review it in the heat of the moment. Yes, my friends. This was not a good experience for me and my family. Honestly, for much respect I have to Iron Cheff Zakarian, I have to mentioned this is one of the worst dining experiences I had in Manhattan in years. As usual, I will put apart the fact everyone working in this place has the typical 'New York Attitude', which is becoming more annoying every time I go there. I will just overlook the fact they are rude and in some cases mean, not to mention, erratic and slow. I will just take 1 star for that and move on.We arrived there around 9:30PM. Kind of late of us, Texas residents, but looks it is 'rush hour' for New York restaurants. Even though, just a couple walked in before us and then we were supposed to be next. The hostess, for some reason, acted like we were not in the right place or we were not welcome. I decided to overlook that and wait for her next move. After deliberating with her manager, they gave us a table right next to the kitchen entrance on the other side of the restaurant. At the beginning I was kind of upset because she did not want to give us a table in the dining room, but in the bar area, but at last, I did not dislike it since it was more private than the dining room itself and we had no 'close by' table. Our waiter was kind of odd. He seems to have problems, not with his broken English which I could understand very well, but with his skills. He seemed to be clueless about the menu and the drink options. I just pretend it was his first day and move on.We did not order any special. Just everything directly form the menu. My wife and my sister in law went for the Roasted Chicken with Barley Risotto. I was not that hungry so I set for the Charcuterie out of the appetizer menu. My 5 y/o niece got chicken strips and fries. About 45 minutes later, we got our plates (you did not read it wrong, 45 minutes and I am being generous, trust me). My charcuterie, looked very well, but my taste buds were not impress at all. The plate is average just to say something. Nothing impressive on it, and honestly, among all the stuff, just two squalid pieces of prosciutto and one of Italian Mortadella, really Chef?  Anyway, let's go to the chicken and risotto. The roasted chicken was somewhat dry but still edible, the problem comes with the barley risotto. I have to be honest, never had barley risotto in my life so for my taste (and my family member's too) I don't consider this was a good combination, but I will have to go with the chef judgement and say this was a bad choice on our part. As of this part of our meal, the best thing on the table, was my niece's plate. At least she munched all her chicken strips and fries with no hesitation. During the course of the meal, we have to ask the waiter for some salt, pepper, ketchup and some other spices and sauces to make it a little bit more 'interesting' (just to say a word). Once we finished (that's an euphemism) our food, I have to let my family go, till I wait for our waiter finishing an argument with another waiter and the bartender to give me my bill, so I can join my family on my walk back to the hotel. (I read another review about waiting staff arguing with each other.... well, that did not change much). Honestly, I will like to love this place, since one of my favorites Iron Chef is running it, but the execution is very poor. I am supposed Mr Zakarian has better standards than what I saw there and I hope they improve in the future. I will give then one more chance and of course I will stay away from barley 'anything' (except beers of course).As of today, guys, in 3 blocks around there are plenty of options, if I were you, I will give National a try, but don't say you weren't warned.",0,0,0,Rudy J.

I've read mixed reviews about Geoffrey Zakarian's version of a Euro-American ""Grand Cafe"", but actually had a relatively nice experience.The place was fairly empty around noon on a Saturday - never a good sign - but it worked out for us because the servers were extremely attentive and diligent about refilling much-needed water glasses after what had been a long night. I had read the Ugly Burger was a safe (and hearty) choice, and went with that, which turned out to be a good decision. The burger was cooked exactly to medium rare and crammed with tasty toppings including pickled onions and jalapenos, with a good batch of fries on the side. I also love that they serve Sir Kensington's ketchup; that stuff is great. Nevertheless, the consensus around the table was that the rest of the more traditional brunch dishes - an omelette, eggs benedict, etc. - were less exciting.

2.0,1/29/2015,"First NYC dining experience, man was I dissapointed. Luckily I tromped down to the Modern the next day and had an excellent meal and experience.I was bringing two clients I had in town with me to dinner, and we chose this place because it was close to our hotel and there was supposed to be a lot of snow. I made a reservation and they told me they would be open notwithstanding the forthcoming blizzard.Well, we got there, and despite several empty tables, we still had to wait. We were also seated right next to the server station, in the middle of the room. Our server came by once to take our order, and then did not return until he brought the dessert menus. I kid you not. Not one time did he stop by and ask if we needed anything, like, you know, ketchup for our fries, nothing. We would have ordered a few more drinks, but you couldn't even flag the guy down. Now that's not to say that he wasn't paying a TON of attention to a table near by us, but just far enough away that he was able to ignore my attempts at getting his attention.Best service: water was constantly refilled.The food was pretty good, I wasn't going to get the hamburger, but the waiter reccommended it, so I got it, and I didn't regret it. Would have liked some ketchup though. Dining companion thought the lamb was just okay. The other person also had the hamburger. To be honest, if the food hadn't been pretty good I would have given this place one star.That said, this was nothing that blew me away. I eat at higher end establishments outside of NY quite frequently, and this was nothing special. Also, the fact that the Caesar salad for a starter was about only three dollars cheaper than my entree was comical. I understand when you are at a high end steakhouse, but let's not kid ourselves about where we were.Anyway, with all the great options in NY, I won't be coming back after the lousy service. We had much better service and my dinner companion told me a very good burger a few blocks away for lunch the next day for 1/4 of the price at a tavern.

After a glass of red wine was knocked over, we stood and asked to be seated elsewhere. The ""host"" pointed us to another table. About 5 minutes later we realized they weren't bringing us there, so we went over. Eventually a server came over and asked for our order. We eventually got our appetizers which were disappointing, (do not get the steak tartare). The entrees were good but given the abysmal service, hardly enjoyable.

2.0,11/28/2014,"Considering that Jeffrey Zakarian is touted as being the executive chef of The National, this place is even more disappointing than it might have been. We were met at the door by three young women who simply stood there staring at us. I finally broke the ice and said ""Two for dinner"" and finally got a response. Although the restaurant was only about 2/3rds full and plenty of tables were available, we were seated in the bar beside the service area. I asked for our table to be changed, and while one of the hostesses accommodated us, she was clearly brusque in her manner. We were not off to a good start.We started with the seasonal soup of the day, butternut squash, as well as a special soup, turkey chowder. The butternut squash soup had very little butternut flavor and was very heavy on the cinnamon and clove. The consistency was thin and watery. The turkey chowder was a bit better, but had very little turkey and even less turkey flavor.From there we went on to the wedge salad for my wife and the meatballs for me. The wedge salad was way too vinegary and the bacon was so sugar cured that it didn't have any of that salty taste you expect to offset the blue cheese. The meatballs were small, very dry, and desperately needed a sauce of some sort to give them some flavor. A bit of salt made them edible, but barely.We decided to call it quits after that. So-so service, food that was completely undistinguished, and prices that were ridiculous for this level of food made me swear off any restaurant with the Jeffrey Zakarian moniker.

1.0,9/3/2014,"AWFUL experience. After 15 minutes I'd walked out and made a reservation elsewhere. My partner and I had trouble parking our car and arrived around 15 minutes late for our reservation. When we got there we were told our table had been given to a walk in and we would need to sit in the bar area. We couldn't help but wonder why they wouldn't give that table to the walk in and hold onto the reserved one or at least check in with us to see if we were still coming. (Despite having our number, no one called to ask if we were keeping our reservation, as most establishments worth their salt will do.) It should also be noted that there were at least three booth tables open in the dining area along with a few regular tables. At this point we are brought into the super loud bar area full of drunk businessmen. Neither of us want to sit there, which we relay to the hostess. She tells us this is all she has. We say we're happy to wait for another table to open up. She says no. They have a party of twelve coming in later so that won't be possible. We sit down. After some time we still hadn't given beverage orders and were just annoyed, so when the waitress finally came over we asked for a manager. While waiting for him, we looked online to see about another reservation just in case. Still no manager. We call make another reservation. Still no manager. We wait. Nothing. So we left. Walking to the car, I decide to call to speak with the manager. I get routed through an automated system to a voicemail and leave a message. When it occurs to me that it might be an office line and he could be on the floor, I call the main line to ask for him directly. I recognize the voice of the girl who picks up (Daisy) as the hostess we'd dealt with. I ask for the manager and she asks for my name. I think she recognizes me as well and I don't particularly trust her to connect me so I can essentially complain about her, so I just repeat that I'd like to speak with a manager. Without a word she hangs up on me. This is absolutely my last time at The National, which is a shame -- the food is good and I end up in that area at least once a month. Not to mention, I'd brought my partner there to test it out for a potentially large private party. That's not happening now. There are other places in the city with good food that also understand customer service.

3.0,8/22/2014,"I expected more from a Geoffrey Zakarian restaurant.  We ate lunch there as the final stop on a Chopped judges tour of NYC.  (We hit three in 2 days)  It was a last minute decision to grab lunch before our flight.  There was no wait at 1pm on a Monday.I didn't love the decor.  It comes off like they are trying to be fancy disguised as comfortable but it really just feels casual with a super premium high priced menu.  I could see Chef Zakarian sitting down, designing the menu and the concept, getting it set up and in-motion and then moving on to his many other ventures.  A restaurant needs someone to constantly be steering the ship and it felt like the staff didn't know their job.  The hostesses where flipping their shoes on and off...which isn't a big deal but at an upscale place, it shouldn't be happening.  I saw two different waitresses check their teeth and hair in the mirrored column in the middle of the restaurant.  Gross.  We ordered a ginger-ale and an iced tea.  The tea had ""ice tea cubes"" which was a cute touch.  The ginger ale was a 6 ounce bottle.  SIX ounces.  I didn't know they made soda bottles that small.  It was a yummy bottle but again, six ounces.My wife wasn't very hungry, so she got a side order of brussel sprouts which were delicious.  I ordered the $19 hamburger and fries.  I think it was probably worth it.  REALLY YUMMY burger and we were told to order it without cheese to really get the amazing flavor of the meat.  It was good advice.  Super juicy and delicious.  The fries were, ""just fries.""Summary: The restaurant felt well designed but not well managed and as a result, the food was great but the service didn't meet our high expectations.  Maybe next time we'll try Zakarian's, The Lambs Club, instead.",3,0,0,Alex R.,"Evanston, IL",0,16,3

Getting seated wasn't all that hard, particularly since I was running late and everyone else was seated. That said, it is a small space, so it gets loud pretty quick - it was difficult to hear everyone at our tables of 6. Part of what brought the meal down was the service - our waiter would just simply wander away if we didn't respond right away to him, and he barely bothered to come in and check with us as to what we going on. He also mixed up who was getting what at our table...in all, service was definitely less than stellar.The drinks were not too bad; while the beer selection wasn't wide, they did have a reasonable number of crafts available...and after a long day at work, a couple of Green Flash West Coast IPAs were just what was needed to get a load off. I went with the branzino for my main course (even though the server pointed at it and said that steak was the most popular dish...hmmm...), but it was rather unremarkable - not really much memorable flavor, although the filets were tender. The potatoes served on the side were forgettable versions of potatoes that would be served at brunch. For dessert, we shared some cookies - okay, but the 6 cookies are not worth the $8-9 you pay for them by any measure.I suppose I might go again, just because I do like the vibe and the environment - it fits in well with the Midtown East work scene - but it wouldn't be a spot I visit just for kicks otherwise.

4.0,5/1/2014,"The National offers delicious food, a great ambiance, and creative drinks for an upscale dinner, business lunch, or cocktails with friends. The National is pretty popular with tourists and locals alike, which means it can be rather crowded. On a rainy Wednesday night, even with reservations, they sat my bosses and I at a tiny table right up next to the bar, which totally had the chance of ruining the evening. We took it all in stride. We ordered the grilled octopus, which was fantastic, but on the small side. We had half a dozen oysters (small, clean, fresh, and tasty, guessing Canadian). We followed that up with two orders of the branzino (again, on the small side), the lamb shank, and the cod. The lamb shank was huge and well seasoned, cooked to tender perfection. The others cleaned their plates, which is both a testament to the good food and how slow of an eater I am. We also followed up with dessert - again, clean plates all around. I thoroughly enjoyed my chocolate mousse. Service was abysmal. Really. We had a 7 pm reservation. We were missing one of our party, and put drink orders in. But even after he arrived, we still had not placed our dinner order. The waiter took our dinner order at 8 pm - one hour after we sat. Receiving our appetizers and entrees did not take too long. But getting the check took another good 30 minutes after the table had been cleared. We didn't leave the restaurant until 10:30 pm, long after many tables had already cleared and left.

I have only been twice, but didn't have a problem getting a last minute reservation either time. The food is good and I recommend the fruit salad (they add ginger and lime to it - yum!) and the sunchoke omelette. My only real complaint is that in my experience, they were not particularly accommodating when it came to altering menu items. Additionally, they won't serve food from the lunch menu during Sunday brunch. This left my mother very disappointed since she had her heart set on something she saw on the lunch menu when browsing their website. Most restaurants hand out the brunch menu, but still allow for people to pick from the lunch menu considering brunch is generally served until 3 pm. She's not a big fan of breakfast food and prefers lunch-like cuisine. So that was a bit of a let down. But again, everything we did order was tasty and I am sure I will dine here again.

3.0,1/6/2014,"an alright brunch choice. the short rib with biscuits hit the spot, and I probably drank enough coffee to shut down a small coffee shop. to be fair, this dish was supposed to come with asparagus, but instead we got salad. the biscuits weren't anything special. the short rib with egg on top was really the saving grace here. also, the countless amount of coffee I drank (having come back to Forest Hills at 3 AM from a concert in Sayreville the night before).there was no real time to complain or send things back, since some members of our group had to rush out for a theater show.service was a bit spotty.the place does look pretty upscale and it's clean. the bathroom is in the basement of the adjoined hotel, which is a tad bit annoying (and questionably not ADA-compliant).I did have way too much fun with the steamed milk that was provided for all the coffee I drank. I used it to make foam art, while musing that my foam art is far superior to anything created by art majors living in Williamsburg on their rich parents' money.",2,2,1,Mike B.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",187,1514,175
4.0,1/3/2014,"Even when The National have many and diverse connotations for the Spanish pueblo that can surely start endless conversations, debates and discussions; or may make you think of that great Spanish Tapas place in Chelsea*. When is not. For my (Spanish) family, The National Bar and Dining Rooms (The NTL hereafter)  have become our place of gathering for diverse celebrations. Dad and I randomly discovered it a while ago and he fell in love with the ambiance emanating through the windows. The lighting. The classic display. The elegance. Dad just fall for those and we decided to give it a try. Three regular meals, one Thanksgiving and one Christmas celebration after we have a place were not only me, but my family when visiting are regulars. I tell you first what in my opinion is bad here. Like a dessert in a meal, the sweet pleasure will came at the end. I think their drinks menu is unreasonably overpriced. Once, we had a Bloody Mary. It was seriously only ok. For a wine by the glass, those under $15 are also average. Or that is been my experience. Their Cabernet Franc form Long Island (2010) at $14 is good enough. But my Spanish heritage brought us always to a bottle of Rioja Marques de Murrieta reserve 2007 ($19 glass/$76 bottle). This wine is wonderful. Truth is, the wine menu by the bottle is quite extensive but price wise I don't think it is. Another matter, the front of the house house is .. Hm mm okay. You almost every time will have to wait. Yes, I almost always had a reservation. And during that time you will question if they have forgotten you. Their welcoming is a bit cold. But ask, and you will be listened. Last time I requested an specific table and so we were seated; plus we also wanted to somehow break the rules of the prefix menu; again our wish was granted. This being said and even when some of their dishes have room to improve, lets get dessert now. Si? I love the service. Correct, pleasant, efficient and friendly if you are open to it. Old manners if you ask me. And you know ..  ladies, ehem, girls like to be treated as that. In case you need a tip. The decor falls also into the classics. It breaths on elegance and I just love the floor design, the room lighting, the feeling of intimacy in the tables, and how your face is reflected in the metal elements in your table ... to name, salt and pepper, candle holders, dinnerware ... plates with the house name. Simple yet sophisticated. Those things, not really important, but that somehow elevate the overall experience. Their trumpet mushroom salad is wonderful, perfectly dressed. Their Brussel Sprouts, which I have taste prepared in different ways, have been always tasteful, always good. Same with the Scallops. I love their Farro Rissoto and The Octopus. I would opt for fish instead of meat. I think they do a wonderful job with fish dishes, but the meats I have try (turkey and duck) have been always dry and bland. I heard from someone I share a meal with, that the Ugly burger was average. However, wonderful desserts. The only one I wasn't a fan of, was their Sundae, but I have try many and they were all excellent. However, I think they are best with their cakes. (i.e.  Spiced carrot and pumpkin cake). To finish, I would recommend you to get an expresso. Classically served. Incredible (good) taste. And what can I say, the fact that Geoffrey Zakarian is been always one of my favorites Iron Chef-stars, didn't ever count a bit when I decided on my first step inside The NTL. Really ... * yes, I do think one of the two should gave up on the name",6,4,5,Laura A.,"Brooklyn, NY",232,344,1232

3.0,12/30/2013,"I am a fan of ""Chopped"" so, naturally, I was pretty jazzed when my dad invited us to brunch at Geoffrey Zakarian's The National to exchange Christmas gifts and enjoy each other's company.  The restaurant itself has an upscale yet relaxed feel to it, and since Mike and I arrived a little early and the restaurant wasn't too busy at the time, we were able to get us the curtained-off VIP table in the back corner. I had a hard time deciding what to have for brunch since just about everything sounded delicious.  I opted for the short rib over biscuits, without the egg though.  The short rib itself was pretty terrific although the biscuits were not as good as the ones at Docks.  It was supposed to come with asparagus, but there were none on my plate.  My dad and Mike both ordered the same dish (with the egg) and also did not receive them.  The salad that came instead was tasty with a mustardy vinaigrette.  The service was lackadaisical.  My sister commented that our waiter seemed like he must have had a late night the night before.  My parents had theater tickets to see a show around the corner so we were on a bit of a schedule.  Another thing that irked me was that not only were the bathrooms downstairs, they weren't in the restaurant at all!  They were in The Benjamin Hotel, which is attached.  Not only was this inconvenient, but the lines were long.  Was I overwhelmed by The National?  Not particularly, but it was a good setting for us to have a proper brunch and open presents on a Saturday afternoon.",1,0,0,Caroline B.,"New York, NY",457,1247,36

My spare ribs could have used a dash more sauce but were otherwise perfect. Flavor was spot on. I did not try the branzino but my friend was extremely happy. Dessert, we had cookies and an excellent sherry. Absolutely enjoyable if not original. Based on food alone I would give 4 stars. Absolutely a stand out in a bleek part of town...what is this even...midtown east? Who goes there? Anyway...food is not the only part of meal and our service was sadly horrible.  Mind, I believe this was solely the fault of our server.

I  couldn't eat too much of either.  Next, I ordered the Mushroom Polenta...horrible!  I am not sure if they intend to serve it cold but if so that is a big mistake.  The combination of hard musrooms mixed with cold mush is a texture nightmare!!We also ordered the Mac and Cheese which seemed like it had the potential to be good if not also cold in the middle??? Must be pre-dished snd thrown in an oven...Our waiter was nice enough but running around frantic and asked if we were ready to order before he even gave us menus and the bar service was awful.  We were given a menu and tgen ignored for 15 minutes!  Noone else was ordering drinks,  it was beyond strange and when she finally came over it was as if our existence at the bar was annoying her!   The making of the drinks was pretty sloppy but the French Cosmopolitan was pretty good.Anyway, bottom line is that it's just another over priced,  horrible serviced, overrated food establishment that could only survive in Manhattan because of its famous owner and non stop tourism.",2,0,0,Darlene B.,"Wantagh, NY",56,81,46

2.0,11/3/2013,"Ironically, I had just read Anthony Bourdain's infamous chapter on food safety and brunch when I decided to actually GO to Sunday brunch at this appealing-looking Midtown East restaurant. Its location was the prime draw, though the menu looked good enough. But I should have listened to Tony, a phrase that will remain my pre-dinner mantra forevermore.The problem with brunch is that I seem to always either be (1) mildly hung over, or (2) really hungry, or both when I go. The problem then is that by the time my food arrives I will eat it no matter how awful it is.The first thing I will say about The National is that even for the neighborhood and nice decor, the prices are outrageous. Twelve dollars for a 10-oz Bloody Mary is insulting and the cocktail itself nothing special. I dine out in Manhattan several times a week, so I think I have a handle on what constitutes a reasonable price for a brunch Bloody Mary, and this was just over the top.But the most disappointing thing of all was the Pork Belly Benedict. Now, I admit that with a name like Pork Belly Benedict, expectations were high. But nonetheless, I know an undercooked poached egg when I see one. I think these may have been cooked by simply soaking them in room temperature water overnight. Runny yolks? Yes, please. But the whites were not set and the whole dish was cold. The pieces of pork belly were generous but also cold, as was the bland bearnaise sauce. On the plus side, the fries (separate side order) were delicious if unevenly salted, and the cheese grits (also sold separately) were creamy and delicious. So okay, Tony, I have learned my lesson. Brunch always sucks unless you go to a place that really does brunch intentionally and well. Such is not the case at this place.

It's a strip which isn't my favorite cut, but it was prepared to the correct temperature and ended up being fairly tender (strips generally are a more chewy cut). I ate the whole thing; delicious!  Also, we had a plate of ravioli for a tasting, and they were excellent.  I usually hate anything that comes garnished with cooked peppers, but these were tasty.One unusual thing.  I think it was the best unsweetened iced tea I've ever had.  Whatever vendor they use provides them with an iced tea I think had a light infusion of peaches, and it was tasty.  The Iced Tea Ice Cubes were also a nice touch.  For dessert, I had the chocolate mousse cake that comes with a scoop of tangerine sorbet.  It was just the right size for an after-lunch dessert.Really a nice lunch spot.  If I had anything to complain about, it'd be that I didn't feel like there were many choices that stuck out to me that'd make it hard to choose what to have.  This means that after looking at the choices, I kind of ""meh'd"" my way to the inevitable conclusion to try the steak.I will dine here again.",0,0,0,Ryan C.,"New York, NY",15,13,7
3.0,9/5/2013,"This restaurant really was just A-OK. I came here for dinner, and with it being Geoffrey Zakarian's restaurant, I think I was expecting to be blown away by it. It was definitely a good meal with quality food and drink, but nothing spectacular. I will say off the bat, our service was less than satisfactory. We were sitting right by the waiter's stand, and it must have been at least 30 mins after we sat down for our waiter to take our order. Granted, he did come and take our drink orders and brought them back, but I'm sure he saw my party sitting at the table with our menus closed.The dining room was not very intimate, and the tile floors were kind of noisy. However, the food we received was all prepared and cooked very well. I had the Ugly Burger, which hit the mark (granted, it was just a burger). I also tasted the brussel sprouts, which were fantastic, and the polenta, which was also good.In short, everything was satisfactory, but nothing that makes me want to return.",0,0,0,Bette M.,"Jersey City, NJ",1,42,0

Everything - particularly meats - were good; I tend to avoid pork chops while dining out because they tend to be dry and overdone but this one was juicy and slightly pink. Perfect!

4.0,8/27/2013,"*This review is for dinner*I had an OK experience at The National for brunch, and I was initially skeptical about returning too soon for dinner. However, I was glad I gave them a second chance. AMBIANCE: Classy, cozy and semi-old school decor, espescially with the candles lit. It surprised me how different the restaurant could look in the evening. When you enter, there is a winding staircase that leads up to 2 private dining rooms. Brownie points for the warm bread basket and butter. We received two selections of warm bread. FOOD: My sister and I shared several dishes. Portion sizes are average, which is good because you can order an appetizer, main and dessert and feel well stuffed, but also share a plate between 2 people and receive an adequate tasting. We tried the grilled octopus salad, the warm bean salad and the milk-fed suckling pig. I am a fan of grilled octopus and almost always get the octopus dish at every restaurant. The National's octopus dish would definitely receive my thumbs up. In fact, every dish we tried here had a unique 'wow' factor to it. I liked that the dishes here had interesting, yet simple ingredients, unlike some places i've been to where the flavors are just too overcomplicated to be crowd pleasers.

I got the pork belly benedict off of their brunch menu. I mean, the goodness of one of the mother sauces in French cooking plus pork belly instead of Canadian bacon? Holy balls was I excited!Eh, well I suppose things can send better on paper than they do in real life but this was pretty underwhelming. The pork belly was barely there, both in real life and taste. The egg was nice and runny but it was basically trying to mop up the yolk to get some flavor, even the Bearnaise sauce was just okay. Seriously, almost 20 bucks for this? Where is it going towards?

I got it with bacon, but it didn't add a whole lot. Honestly, this wasn't even close to the best burger I've had, but it was decent. Too much of the flavor (from the toppings) was in the middle of the burger, leaving the perimeter (i.e. most of the burger) not too flavorful.

2.0,8/8/2013,"This is a pricey but very well located (for the midtown business types) spot.  I had both breakfast and dinner here and both times, I felt that the kitchen and service really needed to step it up a big notch. (This is, as I said, a prime midtown business spot!)At breakfast, the server was very nice, but the subsequent waitstaff who brought out the tea and plates was not very well trained.  An extremely hot plate was handed to my colleague who did get hurt touching it.  When the ""hot plate"" warning is given, most diners will adhere to it - but when not, injury is almost certain. My egg white  frittata was also not terribly tasty, though it being eggs, hard to ruin completely.  It was a watery clump of egg white really.  I also would say that the very expensive tea is not pre-steeped at all, so when you get it, be sure to let it sit awhile.At dinner, I returned with friends due to its location and decided to try it because it was a restaurant week participant.  Incredibly disappointing - NO vegetarian option ont he RW menu and NO vegetarian entree on the regular menu!! The kitchen can convert the gnocchi starter or mac n cheese side into an entree for you, but I always find it quite discriminating when vegetarians don't get at least one option on the menu.  Why on earth should vegetarians be treated like second class citizens that the kitchen has to accommodate? (Note, I am not veg, but was practicing a veg diet at the time for religious purposes.)Again - lack of training of the server here, who said that there would be no alterations made to the RW menu notwithstanding their lack of vegetarian option.  I insisted on speaking to a manager because this had to be a mistake! I told the server that in NY, there should always be an expectation of at least one veg dish on the menu, even if it is a stupid pasta.  She retorted that in all her experience at other restaurants, this was not the usual case (she did say it nicely, I'll admit). After forever and a day, the manager came and clarified that the starter/side could be converted and then we were able to finally proceed with our meal. The gnocchi was quite tasty - but probably best left as an appetizer, because it gets too salty after the first few bites.  The mac n cheese was also delicious - but again, prob best left as a side, since it was a bit too decadent (we were recommended to get the gnocchi for my entree and have the mac n cheese for a dish to share, which we did).The place also gets very loud, so it is hard to hear each other - so not a romantic spot and not a place for confidential discussions.It's too bad there was so much left to be desired here - it really is a convenient location for midtown work people.",1,0,0,Joan H.,"New York, NY",213,485,3
4.0,8/5/2013,"I'm surprised to see a negative review here. I had a great experience at the restaurant. I went there with my manager and while it took a while for us to be seated, we got good seats and the service was not horrible (but definitely nothing to write home about)We had the restaurant week menu. I had a pea gazpacho appetizer and mahi mahi as a main. The gazpacho was perfect for a warm summer day, fresh, bright with a hint of lemon and so light and refreshing and a treat to the eye with that beautiful green. The main of mahi mahi was delectable. I wiped the plate clean. It was perfectly prepared mahi mahi on a bed of jasmine rice in coconut sauce with asparagus. The combination sounds weird, but it totally works. I am not a fan of the dessert that I picked. Had a praline sundae. The portion was big and I thought the praline was too chunky so instead of being the crisp crunchy addition, it was this hard lump that distracts me and I almost wanted to spit it out. (tastes good just rock hard and I feel like I'm killing my teeth)I didn't know beforehand it's Chef Zakarian's restaurant until I saw it on the menu and I think he doesn't disappoint (food wise).

We saw this guy walk by us a million times prior to this, who knew he was our server?! After our desert was cleared we waited about 15 minutes before the server reappeared again.

Our third ordered something different because she just didn't want to see all three of us drinking the same thing.

The service was awful with one exception. We ordered breakfast on a weekday when I was in town for business and it was empty. The eggs benedict took 25 minutes and had eggs that were so undercooked there was no white part at all, only clear (and I love a runny egg). I sent it back and 20 minutes later was brought back a version with egg yolks cooked so far beyond chalky as to be green. Seriously. The waitress actually apologized when she put the plate down.

2.0,4/21/2013,"I came here with high expectations, but it didn't start off well.  Judging by the area that The National is located, the people's attire are most likely business or at least business casual.  It just happens I have casual Fridays at my workplace and wore casual clothes to this establishment.  Now I won't say I dress like a slob just because I was casual, but it certainly was not the same as the majority of the clientele there.  No suit, no ties.When I got there for my reservation, we were greeted by 3 hosts.  That's good, but they found my reservation and after discussing for a good 30 seconds, the guy pointed at a location on the computer, telling the hostess to bring us.  I saw the look on the hostess and it looked kind of awkward, as if even she is saying, ""Seriously?""  Anyways, she brought us to that particular table, and the table was pretty much hidden and I was with my girlfriend, yet the chairs cannot be placed in a way where we are face to face.  You would think couples would like to eat facing each other and not have one to the side.  I kept thinking, WTF is this?  Are we getting some kind of punishment, go to the corner, you've been bad kind of deal here?  There were other tables, this was not the only one available.  I guess I should have complained at the spot, but I refrained.  I usually don't, as I do not want any added substances in my food.  I would also like to add that, I noticed other folks who had casual attire like I did, actually even more casual were put into this particular corner as well.Onto the food, we had the charcuterie and two steak frites.  The charcuterie was not the best we have had.  My steak was salty on several bites, and as it was with the charcuterie, it was not worth the price.  So in the end, I came here expecting a lot from a Zakarian restaurant, but The National failed me from the start to the finish.  Never again.",0,0,0,Wayne C.,"Brooklyn, NY",47,77,30

I have become a fan of Geoffrey Zakarian from his appearances on television shows like Iron Chef America and Chopped and had been dying to try one of his restaurants. We were seated right near the staircase. The food was delicious - For appetizers, we shared the charcuterie, the mushroom salad. For entrees, we each had the short rib. For dessert, we shared the sundae. We were stuffed by the end of the evening and were pretty satisfied. The ambience was quite nice, except for annoying, loud drunk girl who was sitting near us.

I think perhaps it's important to note that he isn't actually doing the cooking... ok, on to the review.First, when I had made reservations I had asked for a ""quieter"" or more private part of the restaurant and that was happily accommodated without any fuss, which I appreciated seeing as a lot of places will just tell me ""well, it's loud everywhere.""  We were seated in a comfortable corner and no one was seated next to us until our meal was almost finished. The service was top notch - perhaps a little too over the top (I think 5 separate people came to our table) but it was still appreciated and I'd rather that than bad service any day. I had the grilled branzino with glazed pineapple, shiitake mushrooms, and roasted broccoli... simply delicious. I wanted there to be so much more when I finished it, despite feeling full!  There was a bit of crispy skin left on the fish for me to enjoy and the flavors really complemented each other.

Whatever. I'm here for dinner. Not to hang out with him. I ordered the warm mushroom salad and my husband had grilled octopus. Mine was great. He said his was too. He ordered Bronzino for dinner. It came with a potato medley that he said was just a little under cooked. I'm a vegetarian so I ordered sides: the broccolini and truffled polenta. The broccolini was ok. It got cold pretty fast. The cheese on top stayed in one big clump. Probably should have been left off. The polenta was good. I would have loved to have added the extra truffle, but forgot and our waiter didn't ask. My husband got the Mac and cheese with caramelized onions. It was good. Not amazing but good. The dessert menu looked great. I wish I could have tried something.

4.0,3/17/2013,"Wow. Some folks must have woken up on the wrong side of the bed when they wrote their reviews of The National. First off, I go there quite often after church at St. Bart's on Sundays for brunch, and I go with a picky group of souls. We all have pretty discerning taste buds, and we all love this place. In fact, Jesus told us that he loves it too. Two friends came to town who are so picky at a restaurant that I want to hide under the table, but they raved about this experience. Maybe we're all just deceived, but something seems askew in these reviews. I also love it because the host always makes an effort to seat our group, even when we don't have a reservation on a busy sunday.First off, this is a neighborhood without too many great options. For that reason alone, this restaurant stands out above the rest. Secondly, the atmosphere is classy, very New Yorkish and the perfect Sunday brunch spot. I love taking my out of town guests there. Thirdly, the brunch menu has so many inviting options that we had a hard time choosing. The tea options are quite extensive for tea lovers. We all were learning towards the brunch items until we saw the Ugly Burger and fries. The bun, the burger itself, the fresh vegetables, the homemade mayo, the fancy ketchup, and the incredible fries were off the charts good. My friend had a mushroom omelet and roasted potatoes that she loved.We did experience one tea issue -- not sure that brewing the tea in a large silver pot is the best for steeping and taste, but it looks good -- but our waiter apologized and quickly brought a stronger alternative.

My wife had the ugly burger, as it is called.  It was cooked as she ordered and came with some normal toppings, but nothing special. My wife said the best part of her meal might have been the french fries which were crispy and season well.I had the grilled cheese sandwich. As soon as it was put in front of me I knew I made  a big mistake. First,  you could hardly find the cheese between the sourdough bread. Second, there was nothing on the sandwich except for bread and cheese. It was completely tasteless along with being  a small portion. The local deli where I live  makes a 10 time better grilled cheese then what I was served. The sandwich was also served with  tomato soup which was fine, but  nothing special.

2.0,11/27/2012,"A very disappointing ThanksgivingMy husband and I searched online for a nice place to indulge for a late Thanksgiving dinner during our trip to NYC, and thought this place fit the bill. We made our reservation a week or two before Thanksgiving, and were really looking forward to a special evening. Unfortunately, our experience was marred by several missteps that I believe I can attribute to the restaurant's mismanagement. First, our reservation was for 8:30, but the restaurant did not have space for us until after 9 pm. We opted to wait outside in the cold, because the bar looked quite crowded, and we prefer to have a drink with our meal instead of beforehand. The hostesses told us when we arrived that they were ""running a few minutes late""- in my book, 35 minutes or so exceeds ""a few minutes"". When we were finally seated, our waiter seemed nice, and even expressed apologies for our long wait. We enjoyed our first course of carrot ginger soup, although my husband thought the size was a bit on the small side. He noticed that each of the 4 or 5 other tables around us, where everyone had also ordered the Thanksgiving meal, had a basket of bread given to them not long after they were seated, but we had not been given any bread. I asked the waiter if bread came with the meal, and he said ""It doesn't, but I'll get you some bread."" I ordered the turkey and my husband ordered grilled flank steak for the main course- we both found our entrees to be okay, but not really what we were hoping for. We then ordered our desserts. We observed the couple at the table just next to us order their desserts (the tables were very close together), and then they were given their desserts, and then they finished their desserts, and we had still not been given our desserts. Meanwhile, we noticed our waiter talking with other restaurant staff a few feet away. When he came to clean up the plates on the other side of us, my husband wondered aloud whether or not someone had taken a cab to go find our desserts, and our desserts came soon after that. I also must mention that while we were waiting, we saw our waiter confront a couple two tables away from us for leaving an insufficient tip. We couldn't hear exactly what was said at the beginning, so aren't sure whether or not they left no tip or left only a small tip. We then heard one of the customers from that table telling our waiter that he had been fine, but she was upset that it had taken an hour to seat them. After this, our waiter seemed quite upset, which may have been why he didn't care about our dessert.Speaking of dessert- I ordered the pecan pie, and my husband ordered a sundae (these came with the Thanksgiving meal). I would rate my pie as one of the most underwhelming pecan pies I've had in my lifetime.On a final note, the menu stated that there would be two shared sides- sweet potato puree and brussel sprouts. There was no sweet potato puree- we were given rather ordinary-tasting mashed potatoes. The brussel sprouts were, in fact, quite good.With our drinks and tip, the meal came out to just under $200. This may be peanuts to people in Manhattan, but to those of us who come up once in awhile from DC, it's quite a lot of money. If it hadn't been so pricey, and if we hadn't looked forward to this is as a very special evening, we might not have been so disappointed. By the way, call me stupid, but I insisted on leaving a very nice tip, despite our disappointment. I preferred to give the waiter the benefit of the doubt, and assume that management had made things tough for him- and it certainly wasn't his fault that we were seated late. I also have the strong feeling while in Manhattan that restaurant staff believe those of us who don't wear high heels or lots of makeup will not tip well, and I try to offset these prejudices. I happen to know we tipped much better than the New Yorkers sitting next to us (who got their desserts much earlier than we did).We decided not to make any more reservations at nice restaurants for future Thanksgivings in New York. Next time, we will just find a mom-and-pop restaurant on the corner somewhere that has a $25 prix-fixe menu. I'll bet we'll have a much more enjoyable experience there.",0,0,0,Amy R.,"Washington, DC",33,7,0
3.0,11/22/2012,"I personally like this place, it has a very refined feel. As my friend put it "" somewhat of a french bistro with city chic""For lunch I had the  Roasted Chicken Herbed Barley Risotto, Pearl Onion, Parmesan  for $27. It was really great, the chicken was succulent and I could taste the mild herbs, but really thought the barley risotto was a nice touch. I kid you not I did not need to eat anything else for the rest of the day. Not to say the meal was large, but it was just right to the point when I had my cappuccino to top it off I was completely satiated.Our server was a delight. He was so attentive and friendly. He was patient and even told me to stop talking so I could eat my food before it got cold :-) I heeded his advice and was glad I did so I could really enjoy my wholesome lunch.I could definitely go back here for another Business lunch or even a casual one.",1,1,2,Sheri S.,"Minneapolis, MN",578,580,1880

2.0,11/5/2012,"My hubby and I were bummed because the restaurant we wanted to go to was closed due to Sandy. So, we settled for The National because it was close to where we were, it was Jeffrey Zakarian's place, and we were big fans of Tudor House in Miami, so we figured that The National would live up to the expectations of an Iron Chef, right? Wrong!We got there at about 12:30 p.m. and were told that they were serving  brunch :(  We don't like brunch, but we were hungry and there was nothing else open nearby so we decided to sit at the bar and give it a try. Our bartender/server was overwhelmed...we don't know by what but she just couldn't get it together.   After a long while, we finally got the right menus and it took another while to put in our order for drinks.  We scanned the menus for something not too ""brunch"" and finally decided to share the grilled quail, which was ok but not memorable by any stretch of imagination.  My hubby ordered the ""ugly"" burger which turned out to be the best item we had.  It comes with pickled jalapenos which were not too spicy but gave a nice bite to the burger.  The french fries that came with it were soggy and had nothing on them to make them stand out from store-bought frozen fries. I had the grilled cheese sandwich which was a huge disappointment. I expected cheese oozing out of sourdough bread, but instead I got cheese crostini. The only good item in my plate was the tomato soup which had a very nice smoky flavor.  I ended up dipping my sandwich/crostini in it just like if it was marinara :) Very sad...All in all the food was just blah and the service was lacking.

Although there were plenty of tables to better accommodate 5 people, we were sat at a table the sits four ideally.  I asked and after they looked at the computer screen (like they are launching rockets and work at NASA) they said...oh i am sorry but there is a reservation coming in later that requested that table.  Liar!  They never showed up.  yeah thanks biznitch.  Evidently they canceled because of weather.  LIES!So we sat down and after about 20 minutes thought I should check the back of a milk carton to see if our waiter's picture was on it.  Hello? So I finally had to wave him and tell him we were ready.  We got our order in and sat back for some good conversation.  I thank God that the company was good, otherwise I would have gotten all Carrie on prom night.

Our entrees were ok - good portion size, well cooked but a little lacking in the flavor department. Pretty forgettable actually. At this point I've already decided that I'm probably not coming back here but the fact that we sat there with nothing on our table after our meal was over for nearly 20 minutes without even an acknowledgement from anyone kind of sealed the deal.

4.0,8/12/2012,"After planning to visit for several months, especially after noting that it belongs to Iron Chef Geoffrey Zakarian, we mysteriously received a Blackboard Eats discount with a short life span and could therefore not avoid finally heading over to The National. We've been disappointed by some celebrity chef haunts in the past -- Les Halles (Tony Bourdain's former joint), most specifically -- although we had visited some time after Tony had left, so I 'spose that doesn't count. And Barbuto -- Jonathan ""Obi Wan"" Waxman's Meatpacking District location on Washington Street was infinitely better than our high hopes had expected, so I guess visiting The National was indeed left to the roll of the dice.In a word, wow.We had a great experience. Everything was better than we expected. We started at the bar with a couple of cocktails and enjoyed. The service was excellent and not overly pretentious or snooty (which one might expect given Geoffrey Zakarian's attitude towards some participants on Chopped), the decor was sophisticated without being over the top or snobby, and the food -- the reason why people typically visit restaurants -- was well beyond our expectations.Briefly, we ordered the grilled octopus and the Caesar Salad to start, and the roast chicken and the pork chop for our entrees with sides of the sauteed mushrooms and the fries. Two minor quibbles -- the Caesar Salad, which was excellent, was noticeably overdressed and the romaine was served with its stems intact. To be fair, however, the salad had been grilled -- which to me is a great flavor enhancer for a everyone-has-one Caesar -- so the stems weren't a big deal, and typically a salad can get dried out so the overdressing wasn't a big deal. The octopus was perfectly cooked and the accompaniments -- white beans, peppers, sundried tomatoes -- were delicate and delicious.The entrees -- the roast chicken and the pork chop -- were absolutely amazing. The chicken was served with a barley risotto with chunks of confit chicken interspersed therein -- think the best chicken from the best homemade chicken soup you've ever tasted, and that was just part of the dish's garnish. Unreal. And the pork chop was cooked perfectly and served with non-bitter, vibrant green broccolini. Really memorable and really worthwhile.You might have noticed we made no mention of the fries -- alas, they never made it to the table. And frankly, that's fine by us -- we were so over-stuffed that we brought 1/3 of our dinners with us. While we would have liked to try the fries, we'll do so next time, and our waiter apologized and the bill reflected the non-arrival.So with two minor issues, we received a bill that was discounted fairly significantly. Frankly, when we examined the menu prior to our arrival, we were impressed by the options and wondered if the price tag -- which is significant -- would be worth a return trip (eg without a discount in hand). And the answer is yes -- while pricey, this is a very upscale experience. I wouldn't recommend visiting The National with friends for a Tuesday evening dinner, but for a special event with a significant other or for some higher-end fare with special friends -- if not just one friend -- this is a worthwhile and recommended destination. I wish the prices weren't so prohibitive -- and while I would still choose Balthazar or Keen's for my last meal on Earth -- this was and, I'm sure, will continue to be, on our short list of great restaurants.",2,1,1,Boogie N.,"Manhattan, NY",39,151,10

My friend and I saw all the reviews about the service so we went in with the idea of not being impressed by service, but at least the food was good. Well, the reviews were right.... Service was TERRIBLE. We sat down at our table and there were still crumbs and sweat rings from glasses on the table. We never had our water filled without asking, and another server elbowed me in the back of the head and didn't even apologize. The food was good, but nothing i'd expect after seeing the iron chef at work on television all the time. Obviously I went inthere knowing Geoffrey wouldn't be inthe kitchen, but I'd actually be mortified to put my name on something like that. But I'll focus on the food for now. The starters were really good. I got the frise salad, and my friend had the plantain soup. The soup was overly spivey, but if you cut the spice with a bite of the grapes, the acid evened things out a bit. For the entree, I got the fish and my friend the chicken. The fish was good, and the broth was very nice under it, you could really taste the lobster in it, I just wish there was a few more veggies alongside. My friend had the chicken, and it was a large serving if you go in hungry. The skin cooked on it chicken had incredible flavor too. Dessert was alright. I had the ricotta cheesecake, and my friend had the brown butter cake. I would never order dessert again there if it wasn't for being included in our meal.

We made an online reservation because we have always wanted to try Geoffrey Zakarian's food. When we showed up the atmosphere appeared at first to be kind of ""douchey"", but it was great and comfortable once you sat down and enjoyed. It was restaraunt week, so my wife ordered off of the Restaraunt Week menu, but I did not. Let me start with drinks. The Jalapeno Margarita was so good I had to have two, don't be afraid, its not over poweringly spice, it has just enough spice to make it different and memorable, and the smoked sea salt on the glass added a great element. As an appetizer my wife had the asparagus and mozzarella salad which was pretty good, and I had the Meatballs, which were amazing! such a wild combination of flavors from spice to a little citrus i dont know, but something about it was just great! Next for the main courses, my wife I had the chicken which was perfectly cooked and the barley rissoto which was very delicious. I had the pork chop with the broccolini and the cheese grits. The pork chop and broccolini were absolutely fabulous, and holy cow the cheese grits were out of this world! Next for dessert I had the Prailene Sundae which was great and delicious, and it was topped with a perfectly melted and charred marshmallow that was great.

1.0,7/13/2012,"I liked the decor inside the restaurant and layout of the bar. Food was pretty good; had the 'ugly' burger which was very tasty. The reason I rated this restaurant so low is because I've never experienced ruder hostess' in all my dining experience. From whining to each other over which one had to take us to our table, to slapping each other on the butts while we were trying to check in (haha), to screaming at us in front of other patrons because our bread basket was in the ""wrong spot,"" it was a pretty crazy experience...

They clearly spent a LOT of money on decorating and stocking this place.Food was rather expensive for what I got, I think. Not portion wise -- they were actually a bit big. One caveat -- I only had one dish - the summer vegetable risotto appetizer. It was a very large dish, considering.Food was fine, I guess. I found it odd though that the okra was pickled. It gave the dish a briny, bitter taste -- not in an unpleasant way, but unexpected. I'd rather have had okra cooked/seared/roasted (anything but pickled).

4.0,7/2/2012,"In town for a personal matter with my wife, staying at the Benjamin, and so tried The National for dinner. I think we ordered well because the food was excellent. The menu does change, but if it helps anybody coming in the near term, I'll tell you that we ordered the risotto with fresh vegetables as an appetizer with fresh corn, baby okra and other delicious ingredients including a hint of anise and an acidic (lemony) balance. It was perhaps the best risotto dish I have ever had. With that, we shared the muscle dish that was equally as good with an incredible subtle coconut sauce with sweet onions-the two together were superb. For the entre, we both had the Grilled Branzino; I loved it. The fish we perfectly cooked with a delicious grilled flavor on both sides, skin and meat. There was a fresh sweet sweet corn sauce that counterbalanced the smokey grilled flavor and at the end there was a tiny pickled something (not sure what), that was the cherry on top. I noticed that some of the items we ordered were on the online menu, but the ingredients changed, most likely because these were the freshest available today (for instance two of our dishes (risotto and Branzino had the fresh sweet corn kernels, and the risotto had fresh baby okra).My only complaint was that our waiter was not too experienced. We asked about one of the ingredients named on the main menu and he did not know what it was and so I sent him back to the kitchen to ask. I asked him for help with wine pairing and it was clear he did not know the wine menu; luckily another guy jumped in (perhaps the manager on duty), to help us figure out a red wine that worked well with our seafood selection. He also forgot to tell us about the daily menu addition that is in a holder on the table that we did not notice until well after our order was placed.  But frankly I'll take great food over great service any day. Yes I'm a Zakarian fan BUT I was skeptical about this place going in and was pleasantly surprised.  So thumbs-up.PS Loved the flowerless chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream desert also-had a caramel sauce and delicious toasted cashews for texture-really good.",0,0,0,Alan R.,"Los Altos, CA",7,13,2

It's just average. But my expectations were a lot higher when I walked in, so I left slightly disappointed simply because my meal was very forgettable. We waited about 10 minutes for the waiter to come over and when he did, he was super nervous or jittery. My boyfriend ordered an iced coffee, but was brought an iced tea. Minor thing, but given that the restaurant was pretty empty, one would assume the waiter could pay a little more attention to his customers. I got poached eggs - not over cooked, but just a tad bland. The one plus was the ""ketchup"" they serve. It's more like tomato sauce, and went well with the seasoned home fries.

The waiter was inattentive and missinforming. He would be missing for 20-30 minutes at a time, he told us that the orange juice was fresh squeezed.... yet it tasted pasteurized. The hanger steak in the steak in eggs dish was super tough, and at medium-rare was a bit on the purple side.In ""Chopped"" Chef Zakarian stresses on honesty, ingenuity, and execution in delivering results.

I had such high hopes to be blown away with my meal here, but left vaguely disappointed.Me and my colleagues came here after work for a deserved dinner out and were suitably impressed by the classy interior and upscale vibe of the place. The menu was simple and inviting, with octopus featured prominently under ""small plates"". I love octopus. Alas, this one came with chorizo, so I went with the mussels instead and a side of asparagus. The broth was lovely - rich and flavorful with the potential for being sopped up indefinitely by a good piece of bread. Unfortunately, the piece of bread served with the mussels was slathered with this salty orange thing (for lack of a better word) that was completely at odds with the delicate flavors of the broth. I think a simple piece of toasted baguette would have gone a long way here. The asparagus was...interesting. I thought ""asparagus? cheddar cheese? win!"" - but the cheese congealed quickly and became grainy and combined with the oil/butter that was already on the asparagus to make an otherwise light vegetable a little too heavy.  My colleagues also mentioned that their Ugly Burgers were a tad on the salty side, but deemed the french fries and the homemade ketchup a win.Our server was a little scattered, but when we had him to ourselves he was nothing but knowledgeable and pleasant.

Both cocktails were really good and we could barely taste the alcohol.This place has a casual atmosphere with checkered tiles on the ground and no table clothes.

Are. You. Kidding. Me? I'm about to upload the picture I took of the servers chatting amongst themselves while we sat there waiting for them to come take our order. My dad paid 27 dollars for a plate of pasta and a few measily shrimps - that would have been massively better if made at home (or at any other restaurant). My ""falafel"" sandwich was actually good, but it wasn't falafel - it was an undercooked veggie burger, and definitely wasn't browned like falafel should be. I asked for no bread but the server insisted I get bread because the sandwich is grilled in a panini type way - so I got the bread and ended up with a mushy veggie burger. It tasted good, so I can't really complain, but at 15 dollars, it was a total scam. Falafel indeed. I also ordered a Moscow mule (""National"" mule), and just saying, they made it very very sweet, which I found sort of gross.

The dinner menu selection was somewhat limited, but the meals we ordered were ok, but not impressive. The waiter was not very attentive, even though the restaurant was not extremely busy.The reason why I am giving this restaurant a poor rating is because of the bill. We gave the waiter a little more than 15% tip, but when we received an alert from our credit card later than evening, we were surprised that the pending charge included a 20% tip. I called the manager to inquire why they had submitted an unauthorized extra 5% tip. He advised that this is a new process with the credit card. Specifically, the credit card automatically adds the 20% tip until the actual charge is submitted. I didn't buy it and asked my credit card. The credit card advised they did not tack on the 20% tip on a temporary basis.In fact, we went to another NYC restaurant the next night and used the same credit card. The credit card alert we received that same evening showed the pre-gratuity bill amount (without the automatic 20% tip the National manager indicated is a new process). The correct amount with the authorized tip was later billed to my account.I've been to many restaurants before and never seen this happen. So, I ask that the National restaurant management review their process and submit gratuity amounts as they are given by their customers, not what they believe is due to them.If you go to this restaurant in the future, make sure you check your credit bill to make sure the amount charged is what you had authorized.",0,0,0,V Y.,"Phoenixville, PA",13,26,1

The place wasn't as packed as it would later be yet the noise level was uncomfortable. It would actually get worse.Our server wasn't very helpful when we asked for his recommendations. I dont want to hear ""everything is great"" when i ask "" what are your favorites"". We ultimately made our choices and ordered a bottle of wine. Our server came back to tell us they were out of that wine.I had the tuna crudo appetizer and it was fabulous. Beautifully fresh yellowtail was served with thin slices of grilled pineapple and jalapeno. Light, fresh and flavourful. My partner had the steak tartare and it was delightful. A nice rustic presentation with a raw quail egg yolk, along with the fairly big pieces of the meat gave this a great texture. Excellent!Our mains is where we found a contrast of how good and how average it could get. My partner got one the specials that day, which was a striped sea bass served with a lobster broth, grilled ramps and eggplant. The fish skin was soggy to the point of being inedible. The eggplant was mushy, the broth had no discernible lobster taste and there was only one flaccid ramp. A bad dish. Worse, when we complained about it, there was not so much as an apology or even the least bit of empathy. Disappointing.I however had the Ugly Burger and i was very glad i did. Best burger I've ever had! The meat was perfectly cooked to medium, as i had ordered it. The bun was crispy and buttery, the pickles were obviously house-made and had a nice kick to them, the bacon was smokey and the whole thing was much more than the sum of its parts. A cornet of hand cut fries, perfectly seasoned and sprinkled with smoked paprika, were so good i couldn't stop eating them. It was a large portion!

I had the ""Ugly Burger"" with pickled jalepenos and Ntl sauce.  While the jalapeños and sauce were flavorful, the burger patty itself was similar to one you'd get at any local diner for 1/3 of the price.  Two of our guests ordered a salmon special that was drowning in sauce - neither was overly thrilled with the salmon.  The fourth person ordered the omelet special, but, didn't want one of the ingredients.  The waiter explained that she would be charged for a ""make your own"" omelet.  REALLY?

3.0,3/19/2012,"Again, I found myself at this restaurant twice. Three stars is the average; 2 for dinner and 4 for breakfast. The national is beautifully decorated, but cramped and has a stunning bar. The overall feel was warm and cozy. We were seated in the corner of a booth seat that runs in an L-shape serving many tables. We were pretty well wedged into our seats and left awkwardly huddling around our table. The bright side to this is we could actually hear each other sitting side by side. The service was slow and not in the least friendly. It took an unreasonable amount of time to order, and even longer to get the check. Neither of us was terribly hungry, so we split small plates of chicken noodle soup, parsnip risotto, scallops and fries. The soup and scallops were ok, nothing to write home about. The risotto was cooked to perfection and the flavors of pear, parmesean and chive combined into a savory happiness with each bite. Every one of the fries were crisp and perfectly seasoned with paprika. Served with a small bottle of ketchup that wasn't necessary as the spice provided plenty of flavor. The National is a nice place, with good food, but nothing mind blowing; definitely not enough to overshadow the lacking of service, uncomfortable seating and loudness.  Luckily breakfast was a different tale.Despite the aforementioned experience, the fact pork belly benedict was on the menu left me feeling compelled to come back in.Arrived around 9:30am a couple of days later and the atmosphere felt completely different. There was a calm and pleasantness among the staff and diners. I sat down and started with coffee which comes in a small pot for a very reasonable $4. Of course ordered there benedict and a side of potatoes. Was started with a plate of various fresh fruits which was a nice surprise since I'd been eating primarily starch and meats the past few days. The rest came out and the benedict was PERFECT. The pork belly was crisp and savory; the eggs poached better than any egg I have had and the bearnaise was tasty when soaked up into the muffin. A MUST HAVE. The potatoes were rather disappointing, very bland and rather mushy. Service in the morning was friendly and prompt, especially in comparison to my dinner experience the night before.

The ""ugly"" burger is one of the best; the brussels sprout and smoked paprika fries are delicious; the steak frites is very perfectly seasoned and the parsnip risotto starter is the best I have ever tasted (hint--get the risotto...you will love it).  I also have to give a shout out to the cheesecake dessert which was served with grapefruit sorbet and pistachio...a surprisingly enjoyable combo which left a great taste in my mouth.  Added to the great food are a beautiful space and good service which = a solid go-to restaurant.",0,0,0,Madison B.,"New York, NY",3,126,56

Unfortunately that's where the good experience ended. The food, all of it was a bit salty and the ""Berkshire pork"" promised on the restaurant's version of eggs Benedict was fatty and not at all good. The ""cheddar grits"" was a watery, strained mess the consistency of tapioca pudding, not the kind of grits this Southern transplant was hoping to try.While the food was less than impressive, it's the service here which is beyond awful. After reading other reviews here I realize we would have been wise to consult Yelp prior to our visit. The waiter seemed aloof, uninterested and uncaring, forgetting things like spoons and having us ask not once, but multiple times for the most basic of things such as utensils and sugar for our coffees. He completely forgot two meal items we asked for, something I normally look over in a terribly busy place, but this early afternoon at The National was hardly bustling with customers.

It looked like a delightful spot, and so I happily sat down to entertain our guests. Just in case you're wondering about those muffins and why I'm mentioning them, it's because they obviously were intended to be served as a small amuse bouche while you wait and wait for whatever it is you are waiting for (everything!).But in fact ours came halfway through our breakfast, by our rushed waiter, who occasionally and briefly made an appearance. The breakfast food was serviceable. My bagel and nova plate was fairly standard, with 2 tiny slices of tomato. I ordered Iced tea, which seemed to throw my waiter for a loop, but when it did eventually appear, it was quite good.  The Huevos, rancheros, I'm told, was spicy but acceptable.

We were greeted by the hostess, who had on a previous occasion been incredibly rude to us. That evening we did not eat there, but after speaking with a manager about her attitude we decided to give the National another chance. We were seated at a spacious table which was a plus. We started by ordering a bottle of chardonnay and a dozen oysters. It took us awhile to decide on our entrees since we were so caught up in conversation. We had to keep telling our server to go away and that we'd let her know when we were ready to order again. We each decided to order the roasted chicken, but I changed my order before she walked away to the skate(or maybe the branzino, I think it was a special they were having that day all I remember is that it was some sort of fish and it was bad). Our waitress repeated the order back to us correctly and I watched her walk straight over the the system and enter the order. The oysters were delicious and fresh. The mignonette was the perfect compliment. Then came our entrees......two roast chicken entrees when she repeated my fish entree back to me. How the hell do you get my order wrong when you repeated it back to me less than 30 seconds before entering it into the system? So I had to sit there and wait for the food I ordered to come out. When it finally came out 20 minutes later, I was not pleased with the taste. It was an overly salted inedible mess. WTF Geoffery Zakarian? Granted this meal was prior to your winning Iron Chef  I still expected a lot out of your restaurant. I was very disappointed. I barely touched my entree it was just so bad. On top of that our server was barely present after taking our entree order. She didn't even come to check on us after I got my food. We had to flag her down to get the check and then again to pay.Overall bad experience, bad service, bad entree.

We were eating breakfast that day at The National about 9:30 am.  First off the hostess had a nasty attitude right off the bat. Again usually doesn't affect me as living in Chicago waiting for a table or poor service sometimes happens but I was with my Mother In Law who does not like to wait excessive amounts of time for table/service or like to be treated like garbage.  We entered the dinning room which was not busy at all. We were told it would take 10min. 15 minutes go by & everyone who walked I'm after us got seated. Again I usually don't care but my mother in law was becoming increasingly irritated especially since we had a limited amount of time left in NYC. I go up to the hostess and asked kindly how much longer the wait would be and she put her hand up  and told me in a nasty tone  to ""just hang on we'll see.""I go back to the bar wait 5 more minutes & the hostess comes over to seat the people next to us who arrived 15 minutes after us. Well by this point my mother in law gets upset and tells the hostess that we have been waiting a while and everyone after us has been seated. The hostess then speaks to my mother in law in a snotty condescending tone to ""calm down, this is out of control and no need to get upset I guess I will seat you."" Now my mother in law was not being foul or vulgar so I found it rude for the hostess to act to bitchy to her! We sit down and wait 15 more minutes for coffee.

There was no LOVE in this food or kitchen. I think if chef Zakarian was a patron at his restaurant he would be horrified at both the experience he was providing for the demanding price tag.

They also got their drinks quickly. Then it went downhill.The other three of us arrived and waited about ten minutes for someone to come by and take our drink order. When I asked for refills for people at our table, the waiter got a bit flustered--especially when I went *crazy* and asked for more water for the table as well.Another fifteen minutes later and our drinks aren't there. I have to flag him down to ask him to take our app order. He does.Five minutes later our drinks arrive. Still waiting on that water.Another twenty minutes later our apps arrive. Haven't seen our server since, so I have to flag him down. I ask for two bottles of wine.The wine comes pretty quickly thank God, but we need more water and bread and no one seems interested in helping us. Mind you--he hasn't taken our main dish order yet.I walk up to him and say ""listen, I know your tip is included since we're a big party. but if you're not feeling this just get us another waiter."" He is extremely apologetic but not much changes. I know he's busy with other tables, but that's really not our problem.So an hour later we get our food. Everyone seems happy with their dishes but my cod was really dull and slightly overcooked. The brussel sprouts were very nice, and their fries have this great smoky flavor. We ask for more sprouts. They never come.I think our waiter gets how annoyed I am, so he promises that if I order dessert, it will come out speedily. It does, and it's pretty tasty.At the end of the night, the hostess misplaces a very expensive umbrella and one of my clients is definitely unhappy.

It was so wrong, it was almost inedible. I have never been to a restaurant, especially an upscale one like this, where it was hard getting the food down. It was a strange dichotomy of being way too acidic yet flat in flavor at the same time. My entree was the salmon. I found the serving size to be quite small. I don't know if that usually is the case, or if this is particular to the RW menu. The side was a mixture of vegetables: corn, yellow bell peppers, and snow peas. I think fresh cilantro was used to top the vegetables, but I found the seasonings to be . . . off. Actually, I think that is my chief compliant for the food here.

Perhaps if I could find my waiter or when I did, if I didn't feel like I was interrupting his conversation with the other bored waiters, I would have sent it back. However, I am a sucker for truffle, so the dish gets kudos for that. The Bloody Mary was tasty, but had so much ice we were done with it after a few sips.

The dessert was so blah and the gelato so icy, we left most of it over.",2,0,0,Rebecca E.,"Manhattan, NY",100,64,1
3.0,4/9/2011,"Rating: 3.5 starsReview is for Brunch only.  The space is great for a casual brunch/dinner.  It's a good spot to bring the family.  Not too loud and plenty of space.  The service is attentive - no complaints.We started with complimentary mini muffins, which were moist and yummy.  My gf had a bloody mary and said that it's probably one of the best, if not the best, she's had in NY (and she loves her bloody marys).  For food, I had to try the french toast and I have to admit I was disappointed.  It was made with the right bread, brioche, but was not dipped in the batter long enough.  So it pretty much tasted like fried bread.  On the menu it says it was accompanied with fruit and I think there were four slices of apples.  My gf enjoyed her spinach and goat cheese omlette, with roasted potatoes on the side.  She really liked hers.  Another friend had the smoked salmon bagel.  I think the bagel was from Essabagel (my fav bagel place in the city).  He said it was good.  The last person ordered the split pea soup which came in this stainless steel pot, which was cool, but the the portion was quite small.  The taste was good though.  He also ordered eggs sunny side up.  Nothing special.In general, I liked the feel of the place and wouldn't mind trying this place for dinner.  I just didn't have anything to rave about, hence the 3.5 stars.  I will say it's a good option for the neighborhood though, b/c there aren't that many great ones.",0,0,1,Michelle H.,"New York, NY",191,497,6
4.0,3/29/2011,"A classy place, ideal for foodies with corporate accts and blue-blood Europeans on holiday.  The decor is a hipper than most in mid-town, the place is loud, the service is good but not overwhelming.  The bread came with warm butter, always a good sign.  Bronzino with sunchokes and salsify was excellent, the pear and parsnip soup delicious and balanced.  All goes well with a Sixpoint.  Good for entertaining your parents and treating your midtown worker drone beloved.",0,0,0,Matthew Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,15,0

5.0,2/27/2011,"Had a fantastic meal and experience at this restaurant! We were immediately seated and the waiter asked for our drink order. While it took awhile to get our drinks, it was nice not to be rushed in and out of the restaurant for a change. The server let us take our time ordering and enjoying the food. While the menu initially looked like typical steak, chicken, veggie type of food, a careful read through showed that each dish was prepared in a unique manner or paired with an unusual side. For instance, we had crispy pork as an appetizer and were pleasantly surprised at the flavor combination of jalapeno and green apple mustard. Something I have not seen other places, but definitely worth trying.The wait staff was extremely friendly and attentive. As a first time visitor to the restaurant, our waiter was more than willing to give suggestions that turned out to be delicious.The only bad thing I could say is it was not the quietest place. It was a fun atmosphere and loud with all the tables being close together, but the food and service made up for the loudness. A superb restaurant all around. Would definitely like to go back!",0,0,0,Lauren T.,"Washington, DC",0,26,1
2.0,2/17/2011,"The apps were good but the entrées were not. The pork chop and lamb were not flavorful and disappointing. The service was also not very good.  We were not eating our entrées due to not enjoying them, and no one noticed, or came to ask how things were.  Our water was not even refilled.  I had to go to the matree D to ask for the check we waited so long.The apps  we had were pretty good.  I had the octopus and my friend had the muscles.  He did not finish them since it was such a large portion and he wanted to save space for the main course.  He regretted not finishing them.The waiter finally came over and noticed we didnt really touch our food and they tried making it up with free dessert, but I feel like by that time it was too late.  I will not be heading back here, unless things get changed.",2,0,0,Ted S.,"Norwalk, CT",15,54,56
3.0,2/2/2011,"Last night me and my date A went to the National for dinner and it was the first time for both of us. First of all I have to give lots of creds to the host that as soon as I stepped in, looking a bit lost because my date was waiting for me somewhere in there, came up to me and asked how he could help me. When I said my date was already there he offered to check my coat and then escorted me to my date, who was waiting in the bar. That to me is great service! The decor is very nice, feels like a mix of upscale and casual, and ambient lighting which makes it cozy. Anyway, we were promptly seated at a cute corner table, again props for putting a couple on a date in a corner so you can sit closer to each other :) and our waitress was very attentive and patient with us...we had some catching up to do so we had a hard time to get to the ordering. Now the food: For appetizers we had, and shared, the Scottish Salmon Takaki and the Citrus Salad. They were, lets say ok, not bad, but not as good as they looked. For entrees my date had the days special and I had the Hake, a white fish with a hazelnut crust. The fish was really good but the veggie stuff on the side was again bland and didn't compliment the fish. Overall an OK experience! (They deserve 3.5 stars) Will I go back? Probably not, unless I happen to be in the area.",2,0,0,Sofia J.,"New York, NY",172,24,2
3.0,2/1/2011,"I am absolutely in love with the decor and ambiance of the place!!! It's sophisticated but still has the feel of someone's home in the woods. The entrance to the hotel were well hidden. The bar well spaced from the dining area. I've been here for both breakfast and dinner service a few weeks ago. The yogurt at breakfast was some of the best Greek yogurt I've ever had, thick enough create a sculpture. The granola was perfectly sweet too. However all the breakfast entrees I tried (pork belly, steak, biscuits & gravy) were overwhelmingly salty and heavy. Dinner was also very generous in portion size. I had the lamb, and hard time finishing it. All the sides were also way too salty. I highly recommend the baby beet salad! The combination of pistachios, citrus, beets frisee and quinoa was definitely very quirky and worked very well together! Also had the National Mule, their signature cocktail. Very simple, and the ginger packs a great punch. Service was a little slow both times, and at dinner, the waitress knew nothing about the drinks menu. Overall I can't see myself coming back here for a meal, maybe for a drink if I get thirsty in that neighborhood.",0,0,0,Em D.,"New York, NY",255,37,15

1.0,1/13/2011,"Rule #1:  When you accept a reservation from a customer, HONOR it.Rule #2:  When you don't honor your reservations, you get negatively YELPED.Rule #3, see Rules 1 and 2.Sometimes you feel like a dining room and sometimes you feel like the bar.  Last night, I wanted to share a quiet dinner catching up with an old friend in NYC, so I made an 8:30 Open Table reservation at the National, the great restaurant in the Lobby of the Benjamin Hotel at 51st and Lexington.  It wasn't a ""date"", but for all the maitre'd knew, it could have been.When we arrived on time for our reservation, the maitre'd showed us to a table in the lively bar.  Clearly, the vibe of the boisterous and lively bar was quite the opposite of the subdued dining room. I stated my preference for the dining room and  inquired if we could be seated in the dining room.   The response was that there was no room available in the dining room.  Not, ""let me see what I can do"" or ""if you'd like to have a drink in the bar, I'll get you a table as soon as possible.""  There did not appear to be guests waiting for tables in the dining room nor was the bar or restaurant overly packed on this Wednesday evening at 8:30 p.m.  I didn't want to look like a douche bag in front of my friend (and complain), so I took the table the maitre'd showed us in the bar and we had a lovely evening shouting to one another over our fabulous (seriously!) small plates.My friends in the Maitre'd business in fine NYC restaurants:  Where I come from, a reservation is for a table in the DINING ROOM.  If you are going to take reservations and limit your guests to tables in the bar, WARN THEM IN ADVANCE.  If it wasn't for me being so f*ckin' good natured, it would have ruined my whole G*d D*mned evening!Food:             *****Ambience:    *****Maitre'd IQ:   *UPDATE:After posting a similar, but toned down version of this review on Open Table and following up with a very nice e-mail to the National, both requesting a call-back from management, guess what?  No response!",2,3,0,Bruce F.,"El Paso, TX",408,406,3
4.0,12/18/2010,"I really enjoy a good Hotel restaurant.Something so ""escapist"" about it, even if you're not staying at the hotel.This spot is inside the Benjamin Hotel at 51st and Lexington.The bar is almost like an old time French Bistro.  It has a silver hammered bar surface, and white wooden wains-coating slats on the underside of the bar, with hooks to hang your winter time ""stuff"".I didn't hang at the bar, but it looked full all night, with a decent mix of after work professionals, and a smattering of hotel guests. The bartender dons a white apron.The main lounge area is more of traditional style extension of the hotel lobby.  With small square tables surrounded by 4 comfortable chairs.Off of the main bar is a more cozy and darkly lit area, that has the easy ability to serve your small group of 10 to 12 people.I was tucked away in a corner with candlelight, dark wood floors and tables, encircled in glass just outside the kitchen, which wasn't a problem.The appetizer I enjoyed was the ribs.  This arrived in a large bowl with about 7 or 8 large size BBQ ribs.  Very meaty, and the meat basically fell off the bone.   I've had better, but this was very good.  Almost a meal in itself.Main course was skate, with capers, which was very tender, but a little salty for my tastes.  Beautiful presentation, in a crescent moon fillet shape.For dessert, the pumpkin cake with a nice lump of gelato topped off a really nice evening.Service was good and prompt, and very helpful.This is a nice option, for after work, or if you're shopping over on 5th avenue.and you remember that you can bounce over here as an option.Other items here that looked or sounded good are their burgers, made with 3 different types of ground meat, served on an onion roll.

1.0,12/17/2010,"Today was my second lunch at The National.  The food was good.  The service was horrible... borderline embarrassing actually.This is my first restaurant review... and probably my last.  But I was so frustrated with the experience I felt I needed to save future diners.We waited at the bar 20 minutes before our table was ready, no big deal.  But when we realized the bartender had no intention of asking us if we wanted anything to drink we decided to get his attention so we could order a bloody mary to begin our ladies lunch.  He basically said, 'I don't have time for you.  I'll get to you when I can'... which was almost 10 minutes later.It took the waiter 10 minutes to come to our table after we were seated.No bread was ever brought to the table.They delivered my soup to the table but neglected a spoon... so I stared at my soup for a good five minutes before I could eat it.We had to ask for both our appetizer plates and entree plates to be cleared.A side dish was forgotten.Water was not refilled.At the end of the meal I finally got our waiter's attention to ask for a coffee and the check... he didn't even stop.  He just cruised by, smiled and said, 'Coming right up.'  My guest shouted, ""I'll have a coffee too!'  ""Okay, two coffees,"" he shouted back (mind you, there were only about 5 tables left...) DECAF!  He then realized the ridiculousness of the situation and returned to the table so we could complete our order.I take clients to lunch weekly and good restaurants are few and far between in that area of town.  Sadly, I will not be returning.  Because while the food is not very good at Bryant Park Grill... the service is.  You need to hire a new manager, National!  Some one who has an attention to detail.",1,0,0,Kristen B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0
