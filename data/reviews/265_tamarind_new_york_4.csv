5.0,4/30/2019,"Great 4 course fine Indian cuisine lunch for $27 in a beautiful spacious and relaxed setting!  No reservations needed for lunch with plenty of room to host a large party. Service is attentive but cooking times are longer, so make this a lunch to linger and have conversation over.  The tandoori cooked Lamb and Chicken were the best, and the coconut dessert was perfect.",1,0,1,Anne R.,"New York, NY",845,460,5492
1.0,4/29/2019,This was the worst dining experience I've had in over a decade of living in New York. First of all the waiter took 20 mins to take my drink order and bring me a menu. Waiting for my food took longer. I was dining alone and asked several times if someone was joining me. My meal was mediocre at best.  I debated saying something but it wasn't worth it as I just decided not to go again. After falling asleep I have now been up half the night with food poisoning. All in all an awful experience.,0,0,0,Emily S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0
5.0,4/22/2019,"Tamarind is known to be one of the best Indian restaurants in nyc. I enjoyed everything we had ordered. I want to begin by saying the service is tamarind is remarkable. Our waitress was ready at our request. Any time we finished a drink she asked if we would like another. I did not like my mango cosmo- and when I told my waitress she quickly changed it to something else with a smile. We started with the malai chicken and the prawn special. We then got he chili crab, chicken tikka, and the lamb chops with the mushroom and truffle naan and garlic naan. Truly enjoyed everything about this restaurant. Highly recommended!!",0,0,0,Anjali B.,"Little Neck, NY",164,27,18
1.0,4/8/2019,I had high hopes given the review history. I had a group over 10 people  on a slow Tuesday night. When I got there they immediately pushed the prix fixe at 125 per head when they had multiple below and one above. I did not book this to be treated as another plate dinner. We went a a la carte which confused them. We had a few delicious apps but spotty orders on drinks. No idea what neat or single cube on what at 20 dollar drinks meant. Sorry I paid over 1500 eventually for 10 and felt like I could have gotten takeout went to a top notch cocktail bar and came out way ahead on food and drink without the cost. It was half empty and not worth it. I would pay gladly for glorious food and service but that was not it.

3.0,4/6/2019,"Our dinner here was very average as far as the food went. The restaurant was much larger than I expected and our server was super friendly. My cousin, my fiancée, and myself decided to order 5 entrees for sharing. We also had prawns and scallops to start. The scallops were by far the best thing we tried. Wonderfully cooked and a bit spicy. The shrimp were extremely overcooked and tough to enjoy.My lamb ghosht was mostly eggplant with two large pieces of stiff lamb. I can't really say I enjoyed this dish as it was hard to cut into. The sauce was decent. My fiancées halibut curry was pretty good but it could have used more sauce and been less cooked. My cousin's lobster masala looked intense and she also said it was super overcooked.Overall, we had a good time but there's definitely better Indian in NYC for a smaller price point.",0,0,0,Amrisa B.,"Hollis, NY",350,161,197

Everything we ordered was great! Some things that stood out include the crab appetizer. I never eat crab because I find that it can be fishy, but this was smooth and had a Smokey flavor almost. The scallops were also wonderful, and huge! For my main I got one of the shrimp dishes, which was served in a coconut with coconut sauce and mustard seeds. It was incredible, my brother agreed it was the best dish. Highly recommend this place if you want a nice dinner with different food.",1,0,0,Sarita L.,"New York, NY",7,118,110
2.0,3/29/2019,"One extra star for the ambiance. Besides that this restaurant really doesn't have anything going for it. The food is mediocre. Service was okay. Be careful with getting the pre-fix menu because they will service you one dish for all the people there. We ended up paying $1300 for 8 people which is so bazaar. So not worth it. They nickle and dime you for every little thing.If you're looking for a good experience in this price range, there are so many better alternatives such as Junoon and Rahi.

3.0,3/25/2019,"Came here on a Monday night for dinner. I was immediately impressed with the spacious interior, cleanliness, and friendliness and attentiveness of the staff. Service and everything was really great, but I just don't think the food was anything special, and I definitely think it's overpriced for what it is. None of the entrees come with rice or naan, you must purchase that separately. The portions are actually quite generous and I think an entree can easily be shared between two people! The garlic naan was also delicious. The best thing I had was a complimentary puff pastry type thing with cheese and peppers, it was divine! I tried two of the vegetarian entrees and they were just ok.",0,0,1,Leyla K.,"Elizabeth, NJ",190,96,114
3.0,3/24/2019,"I have a feeling that Tamarind has seen better days. It used to have a Michelin star but hasn't for some years now, and this is evident in the quality of the food.Chicken tikka masala - We wanted to try Tamarind's well-regarded version of this classic dish. The sauce was better than many I've had. With rich, piquant flavors, it was spicier than many other versions. The chicken was a little tough, though, which was disappointing. Malai Halibut - Who wouldn't want to try the winner of the 2004 fish dish awards? I thought that sounded promising. The delicate sauce of ginger, coconut, mace, and cardamom was delightful, but the dish was very lightly sauced and it needed more because the flavors were so subtle to begin with. The fish also seemed a bit overcooked. Not quite worth the $38.We both agreed that we had eaten better Indian food in New York at a more reasonable cost. Try Seva in Astoria or a number of places in Curry Hill: Pippali, Tiffin Wallah, Spice Symphony.The garlic naan was savory and at once pillowy and crispy. 2.5 stars rounded up, because the sauces did taste good and the atmosphere was nice.",3,1,1,Laura O.,"Manhattan, NY",341,548,34
5.0,3/21/2019,Favorite indian place to eat in the city. Great quality of the appetizers and the lunch items. Very hospitable and professional service.

2.0,3/3/2019,"Beautiful decor. Service was on point. But I wasn't particularly wowed by the food. I'd give it a star more if it was a ""mid level"" restaurant but I believe it still has its Michelin Star and neither the creativity nor the taste really proved that. I had the ground nizami keens which was dry, to the point that you feel that it's stuck in your throat. My entree was the murgh lajawab. It tasted like any other regular chicken curry except to their credit, it was less creamy and heavy. I finished with a mango cheesecake and I just wish I hadn't. It wasn't airy. They likely used a lot of mango purée because there was a strong scent of mango but not so much of a natural flavor.",0,0,0,Reviewer R.,"Mineola, NY",2,73,12

4.0,2/3/2019,"I went here for the Restaurant Week lunch special with my husband and overall was a great experience. I found the food to be good but not amazing. It's a 3 course meal: Appetizer, Main (which comes as a single plate of 2 entrees, tomato rice, naan, and the vegetable curry of the day), Dessert. Cheese pakora with chutney: this was a free starter which I personally didn't have because I'm allergic to chickpeas (which they knew ahead of time and accidentally served it to me anyways and didn't apologize about it ). My husband had both pieces and he said it was amazing.Tropical Salad: this was a super light and fresh salad with mangoes. Great way to start the meal.Tandoori Broccoli: you get one large piece of broccoli layered on top of a red gravy. Both elements had great flavor and was well seasoned. you can definitely tell this was a tandoori dish. Kadai Paneer: I LOVE paneer to the point where it's not an official Indian meal without it for me. I was really excited about it but I found it to be lacking salt and had tons of large pieces of ginger that I would bite into. It was ok but definitely have had better versions of this dish at other restaurants) Potato Squash Curry was the vegetable curry of the day: this was a disappointment. It's clearly made in large quantities in the beginning of the day and served with everyone's meal so it definitely lacked attention. It was under-seasoned, lacked salt, and the potatoes had no flavor whatsoever because the pieces were so big that none of the curry spices actually got into it. Tomato Rice: great accompaniment Naan: super fresh and authentic. Probably my favorite part because it's hard to do a good naan without burning it.Gulkand Cheese Cake: the dessert was just the right portion. It was creamy and indulgent. I'm personally just not a fan of rose essence in food but I could appreciate that it was a well-made dessert.Service: our waitress was great and attentive. Only complaint is that they called us ahead of timeto check on allergies (chickpea) and told them again once we were seated and they still served me the starter which was coated in chickpea flour :/",2,0,0,Forumb P.,"Sacramento, CA",167,6,10
5.0,1/31/2019,"My two friends and I went there for my birthday dinner. The ambiance was magnificent and the service was spectacular. We were greeted immediately and taken to our table. Our waitress was friendly and informative. We got two bottles of wine throughout the night. Our waitress told us the special. She was on point with telling exactly what the dish contains. We ended up choosing the prawns. We also got raj kachori. Wafer filled with chickpeas yogurt and tamirand and mint chutney. We also got samosas to start. All three appetizers were delicious. My favorite was the prawns. I ordered the lamb curry with mint Lacha parantha. The bread reminded me of the taste i use to have in India. It was absolutely delicious. The curry was spicy but not too much. The flavors were all in there mixed with the tender lamb. For desert, I ordered gajar halwa with ice cream. It was my favorite because it was not too sweet!  Throughout our dinner the servers were on top of filling the water when it was empty.  Picking up crumbs from the table as well. All in all a great experience. It is a bit on the pricy side, but worth it for a special event. Will be coming back.",1,0,0,Ishita V.,"New York, NY",240,40,79

4.0,1/28/2019,"Our experience at Tamarind was really nice, but more because of the ambiance and the service and less because of the food itself. While everything was prepared well, the dishes did not manage to blow me away. Between the two of us we got-Shredded Kekda(crab) appetizer- slightly ketchup-y and tangy, the crab was cooked well. The dish overall was a 2.5/5Tandoori chicken breast stuffed with spinach and cheese appetizer- chicken had a really good flavor, so did the filling. 3.5/5Kadai Paneer and Tandoori Broccoli as vegetarian mains- both were flavored really well, especially the brocolli. Kadai Paneer- 3/5, Broccoli dish- 4/5Chicken and Lamb cured in spices as non vegetarian mains- both these meats were just above average. Nothing to write home about. Chicken- 2.5/5, lamb- 2.5/5We ordered the Kalonji Nan with our mains which was a delight and truly the main event of our afternoon.Not sure if we ll be back since there are many new Indian restaurants opening up that are pushing the envelope way further than the older more classic Indian restaurants in Manhattan.",3,1,2,Amrita A.,"New York, NY",189,234,771
2.0,1/27/2019,"I visited this restaurant for restaurant week. We were greeted with a very warm welcome by the staff and seated at a table with pretty settings. Everything went down hill from there. The staff that served my table seemed aloof and didn't even introduce themselves to us or ask us about dietary restrictions/allergies. The dishes of the day were not described, simply named. They moved plates around without telling us what was happening, presented food without describing what it was. We could tell the plates were supposed to be plated in a visually pleasing way, but many were coming out of the kitchen quite messy. I had the Halwa dessert which is supposed to be elevated by an apricot cream that it was served with. My apricot drizzle was actually solidified on to my plate so I could not even try it. The appetizer of the mango salad was overly sweet and missing an acidic balance. The food was otherwise tasty, but nothing special beyond normal North Indian cuisine. As a final kicker, we learned that asking for normal water was bottled Voss imported from Norway rather than tap water that every other restaurant I've ever been to defaults to.

The dishes were on the small side but there was a little bit of everything to try.

5.0,1/25/2019,"I have been a paying customer of Tamarind since discovering its original location near Madison Park and now the Tribeca home.  Tamarind is in my own opinion (as a British fan of Indian cuisine) one of the best restaurants for Indian cuisine in New York City and stands out from the pack at 'Curry Hill' near midtown.To address the ""why ?"" Question, as a paying guest I find the following differentiates Tamarind;- The restaurant is scrupulously clean and modern in design.  tasteful and not overbearing.- The service is good.  The owner, with a lifetime of experience in restaurants in the City knows how to train staff and set the expectations.- The food and drink is extremely consistent and whilst the menu adapts the quality is ever present.Favorites include the Tamarind Magherita, The Chilli Crab starter (spicy) and Chicken Vindaloo.  In fact, I can feel my taste buds now as I am writing this brief review.  I feel a little guilty having been so many times and not having sat down to write a review.Probably my only grouse is that Tamarind's only location is down town...",6,0,1,Jeffrey B.,"Manhattan, NY",6,105,368
4.0,1/21/2019,Came today for the start of restaurant week.  The place is beautiful.  We were seated in a both that was a little enclosed so it was nice because we felt we could talk away from the crowd.  Service is great.  Honestly it made the difference between 3 and 4 stars.  I'd say food is 3 but service and decor bump it up to 4.  Our server was Vinny.  He was super nice and attentive.  I believe it was the owner that stopped by and checked on us as well.  Seemed like he was super attentive and cared about customer service.  Now onto the food.  I started with the soup of the day which was a tomato based soup.  The flavor was good but it was too spicy for me.  I have to say the spice level was my biggest issue today.  I'm a mild spice kinda girl.  I should have asked so it may be on me but I'd say the spice level was more a medium on everything I ate.  For main course I had paneer and broccoli.  It was good but again too spicy for me to really enjoy fully.  Dessert I didn't like it was some apricot helva I think it was called.  Super weird texture and taste didn't make up for it.  I'm not sure if I'd return but I think it's a nice place with great service and food is good for someone who likes spice.,3,0,2,Sandy J.,"Westwood, NJ",193,186,185
4.0,1/7/2019,"This restaurant offers a refined level of service - in my NYC South Asian experience matched only by midtown's Amma. This includes the hosts, servers and the owner/manager, all of whom were gracious.We came for an executive lunch - $27.00 for two courses and a small sweet. I started with the nicely spiced lamb patties, which were the best thing I would be offered. My companions  plumped for the garlic shrimp - three to the plate, and the salad.The glass of Hugel Riesling was excellent and I was offered a taste before the decent pour.For a main course, I had the fish (Hyderbadi Machli) and the Nizami Gosht (stewed lamb). The former was a good size portion of fresh salmon, but the lamb portion was on the small side and I did not think of it as any better than a buffet lamb korma or rogan josh. The herbed nan was excellent. I believe the vegetable was a stewed squash - quite tasty.Dessert - the semolina halwa, comprised a small wheat cake, which I enjoyed but my companions eschewed.I finished with a masala chai - served up in a nice pewter teapot.I enjoyed the experience, but can't say the food was definitively better than that offered at a top notch buffet like Bukhara Grill.

Located in Tribeca, it's also a nice non-touristy spot near several of NY's best bars (for before or after). If you are a tourist and have never been to Tribeca, you should... it's a lovely neighborhood with narrow brick streets offering a different perspective on Manhattan.This was the second time in the past few years begun our New Year's Celebration with dinner at Tamarind. We started the night with a pair of Samosas, one with ground lamb meat, the other with chicken. Both were extremely tasty, of the two the lamb was off the charts. For my main dish, I had the Chicken Korma which was so delicious I can still taste it.  My mother-in-law had a spicy shrimp dish that she loved (and she is one picky diner with discriminating taste).

Not anything egregious, but we had to wait over 15min and ask twice to get tea for dessert. We were also seated for 5-10min before being given menus.The food itself is similar, good but not great. The best dish we had was the spinach patty appetizer (hara bhara kabab). It had paneer inside and the sauce it came with was very flavorful. We also tried the raj kachori which was a crunchy wonton like exterior filled with chana masala. It was good, but nothing special. We thought it was weird that it was served cold.The entrees were the toplina paneer and nargisi kofta. The paneer was tasty, but each of the three different preparations tasted similar. The kofta tasted overwhelming of cardamom and was extremely rich. We ordered the spinach garlic rice and mushroom truffle naan to accompany the entrees. The naan was excellent, but I get annoyed by having to order rice separately.Overall the meal was enjoyable, but for the prices and experience, I would recommend baar baar instead.

For entree we all got something different to try out. I got the Red pepper and yam soup... so good!!!! We got the Chana pindi, also a favorite and the Punjabi mutton omg to die for!!! Plus the goat is halal here, so we had too lol. The shrimp entrees were ok. We also go the seafood platter, ate the whole thing. The daal was ok, tasted too much like butter to me. The desserts tho. Omg each one we got was over the top in presentation and taste. The pistachio kulfi is a must!!! The gulag jamoon came with a mint ice cream, yummy. The Black Forest cake was their most popular since they had only 1 left. And the dark raspberry mouse cake was the perfect birthday cake. Service had to be on point here for the $$$$ point, and it was!!!! Best service . [one thing that bothered me was the server/owner whoever it was was bringing out more food or doubles or food items to fit for he table.... which did add up. Just a heads up] The bill yea... just make sure you have about a grand on the side for a dinner like this. So good, so expensive, and so tasty.",0,0,0,Sufora S.,"New York, NY",6,77,60

The service is always impeccable, the food is delicious and a solid value for what you get. It's an excellent place to take friends visiting the city.

2.0,11/5/2018,I have been coming to tamarind for years and it's been one of favorites for great upscale Indian. I had my grad school lunch at the east side one way back in 2002. Went recently and was disappointed. Service was terrible. Told waiter multiple times that not to put cilantro in food. Apps came with cilantro and I reminded him again. I thought he would bring out new ones without but no. Entrees came out again with cilantro and this time he did prepare new ones but still.

They offer an executive lunch menu as well as the regular dinner menu which is extensive and has something for every taste. The food was outstanding from the chicken to the lamb and the breads, each dish was perfectly seasoned and the meat was cooked perfectly. As an example, the Masaledar Chop, Lamb chops marinated in nutmeg, cinnamaon & Indian herbs was unbelievable-perfectly charred on the grill. For dessert, we both had the rice pudding. It was served warm with crushed pistachios and was one of the best we've ever had! Tamarind is the perfect restaurant for anyone who has not tried authentic Indian cuisine.

2.0,10/25/2018,"I'm really sad because I truly wanted to enjoy this restaurant, but simply didn't. There are plenty of up and coming, trendy Indian restaurants opening up in the city and my family and I decided on this one because it had a more traditional menu. However, for the price point the food was at, I found their food to be below average. We're huge carnivores so to start we ordered their tandoori shrimp (jhinga e Aatish), lamb chops (masaledar chop) and chicken (murgh angarey half) to start. Also we ordered the fried cauliflower they had on their seasonal menu. Tandoori items were extremely charred and almost burnt which caused all flavor to be gone in the meat. We were really disappointed. We also ordered the fried cauliflower which we pleasantly did enjoy.For dinner, we ordered the lobster masala and dal makhni. Absolutely hated the lobster masala, had somewhat of a sweet makhni sauce which didn't pair well with the lobster at all. Also, the lobster was over cooked that caused it to have a tacky, extremely hard to chew bite to it. Hated this dish. Dal makhni was tasty.Being an Desi in NYC, I would say I have fairly high expectations when it comes to Indian food, as should be. This place did not deliver at all and was a complete waste of money. Sadly will not be returning. Much better options in NYC for Indian food!",11,3,2,Roshni C.,"New York, NY",405,58,92

It wasn't dark which I liked a lot since it makes it so much easier to take photographs.Drinks were strong and well made, well worth the $15. This place is not cheap so don't go in looking for a bargain. Our server was extremely nice and very attentive. He took photos, charged phones, made recommendations, answered questions and waited patiently while we indecisively ordered off the menu. The real great part for me though was the food. I'm half Indian and half Pakistani, and this city is full of mediocre desi food. I didn't go in to this place expecting a lot but I was simply wowed. First of all the menu is written so well in beautiful proper urdu. Reading through it is like taking a trip back home, and they feature dishes from all over the Indian subcontinent. The appetizers were sublime - the shaami kabab were beautifully made, so was the spicy crab, and malai chicken. The curries were phenomenal. I ordered the Kashmiri gosht and it was absolutely divine. The sauce was decadent and the lamb pieces were so beautifully tender. Other people in my party ordered grilled items. I especially loved the lamb chops and the milagu curry.

While we were still working on our food and drinks servers and waiters kept walking upto us asking us if we are done. 5 different times they walked upto us and the last time was really rudely. Instead of accepting the fact that they could train their people well, when we complained to the manager the response we got was you can cut it off from waiter's tip. That was not a good response.

1.0,10/19/2018,"This is my first review ever on yelp. Tamarind has been a restaurant that has been a favoured spot but the last experience has scarred me for life. I know I will never go back. I was having a very pleasant dinner with my husband and a close friend. We had finished our meal and were ready to pay the cheque when a man on the table next to us interrupted us out of the blue, complained about how loud we were in the rudest way possible and claimed we were on cocaine. I was shocked; initially I thought it was a joke but soon it was apparent that it was anything but. The guy went back as though he did nothing and disrupted our evening significantly. For context, the restaurant was loud, it was a Friday night with multiple large groups dining and we were just three of us. Management swooped in to ensure we did not make a scene without making any effort to talk to the other party. When my husband went to ask for an explanation, the guy threatened punch him and when I tried to engage, I was called a wh**re. It's difficult at this point to not conclude - Racism - ironically, the owner, Mr. Walia was keen to land the blame squarely on us much to our dismay. Half an hour later, with the police involved, we did not make any progress. Apparently no crime had been committed. We got no apology and the owner of the restaurant was disgruntled with us! We also paid the cheque and paid the wait staff as they were not involved in the incident Overall, it was a downright infuriating and humiliating experience. In my ten years outside India, I have never felt this discriminated against.

We were almost done with our meal when a guy from the next table comes over and starts shouting at us. He told us that we were very loud and told me to shut the eff up. He also called my wife a wh**e and accused us of being on cocaine. We were obviously taken back and retaliated verbally. The girls called the wait staff for assistance while the guy was telling me that he would punch me in the face. I lost it at that point and told him to shut the eff up and sit down. The owner, Mr walia comes and reprimands me. He tells me that I shouldn't escalate things and I should just take it like a gentleman. Racists. The guy shouting was white and I'm Indian. He just took the white person's side and accused me of making a joke out of a fine dining room. The police arrived as my wife and my friend were scared as he threatened us verbally with physical abuse. Mr walia decided to give us a free drink after we paid $180 entirely for our food. He told me to forget about this as he was providing us with some wine.We still ended up tipping the wait staff as they are awesome drank our free wine as we deserved it and will never step back into this establishment again!

3.0,10/19/2018,"I had been to Tamarind's original Flatiron location years ago, thinking that it had been above average, but not the best Indian food I had experienced.  However, I had never been to the sprawling and elegant Tribeca version, but had heard very positive things and decided to give it a shot.  Upon our arrival, we made a pit stop at the bar, when my companion ordered some kind of cocktail that was the brick red color of Robitussin and did not taste much better than the dreaded cough syrup.  We were escorted to our table in the corner of the second floor balcony, providing us with an expansive view of the space.  We decided to start our meal with Vegetable Samosas, which were heavily fried and stuffed with potatoes and green peas.  The crispy dumplings were fine, but the dough was a bit chewy and made me think that they had previously been frozen.  The filling was also pretty mild and bland.  Thankfully, the meal improved from there with our robust entrees.  My Tenakay Murgh included large chunks of boneless chicken breast that were lean and tender.  The meat had been marinated with roasted coconut, madras spices, and ginger for a sweet and zesty flavoring.  The Lamb Vindaloo included succulent meat in a thick and spicy sauce.  Both meat dishes were so impactful that it was nice to have a side of Steamed Basmati Rice and some bread to help sop up every drop of sauce, though we had to order each of these on top of our meal - not even the rice was included.  When it came to Naan, we splurged and ordered three varieties.  The poultry in the Chicken Tikka one was rather dry, but the tangy Garlic and sweet Dried Fruit and Nut versions were phenomenal.Overall, Tamarind provided a classy and upscale Indian experience, but the food could have been better executed, given the higher price point.  I would give it a 3.5-star rating.",8,2,4,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

While everything on the menu is absolutely delicious, the lamb dishes, naan, and desserts are unmatched. We ordered the Bataki Kosha (duck pastry), Samosas, and Dahl Aloo Poori (chutneys) for appetizers. For entrees, we got the Malai Halibut, Murgh Kolhapuri Chicken, Kashmiri Gosht, Steamed Basmati Rice, Pudina Paratha, Truffle Naan, and Rosemary Naan. For dessert, we bought the dessert sampler and herbal chai (the Gulab Jamun being my favorite dish from the Sampler). Finally, we all bought the lychee martini.Everything was prepared to near-perfection, with the exception of the chicken which was not as spicy as we had hoped. However, the chicken was still delicious and savory. In addition, the lamb was tender and flavored beautifully, while some of the chutneys tasted as if they were imported from restaurants in Delhi or Dhaka.I would pin the Kashmiri Gosht, Truffle Nan, Duck Pastry Appetizer, Gulab Jamun dessert, and the Lychee Martini as must-haves for dinner. Everything else was delicious, but could be substituted with other dishes from the menu. In addition, the service was great as our waiter was attentive and helpful. However, he seemed a bit too eager to push dishes onto our table. The ambiance is noisy and bustling, but the restaurant is gorgeously decorated. It feels like many high-end restaurants in India.

4.0,9/29/2018,"After a disastrous experience at Junoon the day before, my family made an emergency reservation at Tamarind to restore our faith in upscale Indian in New York. Tamarind is a reliable place to get good Indian food, period. It may not be one of my favorite restaurants, but when in need of a nice curry in a nice environment, Tamarind fits the bill. The Good: - Overall great food. All the curries we had were quite tasty; robust in flavor, spice and temperature (I now have nightmares of cold curry after my Indian experience the night before....). Some of my favorite chana masala in the city... yum!- Service has always been excellent. The first time we visited we had a wonderful waitress who was so knowledgable and friendly. This time was no exception, with an equally as cheery and helpful waiter. The Bad:- The ambiance is nice, but could use a ""freshening up."" A bit pre-2008 fancy, if you catch my drift. It also feels far too big. Love sitting downstairs in the booths, but sadly this visit had to sit upstairs which wasn't as great. - The water server was laughably rude. It's ok, other servers made up for it. Overall, I wouldn't regularly visit Tamarind, but I think in comparison with other similarly priced options in the city for Indian food, it's really good. It does have fierce competition from Indian Accent, but to me they're different enough to be considered separately from one another; if you want a solid curry with classic Indian flavors in a nice environment, this is the place.

SCALLOPS APPETIZER: Wow, OK.  I've never had scallops at an Indian restaurant before and that all changes NOW.  Spicy (by my standards) pan seared scallops in a sauce with fresh veggies chopped on top.  It was spicier than I personally thought it would be, but I was very pleased with this.DRINKS: Not so pleased with this; I got a very, very sweet margarita-like drink.  Definitely could have passed here / should've stuck to wine.HALIBUT: Saw on the menu that this was the ""Grand Prize Winner of the 2004 USA Fish Dish Awards"".  Quite frankly, I have no idea what that means, but I think the USA Fish Dish Awards people have the right idea here.  Halibut in a ginger + coconut sauce served with asparagus.  Pre-portioned out.  CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA: It's not 100% fair because I've never met a chicken tikka masala that I didn't like, but this one was very multi-dimensional and had several enjoyable layers of spice.  At $27, this is one of the pricier Chicken Tikka Masalas I've ordered, but certainly enjoyed this.Also ordered some naan and a decaf coffee at the end - both fine.All in all, I would certainly go back to Tamarind.  The one thing that I would warn is that those with more sensitive-to-spice palates should be careful here.  While what we ordered was by no means outrageously spicy, everything had a 'kick' to it.  Delightful for me, though!",4,1,2,Jenn P.,"Manhattan, NY",285,134,933

Entree I got lamb and bitter gourd - sauces were good very spicy. Lamb was not as good as the skewers. Rice was good with very interesting spices. I did love the nang but they were quite little pieces and there was a charge if you want more. Desserts were disappointing... we got custard and fruit ice cream. Super sweet but lacked thickness. Also taste quite artificial. I would have given three stars but I lower a star down because my stomach was burning for the whole afternoon and night after the lunch.

The staff are quiet and focused on achieving a serene dining experience.  The space between the seating is enough to carry a discreet conversation without anyone listening in. The place was almost empty when i arrived at 6pm. When i left, the was not an empty seat in the house. If you like or love Indian cuisine,  and being in lower Manhattan and price is no object, Tamarind is great place to dine. The menu and the diversity of flavors plus a nice list of wine, including undervalued Australian wines, just proves what you can achieve with attention to detail.  Hiren (hope i spelled his name right), was our server and he knows how to direct and please his customers. He has such a smooth demeanor and it would be a pleasure to have him as a server again. He does good for the restaurant,  in fact he asked to return soon to try more items on the menu.  He asked very nicely and very smoothly. I will certainly consider. I most certainly will refer some people to done here for sure! We ordered a bottle of Two Hands, Sexy beasts from South Australia.  Wow, what a smooth drinker. So many Australian wines most people neglect. Look into it.  We had garlic naan, spicy crab (quite nice), Murgh Malai Kabab (grilled chicken in a superb marinate), Tenakay Murgh and Lobster Masala and finally ended with Gulab Jamun (milk pastries in honey).

4.0,8/13/2018,I loved Tamarind. The food here is very authentic. Their Thikhe Kebab and their lamb kebabs. Their vegetarian platter was also excellent. The good news is that Tamarind is Indian food as you would expect it with authentically Indian flavors and spice levels. Everything here is exactly as one would have expected at a high end restaurant in India and it showcases great Indian food.  The restaurant has a great ambiance and great service. My only quibble is that it's a trifle overpriced for the food.,0,0,0,Autish D.,"Vienna, VA",0,26,1

5.0,3/17/2018,"Delicious food from a former Michelin star-holder! Tamarind May have lost their star in 2015, but it's still got some tasty options available in a classy environment. We had the kolambi pola to start, which is sautéed prawns in a delicious coconut curry served with a crispy chickpea patty. The shrimp was cooked well and the sauce was delicious!For entrees, we shared the topli na paneer (paneer tikka marinated 3 ways), murgh kolhapuri (spicy chicken in a tomato-based curry), and the tandoori salmon special. The paneer was soooo good! The chicken kolhapuri was cooked perfectly and was medium-spicy. Every now and then a whole peppercorn would be in the spoonful, so that gave it a kick. The real star of the meal was the tandoori salmon! If this is available when you visit, you should definitely get it. It's a roasty, moist cut of salmon, served over a bed of grilled peppers, onions, and cabbage and drizzled with tamarind and yogurt sauces. So. Good.Lemon rice and garlic naan were good, as were the cocktails and dessert. We had rasmalai, cardamom creme brûlée, and the coconut mousse bombe. The creme brûlée was our fave of the 3, but the rasmalai was a close second!Book on Open Table and you'll get bill updates as you order, then you can use Apple Pay at the end and never have to swipe a card!

2.0,2/25/2018,"My boyfriend and I were really excited to try this place. It was his birthday, and he *loves* Indian food. We ordered drinks first. He got the spicy margarita (Tikhi?) which was good but too sweet for me, so I got some wine. We were treated to some complimentary pastries to start, and we agreed that the sauce was delicious. We ordered a daily special appetizer--lightly-battered cauliflower in some kind of sauce--that was amazing, and made us extra excited for our entrees. After a lot of hand-wringing over entrees (I didn't want to get anything too traditional), he got Murgh Kolhapuri and I got the Majjiga Pulusu. I took one bite of mine and knew I'd send it back. It was spicy, but that was its only flavor--otherwise, it was bland. He said his was underwhelming as well (""the only flavor is spice""), but he kept it. I got the Bhagarey Baigan for round 2, which was okay but not great. The garlic naan was good, but I can get garlic naan anywhere. We haven't been in the city long, and we were excited to eat at a place that was so highly-reviewed. We left wondering what all the fuss was about, especially given the bill. We're both handy in the kitchen, and he's made Indian dishes at home that we liked better (though granted, it's a time-consuming venture). It's possible that we just ordered the wrong things, but I don't think we'll be back. I have to say that the ambiance was very nice, and our server was friendly.

4.0,2/22/2018,"Came for Restaurant Week in winter 2018 and had a great lunch experience. Between us, three friends and I tried:+ kekra chaat (lump crab meat)+ rajasthani sooley (grilled lamb skewer)+ tropical salad + gosht kali mirch (boneless lamb)+ kathal murgh (tandoori chicken)+ tandoori broccoli+ potato/vegetable side+ naan+ chicken tikka masala+ poori+ gulkand cheesecakeThe apps were great - I'm not usually a crab meat lover but it was delicious. The boneless lamb, tandoori chicken and chicken tikka masala dishes were my favorite mains. I did think the tikka masala was a bit overpriced (at the regular menu price, it was $27, and didn't come with anything) but it was by far the best entree. The breads were fantastic and the cheesecake was surprisingly good. I thought the prix fixe was a good value. That being said: this rating is strictly for the food, as the service was kind of terrible. Our meal, which took place on a weekend when the restaurant was half-empty and thereforenot at all busy, ended up being almost three hours long because we rarely saw our waiter.

5.0,2/7/2018,"My friend Rochelle and I love to take advantage of Restaurant Week. Every year we try different places. I love Indian food thus today's pick was Tamarind. Tamarind is located in the heart of TriBeCa.When you enter the beautiful restaurant you really feel how special this place really is and given the slushy rainy day it is; Tamarind really is a delight to spend a long lunch hour in.The Restaurant Week menu was very generous: choice of one appetizer and two entrees and dessert.I ordered a margarita on the rocks to start with which really hits the spot on a cold rainy day.I ordered Kekra Chaat which consists of lump crabmeat, ginger, chilies, lemon juice, mustard seeds and curry leaves. My friend ordered the Tropical Salad; mescaline, dried berry, mango, strawberry, ricotta cheese surrounded by honey lemon dressing.For my main entree I ate the Kathal Murgh which is Tandoori Chicken in yogurt with jackfruit, ginger and mint almond chutney with a side of Tandoori Broccoli. The chicken was delicious cooked witha multitude of spices. The broccoli was marinated in sour cream, chilies, garlic, garam masala in a river of a delicious tangy tomato sauce.My friend ordered the Meen Calwah which is the halibut cooked with okra and coriander and had the the roasted lamb cooked with tomatoes, garlic and peppercorns.We also shared the Dum Aloo Goni: cauliflowers and potatoes simmered in a  tomato sauce. Think of the sauce that sesame chicken is basted in: OMG!We were also served  Kalonji Naan, tomato rice and a vegetable to accompany our meal. The Naan was delicious, it came with a tomato/ potato purée.For dessert we had a choice of Gulkand Cheesecake sweet and served with rose petals. I had Apricot Halwa:carmelized apricots, raisins, cashews and saffron. My friend had the cheesecake.The portions are not overwhelming but are filling.Note: we ordered from the Restaurant Week Menu. The drinks and cauliflower were additional.The restaurant's decor is elegant but not fussy: clean, glossy wooden floors with plentiful seating near the window which has a great view of Hudson Street and cozy booths to get lost in for 2 hours like we did.Tamarind is a treasure and serves delicious Indian Cuisine.

2.0,2/7/2018,"Not the greatest Indian restaurant in NYC by far.   That is a joke.   Called in a delivery order.  Asked if they delivered to our address and was told yes.      Ordered  2 orders of the same chicken in curry sauce which was just OK.     Also ordered MURGH LAZEEZ  which was disgusting and inedible.     Two balls of some kind of mush, ground up chicken the menu says but it was impossible to tell what was in the mush balls.     Two other dishes were an eggplant dish which  was the only decent dish and nam bread which was plain and very similar to what they sell in the supermarket.   Charged extra for plain steamed rice and when I asked how many people one portion served she said one.  So I ordered three.   One portion was enough for all and now I have such a ridiculous amount of rice that  will mostly go in the trash.    Total came to about $135.00.     Insult to injury was the delivery guy added $16 to the total (on top of the $135)  for his taxi fare. In all of my years I have never had a NYC restaurant delivery guy deliver via taxi.  We order food from their neighborhood (Tribeca) all of the time without any delivery fee at all.      I refused to pay for the taxi and called the manager who tried to convince me to pay it.  I refused and ultimately he took the taxi charges off the bill.       If they were going to do something so unusual and unforeseeable as that they should have told me when I asked if they delivered to my address.  Give two stars one for the eggplant and one for finally removing the unfair charges.",0,0,0,elaine e.,"New York, NY",0,14,0

We had made reservations so we got a table as soon as we walked in. Our coats were taken right away by very sweet hostess. We started off with the tandoori paneer which was amazing! I think this was the highlight of the whole meal. Murghi angare- nicely marinated , every bite was very juicy and full of flavors and spices. For main course We got Chana masala, which had the perfect flavors very well cooked. The  paneer lababdar was average. I didn't find it very appetizing. We also ordered the veg thali which comes with papad, daal, and different other curries. We liked the daal from the thali. Other curries were kind of hit and miss. Chicken tikka masala was good but again not too great. For the drinks I got mango cosmo- very smooth and nice in flavor but not too strong. I would totally give extra points for the decor. Huge space, very nicely decorated, very classy. Our server wasn't that great though. It looked like he was very laidback and not too interested in doing what he was doing.

5.0,2/1/2018,"the comforts of indian cooking elevated by an upscale dining ambiance & experience in TriBeCa. from entrance to entree to exit, you will dine finely on complex flavors honed over 1000s of years from South Asia...add to that modern influence from the posh neighborhood it inhabits...and you have Tamarind.the space is what fine dining is all about. two stories of modern design--clean to the eye views are uninhibited but guided by details acknowledging the posh modern space. daytime dining allows for floods of sunlight to soak the dining area by the windows while evening brings a calming elegance to the space. the interior dining areas and bar do not disappoint as you do get what you pay for....AND this restaurant is huge without feeling cavernous....still a fair amount of ""intimacy"" without being shoved too close together.the cocktails are well-made and work well for biz drinks, a ""nice"" date night, introducing out-of-towners to a TriBeCa experience, etc. however for me, booze tends to subtract from indian food as opposed to be additive. and i also tend to prefer to eat my calories not drink them at restaurants such as this. i will note the wine list here is well-balanced and i normally order just one glass to nurse throughout a meal...which won't upend the flavors of the meal. that said, the bar is luxe in my book...& grabbing a signature cocktail here is not for budget hunters, but well worth the experience for splurges.the food? excellent. well-prepared. plated for maximum eyefuls. the smells/scents tend of the foods tend to be fairly muted compared to ""mom's kitchen"" for anyone who grew up South Asian or had access to foods from the Indian subcontinent via a friend. the visuals and taste unify to tie the meal experience together as Tamarind's menu guides you and yours through Indian cuisine. recommendations: aloo tikkiya (app); chili crab (app); hara bhara kebabs (app).bypass the soups & salads to maximize belly space!murgh angarey (main)--get the full size to share. yogurt/spice coated chicken oven cooked. sirkah ghosht--eat this lamb dish! tandoor mixed grill platter (main) is amazing, though it's not as much food as you'd think. the curries and the seafood dishes that are anchored by prawns are all great. in terms of spiciness-- the dishes throughout the menu have a decent amount of heat, nothing crazy and perfect for newcomers to Indian cuisine. as always, check in with your server about spice levels. and regardless, order raita.curries to me are a very personal thing if you grew up on them or toured through them via restaurants in NYC or across the globe. i'd say the curries here are well-executed, and tasty. however the  emotional connectivity to the ""comfort aspect"" of curry is not there...and that's mostly bc that ""nostalgia"" is an experiential element of having grown up on it: the trappings of it being served in a more relaxed way as opposed to an upscale way. however in terms of quality, the curry at Tamarind is fine. again, the scents feel subdued re: curries. do order roti or naan here--carboholics!desserts? order anything with the word ""cardamom"" in it. service? attentive. informative. proper. the way fine-dining should be. the gents here work hard to make sure your meal doesn't skip a beat. treat them well (translation: tip them well). the crowd? mostly well-heeled except for me. lots of ""suits"" post work & business casual. on more primetime nights, it will be a mix of out of towners, folks celebrating special occasions, and datenighters. i would recommend reservations even though the restaurant has a large capacity as folks tend to linger.drops mic cuz this joint will have naan of thati outzzz",25,17,21,Ruwan J.,"New York, NY",458,773,32909

One doesn't mind waiting at bar.We got the seating upstairs overlooking the bar area which was nice. As for food, being vegetarian, we didn't have any issues as there were plenty of options. Cocktails were rich, Appetizers were truly appealing, particularly kabab- uniquely tasty-. All main dinner options were good in taste and portions.But the best thing about the place that remains with one well after the evening is their truly exceptional service. From the head waiter checking frequently to busboys changing cutlery every few mins to owner visiting you personally.

Tamarind is the kind of restaurant one might visit for a special occasion or to eat special, high quality food (including en pointe service). This upscale Indian restaurant in Tribeca met every expectation and then some.This is what is known as white tablecloth (prices reflect it) food and service.We ordered everything from appetizers to dessert (including their signature cocktails). I remember devouring the delicious Gulab Jamon dessert (one of my favorite Indian desserts).Keep in mind that Tamarind serves meat in addition to many vegetarian friendly dishes.Spices can also be adjusted.Since I didn't do the ordering and I visited during the summer, I can only emphasize how wonderful my experience was at Tamarind.I would definitely recommend and return.",3,1,2,Johanna B.,"Brooklyn, NY",468,560,1574

The whole ordeal was taken care of in less than 3 minutes ... and it was A LOT of lassi. The food though (only ordered vegetarian options) was just okay. The menu can be a bit overwhelming as it's HUGE. And I expected more flavor for Indian cuisine. I did really like the cheese and broccoli naan tho. And definitely don't leave without getting the gulab jamun (super soft, warm with just the right amount of honey sweetness - served with a dollop of vanilla ice cream)... but the okra we ordered was nothing crazy spectacular (just tasted like a lot of ginger with okra). We also ordered the Aloo Tikkiyas and Bhel Poori but neither were very good.

3.0,7/18/2017,"Came back here for a third time and had a less positive experience than previous:The waiters seemed generally confused throughout the meal. They took so long with the food menus that we had to ask, and then they brought us one menu for a party of 5, and took several minutes to bring along additional ones. We ordered and received food without problem (though it's always super awkward when the waitstaff insist on serving one piece of each dish to each person at the table). The lobster masala was good, as was the chicken tiki masala. The shrimp (I forget the name - it was in a green sauce) was good but a bit too spicy for my liking. The best was the breaded and fried fried duck appetizer we ordered. We tried a few basmati rice dishes as well (included one with chicken) which I found mediocre at best; they were unevenly cooked. The garlic naan was yummy though! We asked the waiter to wrap up the leftovers, and after a while he and another waiter began clearing plates. It ended up being the second waiter who cleared the main dishes, and we had to remind him that we wanted leftovers. If we hadn't, I'd have bet that extra food ended up in the trash. Also, weirdly, he wrapped up the leftover sauce from the lobster dish for us (we finished the lobster), which was nice but seemed rather odd.Finally, when it came time for the bill (which we had to ask for a few times) we finally were told that the machine was broken and they couldn't process a credit card or give us a check. The waiter asked for a credit card, email address, and tip amount - and waited watching over us as we wrote out the email and the amount of tip (in percentages because we didn't even know what the total was!) on a piece of paper. Presumably he took down the credit card number to charge later on. Awkward to say the least. While I'm certainly sympathetic to technology failures, it made no sense to me why they couldn't have written out even a non-itemized total bill before demanding a credit card so we at least knew how much was being charged once the machine was up again and could calculate tip based on that. The whole experience was rather bizarre.",1,0,0,Laura B.,"New York, NY",160,56,22

We arrived 10 mins late but the restaurant was accommodating and set us up right away. While I did request a second level seating we were placed on the ground floor....busy night so I understand. Our table on the other hand was a bit loopy so I asked the manager to handle, which he advised a waitstaff who totally forgot. That being said the manger did come back and asked if the issue was fixed and upon me saying no he quickly scolded the staff. Reminded me of India and how the lower class of treated by the upper....it's a shame. Appreciate the follow-up which put me in the right mood again. The waiter Godfrey provided us ample time to sit relax and review the menu. We ordered papri chat which frankly I have had so much better at the local veg restaurant surrounding the tri-state.

3.0,7/8/2017,"Overpriced, mediocre Indian food - at least when it comes to the more traditional dishes. The meal was off to a bad start with our waiter taking close to ten minutes after we were seated to take our drink order. To make matters worse, the complementary papad that was brought out was stale - it was clearly fried hours before and unceremoniously dumped on our table with the usual assortment of chutneys. Unacceptable. Cocktails were decent, if forgettable - hence my inability to recall exactly what my fiancée and I drank. Probably the standout of the night's meal was our appetizer, the chili crab. Succulent chunks of well-spiced lump crab meat were neatly presented in a compressed, bowl shape. For entrees, I ordered the Punjabi Mutton and garlic naan, while my fiancée opted for the Sufiyani Machli. The menu description for the mutton boasts that it is ""baby goat"" but what I was served was far from that. The fibrous, chewy meat led me to believe that this was an old goat and/or it was way overcooked. As an aside, it's a shame that it's exceedingly difficult to find tender goat meat in the US, which is why I'll probably avoid ordering mutton dishes at restaurants and stick to good 'ol home cooked goat curry.Anyway, back on track...the Sufiyani Machli - sea bass cooked in a tandoor - was significantly better. The fish was very soft and it had a somewhat creamy texture, probably due to marination in yogurt in the style of most tandoori meats. It was not overly spiced as to allow the natural flavor of the fish to shine through.For dessert, we ordered the cardamom creme brûlée. I wasn't amazed, but the cardamom did add an interesting spice profile to balance out the creaminess of the custard.I'm a bit confused to the high ratings. Perhaps I would have fared better if I stuck to the non-traditional dishes, but as an Indian-American who thoroughly enjoys his desi food, when I'm paying this much ($200+ for 2 people with drinks), I simply expect much more.I can't wait to try Indian Accent, as I'm hoping the high expectations that I had before walking into Tamarind will be met there.",0,0,0,Jay R.,"Marlboro Township, NJ",1,4,0

However, as any good parent should do if she was to cry we would immediately take her outside so as not to disturb other diners. We dined at Tamarind less than two months ago-with our infant and they allowed us to do so. I called this evening to make a reservation and they asked if any of the party were children and I said yes. They informed me they don't take kids under 6, which makes no sense because that age of child is not well behaved in restaurants either! Legally you cannot tell someone they can't bring their child into the restaurant. Unbelievably rude and disrespectful to loyal customers who have spent so much money in your establishment.

Nothing was overly saturated in oils and spices. You get subtle hints of different flavors that compliment every other flavor in the dish.

I get subtlety, but this was more like the chef was scared to bring the flavors out... all the right ingredients were there... none in the right amount (including in some cases, salt!)The tandoor items were all over cooked or under- seasoned, or both... the Kulcha was dry... closer to a papad than a kulcha. The spinach and ginger rice looked like it was scooped out of a cooker and had been sitting there for a while. The saag paneer was hard and crusty... the only saving grace of the main course was a delectable chicken korma...All in all, quality felt more like an average weekend buffet than fine diningIn a place like NY, hardcore Indian foodies AND novices alike can find waaaaaay better Indian food for waaaaay cheaper than Tamarind..",1,0,0,Rahul C.,"The Loop, Chicago, IL",0,2,0

2.0,3/13/2017,"My how this place has deteriorated. There are far better Indian restaurants in New York City and Tamarind is resting on its laurels. I used to be the biggest fan of this place and have been going countless times since its opening in 2010 but the memories of my experiences over the last few visits will ensure that I will never return. A recent experience prompted me to come on Yelp and write this review. I don't see Tamarind regaining its Michelin star and rightfully so. For instance, the amuse-bouche was a store bought samosa in the freezer aisle of any Indian store that nearly every Indian family is familiar with (Deep Cocktail Samosas). It's the equivalent of Del Posto serving you Totinos Pizza Rolls. The fact that they served this just signals pure laziness. A restaurant of this quality and price point should demand better of itself and deliver better quality to its patrons. The Aloo Tikki was also bland and probably frozen too. If they are adamant on using store bought items then I can suggest better brands. Come on guys, how can you mess up pan fried potatoes? The worst part was a Thali (platter filled with various small bowls) for $32 that my dad ordered. He could not eat one of the items in the Thali and the waiter refused to substitute it out. The restaurant has so many vegetarian dishes and we were just asking for a very simple substitution. This wasn't even one of those dishes where you have to appreciate what is collectively on the plate, respect the chef's vision, and eat the dish as it is intended. For $32, it is okay to substitute. Not like we were asking to substitute with lobster. He simply wanted another lentil dish. Tamarind has just stopped trying. The ambiance is the only virtue.

3.0,2/7/2017,"The service here is beyond top notch. Like intimidatingly good. From the hostess to the waitstaff to the buss boy, I was talked to as though I were a visiting dignitary who could start having heads lopped were I to find anything displeasurable. The downside of that was that I felt equally pressured to perform. As though parliament might be able to call for a vote of no confidence in me if I spooned my tikka masala incorrectly.The food was basic Indian buffet fare. I ordered the perennial chicken tikka masala with some garlic nan. Note that rice is not included and costs you $6 extra. The total for just the chicken tikka masala with rice was $32 not counting the nan and beverages. I wasn't too upset about the pricing because I knew it was a bit pricey going in. But it's definitely worth noting that the prices here are a little steep in comparison to what you get. And what I got was exactly what I ordered. Some fairly run of the mill chicken tikka masala and 100% standard garlic nan. Both dishes I enjoy, so they were good. But absolutely no different than they would have been at any much less formal Indian eatery around town at half or even a quarter of the price. The masala sauce was a little extra flavorful but the chicken was a bit tough, so nothing special.I have trouble recommending this place. If you want a high-end, posh formal dinning experience in a restaurant that doesn't allow children under 8, then you probably want to go somewhere that also offers posh, high-end formal dishes. If you want basic, Indian food for Westerners then there are plenty of other options that are less intimidating, just as well prepared, and half the cost.",2,1,1,Aaron B.,"Indianapolis, IN",58,135,77

Without checking anything, he started telling us that the restaurant cooks the lamb like that and pointed us that its our mistake that we didn't ask it to be well done. We told that we cannot eat it like that .. finally, without being apologetic, the guy said that he will get it replaced .. after a couple of mins he comes back with tongs and took the chunk of lamb from our plates while we were eating embarassing us infront of everyone .. which was totally unaccepatable!!! We kept our calm and decided to finish our food. Meanwhile the couple next to our table complained about a hair in their food. We were shocked!

A representative had told me it raised awareness for fraudulent activity due to multiple transactions at 1 time. There was 1 transaction for our bill, $198.42, and then another for $407. This is why it automatically declined.My boyfriend looked at his bank app ( we have different banks ) and those 2 transactions showed up on his end as well. Where did this $407 come from? Even if you accidentally doubled $198.42 you'd get $396.84, not $407.This has never happened to me in my entire dining life, and I feel extremely uneasy about a random amount charge. Not to mention embarrassed this guy walked back and forth 3 times to keep telling us the cards decline. Even if this was a mistake, how could the same mistake be made twice with 2 different cards ? These are questions I won't have an answer to & don't ever plan on finding out. I will not be returning.Side note - MINUS all this sketchy activity, food was okay at best & the service was extremely slow. I watched 2 tables who were seated after us leave before us. Our reservations were at 7:30, there shouldn't be a reason our meal was ending around 10:15pm we ordered 2 apps 2 entrees and 2 desserts nothing crazy and 2 people. Let me repeatI will not be returning.******Update *****The GM called my boyfriend and told us the waiter has been let go. He accidentally charged another diner's bill to both our cards. But instead of admitting to this silly mistake, he rather embarrass us and make my boyfriend go to the car to get another card. The GM offered to take care of us if we were ever to return, what that means exactly not too sure but doubt we will be returning.",4,2,0,Alyssa D.,"New Milford, NJ",161,129,461

4.0,10/13/2016,"In search for excellent Indian food in NYC, there will always be a push and pull between modern and classic dining experiences. Tamarind Tribeca is on a upscale modern indian fare which has excellent service. It's always best to have low expectations in regards to service in general but Tamarind Tribeca was an excellent experience for lunch.For the atmosphere, the interior layout and design are extremely modern with high ceiling and large windows. We visited on a weekend day so it was not very busy but I could see a bustling dinner scene with larger groups.It was our first time so we went with the Executive Lunch menu which comes with an appetizer, two selections of entrée portions and a dessert. The portion is not very large but the quality and presentation was quite high.We started off the meal with two cocktails because they was a nice specialty cocktail menu. We had Lychee Martini  for $14 and Ginger Caipirinha for $13. The Lychee drink is made with Stoli strawberry, lychee liqueur, lychee puree and pineapple juice. Ginger Caipirinha is made with Leblon cachaca, ginger liqueur, fresh ginger and lime wedgesThe Lunch appetizers were Mango Jhinga and Chikundari Croquettes. Mango Jhinga is prawns cooked with mango, mustard seeds, and curry leaves. Chikundari Croquettes is made with beet root, ginger, chili, fennel seeds, cilantro, mango mustard chutney.For the entrees, we chose Sarsao Machli & Nadir Palak for one, and Kashmiri Murgh & Ghosht Patiala for the other. They came with salad, tomato rice, and dalchini naan. Sarsao Machli is a salmon with coursed mastard, lemon juice, green chili, and coconut sauce. Nadir Palak is made with lotus root, spinach, garam masala, and chili. Kashmiri Murgh is Tandoori chicken cooked with yogurt, fenugreek leaves, red pepper, mint almond chutney.  Ghosht Patiala is lamb cooked with tomato, onion, yogurt, cashew nut, saffron, and whole spices. They also brought one Naan per personFinally for dessert, Tiramisu was very tasty and Mix Nut Kulfi is an Indian ice cream which is a frozen dairy dessert.If you are in the mood for modern Indian, try out this place.

We split the murg malai kebabs (chicken) and veggie samosas to start. The chicken was extremely tender and flavorful. The samosas were perfectly crispy and well seasoned. For an entree, we split the lamb vindaloo, which had a spicy kick to it with rice on the side.

About one hour later, her throat closed and she got sick- there were nuts in almost everything!!!!!! I was so disappointed that nobody had the decency to let her know that almost all the dishes that came out had nuts and that her allergy was taken as a joke. So so disappointed with this place.

3.0,10/8/2016,"It's a 3.5 really, but Yelp won't allow that.After hearing rave reviews from family and friends for years, I finally had a chance to go to Tamarind during a recent weekend in NYC. The ambiance was nice and upscale - a tad dark for my liking but date night appropriate. The service was good too.  The warm hand towels before and after the meal were a thoughtful touch. The detailed verbal description of the specials went on a little too long. I had forgotten the first thing by the time we got to the last. Might have been a little more helpful on paper. The menu overall was interesting and different from a standard Indian restaurant. They also had an extensive beverage menu. We got some nice wines that paired well with the food.Moving on to the food. We got a complimentary pre-appetizer which was a puff pastry with ricotta and corn. I could taste neither the ricotta nor the corn and the pastry bit was just standard puff pastry. Moving on. For the appetizer, my husband and I shared the Nawabi Shammi Kabab. It was a phenomenal lamb kebab and I take kebabs very seriously. The portion was good-sized and the lamb was perfectly spiced and cooked with a melt in your mouth quality - 10 on 10. For the main course, we got the Awadhi Chicken, Bhindi (Okra) Do Piaza, naan, and steamed rice. The sauce and the filling for the chicken were delicious! The chicken breast itself was overcooked and on the drier side. I would have preferred to just eat the filling and the sauce. The okra was very underwhelming in both texture and flavor. I have cooked and eaten a lot of okra and it absolutely needs to have a crunch and bright(ish) green color. Overall, the experience was good but I'm not itching to come back.

4.0,10/7/2016,"We wanted to get some upscale, fancy Indian dining, and I found this spot. It was said to be kind of a hidden gem. The inside was really spacious, and very bright with natural light coming in from large windows. This restaurant sits at the corner of the building, and both corner walls were covered from floor to ceiling with large windows. The interior was really beautiful, and had lavish lighting fixtures, although, it really didn't need any additional lighting during the day. They have second floor dining space as well, they can accommodate quite a lot of customers. I didn't go upstairs so I don't know how big the second floor actually is, but it seemed big enough. We started with couple of drinks. They had nice variety of specialty cocktails, enough to please everyone with different preference on liqueur and flavors. For food, we ordered Executive Lunch Menu which is a prix-fixe lunch menu. It comes with a choice of appetizer, two choices of Entrées, and a choice of dessert. They were all beautifully plated, and were really tasty! The thing I liked about this place the most was the fact that they brought hot towel at the end of the meal, before the dessert! Great way to get your hands clean after the meal, before digging in to the desserts.Our ""fancy"" Indian dining was a success, we enjoyed our lunch special. Everything was well prepared, beautifully presented, and the service was top class. Our waitress (Corina? Not sure of the spelling...sorry!) was fantastic.

3.0,9/10/2016,"Well, I really wanted to give this place 5 stars bc if I were reviewing it while it were at its old location on 22nd, I would have. Unfortunately, our experience fell a little short. We got to the restaurant early so it was fairly empty, but we did get a decent table in the back. The service was quite good throughout the meal, however,  i I have to say they definitely short you on glasses of wine. I Should have ordered a bottle but wasn't sure two of us were in mood to drink that much. Even though the waiter brings over the bottle to the table and pours the glass that you ordered, it was clearly not a full glass. I should have said something, but let it go. Next time I will. As far as food goes, all of the dishes were pretty good. Our appetizers were excellent. We got the cauliflower special, which as far as I'm concerned, might as well be on the menu because it has been a special for 8 years. But needless to say, I am glad they still make it. It is comprised of lightly battered cauliflower smothered in a spicy red sauce full of traditional Indian flavors. We also got the vegetable samosas. They were also quite good. Vegetarians and meat eaters alike would like these two choices, and while there are plenty of meat dishes to share, these two are a nice introduction to the meal. For the main, we both got the chicken korma, which was chicken cooked in a creamy saffron sauce.  In addition we shared garlic naan and the tamarind rice. Both were quite tasty. While the mains come with a basic rice dish, it is worth taking a glance over the various rice and naan options because they really compliment the meal. My only quip with the main meal was that I had a few pieces of very hard, chewy chicken. That always grosses me out, as if they give you pieces of the fat but otherwise I enjoyed the meal. Overall, the food we got was good, not as good as I remember, but still very flavorful. The service was on point, and the ambiance was very nice.

The only downside to the restaurant is the price, it is very expensive. We did not do the restaurant week menu because the dishes we want were not on the restaurant week menu.

It had some cadaman in it which added taste and wasn't overpowering. Chicken tikka was Good, decent size portion My husband got the special lamb dish which was better but way overpriced. The best thing on the menu was the mushroom and truffle oil naan. Unfortunately none of the entrees include rice, you have to get the rice and naan bread separately. Service: Great, our waiter was attentive and checked in on us wo being overbearing. We got our cocktails soon after we sat down and they refilled our water often which is one of my pet peeves!! Perhaps it was because it was still early and the restaurant wasn't super busy yet. Overall , my husband and I were glad we went to see what it was all about given the one Michelin star.

For all you instagrammers out there, the seat in the corner by the window will give you great light for that perfect picture! ;-)I've probably eaten here at least 15 times, from brunches with girlfriends (weekend brunches are surprisingly quiet), to work dinners to birthday parties and everything in between - and I've never been disappointed. In fact I've always left very happy! Everybody raves about the cod dish, but my favorites are the Bhel Puri and the Dal Makhni. Consistently delicious and satisfying!

I might as well have gone to Junoon, paid the same or less price which has much better quality of food items. The waitress was good, but I had asked for a cocktail from the menu and when it came, there was an issue with it. I explained and she insisted everything was fine and argued. I was a bit taken aback since, in general, restaurants accommodate patrons' requests if something is not fine with the drink or dish. She, in fact refused to replace it and I had to insist that I'd like to return it. I had a high level delegation in the group, and tried to do this as politely as I could. When the bill came, I found that she had added the item in the bill. I had to excuse myself and go to the host and ask him to correct the bill (which he politely did). Not that I'd do this in other circumstances, but this really felt wrong. We paid about $ 500-600 and to have the person serving refusing and arguing with a customer over a request to replace a $ 12 cocktail was not professional.

5.0,7/21/2016,"This is my first visit to New York City and, based on my dining experience at Tamarind alone, I would seriously consider living here. The ambiance is absolutely beautiful. The restaurant is two stories, with the second floor feeling like a high rise penthouse overlooking TriBeCa. It can get loud as the evening goes on, but the entire restaurant and its decorations are so beautiful, you don't mind. I loved the glass walls that let you look down onto the first floor, and how open the entire floor plan was. We began our meal with the vegetable samosas, as well as the grilled shrimp. Our waiter, Gullu (who I will rave on later), recommended the shrimp as well as the plain nan, emphasizing how the plain bread better let you enjoy the shrimp. And let me tell you, he was RIGHT. The samosas were crispy and flavorful with a good hint of spice amongst the pea and potato. Really, though, the shrimp was the star. It was marked as the appetizer special of the evening, and special doesn't even begin to cover it. These shrimp were the size of a baby's arms, and perfectly cooked- not too well done despite the rich char on the outside. The sauce was sweet without being cloying, and it was the best shrimp I've had in a long time. For the three people dining, we each tried different things. The Tulsi Malai kebabs were delightful- again, that perfect balance of tender meat and char knocked my socks off. The kebabs are white meat, and yet lose no flavor or tenderness for being from the breast. Whether you're just venturing into Indian food or are a long time fan, this is a great call.A different dish for the group was Malai Halibut, and it was a surprising favorite. The mace in the sauce added an element of sweetness, but the spice medley worked perfectly together. The halibut was tender and delicate- not rubbery at all- and practically melted in your mouth. Rarely do I order fish dishes when I could get meat, but this is one I would definitely eat again.The third and final dish of the evening was the Tandoori mixed grill. It boasted a mix of all the finest tandoori treasures, and it certainly lived up to its claim. I myself got a taste at the tulsi malai chicken, which was divine. The shrimp, here served without the sauce, were stellar on their own. The crispness of the grill and the wonderful texture were out of this world. But the real star of the show was the lamb. If I return, I would opt to order just the lamb so I could enjoy more of it. Beautifully cooked, richly seasoned. It's hours later now and I'm still drooling over it. The lambchop was tender to the point it barely needed cutting, with just the right blend of fat to meat to bring in the rich flavors with excellent texture. If I could live off of one food and one food alone for the rest of my life, it would be lamb chops at tandoori. Please send a chef down to Texas so I can revel in this food more often. I need lamb of this caliber in my life. As a means to try some of everything, since we're from Texas and aren't sure when we'll be back, we also ordered the Saag Paneer. I've had Indian food where the paneer barely holds itself together and the texture is altogether lacking, or a bite leaves your mouth watery. Not this paneer, though. Tamarind's paneer is perfectly cooked to a silky texture with no unpleasant runoff, embedded in a wonderfully spicy bed of spinach. Absolutely heavenly. It's wonderful to know people can still properly spice paneer without it being sad and runny, and Tamarind is proof of that.Just as important as the food was our waiter, Gullu. He was friendly from the moment we sat down, joking with everyone at the table and smiling more genuinely than anyone else I'd seen in New York. He was more than happy to answer our silly questions, and basically lit up like a Christmas tree when asked for his recommendations. His reasoning for all suggestions was perfect- mild rice and nan to match the strong flavors of the meal and enhance them, rather than overwhelming what we were eating. He took care of everyone at the table, and was eager to see what we thought of the food and his suggestions. Everything we needed was taken care of quickly and easily, and he didn't laugh at my terrible mispronunciation of half of the dishes. Gullu was a GEM. If you eat at Tamarind, get him as your waiter! Gullu won't steer you wrong.And definitely get the mango lassi. It's a small indulgence, but the yogurt and mango blend so perfectly together. Trust me. It's delicious.If I had to pick a final meal, it would definitely be here, with Gullu helping me pick what to eat. This experience was nothing short of perfect, and I'm already saving up money to come back to New York and eat at Tamarind and see Gullu again.You MUST go here. It's just not optional.",0,0,0,Anna S.,"Plano, TX",6,22,12

4.0,6/19/2016,"One of the best Indian restaurants that I have been to. Tamarind is a modern, yet authentic restaurant centrally located in the heart of Lower Manhattan. It is considered high-end, but there is no pressure to dress in formal attire (smart causal would do). Upon arrival, you are served a hot towel which is a first for me in the states. It is nice to wash up in the comfort of your seat before ordering these delicious dishes. You are also given the hot towel at the end of your meal before you leave. This is an example of the excellent customer service at Tamarind. We had a core team of 3-4 individuals serve us during dinner. One even helped a colleague of mine charge his phone. The menu is extensive and consisted of different regional flavors and varieties. Prices are a bit steep, but that is expected given the location, service, and amenities. I ended up going with the delicious Goat Biryani that is priced at $28 and consist of basmati rice, baby goat, and a mix of spices. Be prepared as this dish was fairly spicy, but delicious. The goat was tender, had a balance of bones and meat, and spiced perfectly to complement with the basmati rice. One of the best versions of biryani I've had!

The experience was incredibly enjoyable; service was impeccable, the atmosphere was lively, and food was, overall, excellent. Although some of the dishes we ordered could have been more flavorful, Tamarind does a good job in pleasing the type of clientele that would eat at such a restaurant.

4.0,4/20/2016,"Tamarind Tribeca is indeed a fine Indian restaurant, i.e. fancy with white table cloths.  We received a friendly greeting upon entering the restaurant.  We were going to be seated at a table jammed between other tables, however, we requested a different table and they accommodated.  Our waitress and servers were friendly and professional.  We were pleased with the overall service.  Once seated, Khari biscuit and yogurt sauce were brought to the table.  The Khari biscuit was tasty however, it was extremely light so the portion of one per person is insufficient.  The yogurt sauce was tangy and sweet, like tamarind.  We ordered Midnight in Mumbai, a rye and port cocktail.  It was delicious however, my husband spilled most of it and it wasn't replaced, something we expected from an upscale place.  Our waitress did take care of the spill right-away.  We ordered Bhel Poori as our starter, it was visually appetizing however, it was a bit dry and needed more seasoning.  Our food experience got better once we received our main course.  We ordered a vegetarian (Tandoori Subz) and a non-vegetarian (Tandoori Mixed Grill) entrée.  The Tandoori Subz were flavorful, I am not a fan of mushrooms because of their texture but I particularly enjoyed this mushroom.  It had depth of flavor.  The seasoned paneers were also delicious, both had the right amount of spice and tang.  I would have liked poblano pepper instead of the Italian pepper, as it is more flavorful and would have better suited the filling, but I enjoyed the filling, made with paneer, tomatoes and caramelized onions.  The only disappointment on the plate was the spinach tiki, it was greasy, heavy and lacked flavor.  The Tandoori Mixed Grill entrée was also very flavorful. It came with three different flavors of tandoor chicken, a tandoor shrimp and a tandoor lamb chop.  All were well prepared and juicy, especially the tandoor shrimp and lamb chop. The black lentils on the plate were a big surprise, far exceeding expectations.  Although, the lentils could have used a hint of brightness since they were very rich.

3.0,3/19/2016,"Actually 3.5 but I like to support the Indian diaspora when possible.Grand maharaja- interesting, never had cardamom infused vodka. Unfortunately it's way too cardamom. They did bring me extra st Germain to try to balance it out but it still was just cardamom vodka with simple syrup. Hard pass. Ambiance- wow, looks like a upscale restaurant in India. It's kinda cool. Don't picture that as an insult as nicer restaurants in India are swank. They just have this ""look"". Service- great! Professional and nice. My Eastern European waitress was super sweet. And my Indian one was super sophisticated. The host at the front was also very easy on the eyes. Probably the best part of the experience after the naan.My lunch neighbors were a couple of my Indian brothers straight from the motherland. I overheard them griping that the food was subpar, so I inquired what they got their main complaint (which I find trivial) was the prix fixe items don't go well. I also heard something about chicken being bad and vegetarian dish not that great. I still went w prix fixe...Bihari murgh - The quasi Kati kebab roll thing was ok. Plated nicely, but the white meat chicken was a bit dry and had the tendon portions included. The paratha was nice and crisp without being greasyChikundari murgh - this was good, but it was really just tandoori chicken breast with red beet color on top. Nothing special. Chicken was juicy but eating cold juicy chicken breast is weird. Tawa machli (pan fried fish)Loved the crisp crust on the red snapper and the freshness of the fish, no fishy taste, firm meat, good flavor. South Indian Vegetable curryThis was cool, interesting, standard. Served cold, not sure if that's normal or not. Tomato rice- dry, seems like the common consensus of many reviewers. You could see that there were a lot of components but I just couldn't taste them. On the flipside the rice was very fluffy and none of the grains were sticky.Methi naanamazing. I couldn't really appreciate the flavor of the powdered Fenugreek, but it looked cool on top. And it was perfectly bartered. To think it was cold but despite this it was really delicious. Probably one of the best naans I ever had.I understood how my dining neighbors felt that the components didn't really go together. You're mixing dishes from the north and the south part of the country, which are cuisines that, in my opinion, are vastly different. But maybe that's a good thing, as you get to try food from different regions of the subcontinent. I think one thing that was disappointing was The lukewarm to cold temperature of the dishes served. But I was impressed that a cold naan could taste so good! Take out: Samundri JalwaLobster soup with carrots, cognac, garlic and cayenne pepper, really just tasted like some lobster and a spiced tomato soup. I couldn't appreciate the other components.JalpariBasil shrimp, bean sprouts, radish sprouts, pea shoots and micro greens, honey and ginger dressing. couldn't really appreciate the basil component of the shrimp at all. If anything it tasted like shrimp marinated in the standard  of ginger garlic paste with tumeric and lemon juice then cooked in a tandoor. Actually I looked on the menu and they substituted the shrimp from another dish they offer without informing me. The shrimp from the dish they subbed from is meant to be eaten warm. Gross. Called to try to ask for clarification but got a reservation line so emailed instead. With all this being said I'm not sure I would go back and order any of their dishes on the main menu but rather give it a try during one of the prix fixe specials.And in response to the comments of being Americanized or not spicy enough, I actually find this to be not the case. Just bc it doesn't burn you a new butthole doesn't mean it's not authentic and there's plenty of south Asians who don't like sweat-inducing spiciness. I liked the milder spice levels which allowed the flavors of the spices come through other than mouth burning heat. Then again maybe some more spice would be good given the temp of the food.",2,2,1,Sujan P.,"New York, NY",251,324,87

Wonderful ambiance, high ceilings, dim lighting, white tablecloths, and a full bar. We ordered *tamarind margaritas* as we waited for our table and they were definitely an innovative Indian spin on margaritas. It tasted good, but combination of tamarind and tequila ended up being unsettling on my stomach.We were seated promptly there after. Our server, I have to say, was quite terrible. He ended up ruining the evening for us. He was rude, inattentive and appeared racist. It was astonishing how blatantly he neglected our table while he was so attentive to ones adjacent to us. He failed to give us the specials and we found out from overhearing other tables. He took our order and disappeared for the entire duration.  After the entree he presented himself again and didn't bother offering dessert till we asked. Total fail! When we got our bill my husband pointed out that he had forgotten to charge us for the drinks from the bar. Showing no gratitude whatsoever he added them to the bill, and we later found out that our card was charged twice. This took a couple phone calls and they ended up fixing it after a week or so. I regret tipping this man, and wish we had requested another server. In terms of food, the *lamb and cauliflower specials* were delicious. Lamb was perfectly cooked, tender, seasoned well and probably the best we've ever had. The cauliflower was the right amount of crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Rest of the food was good as well, but average.

I thought it could be a little more tender but overall I would have been content eating a plate of that with the kalonji nan (that nan was awesome) The other three seperate choices was follow:Manglorean fish curry, nice peice of halibut. Kalmi murgh, basically spiced grilled chicken Hare gobi ka saag, kinda reminded me of mash potatoes but green. Dessert 2 ginger caramel creme brule (creme brule on top and ginger sauce on the bottom. Pretty good) 1 blackforest cake (was ok) So in general, the food plate size were small and the amount of spice used was on the moderate side for an Indian restaurant. I still enjoyed it and would like to come back for. Another round of nan and probably goat or lamb there. Happy dining everyone.",2,0,1,Peter L.,"Brooklyn, NY",34,32,87
2.0,1/31/2016,"Bottom Line: VERY Americanized Indian Food.All our Main dishes (both meat and veggie) looked great, but tasted, well, BORING. The flavors were DEAD. As a person of Indian descent who was born & raised in America I have a much more refined/experienced palate for Indian food (though I shamefully cannot handle much spice), but in my honest opinion: there are far better and much cheaper restaurants to go to if you want to enjoy FOOD. If you're going for the ambiance, this place is good. EXCELLENT service.",3,0,0,Nisha S.,"Butler, NJ",0,3,0

5.0,1/26/2016,"My husband and I visited for Restaurant Week as we love Indian food and miss it so much since moving to NYC from London. We loved the food and feel it is the best Indian food we have discovered in the city. We went for Sunday brunch, you have a choice of appetizer, 2 curries and a dessert. Rice, a vegetable side dish and naan bread is part of the deal, which we shared. The presentation of the dishes was very appealing. I chose the Gushtaba (Kashmiri lamb) to start and my husband had the Karara jhinga (shrimp). My dish was delicious, the meat was well flavored and went great with the sauce. My husband LOVED his shrimp! He said if he could have had a whole curry like that he would have been happy. For our curries I chose the Kalmi Murgh (chicken) and Hare Gobi Ka Saag (veg saag type curry) and my husband had the Ghosht Hara Masala (tandoori lamb) and Manglorean fish curry (halibut). The winner was definitely the Lamb. It was tender, full of flavor, just amazing. I enjoyed my saag curry, but wasn't a huge fan of the chicken, I would probably advise to give that a miss. It was a small piece of chicken, with a strange texture and not a huge amount of flavor. Out of the 4 curries it was my least favorite. The halibut was also good, with a decent sauce. I was so happy that the naan bread was actually authentic naan, it was so good! It was fluffy and you could just tear it apart. It was very good. As was the vegetable side dish, which was potatoes and peas in a sauce. The dessert was very small (Blackforest Cake), but we didn't even feel it was needed after such a great meal, so it was no big deal. We came away feeling very satisfied with our meal and planning our return. We enjoyed the food and it was great value compared to other Indian restaurants we have tried. We plan to order the lamb curries when we go back.",4,1,3,Lynsey H.,"London, United Kingdom",223,458,2823
1.0,1/24/2016,"Coming from an Indian person. Hear ye, hear ye, thy unbrown person. There are two types of Indian restaurants in America-1. Indian food for non-Indian people: Great decor, spacious, pricy, with a small menu of items described in great detail. Kofta becomes ""vegetable balls"" and the desserts arent Indian, perhaps merely to spare them the difficulty of describing them. 2. Indian food for Indian people:The spice is strong, the service is questionable. The waiters are of Indian origin and will have a hard time understanding you. A chicken tikka masala shalt not go by any other name. This is a strong type 1. The fact that everyone here for Sunday brunch besides us wasn't Indian is telling enough. We'd come here for winter restaurant week 2016 which promised us a $25 brunch. Excited by the fact that not one, but two entrees were promised, we thought it was a decent deal. It wasn't. Lies. Lies and deceit I tell you. Alas, we discover that $25 is no special price, but the price of their regular weekend brunch. Marketing at its finest. And lo and behold, two entrees isn't the two Indian sized grandiose bowls of spicy ambrosia, but two minuscule portions of curry served alongside a soulcycler's portion of rice. If only the luxurious decor could fill the rest our stomachs. I exaggerate slightly, but let's talk taste. Type 1 Indian food to the core. The portions small, the flavors mild. They were kind enough, I will say, to bring us complimentary pakora [sic]. That is pakora in the singular for they brought us one measly soggy onion pakora. The lamb appetizer was undercooked and almost mistakenly doused with saunf. When recipes are perfected for centuries, one does not simply add a random ingredient. The shrimp appetizer was decent though, I'll admit. Calling the main courses lackluster, would be an insult to the word. The meats - chicken and lamb were horribly undercooked. The fish, edible. The kofta, or ""veggie balls"" as the menu would say, were decent too. Let me tell you something about palak paneer. Palak is spinach, not kale. I repeat, spinach not kale. You cannot simply substitute the age old green leaf of popeye with your next  trending health item. Not cool, bro. And those two entrees, like I said, are misnomers. They were appetizer sized. Onto dessert. The Black Forest cake and the creme brûlée weren't bad per se, although it would be equally strange to see Gulab Jamun and Rasmalai for dessert at a French restaurant. One thing Michelin raters look for in food is consistency between different dining experiences. Granted this is hard. One would at least expect consistency within the same dining experience. Two creme brûlées. One deftly torched on top, was served to my friend. The one served to me, raw. Alright, the best of us make mistakes, one might think. After taking a bite, I politely asked the waitress why the brûlée wasn't torched. I didn't ask for custard. When you're laying $30 for a meal you expect an apology and a replacement. This isn't pocket change. Instead, she asks ""oh, you like your creme brûlée toasted?"". I was a tad aghast. Why don't you serve me some dough and tomatoes and ask ""you like your pizza made?"". ""Duh"". Without apologizing, she takes my dish away promising to return swiftly. As she does. I found peace in the knowledge that this grave error would soon be rectified by a new piece of tiny, yet sumptuous new torched creme brûlée. Nope, they torched over my half eaten wow. This meal was forgetful, and for a post blizzard New York brunch that we all travelled a ways to get to, downright disappointing. Not to mention more expensive than was warranted. Tamarind once had a Michelin star, a star it has lost not without reason. Lest you're craving the sanctity of a completely counterfeit white-washed meal where the dining tables are more expensive than a months rent, go to Curry Hill and grab yourself some real desi food.

Unfortunately this restaurant was quite disappointing.Let's start off with the good: the ambiance and decor are great. The restaurant is beautifully decorated, open and airy. Everything else is pretty much downhill from there.Service: Not on par with a restaurant of this caliber. Our server took our order and we didn't see him again until he asked if wanted dessert. He didn't bother to let us know there were specials (I only found out when I heard him telling an adjacent table). He asked if we had dietary restrictions but wasn't very accommodating when I asked if they could just hold the yogurt off one of the appetizers. Maybe he was just having a bad day, who knows?Food: Overall disappointing. -- Chili crab - didn't taste very fresh...I wouldn't recommend this dish.-- Tamarind Scallops - the best thing I had all night! Beautiful presentation.-- Seekh Kabob - my brother ate this entire dish so I assume he liked it. I can't comment as I don't eat lamb.-- Chicken Biryani - again I don't eat meat but didn't hear any complaints from my brother.-- Chana Pindi - After one bite of this dish my mouth was on fire...I simply couldn't eat it. Had the dish contained pomegranates (as indicated on the menu) the spice factor probably would have been manageable. Since our waiter was nowhere to be found I couldn't do anything until the end of the meal, when he offered to remake the dish at a mild spice level. At that point we were done so I declined. He didn't take this $20 dish off the bill though, which would have been the right thing to do as it would inedible.I read that Tamarind Tribeca no longer has a Michelin star.

However, if you want high-quality Indian food with amazing service and beautiful decor, this is your place. Every single thing about this restaurant is on point. The decor gets you as soon as you step in -  a lot of natural wood everywhere, a lot of natural light in the restaurant, and elegant white linens. And of course, tons of Indian statues/sculptures. The bathrooms were ridiculous. There are five unisex bathrooms, all of which smelled amazing, were super clean, and were decorated impeccably with great attention to detail. E.g. they even have paper towels that have the ""Tamarind"" logo printed on them (WTF!)The owner of this restaurant seems super involved with the operation of the restaurant and greeted me as soon as I walked in. As I left he inquired about my experience and invited me back again. This sets the tone for the type of service you'll get here. Service was prompt, my water glass was never empty, my plates were cleared instantly, and waiters were extremely pleasant. I came during restaurant week without even knowing it was restaurant week so I was pleasantly surprised to see a three course menu offering for $25 dollars. Even otherwise I'd have gladly paid the prices on the menu for the food - it was all delicious. I had a shrimp appetizer  (kharara jhinga), which was perfectly seasoned and mildly spicy. For the entree (you pick two), I had the kalmi murgh and a soya paneer dish... both excellent. For dessert I chose the blackforest cake, which was good, but I think the ginger creme brulee my friend ordered was better.Presentation of all these dishes is unbelievable.

Halibut was great. Potato and pea side dish was watery and soupy and had no flavor. Cauliflower appetizer tasted and looked like General Tso's chicken but you bite into it and find cauliflower. Again bizarre. Breads were all great but the Truffle and mushroom naan looked nice but I hardly tasted the truffle oil. Scallop appetizer was strange - my scallop was  very dry and overcooked and it was served with scallop sized wheat toast (this is what I meant by not authentic) and toast was sprinkled with chili pepper.

1.0,12/1/2015,"I am beyond disappointed with Tamarind and this is NOT my first time. The first time I came here, I was with my boyfriend and we came for the afternoon tea service, which is supposed to be in the Lotus Room located on the upper level of the restaurant. Mind you, the host saw us and seemed to purposefully seat us elsewhere. We had to nag them about how we would like to sit in the room that the restaurant advertises on its site since we are here for the tea service! Finally they brought us upstairs, but we had to make a fuss about it. I came was more recently with my sister for the afternoon tea, since I thought I'd give the restaurant another chance. I came here the weekend of Diwali (just a few weeks back) with the hopes of ringing in another year together. However, the service (or lack thereof) at Tamarind essentially ruined our day. Again, they would NOT seat us in the Lotus Room. Why do you have the room and advertise your afternoon tea in the Lotus Room if you are NOT going to seat your patrons there to begin with? That was the tip of the iceberg unfortunately. Asides from not being seated in the Lotus Room, after we specifically asked, the afternoon tea menu notes that you receive tea, a wrap/sandwich, assorted cookies, + rice pudding. Our server told us that they did not have any more assorted cookies but that he would substitute something else for us. He never did... On top of that, my sister is allergic to cilantro and we noted that with the server. We asked that he provide some other chutney/sauce to accompany our sandwiches, since without any condiment it would be too dry (we ordered the paneer wraps). He said sure but never brought us a chutney. Moreover, our sandwiches were COLD and when we were looking for a server to ask some questions, they were no where to be found. For the price that we paid and the service we received, I was truly disappointed. Oh, and on the way out of the restaurant, we saw one of the workers ASLEEP in a booth. Legs up and all.

My friend and I were seated immediately but then our whole experience was a waiting game. We waited 10 minutes for the menu and another 10 minutes before our drink order was taken. AtmosphereMy friend and I were seated immediately and the orchids and other live plants outfit the restaurant beautifully. The dim lights create an elegant and classy feel to the space while still having a casual element. The hallway to the bathroom revealed great Indian music which was not at all heard from the dining area, making the space less lively.FoodI ordered the Dahi Aloo Puri as an appetizer and it was AMAZING! The perfect balance of sweet, tangy, salty, crispy and smooth was in every bite. However, this is one of the only portions of my dining experience I could rave about. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala as my entree in which the meat was quite tender. When I forked each piece of chicken, it would fall apart from it's tenderness. The sauce was too salty, preventing me from eating my leftovers at home. The naan was soft and flaky and rice that I ordered to accompany my dish was cooked perfectly. Dessert was a complete disappointment. The Flourless Chocolate Cake was awful. It lacked depth of flavor, texture, and the passion fruit mousse did not compliment the chocolate at all. As a huge dessert and chocolate fan, I was disappointed in how such a simple dessert could go so wrong.ServiceThe service was consistently slow. Aside from waiting 20 minutes to take drink orders and another 15 minutes to take our dinner orders, it took 15 minutes to receive the check AFTER our table was cleared.

We had a table for 2 that felt more like a table for 6 with the 2 couples next to us.  It was really loud in there too.,0,0,0,Alex D.,"Dallas, TX",0,52,9
4.0,11/14/2015,"Full disclosure - I usually avoid Indian food. But I still really enjoyed Tamarind. I had the venison and roasted cauliflowers. It honestly opened my eyes about Indian food and less prone to saying no to it. Usually indian food is too overwhelming for me and I don't like some of the spices that are prominent in the food. But Tamarind is really exceptional. It is not too heavy on the spices, but the food is still flavorful. Yes, it is pricey, but it is worth trying it out once even if you're not into Indian food.

From the minute we walked into the restaurant the ambiance was amazing.  The decor was clean and classy, not to mention we were seated immediately, the waiter even helped me with my seat! For starters we chose from their lovely wine selection and then had the samosas. Hands down best samosa we've had.  The samosas were not over or under seasoned, nice layer of delectable fried batter  and was paired with two sauces on the dish. For the entree i had a tandoori chicken which wad good,  but my boyfriend's  lamb on the specials with basmati rice, I wish I could remember the name:( , was amazing.

Food is ok their sauce is good  I always get the Lobster In sauceThey have jumbo Shrimps and they taste great Great location ConsVery pricey an appetizer of 3 Jumbo Shrimp $21. Average price dinner for two is $150-$180. This is if you don't get desert. Their Cosmo drinks are equivalent to 95% juice. I had 2 drinks and I would have got more buzzed from half a beer. None of the meals come with a side order Lemon Rice was very hard and the Chicken tikka Masala was undercooked horrible it was not good at all Overall this is a terrific place to take a special someone but plan it right stay away from the Cosmo drinks and lemon rice. I been to this place a total of four times now. For some reason they seem to rush you and bring you the bill without even asking you. Simply if you are not ordering anything else once you eat they want you to leave instantly. Two of the times I attended the place was not even crowded. The food is very heavy and you need about 15-20 mins after just to settle down in my opinion. All four times 4-7 minutes after they took our plates they brought me the bill if I didn't order anything else. After that you you the impression they want you to pay and leave and they start looking at you funny. They stare at you. I believe they should have a timer and leave you alone for at least 10 mins after you are done eating. You are there to eat and would like to have a conversation with your partner before leaving.This place is definitely not worth the price on the bill but maybe worth attending 2-3 times a year.,1,0,0,James C.,"New York, NY",1,3,0

Great lighting, spectacular service, and even a extra room--the Lotus Room--for a different experience. Ordered a couple appetizers and entrees (highly recommended choices from our server) to share and enjoyed my food very much but failed to see how it was significantly better than regular Indian food. The only dish that stood out to me was the Kolambi Pola appetizer: prawns cooked in lemongrass, coconut, and red chillies--spicy but different, at least for Indian food. Perhaps it is my untrained palette but I did think overall, Tamarind was over priced for what it was. The 4 stars are for the ambiance, service, and SPECTACULAR COCKTAILS AND DESSERT! I highly highly highly recommend the chocolate mousse cake. It is infused with a exotic flavor I'm not going to include because it will give the surprise away but it really comes through.

They used words like ""out of this world"" ""absolutely delicious"" ""best appetizer ever"". Then we had a mix of appetizers (samosas, duck roll, scallops ). Everything came out hot and delicious.  The lamb dish i had was outrageously good and my husband absolutely loved the tandoor chicken. The halibut got rave reviews as did the tikka masala.  This restaurant is hands down th best indian in lower manhattan, and possibly nyc.  The decor is stunning and the wine list is abundant and not too overpriced.

We got the raj kachori and hara bhara kabab for appetizers. The kabab was absolutely delicious and melt in the mouth. For the main course, we got the kofta (lotus root kofta) and paneer and lamb vindaloo. The lamb vindaloo was out of the world (as reviewed by people who ate it). I thought they were he bestmade koftas i had, the perfect texture.A surprising twist was the truffle naan, i wanted to try it but was skeptical about clashing flavors.

The chicken was dry and bland - why did they use breast instead thigh?  The sauce was average, it had no fresh aroma of herbs or vegetables in it. The overall presentation was average - there was no fresh vegetables on the side or a special garnish. Bread and rice were separate orders, which is fine as long at the main dish is of high quality - $24.00.

The decor was tastefully done and the lunch scene is casual but chic. Was not too busy for a weekday lunch and was very quiet.service: very good. My glass was never empty. Food came quickly without long pauses between courses. Before and after the meal I was presented with a hot wet towel to clean my hands..it was a nice touch, but a little over the top...I guess it was a western take on the ""finger bowl"". food: very tasty, very indian, there is room for innovation. The chef prepared dishes from the north and south of India and he prepared them well. Again, I was looking for something more unique. Not too many vegetarian options on the lunch menu. However the selection for non-vegetarian entree's did exceed my expectation. I ordered the halibut and lamb and was very happy with the portion. Best Indian preparation of lamb I have ever had. Definitely a very good value for money if you're eating meat (but only offered paneer and karela for non-veg). presentation of food: a little bit sloppy but the service and ambience made up for it.

3.0,8/19/2015,"A lot of people don't get the upscale Indian food concept (ridiculous- upscale and cheap exists in every cuisine), and I think this has a lot to do with the fact that Indian food is so packed with spices and flavor that it is super exciting to the palate no matter what. Tamarind (though not as good as it once was) still provides great refined Indian food. The samosas were not out of the ordinary and neither was the mango chutney, but the crunchy raita was delicious. the naan was exactly what naan is supposed to be, crispy on the edges but doughy and pulling apart in the center. Service was excellent, the waiter answered all of our questions. The halibut was fantastic, flaking apart just right. Dessert was meh (rice pudding was bland, pistachio kulfi not pistachio-y enough).

Yes, it's pricey but I didn't find it to be too outrageous considering the quality and ambiance.We came here for my friend's birthday, who is a huge fan of anything that sets his mouth ablaze, so naturally Indian was the first thing to come to mind. His wife and daughter, however, are complete opposites and they aren't into Indian food... Until they came here!They ordered the things they were most familiar with; Chicken Tikka Masala and Tandoori Chicken. Both were well executed but for me the best way to go here is the stuff I've never seen before like the Lamb Pasanda with apricots, which was a real treat, or the incredible Masala Gosht my friend ordered. As for my fire breathing friend, he ordered the Murg Kohlapuri and asked that they kick up the spiciness to suit his tastes, which they certainly did!Along with the appetizers and deserts, the bill was reasonable especially considering this was a formally Michelin Star rated establishment. Why they lost the star I don't know, maybe consistency issues? Seems that way going by the Yelp reviews, but I always take into account that Yelpers can be a fickle crowd to please especially in a town full of so many great choices.Whatever the case, I'm sure I'll be returning on a return trip to the city I love.",3,1,1,Jeff G.,"Miami, FL",357,415,954

The atmosphere for this restaurant is very modern with a high end touch which is something unique for an Indian restaurant (I am of Bengali descent, so I've been to many other Indian restaurants which is why I say its unique).  After we were seated right away, the waiters here were very much on top of their game. We were constantly checked up on, they answered any/all questions we had regarding the food and our meals- and overall made sure we were well taken care of to enjoy our time here. What makes a nice touch is the manager of the restaurant will walk around and take the time to personally speak with all the guests who are there, which to me is what makes all the biggest difference. The food here is nothing short of excellent. Unlike other places in the city which claim to make ""indian"" food, the food here is almost as good as the food I get at home.

Tamarind was my first ""high end"" Indian food restaurant. The service was impeccable, but the food was on par with my previous experiences. To be fair, I should have gotten a special. Instead, I got a chicken tikka masala, because I hadn't been feeling well and figured I should stick with something simple. While the chicken was tender, it was not head and shoulders above the cheaper Indian places I have tried. My boyfriend got the lamb shank special, and his was amaaaazing. The meat was cooked to perfection. We also got samosas to start--they were also standard. The plating was very nice--3 samosas per order, with two sauces and some garnish. For the main entrees, the waiters delivered the dishes, and then served us each a portion. I thought it was a nice touch.The atmosphere is probably one of Tamarind's best features. The space is open, and the servers are courteous. We were walk-ins, and there was no wait at 630pm. I was allowed to sit at the table to wait for my date, and they offered me plenty of time to look at the menu. Their cocktails are great--I recommend their Tamarind Margarita. Drinks were pretty strong, also, so you get your money's worth. The decor of the Tribeca location is gorgeous--it fits right in with the chic neighborhood, and the liberal use of modern fixtures lends to the feeling of luxury dining.

The fish curry was meh -- I've had better in the East Village, at one-third of the price. We did like the bhindi do piaza, and the rice pudding was fantastic.

2.0,6/7/2015,"this rating is for the executive lunch I had today. i love the ambiance and service of this place but the food i felt should have been a whole lot better. the shrimp app was prob the only thing decent. they gave u 3, but one was missing a tail and smaller than the other. i picked the lamb and fish as my entree choices. the lamb had this weird mush like texture, didn't like it at all. the fish was a salmon, was just a tiny bit overcooked. the veg curry had some hard uncooked potato and the flavor was very unexciting and lacked depth. the nan was nice. ended the meal with a strawberry kulfi, waiter described it was like ice cream but it was way too ""icy"" for me so they def used more water than dairy in making it. overall, for $25 for all that food its an ""ok"" deal for an upscale restaurant. but honestly the executive lunch leaves much to be desired. maybe i just picked the wrong proteins. =( but next time I'd prob go to a nice indian buffet.",0,0,0,David C.,"New York, NY",9,88,4

It's huge, spacious and has various levels to it. We were seated on the first floor overlooking the Tandoor area, ground level seating and the bar. We started off the evening with Amritsari Seekh n a lamb appetizer. And I have to say, both were extremely flavorful and succulent. In entree we picked Murgh kolhapuri, Nargisi Kofta n Dal Makhni which were a notch lower than the appetizers. However their Mushroom n Truffle Naan was fantastic. The Rosemary Naan was average. If you like cocktails then try their lychee martini which is amazing.

At a normal indian restaurant I would shy away from fish or seafood but both dishes with lobster are to die for, so is the crab appetizer (don't remember the name of it). The quality of the food was really noticeable, at a typical Indian restaurant in the city the quality is nowhere near what it is here. Even the spices tasted fresher zestier. Drinks were strong and complimented the food very well! Service was great too.

3.0,6/5/2015,"I think ""high end Indian food"" is maybe an odd concept to begin with. I didn't go for a long, long time. Someone invited me out for drinks, warning me how expensive it was. The cocktails are around $14, which is average. The appetizers can range from $9-$16, entrees start in the twenties for chicken and top out at $40 for pricier proteins, which is where things get kind of ridiculous. We ordered the samosas, chili crab, and the wild mushroom and truffle oil naan. The samosas were fine but didn't stand out. They don't give you little bowls for the mint and tamarind sauces, they ""plate"" them for you in itty bitty classy piles that do nothing for me. The chili crab was good. Tender, fresh, with just a slight kick to it. The star of the show ended up being the naan, which was bursting with the flavor of the mushrooms. It comes with a cucumber raita that I didn't think complimented it too well. I also thought the drinks were just OK. I had two different margarita drinks, but definitely preferred  the Tamarind Margarita, but then I love tamarind sauce on and in pretty much everything. Service was good, the ambiance is predictably classy. The bathrooms are nice (private rooms instead of stalls). But I wasn't wowed by anything I had, which makes the price point a big turn off. I'd come back only if someone else was treating, but even then I wouldn't mind them treating me to another Indian place instead :P",1,1,0,Luci B.,"Queens, NY",150,1402,3222

4.0,4/23/2015,"ahhhhhhhhh 4 Yelp Tamarind TriBeCa, us brown folk love you guys but at times we may find you to be a bit too Fusion-y but equally authentic as well, coupled with the ""Most Indian restaurants have mediocre/bad service"" mantra. I've been here so many times to this gorgeous restaurant that tries so hard and succeeds in so many ways, but fails in many others. They need a few tweaks in these areas:- Why do we have to pay for white/plain Basmati rice???? Come onnnnnnnn- Every time I'm here, there are dishes/glasses being dropped on the floor by the wait staff causing a loud crash/bang and the owner has to walk over to ensure all is okay. I know this happens from time to time but why every single visit of mine? - The drinks on the cocktail menu sound fantastic and upon 2-3 attempts by the bartenders, turns out being fantastic, but why must I always have to have them remake the drink a few times?- The wait staff at the tables just aren't polished enough for a restaurant in Manhattan, let alone TriBeCa. They need more personality, knowledge of EVERY dish on the menu as well as the specials, ""Sorry sir, I haven't tried it or don't know how it tastes"" isn't acceptable unless you have allergies/vegetarian/vegan or something prohibiting you from eating the food- Some items on the menu have suckered me in but aren't authentic when you come down to it...-- Truffle Naan-- Lobster Tikka Masala / Makhani. Tikka Masala isn't Indian and neither is lobster...- My veg only friends continually say their ""Veg"" dishes are just ""Good"" and not stellarHere are the plusses:+ Most of their dishes that they aren't trying too hard at, are fantastic. This includes most of their succulent chicken apps, chicken entrees, shrimp apps and entrees+ Entrees are fairly priced and not as expensive as you'd think+ The decor, bathrooms, booths, tables, and bar are all gorgeous. Ample seating and walking spaces don't make you feel cramped at all. There's a second level as well as incredibly high ceilings for both so you have no sense of being cramped whatsoever+ Parking is ample nearby, both street as well as garage+ Decent wine list as well as beer list+ The owner is almost ALWAYS there every time I visit+ Their rices and biryanis are fabulous and well doneTHIS has been a review by Gaurav",1,1,0,Gaurav P.,"New York, NY",486,512,2436

The non-foods:(1) service is superb, staff is attentive and friendly without being too up in your grilll - if even a bit formal(2) the lighting... i feel like i'm a movie star about to be found out in the window by a casual pap passing by, maybe this is more a function of how Tamarind compares to my usual go to spots (generally not in TriBeCa and not where movie stars chill) but the swank is palpable(3) Management seem to ""know"" aunt and uncle who visit  NYC & accordingly Tamarind maybe every 6-9 months, this is charming - very welcoming without being over the top.The foods!(1) RAJ-KACHORI (app) 4/5chick pea patty with the most deliciouss *tamarind* sauce - perfect as a light bite b/w 3 people, nice veg option too.

4.0,3/17/2015,"Going into the evening, the only thing I really knew about Indian food is that rednecks hate it.  As a recovering redneck myself (I go to weekly meetings), I was somewhat ""curry-ous"" and snuck some tums tablets in my pocket just in case.  However, I was amazed at the depth of flavor every dish delivered in a beautifully classic setting.Pros:1. Portion size - Come hungry, or split the entrée.  We had to get an Uber SUV to get all the leftovers home.2. Wine selection - Reasonably priced with a good selection. Plenty of room for the white to chill next to your table versus sweating it out on the table.3. Menu options - Good descriptions of the dishes4. Food! (See below) Cons:1. Service was not top-notch.  We sat staring at the dessert menu for nearly 20 minutes before finally flagging down our server to take our order.  We suspect that they were understaffed, for he was always busy and waiting on other tables.  Servers were not rude and were always helpful and knowledgeable, just not readily available. Ordered1. Prawns - Probably our least favorite dish.  Tasted slightly over-cooked and the flavors were somewhat mild.  The prawns were a little on the small side, like they have been skipping carbs for a few weeks.2. Duck burrito - This thing was huge, and definitely meant to share.  The pastry dough was really flakey, like that friend that always wants to ""meet up sometime for coffee."" 3. Lamb in creamy onion sauce - It was fantastic, and the sauce made the dish.  However, I had to knife and fork the lamb, and was not as tender as I was expecting a braised dish to be.4. Halibut - It wins awards for a reason.  Moist (still hate that word), perfect color and texture and seasoned to perfection.  Not overly complex, but still wonderful (like an episode of Friends)5. Vegetable rice - Rice with vegetables. Hard to get too descriptive with this one.  6. Broccoli and cheese Non - Think of it as the best tasting shovel you have ever put in your mouth.  7. Dessert with moose - Rich.  Very rich.  Like just got hit by Donald Tump's limo rich.  Overall - Put this one on your restaurant bucket list, even if your name is Dale and you have a tattoo of a number on one arm (HS football or NASCAR) and a beer company logo on the other.",2,1,1,Brett P.,"Dallas, TX",36,46,0

5.0,3/14/2015,"My co-worker recommended Indian food after a long, seemingly endless night of work. Needless to say, this idea did not sit well with me. After countless back and forth offers and counteroffers (for venue), we consulted with other employees who gave their input for places to try. After 30 minutes of intensive debate in a team room, I reluctantly agreed, and set off on our journey for Indian food - at Tamarind.(Disclaimer: Now, as Yelpers, you can see (or should know) that I rarely, if ever, hand out 5 star reviews but when I do ... you can guarantee something was right with the restaurant!)As we approached the restaurant, my eyes shifted from end to end, pondering the level of Tamarind on a Yelp scale. I opted to Yelp first, Google second. W-O-W. Tamarind was a former Michelin Star holder, a highly rated restaurant on Yelp, and from the looks of the packed patrons, long queue of hungry food go-ers, and interior (employees and decor) - this was going to be an amazing venue.The service was phenomenal. My colleague and I decided that, since we were in the 'Big Time,' it would only be appropriate for the two fellas to go 'all out.' Our food (in the order they came out) went from.....Chicken nan - fluffy, light, and filled with chicken, these delectable delights came with a side of Indian 'goat cheese'? Nevertheless, delicious!Tamarind scallops - pan-seared, turmeric, garam masala, poppy seeds, lemon juice - these had a bit of a kick but were ab-so-LUTELY perfect. From the cooking technique, to the quality itself. Wow.Nizami keema - ground lamb, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, lemon zest, and nan pao! This dish was beautiful crafted, and held a tantalizing dance once consumed. Delicious.The main entree, tamarind mix grill! Comprised of lamb chops, shrimp, tandoori chicken, tulsi kabab, Punjabi tikhe, and black lentils. The dish also came with additional, hot and fluffy nan. After consuming the amount of nan, and the delicious preceding dishes - I almost tapped out!..... ALMOST.All in all, this restaurant is definitely in a worthy league of a Michelin Star.

5.0,3/11/2015,"Allow me to say that every 5 star review is spot on. I cannot say enough good things to anyone that asks.... Tamarind delivers on so many levels. First let me explain, Tamarind is a formally Michelin star rated restaurant that serves Indian food. Now before you poo poo Indian, let it be known that this is Indian food that is made extraordinarily well. I have heard, from some Indian friends, that there are some homemade meals that taste better at home. But that is a far cry away for anyone who was not raised on the stuff. So allow me to start the telling, so you can do the knowing... The place is decorated like a Michelin restaurant ought to be. The table cloth's white and the lighting just so. The service is also amazing. Every whim is taken care of and I just can't add to the praises here.  I had the goat vindaloo, and I can easily say that its probably the best I have ever had.   But the thing I will leave you with as a must try is the BATAKI KOSHA!!! So good so amazing... I wished they had sent 10 of them. Overall I won't drone on and on about the food. I am sure its all as good as these reviews say, I've experienced that first hand.

So when we heard about Tamarind and its reputation, we were obviously very intrigued. We always enjoy fine dining and have high expectations from establishments such as Tamarind. We went here a couple of months ago and thoroughly enjoyed our experience. It is definitely one of the better Indian restaurants in the city. A very nice contemporary atmosphere, with plenty of space and comfortability. The service was exceptional. You really felt like you were at a Michelin starred restaurant. As for the food, it is beyond delicious! I specifically remember the complimentary ricotta puffs served as an amuse bouche. My mouth still waters at the thought of their Nizami Keema. Perfectly spiced ground lamb atop a soft nan pao. So worth it. I also recall ordering the Murg Malai Kabab which was soft and succulent. We're all big fans of lamb chops and test them out wherever we go. So naturally we ordered the Masaledar chops, which were deliciously marinated and tender. For entrees, all I can honestly remember is the Punjabi Mutton and Garlic Naan. The Punjabi Mutton had great, tender pieces, cooked properly and spicy gravy. The garlic naan is a must!

5.0,2/9/2015,"Beauty abounds as you look around the vast multi-level dining room:  a sleek marble bar, wood floors, tastefully lovely art, and Versailles-worthy silk curtains framing floor-to-ceiling windows granting a grand view upon the buzz of Tribeca.  There's an understated luxury and opulence here that takes a while to sink in, in part because the sheer size of the place creates a quiet, almost serene vibe at the tables, which are spaced far enough apart to discourage sharing (unlike the elbow-to-elbow eating at most Manhattan foodie destinations).The food is nearly as bewitching as the surroundings.  After a warm hot cloth was offered, an amuse bouche of green pea and ricotta puff pastry arrived, small flaky bites tasty and mild, setting the stage for spicier and more robust dishes to follow.  Next came the Dahi Aloo Poori, an intriguing and flavorful chaat with a plethora of large, light wheat puffs, and chunks of chickpea and potato bathed in minty yogurt.   As a sidekick we tried the spicy tamarind scallops, plump and moist with a dusting of garam masala and poppy seeds and a smear of pureed green chilis.  The heat hit my quite happily about three seconds after I took each bite.For the main part of our meal - meat and vegetables - we went ""traditional"" with the half tandoori chicken, and less so with the Hara Bhara Kebab, two huge spheres of finely pureed spinach, baked firm and filled with slightly dry but delicious paneer and flecked with a bit of red chili to deliver a subtle note of spice.  The spinach dish was visually dissonant from the rest of the meal (the two green balls sat side by side on the plate, with no garnish of any kind) but was completely enchanting, perhaps in part because of the surprise factor.  The chicken was unconscionably moist with a complex flavor and aroma delivered by the right balance of spices (garlic, ginger, turmeric, coriander, etc.)  We devoured an obligatory basket of garlic naan to clear our palate for dessert, or so we said.  Though we didn't really have digestive room to spare, we were grateful to sample the traditional rice pudding, a sweet and aromatic cinnamon, raisin, and heavy cream extravaganza.The only slight disappointment of the evening was the waiter, who didn't add much insight even amidst a flurry of questions.  My favorite was his response when asked to differentiate two chicken dishes that sounded quite different on the menu:  ""one has bones, and one doesn't.""",3,0,2,Derek W.,"New York, NY",67,178,3
5.0,2/8/2015,What a fantastic experience. This has to be one of the best Indian places in the world in culture feel and food.  The appetizer of cauliflower in red sauce was exquisite.  The batter was light and fluffy and the cauliflower was crunchy with no oily aftertaste.  The prawns were large and firm and the hot sauce was just the right heat to liven things up.  The lamb curry was a generous portion with the intensity of spices being just about right....although I do like a hot curry.  Service was superb and worthy of the reputation of the place.  Knowledgeable and informative in all respects as well as friendly but not overbearing.  All staff were super attentive and made us feel at homeWill be back for more!,2,0,0,Marios D.,"Manhattan, NY",196,509,822

4.0,1/24/2015,"Walking into Tamarind I felt my eyes grow big with delight it is a truly beautiful restaurant very upscale and fancy pants from the beautiful spacious dining area to the lovely indulgent touch of warm towels at the table to clean your hands.My dining companions and I where seated at  lovely round table in the middle of the dining room. To start we ordered drinks lychee daiquiris and they where delicious along with a complimentary amuse. For apps we ordered and shared chimbori jalwa  a spicy crab meat seasoned with curry and chiles it was just right ,bhoj puri samosas a potato and spice infused bite with several chutneys for dipping pleasure, and kolambi pola prawns they where so delicious ! For entrees I decided on Chicken Tikka Masala. I've had this dish many times in the restaurants however I wanted to taste how it was done in a fancy restaurant it was definitely much more subtle than any other Chicken tikka masala I've eaten the chicken was moist and tender and the tomato based sauce had the flavor of fresh tomatoes ,I would have liked a bit more spice,Lamb Vindalo was very tender with a lovely amount of heat  ,and Tandoori Champ spiced lamb chops cooked in the tandoor , I did not try these but my friend said they tasted divine. The servers came and place the food from the various dishes on our plates very fancy!  We also ordered Basmati Rice ,and Lemon Rice ,Cucumber Raita, and various Naan. I got the Afghani Naan as it had raisins ,nuts,and a honey glaze. I was so excited to try it and I was not disappointed it was amazing to dip that whimsical naan into the the masala sauce my mouth waters at the taste memory !

5.0,1/11/2015,"Tamarind was my first time eating at a michelin starred restaurant, and it fulfilled all my hopes and dreams.  I came here for lunch with a big group to celebrate a marriage.  The restaurant is HUGE and gorgeous: extravagant but elegant.  We settled in, washed our hands with the warm towels they passed out (wonderful on a cold day), and ordered a bottle of champagne.  Next, the waiters brought out an amuse bouche.  I'm not sure what it was, but oh my goodness, it was so good.  That one bite may have been the best bite of the whole meal.The lunch prix fixe at Tamarind is very reasonable.  For $25, you get an appetizer, choice of 2 entrees (small portions of each, but not as small as you'd expect!), and dessert.  It's nice that you get to choose 2 entrees and try more things.  Most of our party went with the prix fixe, but I actually ordered something off the menu, which I felt had more interesting vegetarian options.  After a long debate, I chose.. something.  I can't remember what it was called, and unfortunately it doesn't seem to be listed on their online menu!  It had some sort of indian squash (that I'd never seen before), coconut, and curry leaves, I believe.  It was amazing, unlike anything I've had before.  So flavorful with just the right amount of heat.  The meal also came with naan that was dusted with cinnamon-- unexpected, but good-- and the ""vegetable of the day"", which was some sort of bean, tomato, and potato concoction.  These really helped to round out the meal.I didn't order dessert, but I tried both of the prix fixe options from my neighbors:  pistachio ice cream, and a bread pudding that basically tasted like french toast (which is a good thing, of course).  Everyone was stuffed, which can be hard to achieve at nice restaurants.  Great food and great value.",2,0,1,Elissa W.,"New York, NY",351,90,38

4.0,1/6/2015,"4.5 stars.Yes. This place is great, amazing, fantastic. Before I get into details, let me tell you how this place is different than many (not all!) other Indian restaurants around town:1. Beautiful ambiance, upscale atmosphere, relaxed and spacious2. Great quality ingredients3. Fresh and light - maybe the healthiest Indian cuisine around. Doesn't drag you down, and is much less heavy (read: oily/creamy/fatty) than many other places4. Very willing to accommodate requests and customizationsWe had reservations for 4 on a Saturday evening around 7:30 pm. I would say the place was at least 3/4 full and remained that way throughout the duration of the evening. At first we were seated downstairs at a table, but we requested to be transferred to a private booth and they let us (albeit a bit hesitatingly). The booth was amazing and I would highly recommend sitting there.Our waters were filled immediately and a complimentary fried spinach and cheese puff pastry was given to us. These were good and very light/non-oily for being fried. It's not something I would actively order, but was pleasantly surprised by these.Almost all of their chicken dishes use white meat, which is awesome. Punjabi Mutton - bone-in, baby goat in a cardamom sauce. The person who ordered this said it was the best Indian dish she's ever had (and Indian has been a staple in her diet for many years). It was also her first time trying goat (which is surprising because she's an incredibly adventurous eater), but she absolutely loved it.Milagu Curry - Chicken with an onion, tomato and coconut sauce, curry leaves, ginger, garlic. This was very flavorful, not spicy at all, but still very layered in taste. Definitely try this if you want flavor without heat.Murg Kolhapuri - Fiery Maharashtrian chicken, whole spices, peppercorns. Now I was told this was an 6 out of 10 in spice level naturally. I asked for it extra spicy. The dish was delicious, but not spicy at all. I mean literally. Two out of the four at our table do not tolerate spice well at all and when they tried it, they said they'd feel comfortable eating the entire dish themselves. I brought this to the attention of my waiter and he said ok I'll bring you the hottest sauce we have. He said it was the sauce they used for their vindaloo. Once again, completely not spicy. That's probably the biggest flaw of this place - that they have no concept of a proper spice scale. That being said, it wasn't much of a problem because the flavors were great and the dish was still a success.Malai Halibut - Halibut flavored with mace, cardamom, coconut, ginger sauce. This dish is different than the others because it's a filet of halibut (very generous portion might I add) on top of a very thin layer of sauce. It's not a curry, it's not soaked in sauce, it's just a plate of fish with a mild accent of sauce. The fish was cooked perfectly, and the flavor with the hint of sauce underneath was great. This is probably the lightest of all four of the dishes.Onion Naan - was a huge fan of this! The onions are baked right into the naan, which is very unusual. I generally prefer garlic naan over onion naan, but this was the best onion naan I've had.Laccha Paratha - this is a whole wheat, multi-layered bread, which is denser than a naan, but still thin. We asked for this without butter brushed on top and they didn't mind. This was a great addition to the meal and a nice variation from the naan. I thought it was great and would absolutely get it again. They also have a mint version as well.They also have the largest and most interesting dessert menu I've ever seen at an Indian restaurant. I can't remember exactly what our table got, but it was something similar to a warm carrot cake with an exotic ice cream pairing. I didn't try it, but the rest of my table raved about it saying they didn't think it could possibly work when they first read it on the menu.Definitely try this place for a nice occasion!",1,0,1,Laura P.,"Manhattan, NY",4,342,0

I visited during restaurant week, and dined there during lunch. I had the Taar Korma, which was lamb in a coconut and tomato sauce, and it just melted in your mouth.

4.0,11/10/2014,"My prior lunch review of Tamarind was more than enough to raise eyebrows from several experts of Indian cuisine [1], followed shortly by a promise to return for dinner, where I would not be cluelessly ordering from the menu. Thus, reservations for an early Friday evening dinner were set, and my two dining companions and I were promptly led to the second floor of the dining room once we'd all arrived.The selection of dishes was (thankfully) not in my hands this time, so the shared plates were quickly decided on and confirmed with our waiter. A starting amuse of a puffed pastry with a yogurt dipping sauce was a promising, well-spiced bite, a perfect segue to our two appetizers. The Bhel Poori was one of the more creative plates, composed of assorted fried noodles and crisps held together by a variety of chutneys. It was a successful take on a street food that originated near the beaches of Bombay, incorporating a variety of textures and balanced the savory and sweet flavors surprisingly well. I have to say my preference went with the Nizami Keema, however, an appetizer that plated a mixture of ground lamb and various spices (cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and lemon zest) on a circular Nan Pao, a voluminous doughy-pancake.From our entrees, the Lamb Vindaloo was a clear stand-out. Although portioned as a smaller entree, the chunks of lamb and roasted potatoes were perfectly paired with the vindaloo sauce, which only increased on spice with each passing bite. The protein was tender, not too gamey, and the additional orders of basmati rice and naan were much appreciated to make good use of the sauce. Our table also had an order of an off-menu vegetarian dish, which I believe was an Aloo Fry, consisting of lightly fried potatoes with a variety of spices and herbs.The desserts aren't the feature of the menu, but an order of the Kulfi, a dense, milky iteration of ice cream, makes for a solid ending bite. If you're seeking some respite from the fiery bites from earlier, an order of the Mango Lassi to accompany your meal might make for a better solution, however.It's a little disappoining to see Tamarind off the 2015 list of Michelin stars, as the mix of traditional ""fine dining"" cuisines and ethnic cuisines has stayed rather stagnant. Regardless of what a group of unnamed inspectors think, Tamarind does a commendable job of taking Indian cuisine and serving it in a white tablecloth environment, all without compromising the integrity of the original dishes.--[1] Please see: Srini V. and Atif I.",14,5,10,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827
4.0,11/9/2014,"Very good celebratory dinner here last night.We were 8 people and appreciated being seated at a round table near the windowed tandoor room -- fun to watch the cooks thread long skewers and roast kebabs in the deep clay ovens.The restaurant is large, spacious, upscale and airy, with double-height ceilings where the second-level seating doesn't extend. Comfortable cushioned chairs and a not-too-loud noise level.Nice cocktail selection; I had a good, spicy tamarind margarita. Given the size of our party, we opted to dine family style and worked out a selection of appetizers and mains for the table with our knowledgeable waiter.The quality of the food was very good overall - subtle spicing, skillful cooking and quality ingredients. Especially delicious: for apps - tamarind scallops, dahi aloo poori and a special of lamb brochettes; among mains - masaledar lamb chops from the tandoor, malai halibut (the delicate, snow-white fish redolent with mace, cardamom, coconut & ginger), chicken ""murg kolhapuri"", okra ""bhindi do piaza"" and ivy gourd ""tindora poriyal"".Service was solicitous, helpful and unobtrusive, with what turned out to be good recommendations concerning dishes and quantities. The servers walked around the table and dished out food for each diner, which was much more efficient (and effective re: portioning) than having all the dishes simply placed on the table for us to take from.Only issue we had was that some of the food arrived just tepid - a shame given how much better it would have been piping hot. Also, given the prices (each veg dish is $20, and mains top out at $40), it's irritating to be charged extra for rice ($6) and naan ($5 each).Tab for a very filling feast came to around $110/pp, with a round of cocktails and beer with dinner plus two shared desserts (just OK) -- pricey yes, but in line with ambiance, service and quality at this level.",1,0,0,J.

I felt like Tamarind toned all of that down a bit to not overwhelm the clientele, but by dialing it back I think they lost the authenticity of the food.Don't get me wrong, the meats were cooked perfectly, but the spices, the sauces, the flavor were too manipulated.

We thoroughly enjoyed the service, the fresh naan made around the clock, the classic dishes and the fine dine interpretations of Indian influenced flavors.We came for a late lunch on a Friday and enjoyed a window booth to ourselves. Thankfully the window was nicely subtly dressed as the view included construction equipment and workers on the street. In any case the interior decor prominently displayed birds of paradise so it was a pretty distraction.I ordered off the executive lunch menu - soup of the day (spicy vegetable puree) for appetizer, chicken and paneer for the choose 2 entree served with seasoned rice and dill naan, and the mango rice pudding for dessert.  We also shared samosas and their crab appetizer. My husband had a lamb curry for his entree.Let me start by saying that 3 appetizers for 2 people is absolutely ambitious, but we finished most of it!  We ordered the crab because we enjoyed the appetizer preparation we had during resto week and wanted to experience it again.  It really is remarkable that they are able to maintain the wonderful flavor and texture of crab because most restos use canned or frozen and you can tell.  We ordered the samosas because it is a favorite and also we were curious about what a Michelin samosa might be like - well friends, the secret was in the detail of the wrapper, flaky and light.  The filling and sauces were as to be expected.  I ended up enjoying the soup even more in combo with the samosa as the soup was too spicy hot for me.  As for the entrees, I enjoyed the lamb dish the most. The chicken came with a sweet and sour sauce on the side that was reminiscent of Chinese fast food. The paneer was firm toothsome and well made, but I wish the sauce was more flavorful to make up for the blank slate cheese.  The rice was deelish as was the carrot and pea vegetable. I ended up using the vegie side as the sauce to eat the chicken and cheese with the rice.  The naan was wonderfully buttery and the dill gave it a lovely character.  I think next time, I will order an entree that I am familiar with or ask more questions. I would have been just as happy with chicken tikka masala and saag paneer for my entree rather than sweet and sour chicken and low flavor profile paneer in sauce.Tamarind's mango rice pudding was tasty and typical.Overall, we enjoyed our visit to Tamarind! I will definitely continue to try to bring friends and family to enjoy this Michelin starred Indian restaurant.",1,0,0,Siu L.,"Maplewood, NJ",78,87,407
5.0,9/18/2014,"I love Indian food, and have gone to my fair share of restaurants. But, oddly enough, I had yet to visit Tamarind. Well, I finally made it, better late than never, right? So, I was off to experience Tamarind in TriBeCa as part of my Michelin Challenge.You enter into a grand space, open, airy, light and pretty magnificent. There's plenty of space in between tables, which, is pretty uncharacteristic of NYC dining rooms with space always being an issue. There's also a wall of booth seating, almost like individual cabanas.The service here is impeccable, and no detail is left off. You're brought an amuse bouche, we received an Onion Fritter (with green chutney). This was delicious, and unlike the name might infer, it was not greasy or heavy at all. It was light, soft, with pieces of of sweet onion throughout. The chutney was a perfect compliment as well, adding a slight bit of heat to the mild and sweet fritter.They offer a prix fixe lunch menu for just $25, which, is a total steal with the amount of food you receive and the quality. For my appetizer, I ordered the Kashmiri Salad (apple, celery, mix greens, walnuts, mustard-vinaigrette dressing). This was such an amazing salad, and I was pleasantly surprised at the generous portion (the plate in the photo is huge, for the record). The apples were fresh, tart, and thickly cut. All of the flavors went really nicely together here, and, the mustard-vinaigrette dressing was a great contrast to the sweetness of the other components.For your entree, you choose two main items. I chose Kasundi Macher (salmon in tandoor, yogurt, kasundi mustard, tandoori spices) and Kaddhu Ke Kofte (green squash, chili, gram flour, roasted onions, creamy tomato sauce). These. Were. Both. Amazing. The salmon was soft, juicy, and topped with a hot mustard, giving it a very unique and dynamic flavor. The Kaddhu Ke Kofte, similar to a hush puppy consistency, was really delicious. Similar to the Onion Fritter, this was substantial, but not overly heavy or greasy. And the sauce was incredible, spicy and savory, and I used it to mix in with the rice you also get. For the table, you also receive Naan and the vegetable of the day, which was Chickpeas and Potatoes. The naan was like a dream, pillowy and soft. And the vegetables were served similar to a stew, in a sort of vegetable gravy, a little bit sweet, a little savory, and very tasty.Lastly, for dessert, I ordered the Mango Rice Pudding. I really loved this, it was different from any other rice pudding I've had before. It's served hot, and almost more of a thick soup consistency versus the more congealed version. The rice is tender and almost melts in your mouth, and the the creamy mango flavor really comes through nicely.",5,1,1,Katherine S.,"Manhattan, NY",160,257,919

4.0,9/9/2014,"A Michelin star at an Indian restaurant is definitely a step up from a Michelin star at a Chinese restaurant (ahem Lan Sheng) at least in terms of decor. I came with a group of engineers and we were definitely the most under-dressed party of the night. Getting a table is fairly easy. We made a reservation for 7 on OpenTable and there were many time slots open.My Indian friend ordered family style for us, so we were able to try a variety of dishes, all of which were well-liked by the group. To start off we were served a complimentary appetizer of puff pastry with a tomato, ricotta filling, plus other ingredients I didn't catch as the waiter listed them out. The puffs for some reason also had a taste of apples which made for an interesting flavor profile.Appetizers:Dahi Aloo Puri - This reminds me of papri chaat. Basically consists of wheat crisps, chickpeas, and potatoes covered in yogurt and a tangy tamarind chutney. I'm not sure how authentic it was, but I thought it was a nice appetizer/sanck to start as it made me more hungry.Aloo Tikkiyas - Consists of a potato patty, like mashed potato cakes but better because of the flavorful Indian spices.Veg Samosas -  crispy skin, potato-filled with delicious chutneys. no better or worse than any other samosa I've had Non-Veg EntreesShrimp Caldin - The large pieces of shrimp were marinated in a delicious coconut curry sauce. The flavors of this dish were very well conceived. I wouldn't have guessed this was an Indian dish if I wasn't in an Indian restaurant. Punjabi Tikhe Kabab - I've always liked the veg Indian dishes better than meat ones, and this attests to that. The chicken was on the dry side and despite the description of being marinated in yogurt, roasted whole spices, jalapenos, ginger, garlic, I didn't get too many of those flavors. It did taste on the healthier, less fatty side though.Dal Makhni - I normally would not have ordered this given dal seems to be one of the more common dishes served in Indian restaurants, but I'm glad my friend did. Really robust flavor. Definitely a high end dal.Paneer Lababdar - I'm a big fan of paneer dishes, so it's a given I would like this one. Very similar to this dish called Paneer Bhurji, except in the Bhurji the paneer is shredded instead of in chunks.  I've had in other Indian restaurants, except a little lighter in flavor.Basket of Naan - Our basket consisted of the nan e tamarind (Bread filled with dry fruits, nuts, raisins), pudina parantha (Mint flavored oven-baked bread, butter glaze), garlic naan. Definitely the most interesting naan I have tasted. I loved the herbed mint parantha the best. The tamarind naan had an interesting sweet taste to it. All of the dishes are all rather small in size, so don't hesitate to order more, but you can also supplement it by ordering more of their delicious naan or a bowl of rice.",5,2,3,Jocelyn K.,"Jersey City, NJ",479,885,4955
4.0,9/5/2014,"On recommendation from a friend (and because it was participating in Restaurant Week), my sister and I decided to visit Tamarind for lunch. For $25, we were each able to try an appetizer, two half-sized entrees, and a dessert. We each ordered different items to try as much of the special Restaurant Week menu as possible. For appetizers, we tried the Koli Anjappar (chicken croquets) and the Chemmen Uttapham (a savory pancake that had peppers and onions). The chicken croquets were moist and perfectly seasoned on their own. The pancakes kind of reminded us of Chinese scallion pancakes. Each paired well with their respective chutneys.For the entrees, we tried Dhaniwal Korma (chicken), Tawa Machli (swordfish), Tandoori Lal Maas (lamb), and Paneer Balchau (cheese). The entrees were also served with rice, naan, and a vegetarian kidney bean and potato side dish. Among the entrees, we liked the chicken and paneer best. The chicken, though a bit on the drier side, was tasty and just the right degree of salty. The paneer's texture reminded me of pan-fried firm tofu. I was a bit surprised at first that the sauce was sweet, but I did enjoy it. While we typically don't like the gamey taste of lamb, this one was well seasoned and actually palatable, though a bit too salty. Ditto for the swordfish. We probably would not have been able to finish full-sized versions of the lamb or swordfish entrees. We both loved the naan. It was freshly made, soft and smelled buttery. For dessert, we tried the Mango and Ginger Kulfi (a frozen dessert) and Payasam (rice pudding). The Kulfi was delicious! It was sweet, rich and gingery. The Payasam was sweet and more simple in flavor. On the service: Except for almost forgetting to bring us the naan, they did have quite detail-oriented service. Between courses, the server changed our plates, and when refilling our water, he covered the side of the cup so that we wouldn't get splashed. Side note about the restrooms, they were individual bathrooms and to our surprise, they actually smelled pleasant, kind of like a warm, creamy coconut. The paper towels they had in the bathroom were also super fancy. TL;DR Flavorful food; detail-oriented service; surprisingly pleasant smelling bathrooms.",1,0,0,Diana W.,"New York, NY",1,2,0

The owner was doing the rounds, speaking to patrons.

5.0,8/17/2014,"Wow. Easily the best meal I've had in awhile.

The shrimp in a coconut sauce appetizer (I can't remember the name) was so amazing that we ordered the sauce on the side for our main course, and one of my coworkers is trying to track down the recipe online (ha). The chicken tandoori was delicious (and you can watch the cook make it on an oven visible at the back of the restaurant) and the chicken tikka had the right amount of kick to it. But their real crown jewel here is the seafood. Not really normal Indian fare, but they cook the fish excellently well with good sauces, so it works. The sea bass in the seafood platter was cooked to perfection. The halibut entree was my favorite of them all.

2.0,8/12/2014,"I was very excited to try Tamarind, and in the end pretty let down. Service was passable, if not a little annoying; too many explanations and up sells. Too many mentions of the Michelin star that they don't deserve. I ordered two specials, a chicken tikka appetizer and a shrimp entree. The chicken was way over cooked. I ate one piece and saved the rest for my dog. The only flavor in the shrimp was freezer burn, and it too was over cooked. My wife had a vegetarian platter that was underwhelming. All in, with two entrees, one app, some rice and naan, and no alcohol, we spent $160. I would have much preferred some generic Indian takeout for $40.",1,0,0,Alexander S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,14,19
4.0,8/11/2014,"Between the food and the service, I didn't necessarily find anything about Tamarind to be particularly worthy of a Michelin star, but this was a great pick for Restaurant Week lunch that I'm extremely glad I made nonetheless. A paltry $25 earns lunchgoers their choice of appetizer, TWO entrees, and dessert, accompanied by an amuse bouche, naan, coconut basmati rice, and a vegetable side dish, making this not only one of the most affordable Michelin experiences out there, but also a fantastic lunch deal that could easily satisfy a modest appetite for an entire day. I opted for the following dishes:Tarbooz salad: small portion that consisted primarily of watermelon much to my surprise, but it paired unexpectedly and delightfully well with the crispy slices of grilled paneer. Reminded me of a classic watermelon and ricotta salad, but with an Indian twist. Light, refreshing, and very creative starter, but if you have a huge appetite, go for the lentil cakes, which are hearty, plump, and served two apiece.Tandoori swordfish: unfortunately, a tandoori oven is probably too hot for cooking a delicate fish, since this was overcooked and had a rather dreadful stringy texture. However, the zesty tandoori spices and accoutrement of mint chutney worked wonders to mask any misgivings of the fish. It also paired really well with the second entree I ordered -Bharwal kerala: a petite bitter gourd halved lengthwise and pan seared, stuffed with a potato/shiitake/onion/pepper hash, perched atop a mound of tomato sauce (much like a tikka masala sauce) and drizzled with yogurt. Bitter gourd tends to have a polarizing effect (I happen to love it), but this one was earthy and cooked perfectly - not bitter at all. The potato stuffing was a bit greasy, but it was super delicious nevertheless. I probably wouldn't recommend this if you've never tried bitter melon, but I thought this was a wildly creative and delicious dish.Payasam (rice pudding dessert): this was more of a condensed milk pudding in terms of both flavor and texture rather than a rice pudding. Though not what I was expecting, its warmth and richness made it a satisfyingly homey way to end the meal.The rice and vegetable dish (peas and potatoes) were fine, but the naan was exemplary and nothing short of the best I've ever had. With raised edges like a pizza crust, it was crisp in the center, but fluffy, soft, and lusciously pillowy around the edges. The entire bottom of the naan was extremely crispy and charred without tasting burnt at all.Service was spotty (when I asked for descriptions of the entrees, the waiter exasperatedly snapped, ""you can read the descriptions right here, they're pretty clear - no?"") and all in all, the food was just about as tasty as what you'd encounter at your favorite neighborhood Indian restaurant. Still, the diverse menu and the creativity and unexpectedness of the dishes made this one of my top picks for Restaurant Week.",0,0,0,Cam Y.,"San Francisco, CA",365,115,275

4.0,7/15/2014,"Wife, visiting parents, and I sat down here on the July 4th weekend. Still unclear if this is their permanent spot or if they are moving back to the flatiron district. But in any event, my thoughts on this come with the following disclaimers. We are vegetarian. My parents are from India and I have visited India 10 times at various lengths. I grew up with our staple diet being a South Indian diet so slightly varied from the majority of the dishes on the menu. Overall, this was a very fine establishment with good food and good ambiance. It is worthy of their Michelin star rating and my review below is from a place of knowledge. First off - the decor is very elegant and a healthy change of pace than the typical 28th and Lex Curry Hill taxi stand type restaurants. When you end up spending upwards of 200 dollars for a meal, you might want a little atmosphere to align. We had the cauliflower appetizer which translates to a manchurian style fried dish. I think this was a special but it is traditionally one of my must haves. It did not disappoint and a table of 4 can easily split one dish. We also ordered a yogurt based rice chex mix appetizer with mint chutney and other flavors. I say chex mix for the non-Indians in the room. It more aptly can be characterized as crunchy stuff in yogurt with sweet and spicy flavors. As for main courses: The saag paneer (spinach and cheese) was good. The bread was excellent for the main. We ordered about 3 main dishes, rice and a bread basket and all was good. The mixed vegetable korma (navarathan curry) was very good and not overly spiced with cloves which is the way it should be. Some Indian restaurants go nuts with cloves which ends up making your nose burn. For dessert, we had the gulab jamun which are cinnamon liquid infused fried dough balls. They came out warm which is a must and the consistency was average. Not too soft and maybe a touch too hard. The perfect ones are moist but not soft. Its a nuance that most restaurants dont get perfectly right because they dont make them fresh that day. This place was good, not great for these.",1,0,0,Rohith N.,"New York, NY",3,20,0

It is a high end Indian restaurant with silver cutlery, plates, etc., and very well maintained tables and good services by waiters.Rating 3 stars due to the food quality. Went there with really high expectations for food! The chefs definitely have great potential to improve. Also, they have very less options in vegetarian section. The drink monsoon which was custumized was too sweet. Bhel poori was of decent quality and I left most part of my main course, veg thali as the taste was odd of all curries except saag paneer. Also, my hubby who ordered lamb curry couldn't finish it and he said he tasted better lamb curries in NYC. It felt they used good quality veggies, paneer and other ingredient but then the ones who make, seem to have no patience & interest as the taste is no where near Indian! And, really hope they were not trying Americanize Indian food. At the end, however, we ordered herbal chai and passion fruit cheese cake which were the only good stuff for the day of all that we ordered and the only ones we were really happy ordering.

Despite the swanky interior of the restaurant, and the artfully plated food, the flavors coming from the dishes are so rich and full... I was craving lamb, and decided on the milagu curry. The combination of the onion, ginger, tomato, coconut, garlic and curry well accompanied the tenderly braised pieces of lamb. I had my dish served along with a side of steamed vegetables (vs rice), and that made for a nice meal. While I expected it to be light, I was left quite full afterward... despite the portion. (The portion was perfect; some might call it modest, but I thought it was exactly right.) In all honesty, I could not entertain the idea of having dessert, but we were brought some complimentary sweets after our meal.I wish I could've tasted more, but with a couple of martinis in the system, I couldn't do it.

And even without a  reservation, we were seated immediately on a busy Saturday night. You can always expect the staff at Tamarind to be in close proximity to attend to your needs. On this particular occasion, Mr. Walia (the owner) came over and had a friendly chat with us.  Which was really awesome and made us feel more relaxed.  As  our evening progressed it only got better! I was really wowed by my cauliflower appetizer (which I highly recommend) and my friend's bhel poori which was beautifully presented and equally delicious. It even made a Facebook status post with lots of likes and comments!   In the middle of my dinner, which I must say I was perfectly happy with, I was unexpectedly approached by Mr. Walia who noticed that I wasn't really enjoying my dish- And offered to change it to something else that he thought I would like better.  I was  completely caught off guard by this sentiment.  I mean I didn't  even  realized that I was giving off cues that I  was dissatisfied with my dish!  Anyway, I was very impressed with Mr. Walia's perceptual skills and happier with my second dish. It was  wonderful to know that someone will take such measures to ensure that I was enjoying my food and having a great experience.Needless to say I left a very happy customer that night:)Tamarind is a place that I will always be coming back to-for the exceptional  food and outstanding service in a beautiful setting.

I have always liked the food here so I was surprised with my experience here this time. For drinks, my friend and boyfriend ordered the sweet lassi and my friend's boyfriend ordered the tamarind margarita (which I tasted and was quite good!). I and my friend are vegetarian and the boys eat meat, so we both ordered the spinach and watermelon salad for our appetizer and the boys ordered the kebabs. Our salads tasted more like an amouse bouche than an actual appetizers - it was just watermelon with a few spinach leaves. The guys loved their kebabs and said they would be happy if their entire meal consisted just of plates of kebabs.For the main course, given my dietary restrictions, they could only make the potli baigan (so they gave me two servings of it). The food was cold when I got it, it was bland (What! Blasphemy, its Indian food!) and very greasy. I was very disappointed with the quality of the meal. This is supposed to be a fine dining place; I understand that restaurant week means you offer a discount on meals. I don't understand why that has to translate into subpar food. Restaurant week is supposed to be a marketing tool, to get people to come to your restaurant again. If this was the first time that I came here, after this experience I would never return again.For the desserts, since I couldn't eat it I got the halwa for my boyfriend and he ordered the mango shrikhand. The halwa was good but the shrikhand which is yogurt based dessert is supposed to be thick in consistency.

Chef Avta WaliaTamarind deserves 3 to 3.5 stars in my book.  For a Michelin rated restaurant, I expected better service and the quality of food could of been better for the price.  I actually prefer Junoon over Tamarind.  Tamarind didn't give me such a lasting impression from the minute that I walked in.  The venue itself is spacious, well lit with high ceilings.  Nothing unique to the restaurant that stands out as an Indian restaurant.  We were greeted to our own private booth with hot hand towels, which was nice, but after that the service was just beyond slow from our waiter.  He seemed out of it the whole time just standing there, not seeing that we needed some help, or that we needed the bill.  For the amount of people that were in the restaurant, I don't think it is an excuse to be even slow and barely refill our water throughout our entire luncheon.  I felt like I had to chase down someone to pay attention to us!Otherwise, we decided to do the executive lunch which is $25 a person with one appetizer, 2 entrees, naan, vegetable side, rice, and dessert.  The entrees are not big at all for your information.  If you order chicken, it will come in 2 pieces of chicken, or 2 pieces of salmon cubes for example.  Ordered:Amuse Bouche: Fried eggplant with mint chutney.  (Not a fan of eggplant!)1. Pudina Ghosht- this lamb appetizer was DELICIOUS and full of flavor! It was great with the apricots and mint chutney that accompanied with it!2. Crab Nazakat-  the crab was very fresh and was eaten in an unique way with the cups.3. Murgh Kali Mirch- seasoned chicken that was a bit too dry for my taste.  You can really taste the blackpepper that they seasoned it with though.4. Taar Korma- It tasted like stewed lamb.  Probably one of my least favorites.5. Nizami Machli Tikka- the salmon was one of my favorites.  The texture was very well cooked with the sauce. 6. Methi Paneer- Paneer to me always seemed a bit bland to me.  It feels like tofu but good nonetheless.Dessert: Mango Shrikand and Khubani Halwa.  I wasn't really a fan of any of the desserts that they offered.  If anything the mango pudding/soup still wins while the apricot tasted nutty and weird to me.It was a nice change to go all the way to tribeca to check out Tamarind but not great enough for me to make that long trek!!",5,1,0,Kathy D.,"Sunnyvale, CA",2136,1124,541

Halibut and lamb chops were outstanding, as was the prawn special. I did nit taste the lamb dishes. Alcohol - the ginger & pepper martini and tamarind margarita were very good.

There was glitch in the meal, we had a party of 7, one of our guests was not served for a full ten minutes after the other 6. This always gives you an awkward moment, when you don't know if you should wait or start. We ended up getting another plate and sharing.

4.0,2/15/2014,"We came to Tamarind for a Friday night date night.  We started off with a Tamarind Margarita, which is essentially a normal margarita with some juice and tamarind.  I agree with other Yelpers that it is a pretty solid drink, albeit a bit unusual.We got an appetizer of the Tamarind Scallops -- this was possibly one of the best things I've eaten in a while.  The scallops were perfectly cooked and exploded with flavor.  If you're going to get an appetizer, make it the scallops.  We both got the chicken tikka masala as an entree.  The chicken was nicely done and the sauce was very flavorful--it was probably in the top 5 chicken tikka dishes I've tried.  However, I recommend trying something on the menu that is more unique because I felt like it was a bit of a cop-out to get such a typical and popular dish.The service was always very prompt and professional.  Even though it was a busy Friday night, we never felt rushed and had a great meal.",0,0,0,Matt M.,"Manhattan, NY",62,322,18

A friend and I had a few drinks and decided to order some sandwiches to go afterward. At the time, Tamarind had a take-away section located right next door to the main restaurant. So...as we approached the host to discuss their take out options, the gentleman just looked blankly at us without ever smiling or providing a greeting. The exchange or lack there of was very awkward, bordering on pathetic actually. As we proceeded to inquire about menu options at that time, the host continued on in his unwelcoming manner, as his responses were  very curt.  In fact, there was an arrogance to him that just wasn't befitting to Tamarind or any restaurant for that matter.  Its quite vexing that restaurants would hire such people like this when they have no idea how to provide service to customers.

The meat was  more like ""pulled lamb"", but not broken up, that was left for us to do.   We had the lemon rice, and laccha paratha  as sides.

And is that how you spell the prince of persia's name?).  This year she chose to celebrate turning a teenager here, we've got loads of hormonal intrigue yet to enjoy.  The waiter didn't have a clue what he was doing - I lived in Asia for 12 years, my wife's family has Indian roots, and we have travelled extensively in India. But when we asked for clarification on some dishes he read the menu to us......interesting that one would expect to explain to a waiter that I learned to read 50 years ago. He told us we got 3 pieces of tikka per portion and 2 kebabs, yet these were main courses and we got substantially more....after over an hour's wait.  And the proffered mango lassi was, subject to reminder, somewhat later in arriving.  Thus the various oversized starters, late as they were, and after a polite reminder, were cold and dry.  Absolutely disgusting. When they asked whether we liked it I explained that the food was dry and awful.  In fairness I had lot's of people milling around and lots of friendly, albeit unwanted, claps on the back, and we even got a free second helping of sheik kebab.....whilst much better, ie hot and tasty, my daughter's 13th birthday had been ruined.  we decided not to order mains and left.  In fairness we were only charged for wine ( her siblings are 23 and 21) and the lassi!!!!!!!!

4.0,12/10/2013,"It's easy to forget the exceptional dining experiences living in New York City, easy to forget why I chose to make a Yelp account in the first place. In the midst of all my finals stress, I remembered why--thanks to the finger-licking leftovers left from last night's dinner at Tamarind. I review in order to keep a journal of my epicurean adventures, in a city where I'm too broke to afford to eat out on the daily and too busy to maintain my daily sustenance. But on the rare occasion that I get treated to a fine dining experience, boy, do I take advantage of it. I came to Tamarind with a party of seven at 8:30 on a Monday night. The restaurant was fairly empty, and to that I can thank the phenomenal service and attendance from the various waiters. They checked my coat, pulled out my chair for me, and even folded my napkin while I left to the restroom. They gave us the option of eating family style and spooned the dishes on each plates before setting it in the middle of the table.I was told by my waitress that the chef specialized in seafood, so I ordered the lobster masala (hollaaa the most expensive item on the menu!!!). To preface the meal, we each ordered appetizers and drinks, which all came out in a timely manner. My review on them as follows: DRINKS:- Pomegranate Bellini: Great drink to start off your meal with! Solid.- Tamarind Margarita: FAVORITE drink. Very unique flavor--the tamarind almost makes it taste a bit savory, and it has a spicy kick that warms the back of your throat. Good palate cleanser. - Mango Margarita: I wasn't a huge fan of their use of mango pulp, which made taste of vodka come out a little too strong. (the waitress did offer to take it back to the bar to fix)APPETIZERS:- Tofah E Zameen: Yam kabobs with a cocktail-like red sauce, one of their more popular appetizers. Not a huge fan..a pass in my opinion. - Bataki Kosha: Deep fried duck hand rolls with a tangerine chutney. I wasn't a huge fan of the cooking method, I'd rather not eat something so fried and heavy before my meal. Reminded me of an Indian fusion eggroll.SIDES:- Palak Paneer- Bland. Not worth ordering...just look at all the other amazing sides they have to offer!- Channa Masala- Hints of spices and citrus. So many layers of flavor, so delicious if you like chickpeas!- Wild Mushroom and Truffle Oil Naan- I was intrigued by how luxurious this dish sounded; but in truth, I would go with their original Naan bread. This one was speckled in little pieces of mushroom and the truffle oil was very aromatic, but I found it to be much less fluffy than the plain version and the truffle oil was a bit too pungent and took away from the flavors of the actual dishes when eaten together. MAIN DISH:- Lobster Masala: Succulent meat, perfectly cooked and seasoned. SO. GOOD. - Punjabi Tikhe Kabab: Basically, tandoori chicken kabobs. Not a fan, the meat was very dry.",0,0,0,Phoebe T.,"Orange, CA",101,13,28
4.0,12/8/2013,"This restaurant is beautifully appointed, with discreet, well-proportioned spaces for groups of diners and soft, tasteful touches that are the hallmark of the modern luxury restaurant. Coming on a Saturday night, at 9pm, we found a full house, and as we waited for our reserved table to become available, hung out at the bar, where we met with a few glitches from the otherwise impeccable staff. When seated, we found a menu that was pretty diverse and despite a clear focus on catering to the Western style of eating and thus seem more upscale (that is, a meal that is not shared), our server was happy to help us find many dishes that our party of five could share, which I appreciated- perhaps this flexibility is inherent in the cuisine in any case? That meant, however, avoiding the appetizers, but nonetheless, we had a feast. We enjoyed several curries, tandoori'd chicken and prawns, several kinds of naan, roti and paratha (they call it parantha) and a well-flavored, gem-studded goat briyani. The Goan fish curry was redolent with the fragrance of coconut milk and had a hidden kick to it. The Punjabi tandoori teekh chicken seemed to fall apart a bit too easily, but had good flavor to it. Chicken tikka masala went down very well, although it's a dish that's very hard to do badly. The curry vegetables, Sindh Kahri, were unfortunately so uninteresting to the party that we didn't notice that we had half a pot left of it at the end of the meal!

4.0,11/25/2013,"I came here last Friday for a birthday dinner. Although I am rating this 4 stars, really I'm rounding up from 3.5 stars. The food here was fairly good. I came with a large group so we shared in appetizers and entrees. For appetizers, we had the kashmiri tikki (beetroot patties), tafah e zameen (yam kebabs), chimbori jalwa (crab), kolambi pola (prawns), and bhojpuri samosa. For entrees, we had the sufiani machli (sea bass), raan e dumpukht (lamb shank), pastooni murgh (chicken in Kashmiri sauce), nargisi kofta (cheese dumplings) and bhagarey baigan (Japanese eggplant). We also had the spinach and garlic rice, the Afghan nan, and the truffle nan. The prevailing opinion was our meat and seafood dishes were underseasoned while our vegetarian dishes were well seasoned. I am Indian so maybe that colored my view, but some of the food needed more spice. I will say this -- despite the underseasoning, we did enjoy the meat and seafood dishes, to an extent, due to the soft texture. The meat came apart easily - it appears the cook must have marinated the lamb, chicken, and sea bass for days. If I were to return, however, I will be sure to request these dishes to be a bit spicier. After all, it is Indian food. The one notable exception to the above was the prawn appetizer, which had a sauce I really wish I could have licked off the plate. I highly recommend this dish. The nans and rice were also very good. The drinks were okay - my old fashioned was a bit watered down. My sister was unimpressed with the lychee daiquiri but my friend really enjoyed the ginger and pepper martini.

5.0,8/23/2013,"#Tamarind. I may be wrong but isn't this one of the restaurants from the 'Real Actors Read Real Yelp Reviews' skits on You Tube. I believe it was the London location, but not positive. (youtube.com/watch?v=aaSC…) Regardless, five stars Tamarind. The place is absolutely exquisitely decorated inside and may be one of the more larger restaurants in NYC. As soon as you step into this restaurant, you are greeted and immediately sat with someone asking you which type of water you prefer. My hubs to be was running a bit late, so since payback's a bitch, I enjoyed some sparkling water at his expense and checked at some of the Yelp reviews. *** That sparkling water was $8, just an fyi. Also, why do I do that? We share $$ at this point. D'oh.The amuse bouche that came next was magnifique. A large bite of a perfectly spiced fritter with a yogurt dipping sauce. If this was any indication of the meal to come, this was going to be a great meal, and it was. We started with the curry crab app and holy crap one needs to get this if you eat crab. This was a solid mound of fresh crab. I absolutely voted this as the MVP of the dinner and at that point, the entrees had yet to come! I went with the shrimp caldin, which per the menu refers it to ""a Goan specialty."" Prawns in coconut sauce with mustard seeds, cumin, curry leaves and coriander. This was 'da bomb. It was literally the perfect amount of spice from that curry, but not over powering at all, and these shrimps were huuuuuuuuuggggggggeeeeeee. Like biggest prawns this gal has ever eaten huge. I'd order this dish 12 more times if I could. My man went vegetarian style and ordered up dum aloo gobi, potatoes and cauliflower simmered in an onion tomato sauce. He enjoyed it very much and since I couldn't take my mouth off my meal, I only had a quick bite, veggies never tasted so good.We ended up sharing the eggplant in the peanut sauce as well, though this ended up being way too much food. The eggplant however was delicious, definitely ""mushy"" but I mean, unless you're allergic, how can you not love a good peanut sauce, and this was one of the best. I don't necessarily think I'd want to horde this dish since that peanut sauce was intense but if you're with a group and willing to share, definitely include this player in the roster. All this plus an order of naan which we barely touched was amazing, I can't complain about one thing. We passed on bringing the leftovers home but did decide to try some dessert. I'm a chocolate fiend. I see chocolate, I eat chocolate. I was in the bathroom, and the man ordered some sort of dried fruit cake, and I came out and was all like excuse me? Then the dessert** came out and I was all like, AMAZING. Dessert at an Indian restaurant isn't my top priority, but after this one, I may need to rethink my strategy.Service was top notch and we felt that with the amount, the quality and level of food and the combination of ambiance and service, this restaurant was a bargain. I definitely recommend and I definitely would come again!** The dessert we had isn't listed on the online menu sadly so I can't recall but it consisted of a variety of fruits/veggies like carrots, beets, all in a perfectly sweetened cake.",15,9,10,Stephanie Y.,"Berkeley, CA",4999,1763,3377

4.0,8/17/2013,"The beautiful, light interior with soft creams and off-whites makes you feel like you're stepping into a lavish bridal shop. Alas, this is a restaurant - and a really good Indian place at that.The host showed us to an intimate room in the back with small 2-person tables. Throughout the evening, the service was quick and attentive to our needs. However, the sommelier seemed a bit aloof and didn't understand that, yes, we only wanted one wine bottle for the whole meal.As expected, the lights dimmed every half hour. By the time it was 9PM, there was basically only candlelight and a dim light from the backlights.Now on to the food:Appetizer: You must try the Murg Malova - amazing mildly spicy chicken marinated in apple cider vinegar. Kind of sweet and sour. The portion is enough for two people.Entrees: *Ask your waiter to bring out extra green chilies and onions if you want it spicy... because the two entrees I had and sampled definitely needed some kick.The chicken in the Pastooni Murgh is OUT OF THIS WORLD. By far, one of the best grilled chicken I've ever had in my life. The sauce is interesting, yet a little bland. However, you can definitely taste the pistachios and saffron.The gravy on the Pudine Aur Hare Pyaz Ke Tikke was a little TOO sweet. The green sauce is creamy and went very well with the warm naan. This entree was drastically smaller portion-wise compared to the Pastooni Murgh.Only con to the whole evening was the lack of spice and heat on the entrees.",1,0,1,Kasey D.,"Manhattan, NY",40,74,64

3.0,8/10/2013,"""Take it easy""  And so I did: 3.5 starsI was having a really nice dinner with some friends. Why to keep bothering with my request for spicy food  if it was not welcome. I wasn't really that important, however, I don't think our server's attitude and response was right. When I returned a dish supposedly medium spicy that didn't have any heat at all, I got the dish back (just medium spicy in my opinion) and the following comment from our server: ""take it easy""... just to summarize. In the two occasions I had the pleasure to eat Tamarind's food at TriBeCa I was really not thrilled by the service. Don't get me wrong. It is absolutely correct but it didn't went beyond that for me. Except for the manager who grabbed my hand last year to escort me downstairs because of an injured leg. Chapeau! to him . An extra star. And no, I am not expecting that all the time, obviously. But just something in between. Leaving the incident on a side, I have to say Tamarind's food is incredibly good. Besides the ethnicity it belongs to, Tamarind is a true exhibition of tasty ingredients cooked to perfection. Add to this that it seems to be pretty authentic and voila. Warranted and worth success. On my recent visit I clearly remember a couple of things that got me right away. First, the chicken. Extremely tasty,  juicy and tender. Second, the lamb, even when using meat form a quite grown animal, it was tender and flavorful as well. It is also worth to mention that sauces and spices add of course a burst of flavor and fragrances but I am talking about tasty meat by itself. Perfectly seasoned and flavorful, besides the spices that add no other than the ethnicity flavor. I loved it, all of them. For appetizers I have try a few. I can't recall all of them but I clearly remember I like them all. Let me tell you about one, the one I can't forget: Tofah e Zameen consisting in Yam kabobs with paneer, potatoes and mace and cardamon spices. Just remember, texture and cardamon, and spice that may be too strong for certain palates but if you like it you will enjoy this dish very much. It is absolutely delicious. Besides the spices I also loved the texture of the yam kebabs. Somehow I thought about tamales, just for you to have an idea. Finally, the spicy dish on question that I requested was Shahi paneer. Paneer is like cottage cheese and Shahi paneer is a way to cook it in a thick gravy of tomatoes, cream and spices. The flavors were bold just as Tamarind knows but I was caught on the paneer texture, firm yet smooth, and by the fact that you can taste the milky flavor behind the spices. Lovely dish. Better when I got it spicy. It was wonderful because the heat contrasted with the mild tomato and milky flavor predominant on the dish given by the paneer and the creamy gravy. I really liked the contradiction. More spicy maybe wouldn't have been this enjoyable... but I will not know. Regardless, that is not the point anyways. The seating is trendy and elegant and to me will fit many different situations, from business meals, to friends together, to dates to family celebrations. It is spacious and so you will feel quite intimate. Of course I am planning to return. It would be my lost to miss Tamarind's food over something that has an easy remedy. Next time I request my dish to be spicy I will just tell them to relax, I really can tell by myself what I can tolerate or not. And come on, it is just spicy food . Take it easy",5,5,5,Laura A.,"Brooklyn, NY",232,344,1232
2.0,8/8/2013,"Terrible. The waiter spilled a full glass of water on me. Nobody really seemed to care beyond an initial apology. I mean c'mon, at least the manager should come over and apologize as I'm sitting there sopping wet...We had the RW lunch menu. Started off with a bean salad amuse bouche. The soup of the day was pumpkin, which I found a bit watery. The sun-dried prawns were decent. For mains, between the two of us we tried the chicken (good), lamb (texture was way too loose), vegetables (rather tasteless sauce), and paneer (no comment since I didn't try). The falooda dessert was definitely interesting, but I was not a fan at all of the sweet potato pudding. This was probably the first dessert I did not want to finish.I liked the spiciness that was pervasive throughout the course.

The appetizer I chose was grilled shrimp with a spicy red sauce. Lovely. The entrees were chicken with spices in a thin wrap and bitter gourd topped with Indian cheese (paneer) crumble. The entrees came with an eggplant and potato baked dish in a generous serving and garlic naan. After all this, I should have passed on the dessert, but, why not?

3.0,7/9/2013,"So I feel about Tamarind the way I kind of feel about the likes of Tao and Rosa Mexicano... sometimes ethnic food just tastes better when it's cheap.Don't get me wrong - Tamarind has excellent food - but I can't help feeling that the food would taste just as good served simply in a little copper tureen, eaten with one's hands, with a string of tacky Christmas lights overhead. Does placing my Tandoori Chicken on a heavy white plate with a curry leaf and an arabesque of cranberry sauce in the corner really elevate this dish to a $25 menu item? Decidedly no.Tamarind Tribeca has a corporate feel - two levels of seating, big tables, white tablecloths. The menu is as long as any other Indian joint... I was hoping for a cleaner, pared down menu, but it rambles on for like 4 pages of appetizers, your poultry, your lamb, your seafood, etc. All the entrees look very, very similar.I honestly can't remember what we ate... There was some scallop dish as an appetizer. A deep-fried duck / rice crepe appetizer was a fail. For the mains we tried the sea bass special and some murgh chicken dish... There may have been okra involved? All I clearly remember was a truly fantastic Afghani naan that was covered in honey and nuts.The menu was unfocused and the food was laden with so many ingredients that nothing really shone through, or stayed in one's memory. For desserts we unwisely experimented with some ... fennel dessert or something that tasted like I was eating aloe. The service was also a lackluster, with our waiter failing to explain the dishes as they arrived at the table, and a busboy that seemed extremely, extremely nervous.So fine, my review is biased towards the fact that I like my Indian cheap, and I feel that if Tamarind endeavors to be ""fine dining"" I should see less similarities in the dishes between this restaurant and a hideaway on Curry Lane.",1,1,0,Alice L.,"Manhattan, NY",89,173,0

Kalmino Patio (shrimp app) -- if you like shrimp, you can't really go wrong with thisWhile I thought it was solid, I would not recommend the green plantains marinated with mango for the main.The complimentary appetizer they brought was amazing, and the desserts (flan and sorbet)  were really excellent.  I'm not the biggest fan of flan, but this was the best i've ever had.I'm shocked it wasn't busier for lunch to be honest - it has to be one of the best deals in the city",0,0,2,John K.,"Alexandria, VA",1,103,0

No need fo a knife the meat fell effortlessly off the bone covered in a spicy brown gravy and topped with well done fried onions. It was amazing!

We failed to mention that but I suppose they should have some common sense when they see her to seat her at ground level and near the rest rooms. Instead they gave us a table on the first floor near the service entrance.The food we ordered were all below average. Nowhere close to the quality you will expect in a highly acclaimed restaurant. I seriously doubt if reviewers who rate the food high are Indians or knowledgable on Indian food. The Kulfi ice cream had lot of ice crystals, the ocra fry very sticky and cold, the naans charred on one side and half baked at some places. The service was ok. But when we ordered a bottle of wine and it tasted very sour, we had to discuss it for a long time with the waiter and then later the manager or sommelier who came and started advising one of us, who is experienced with wines, instead of just changing the bottle. This guy also later tried to make up unprofessionally for it by saying he tasted it and indeed it was sour, we were right and he would have done more had he been told it was a wedding party - which we clearly mentioned when we reserved.

5.0,3/19/2013,"Tamarind still ranks as the best Indian restaurant in all of NYC, in my book.  Although the style of the food clearly embellishes upon combinations of Western foods, the food is still authentic Indian food, regardless.  (Been to India before, so trust me.)They've changed the recipes up here a bit, and I love it. The Aloo Tikki, my favorite appetizer, is different from the tiny stack of 3 that I am used to having at the 22nd Street venue.  The Aloo Tikki here is more like one artful round mini-cake, with a consistency that resembles mashed potatoes.  But the change is a wonderful.  I am a huge fan.  Way to change a perfect dish and still keep it wonderful.I also highly recommend two dishes: the Murgh Mali Kabab, paired with the New Zealand Sauvingon Blanc (make sure it's the New Zealand, and not the other) and the Hyderabadi Ghazala paired with the California Merlot (hints of deep chocolate in this wine).  I normally would never recommend a Merlot, but the chocolate overtones in this wine make it an absolute delight to drink with any lamb, truly.If you have to wait a while before getting your table, I highly recommend you sit at the bar and try the Ginger & Pepper Martini.  It's superb.

If you are looking for spice they can adjust the heat to accommodate both fiery tastebuds and mild-peace loving ones.Make sure you listen to the specials and take the advice of your server as he somehow miraculously knows what will make your belly happy.The portions are HUGE, like one entree and an extra side of rice can feed 2-3 easily so it's a great spot to go to and pick at each others plates.

What was consistent was a modern  and creative take on some classic dishes. highlights were yam kebabs, prawns, fried paneer, savory crepes, murg malova, scallops, etc. Heck even the naan was excellent with those beautiful, slightly burnt air bubbles.A lot of time, this level of innovation comes short with deserts and many times in Indian restaurants they are too heavy, but not so here. Mango cheesecake was a nicely minimalist finish for the palate. one of our deserts however was so frozen couldn't even hack it for a while...All in all a great experience and look forward to going there again.",1,0,0,Jhost H.,"New York, NY",2,25,1

They were both really good, the crab meat salad was really meaty and delicious.For main courses we had the Hyderabadi ghazala (lamb) and my favorite, chicken tikka masala. They were both delicious and the sauces were great to dip the naan in. For dessert we had the goat cheese creme brulee which was really good and unexpected.So why 4 stars? The price.

I feels like you are in a modern version of a mini Taj Mahal, with beautiful Tribecca soaring ceilings, gorgeous eye pleasing marble tile on the walls and enough space that you can have a human scale conversation with your guests without turning up the decibel level in the entire place. I actually had the good fortune of visiting their second location for a private party about a year ago and found the Tribecca restaurant even nicer that the one in the Flatiron district location. But enough about the environment, the food is outstanding, delicately seasoned, the meat dishes are tender and nicely complement each other on the plate.

5.0,10/10/2012,"Certain types of cuisine I am partial to the mom and pop shops to get my authentic fix. Indian is one of those types of cuisine. I decided to go bougie though and give some fancy Indian food a try and boy, was I surprised. Tamarind knows how to elevate Indian food to another level and it was a truly amazing meal.As soon as you walk into the restaurant, the space is beautiful. It is one of those grand Tribeca restaurants and something really special. Service is friendly enough and we started with an amuse bouche of a pumpkin bread that was perfectly crispy with a nice tangy yogurt chili dip. To start we tried out three appetizers, the cauliflower fritter special, the chimbori jalwa (Crabmeat with Madras curry powder, ginger, garlic, green chilies and scallions) and the bataki kosha (Duck with mustard, onion, garlic, ginger and garam masala, hand rolled in a rice crepe with black salt and tangerine chutney). The cauliflower was so flavorful with a sweet and spicy sauce while still retaining the texture and freshness of the vegetable. The duck crepe was fried and also full of flavor. It was perfectly seasoned and not overpowered by the seasonings or fried crepe. Finally the favorite was the crabmeat tower. The crab was super fresh and the herbs and seasonings actually brightened the flavor of the crab rather than make it heavier. It was light yet filling at the same time. For the entrees, we had the lobster masala and the special tandoor chicken dish. The tandoor chicken was so moist and juicy and had a nice tang from the yogurt and seasonings. The lobster masala was a bit heavy but still nice and a good sized portion with big chunks of lobster. We had some plain nan as well as afghani nan (Honey-glazed bread with dry fruits, nuts, raisins and dried milk). The afghani nan was a huge surprise. It was the best nan I have ever had and the honey glaze was perfect on it. I could eat a whole serving of that on my own. I would actually love to have that warm for breakfast with a nice cup of milk tea or coffee. *mouth watering as I think about it*Overall, it was an amazing dining experience and one of the best Indian meals I have ever had.

Try the chili crab appetizer, the purri bread and my husband's lamb curry dish was out of sight! Oh, and the flour less chocolate cake was delightful as well!

We used up every last drop of the sauce with our delicious Wild Mushroom and Truffle Oil (!!!) naan, Also good was the Chicken Biriyani - the most tender and perfectly cooked chicken I have ever tasted. The Kofta was a bit overwhelmed by the cheese balls, though the tender dumplings that comprised a minority of the dish were perfectly cooked. Everything was well-complemented by the lemon rice we ordered, though i'd be interested to try the coconut tomato rice as well.The desserts, like the sweet cottage cheese balls (""their specialty,"" according to the waiter) were not exactly up my alley and I would not order them again.  After that, we had tea, perfectly steeped individually brewed pots of loose leaf.  We had a very early dinner - around 6pm on the dot - but the service was phenomenal.  From the moment the maitre d' stepped outside to help us find the restaurant to the perfect timing of the waiter's inquiries and the water boy's refill stops, the service was absolutely phenomenal and I hope to come here soon - perhaps with my mom who will foot the $190 bill again!",0,0,1,Stacy K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0

My favorite was the cucumber one (I can't recall the name). My favorite part about the bar? The complimentary cashews!!! I think they cook it in curry spices. very tasty with a slight kick. I actually asked if they sold it, but no, they didn't. We were later seated at a booth by the window. Surprisingly, it felt very private even though there was a table next to us. The place was packed but it was not loud at all.The service was spot on. Our waiter kept the water filled and answered our questions about what he recommended. We ordered a lot of dishes to try. The duck roll was good, but nothing mind blowing. same thing with the truffle oil naan. The coconut naan was superb. The seafood was really good too. We ordered prawns and scallops. The sauce on the prawns.... drool***I odered the lamb chops on the menu. It came out looking a bit burned, but it was cooked perfectly. It was moist and juicy. There was also some amazing potato pancake(?) under the lamb. All my friends loved it. For some odd reason 3 of them ordered the chicken marsala... Which tasted like any other marsala at other Indian places. DONT GET IT. We also had dessert. The goat cheese creme brulee had a slight goat cheese smell to it but was not overpowering and not too sweet. Overall a really great place and definitely one of the best Indian places I've been to.

5.0,7/8/2012,"We went to Tamarind this last week while in NY on a food based vacation and were highly impressed.  I had been looking for a restaurant to take our hosts out to and when ABC Kitchen was booked, I found this place. Thank god for ABC being so popular, because this place was fucking delicious. First off, if you go to a Indian restaurant with a Michelin Star, don't order Chicken Tikka Masala like you would at any run of the mill Indian place. 1) it is more English than Indian, and 2) this place has so many unique items not seen on the menus at mom and pop places.  I say this because one of the people at our table ordered it, and although it was great, compared to the overwhelming taste of awesome coming from our other dishes, it seemed like the worst pick of the night. For me, the best dish on our table was the Raan E Dumpukht (Lamb shank braised in Indian rum, onions, cashew nuts, saffron and nutmeg).  The portion size was huge, the flavors were insane, and the meat was fall apart tender.  We also got the Morg Kolahpuri (Chicken with star anise, roasted garam masala, ginger, garlic and onions) and the Tandoori Chicken Special.  Both were fantastic. What made them so much different than the chicken dishes I always eat at Indian restaurants was that the chicken was perfectly cooked and juicy. So often, the flavors are spot on, but the meat is overcooked. Not here. I ordered the only vegetarian dish at the table (which is weird because I am a devout member of the Holy Church of Carnivores) and got the Dal Makhni (Black lentils simmered overnight on a slow fire with onions, garlic and ginger).  It tasted amazing, but was one of the smaller portioned dishes on the menu.  Either way, I was happy with my choice in the end.Our overall experience was magnificent. The ambiance is the nicest you will ever see at an Indian restaurant and the food far and away beat out any Indian food I have ever had.  It may not be totally authentic in it's presentation, it may be expensive, and it may not have the normal white glove service you expect from a Michelin Star restaurant, but it was worth every god damn penny!",2,1,1,Brett P.,"Chatsworth, CA",104,183,146
3.0,7/8/2012,"Had a friend visiting from out of town and he knows the Tamarind on 22nd St. so I suggested let's try this one as it was closer to where we were.Pros:- Upscale ambiance- Indian food {what can I say, I'm biased as I'm Indian}Cons:- You don't feel welcomed. Feel very cold feeling from the staff.- My dinner plate felt dirty, wasn't sure if it was scratches from usage or just not good dish washing.With 1 Michelin Star, I wasn't blown away by the flavor of the Indian food. We ordered the Chicken Biryani [asked to replace Goat with Chicken] which was good but the rest of the food didn't exactly blow my mind - Cauliflower starter, Chicken Kolhapuri.[I'm using the English familiar names as the menu of their website is inconsistent with it's use of Hinglish terms all over the menu - murgh / morg / murg / chicken]Basically - There is better tasting Indian food out in the city !!!I would recommend this spot for those looking to impress their dates / families with an upscale Indian restaurant. As the food is okay, but the ambiance is upscale. However, be vary of not feeling to cozy or welcomed.I wouldn't recommend this spot for foodies.",1,0,0,N S.,"Manhattan, NY",4,15,4
4.0,7/7/2012,"It's 4.5*We really liked the food here, the setting is nice if you want to have Indian food in a rather de luxe atmosphere. The plates were always nicely presented and tea is served old butler style in silver pots and the milk comes in a cute tiny silver jug.But back to the food:We had the TAMARIND SCALLOPS and the GALOUTI KABAB (grilled lamb tikkis with 36 aromatic Indian spices) for starter and thereafter CHEMMEN KALWAN (5 Jumbo prawns with spicy red chili, garlic, coriander, cumin and black peppercorns) and HYDERABADI GHAZALA (Slow-roasted lamb in yogurt, mint, black cardamom, bay leaf and garam masala). On the side we chose garlic NAAN and LACCHA PARANTHA plus Basmati rice.Yes, we ordered enough! The meat lover went twice for the lamb and the seafood lover once for the scallops, once the prawns. Everything was really delicious and very flavourful. The PRAWNS were of high quality. You could have just pan-seared them with butter and they would have been outstanding. (But that would be too boring for a chef and no Indian food.) The sauce with the prawns was very good. It reminded me a bit of curries Tamil people cook. It was even a bit spicy that's why I had the impression they keep the food original.The SCALLOPS as well were cooked to perfection and of high quality. Nothing makes me more sad than a chef that kills the seafood a 2nd time (meaning in his pan and overcook it. This usually requires a minute of silence and 2 tiny tears). So big happiness here: tender and juicy scallops and the spices around it were delicious. I got even more exited about the two different types of sauce: they were put on the plate like a street to taste buds paradise. And what was that? There was fried toast..! I do not really eat things I suspect of being rather decoration or filler (put on the plate to fill you because the product is too expensive). However, everything was so convincingly tasty that I tried it and immediately apologized in my mind: it was so good! It was covered with so many spices and I can't believe that I am writing so much about a fried piece of bread - but that piece of bread deserves some tribute ;)The GALOUTI KABAB (lamb) was very flavourful, too. There were 2 patties and the spices were very well balanced. I would recommend this dish for people who want to eat Indian but not plunge into a spice bazaar - and yet it is far from boring. I recommend that dish. Again the consistency was perfect.The HYDERABADI was very very good and I would order that - don't think twice, order it. That's it. Very easy. Order it. :)Both garlic NAAN and LACCHA (flat bread) were really good and we could not decide which one we liked better.The rice was so good I wanted to ask them what brand it was, but I forgot to ask.We ordered a lot (2 starters, 2 entrees, 2 types of bread on the side and basmati rice) however my gut told me that even tough my stomach was at the verge of exploding I had to try dessert. And - thank you gut- it was a good advice. The goat cheese creme brûle was outstanding and I really loved the creamy yet granulous consistency, yummm! 1 creme brûle is enough to share if you had a complete dinner before. We had chai and Assam tea with it, both were good.I will definitely go back and yes, you might be full but you must have dessert here!(If you explode please don't sue me)  :)",0,0,0,Miranda K.

Yes you opened the door on my arrival, you tried to crack a smile when I checked in, but the table service was cold and deeply disinterested.

3.0,5/23/2012,"I have some issues with the overall Tamarind concept (average indian food, service is a bit over the top/snobby, and pretty expensive for what it is), but if you like Tamarind, then the Flatiron location is better. The tribeca location is very spacious and light - perfect for a corporate dinner but not ideal for a date or intimate dinner with friends. I like the dim lighting and lower ceilings in Flatiron - it pairs better with this type of shared plate meal. Also - a note to gluten-free diners - be careful when you order here because many indian dishes contain hing, which is a wheat-based spice. Tell your server and all should be fine - just don't assume that lentils are ok!",2,1,2,Neena L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0

I also tried the CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA, which was very flavorful. WILD MUSHROOM AND TRUFFLE OIL NAN was also very, very good, although it's a bit of a waste when paired with curries that already have such strong flavor. The manager was also super nice and fun to talk to. Overall, decor was nice and food was delicious.I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons:1) Price. As good as the food is, it's still a little too expensive for me.2) My water wasn't filled regularly.

2.0,5/12/2012,"My rating might be a little harsh, because the fact is that the food is quite good. But having that established we can move on to all the other aspects of what a restaurant experience is, because after all, it's not just about how the food tastes. We were quite a large party, and the service was lackluster at best. They had four people running around our table, but only one person willing to do anything. I ordered a vodka tonic (which was very weak by the way) and it was $12. Now for their specialty cocktails, I will accept $12. But for vodka and tonic water... not so much. Then our main dishes came, but without rice. At a cheap Indian place you get all-you-can eat rice. But at Tamarind, where the dishes are twice as expensive, you have to pay $5.50 for rice. That wouldn't have been horrible, but the rice was old and cold. As I mentioned before, the food was quite tasty, though as an overall experience this place is not worth the money. I'd prefer one of those kitchy Indian joints on First Ave over this place any day.",2,2,1,Zach M.,"New York, NY",3,9,0

You don't allow children?  He said, yes our restaurant policy is not to allow children under the age of 5.  I was appalled to learn this - I can maybe even understand for dinner time perhaps but for MOTHER'S DAY BRUNCH to be told you cannot bring your child and then told there are other restaurants in Tribeca you can go to . . .

4.0,3/24/2012,"I went into Tamarind Tribeca expecting not to like this place based on a few of the reviews (the ones in particular that mentioned it serves Americanized Indian food, which to me spells bland). However, I was bowled over and lulled into a state of content by the impeccable service and the beautiful space. The food was also quite good as more subtle flavors actually helped me enjoy the complexity of the dishes. When there's too much going on, as is the case with a lot of Indian food, I don't know what I'm eating (and I say this as an Indian who actually cooks a lot of Indian food at home)!Space (4.5 stars): This location is far more spacious and airy than the Tamarind in Flatiron. There were inevitably older people and folks in suits. But I felt the spot would actually work for a group or a date as there are lovely warm booths where you could slip in with your honey and forget that anyone else is around you. Also, this spot does a great job with keeping the feeling of openness and space while also having warmth from the champagne colored decor and the lighting. Service (5 stars): From the moment you get your hot towels to the end of the meal, you feel well taken care of - the servers were impeccable. My husband - let's call him W - pointed out that the waiters served us food from the right but cleared the plates from the left. I loved the level of detail and thought. When service is too overwhelming, it is usually due to the waitstaff hovering over you and trying to get you to order that pricier bottle of vino; however, at Tamarind, we did not feel pressured but instead just enjoyed all the thoughtfulness.Food (3.5 stars): We felt the food was great but understood that we were in effect influenced by the atmosphere in our enjoyment of the evening - including the food. We actually ordered 2 apps (bataki kosha or duck rollls and bhel puri), 2 entrees (soya kofta and Hyderabadi lamb), the mint paratha, lemon rice and shared a pistachio kulfi for dessert - so we managed to have leftovers. When I tasted the food in my apartment the next day, I wasn't as bowled over. Granted that it was left-over but still.Our favorite was the bhel puri, which took me back to India in its bright flavors. However, it also had cleanliness in its flavors that you don't always get from road side stalls serving it in India. The kulfi was also wonderful - not as gummy as the stuff I get at cheaper Indian spots but still full of what I call the tastes of heaven - pistachio, saffron, cardamom, cream, etc.The duck rolls were decent as per W but the entrees were just average. My soya kofta was a healthier option compared to regular kofta, which is basically deep fried rolls of mashed potatoes and other fillings smothered in a creamy sauce. The soya version included soya nuggets in a spicy tomato broth. Tasty enough but not great. My husband's lamb was good but he's had better versions of lamb.We also had the ginger pepper martini and mango mojito. Both were strong but too sweet for my taste. I haven't found anything that compares to the cocktails at Apotheke to be honest but that's just a personal preference. Many people like sugary libations, which is all good.We would happily go back any time to Tamarind and slowly make our way through their menu.

My halibut special was oddly constructed - the fish was perfectly cooked but paired with an unpleasant lentil/spinach cake and an unsatisfying salad with strawberries, apples, sauteed mushrooms and bitter greens. Just didn't quite work. The other dishes around the table also seemed to be close-but-no-cigar. At these prices, the food needs to keep up with the service and ambiance.

I naively made an OpenTable reservation, but I was the 2nd person in the restaurant, the first party there just 10 seconds before myself.I got the prix fixe lunch, priced at $24 +tax , with Tamarind Chicken appetizer, Paneer Shimla Mirch/Murgh Patiala entrees, and Alphonso Mango Cheesecake dessert. Indian restaurants are usually higher priced than other cuisines, so I was surprised at this price for such a quality restaurant. The chicken in both the appetizer and entrees were very tender and spiced incredibly well. The portion for the entrees were more than enough and dessert was delicious. I was pretty stuffed afterward.Decor is great, a mix between modern and classy. There are several booths where you could have a larger party, though I imagine I'd also use this place for a date if it were dinner.The waitstaff was very attentive, almost too attentive, since I was one of maybe only 2 or 3 tables during my lunch.

Yes the $5 million dollar location is exquisite, but when it's paired with rude management and only so-so food who really cares? If you want a nice evening and some of the best upscale Indian, stick with the original. The award winning halibut at the original is replaced with a dry, blandly spiced version. The fried cauliflower appetizer, with it's perfect combination of sweet and spicy, turned out tasting more like orange chicken from a sleazy Chinese restaurant. All around the fishes were fishy, the veggies were cheaply flavored, and the meats were bland. For getting the food so perfect at the original I don't know how this tribeca offshoot could fail so miserably. Even the garlic nan, which I would think is hard to get wrong came out as a crunchy flat bread dripping with oil.But like I said, poor management.

And they do an amazing job at a lot of things: the service was AMAZING, the ambiance and the space is STUNNING... but one key ingredient was lacking: the food! This was the most bland, watered down Indian food that I have ever had. The flavor and the spice just was not there, and it was not intelligently substituted with anything else. It just came out as fairly bland and well below expectations.Worth a go, as long as your expectations are right.

5.0,12/25/2011,"My dinner at Tamarind was the best Indian food I have ever had!! I've tried really delicious Indian food from other upscale places like Rasika and Bombay Club in DC to the pub food in London and nothing compares to the quality at Tamarind. Personally, the vibe is a little cold for me but it was totally appropriate for my family dinner and would be an ideal place for a business meeting. I might not come with a group of friends but I could still appreciate the sophistication and the sleek, clean decor. To start, we got the crab appetizer and the cauliflower special. The crab dish was plentiful and extremely fresh. It was so good I could have had another one of these to myself!! The cauliflower special had a really delicious, semi-spicy sauce but was over-fried...we all ended up picking most of it off. Probably the one dish we could've done without. For our main course we got the halibut, prawns, lamb, and the cauliflower and potato dish without the cream (I don't like dairy/egg in anything but dessert), and basmati rice and garlic naan. The halibut was AMAZING. My dad says it was the best piece of fish he had ever eaten!! My cauliflower and potato dish was also delicious and well flavored with curry and cumin. I can't speak for the prawns or the lamb but my family said they were also extremely well done and so flavorful. The naan was soft and warm and the perfect accompaniment to all of the entrees. For dessert we got the Indian ice cream (Kulfti?), the goat cheese creme brulee, and the lemon sorbet. I don't know why, but even the lemon sorbet was the best I have ever had!! I didn't try the Kulfti but my mom loved it. I had some of the goat cheese creme brulee which was surprisingly light and also to die for, and I don't even like cheese!! I also cannot say enough about the service. They were impeccable! If you love flavorful food and demand freshness and the highest quality, COME HERE!!

We ordered the ginger martini which was well executed and had the right amount of creativity to it without being over the top.That was followed by paneer akbari which, while innovative sounding, tasted more like a blob of melted cheese without any seasoning. That was followed by  a course of nans and malai kofta, both not even meeting the flavors of the $7.99 all-you-can eat generic Indian restaurants. These culinary dishes, were unfortunately coupled with a very disinterested waitress (who was also bar-tending if i recall) who didn't bother despite telling her than the food was just-ok and was barely nibbled.

Dress yourself up, put on those heels. And yea make sure you have on that bright red lipstick that is a show stopper. The bar is gorgeous, but I don't see myself drinking there. I am a divey girl that just likes heels and red lipstick. We had a reservation for 8:30pm. The place was full of people, but not packed and we were immediately led to our table. The service was interesting. I want to say it is very attentive, but I found myself feeling very dizzy and confused. First, we were given warm towels to wipe our hands. A very nice gesture. Thus far, I have only experienced Japanese restaurants that do that! Then right after, we were asked what kind of water we wanted and very shortly after, the amuse bouche arrived. The waiter also managed to swipe my napkin away so my lap was left naked for awhile. And before I had a chance to breathe, the waiter came by and told us the specials but he was speaking really fast and I didn't know what he said. And then he proceeded to ask me if I wanted anything to drink. I was so discombobulated...Once all the madness stopped, everything turned out great. My tamarind margarita was excellent. And my date was very happy about the Oolong tea. We started off with the tamarind scallops. Excellent dish, fresh and the scallops extremely tender. Large portion size and very fulfiling. My date got the lobster masala and stated, "" good portion size, delicious with a hint of coconut."" I had the Nargisi Kofta, which are dumplings made with cheese and lotus. So good. My favorite Indian dish is malai kofta and this is a ""version"" of kofta and one of the best I have had. It still doesn't beat this place in Boston though...For dessert, we had rasmalai. They are cheese ""pillows"" soaked in milk, sugar, cardamon. So good and rounded out the evening nicely. A great meal all in all, but a bit pricey for Indian.

Unfortunately, the thali is better at Salaam Bombay and much cheaper. Mine at Tamarind was boring. My friend ordered the goat and said it was just ok. The service was weird- no kidding, waiters came by 6 times and lifted the napkin covering our naan to see if it was an empty basket. After the 4th time we were laughing and the by 6th time we were just plain annoyed, though still laughing. We watched alot of food go by- it all looked standard to us. I didn't see anyone who looked thrilled by their plate. Its a very expensive restaurant for what it is- It was $120 for two- no drinks, no desserts.

3.0,4/15/2011,"Upscale Indian in a modern setting befitting its Tribeca location.  Contemporary, spare decor in a spacious, high-ceiling space with a nice mezzanine dining area overlooking the rest of the restaurant.  The volume of space is emphasized because seating areas are scattered apart and can feel isolated.  Its beautiful but cold, and not too comfortable.  Service was attentive but not as polished as would be expected in a place like this, a bit too eager if anything.Squint and the menu might look similar to an Indian restaurant without bells and whistles, but what looks to be classic dishes are often given a twist.  Frankly, it seems ambitious but also highly appealing.  The appetizers we had this meal were the highlights.  First, light, crisp skin on samosas stuffed with a tasty potato filling.  The menu listed pomegranate and potato filling but although curious, I couldn't tell that the former added anything to it.  Pan-seared scallops were plump, perfectly cooked, smooth but with some texture and lightly seared, paired with crackers and a savory sauce. The entrees were less memorable.  A special shrimp dish in a tomato cream sauce was decent but from flavor to texture, nothing exceptional.  The slow roasted lamb (ghazala) was also good but lamb not quite tender enough, flavor not quite interesting enough.  Garlic nan was pretty good, fluffy with crisp edges, gloriously rich garlic smell; only negative was a bit excess oil.  The lemon rice ordered to accompany our entrees was well-prepared enough with a hint of tart.  We ended with a white chocolate-Darjeeling ganache that had a bit of mousse filling, accompanied by pineapple butter cake; the ganache didn't leave any impression but I liked the fluffy butter cake on super thin slices of sweet pineapple.  Cocktails were strong, decent; tried a blood orange cosmo and a grapefruit mojito.I was more impressed with the menu than I was with the actual items, although most everything was at least decent and sometimes quite good.  Still, I'm not sure I can justify returning for food that's only ok at these prices and in a dining space that doesn't appeal to me.",1,0,1,Valery C.,"Forest Hills, NY",56,837,9616

5.0,4/9/2011,"There are a couple of things I look for in a nice restaurant -- 1) Service 2) Ambiance 3) Cuisine 1) The service is EXCELLENT! As soon as I walked in the hostess greeted me and was ready to seat me. The bar area was packed, so I would like to go back and hang out there next time. They have coat check for every guest and attended helped me put on my coat when I was ready to leave. The bathrooms are one-sies but very nice and made me wish I had a set up like that at my place. Just kidding, but its very nice :)2) You can meet friends there, take your clients out, have small family gatherings, or have a romantic night out. A good spot for any event.3) The cuisine is a good mix of fusion, classic, and new age dishes. I went for a classic - Baigan. Nice and spicy. Even I needed a side of raita :) The mushroom and truffle oil naan is something great to try. My date was not digging it as much...He ordered the special of the day - chicken with basil, jalapenos, and some other stuff that I was not sure of! :P He absolutely loved it and picked out a great wine for both of us.Best Dish of the Night - Yam kabobs.

3.0,3/30/2011,"Came here during restaurant week.  Of which I'm starting to grow suspicious of, as I'm never blown away, but I suppose that's a side issue.Between two people we had a different item for each course, so 6 courses.  I remember liking a few and being disinterested in two.  There was a lot of zeal put into presentation which was nice but I remember getting some items and they didn't really match my perception from the menu's description.  One dish had a seed element in it that was like eating a root bulb which I found really distracting from the dish.  Nothing was particularly spicy if that's a big issue for you.Standouts were a lychee ice cream and chicken skewers. The portions were quite substantial too.  And they have a surprisingly good wine list if your wallet feels up to the challenge.Another thing, which seems particularly present at Indian restaurants, are the servers who seem to lurk around you waiting to throw in the napkin on the dish and scoop it away.  I like the vast openness of Tamarind and the cream white everywhere but especially during the day when the place is not crowded it feels awkwardly empty and the preying servers just re-enforce that.  I realize this is a high-end restaurant and they're trying to do a professional job but the place to me needed to be a bit more at ease.If the purpose of Restaurant Week is to be good enough to have you return again it didn't really work entirely for me.  I would be intrigued enough to try the Flatiron Tamarind sometime to compare though.",1,0,0,Matt E.,"New York, NY",30,289,0

4.0,1/11/2011,"I used to hate Indian food as a child. I think it was the appearance of it, or maybe the spiciness, but I wrote it off at a very young age. However, my friend Hannah and I one winter decided to head over to the southwest coast of India, and make our way around the country by train, and I pretty much had to start in on the fare. So obviously, I have no problem with budget Indian restaurants - I certainly ate at some suspect places in certain areas of Rajasthan, but it is always refreshing when I come across an upscale place like Tamarind. It reminds me, in terms of the environment, very much of my favorite Indian place back home in D.C. - The Bombay Club (which anyone from the District will tell you is just awesome). My buddy and I both ordered the dahi aloo pooriI as an appetizer - a delicious concoction of wheat crisp, potato, and chick peas in yogurt and tamarind sauce. I have had this before, but never as good as the Tamarind rendition. Next, I got the Korma platter, which involved large chunks of the reddish chicken on a platter of Indian rice and veggies, and it was perfect. Korma is a little bit harder to get 'right' than other standbys of Indian cuisine (i.e. Tikka Masala) because it lacks the bath of delicious sauce to save it should the flavor be a bit...off. However, this Korma was exceptional, and I made sure the waiter told the chef so, because I can now appreciate a (near) authentic piece of that delicious stuff in New York. We were going to order dessert, I do love some Indian sweets, but on top of the generous portions and the three mango lassis (each) we drank, I decided to pass.

4.0,12/5/2010,"Look, I love Indian food. I love that terrible feeling that one gets a few minutes after finishing eating- that ""oh shit, I'm Batista and that Tikka Masala is Fidel and my stomach is Cuba '59"" feeling. You think you're going to avoid that feeling by eating at this swanky Indian restaurant? Think again. It's inevitable. It's like that Beatles quote: ""and, in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make"". You will enjoy the food just as much as you will suffer afterwards. But what's a little gastrointestinal crisis when you have such wonderful flavors to indulge in? The swank element is in full force at Tamarind. These people want you to fall back in a curry-powered stupor and go ""whoa"". I have been to my fair share of Indian restaurants, and none of them looked like this. Call it ""Nouvelle Cuisine Indian"", or ""New Indian"". It's all white, glass, cool looking people, cocktails and small dinner parties of attractive dudes and dudettes. The noise level was surprisingly acceptable- but we were seated in a booth close to the kitchen and I have the feeling that the wood panels in the booth did some serious insulating.  To the food. There were four of us. I ordered the Bataki Kosha as an appetizer- a duck, ginger and masala rice crepe with a side of tangerine chutney. Delicious. The duck was moist and flavorful, the crepe fried to crispy perfection. My friends had the Tamarin Scallops, which I did not try but which were met with satisfied growls and wide-eyed grins of culinary approval. Next, we had our main courses. These were rather serious portions, and no plate was completely finished. But this was not a judgment on the food. Which was really quite wonderful. I ordered the Kozhi Varuval- chicken in curry leaves, coconut milk, fennel and garam masala. The chicken was one of the most tender and flavorful I have ever eaten. The sauce was delicate and subtle. Definitely not your ""all you can eat"" buffet-style Indian creamfest. My friends had the Kaikaire Estu, a vegetarian dish with eggplant, pumpkin and okra; the Tikka Masala; and the Zameen Doz (Dover sole.) All excellent. The Dover sole, it must be said, was drowned in a sea of curry sauce and definitely not my idea of a ""light meal"". So if you are into light meals, don't go Dover. Then again, what are you doing at an Indian restaurant looking for a light meal?? We had some excellent red wine to go with our meal, two different types of naan- one with mint and the other with rosemary- rice and yoghurt. Overall, fantastic. I am not going with five stars because unfortunately they kept us waiting fifteen minutes in the entrance while they prepared our table- and kept telling us it would only be a few minutes. Our guests were a few minutes late (no more than five) and it seems that we were being penalized for it.Twelve hours later, the Cuban revolution is still raging... but, in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.

5.0,11/27/2010,"For years, Tamarind Grammercy has been among my favorite restaurants; however, I was suspicious of this sister restaurant to open in Tribeca. I expected Americanized, watered down Indian food designed to appeal to Chicken Tikka Masala chompers, not barfee lovers or Jackson Heights explorers. And in my three visits here, I can confirm that, yes, you can find such disappointing dishes, most easily by taking Yelp's pulse or by asking the waiters for the most ""popular"" choices. For example, the crab meat in curry powder is a bland mess of shredded crab; the duck crepe lacks the execution of its French cousin or the bold flavors of its dosa cousin; and the prawns sauteed in coconut and chilies is the poor ripoff of the Shrimp Balchau in Grammercy. And the only dish to be carbon-copied from Grammercy is the Lobster Masala - a choice made with the skill of the villain's faceless henchmen shooting at, and wildly missing, the exposed hero in a bad action film. However, you can have a spectacular meal here by sticking to the following: - Kashmir Tikki: These simple patties roll the richness of paneer and the earthiness of beats into a beautiful velvet package. I love it when friends ask to try a bite - it gives me an excuse to order seconds. - Paneer Akbari - Another essential item - roasted paneer stuffed with raisins and cashews, with cheese melted atop. - Afghani Naan: An improved version of the standard sweet naan you'll find (usually stuffed with raisins), as this is also coated with honey. - Uttapam: Do not order if you are a traditionalist. Lacking the fluffiness and moistness of authentic Uttapam, this version is somewhere in-between uttapam and naan. But it's great! - Apple and Pear Raita: Typical raita, but the added citrus and crunch is a nice touch. - Shahi Paneer: Paneer strips in a rich, complex garam masala sauce. - Lamb shank marinated in rum, cashew nuts and nutmeg: Wonderful and so different, yet the vegetarian accompaniments distract. - Chicken with ginger and chili paste and the Chicken Roulade: Love the sauce coating both entrees. - Desserts: The carrot halva is amazing (not too congealed, not to sweet); though the rest of the desserts are just solid There are many more great dishes I'd recommend depending on what kinds of food you like most, but the simple rule I live by here is to order based on the sauce not on the principal protein/vegetable as the sauce is what best exemplifies the chef's creativity and drives most of the flavor. For those knocking the ambiance, I admit it looks as though it was designed in 2006; but. at least it gives you a feast worthy of such excesses.",0,0,0,A.E. G.,"New York, NY",14,196,0

Went to Tamarind in Tribeca last night with friends for dinner and found a f-ing piece of LATEX glove (the whole rubber fingertip!) in the chicken tikka masala. What's even worse? I discovered it after putting it IN MY MOUTH and chewing on it thinking it was rubbery chicken skin! I did my best not to throw up in my mouth. UGH. You'd think this would be unthinkable at a ""fine-dining place"" like this - but the worst part was not the piece of rubber glove in the food (hey, mistakes happen), but the service (or lack thereof)from the general manager. First of all, most places wouldn't even have the gall to make you pay for your dinner if something this outrageous happened. (Why? because they WANT YOU TO COME BACK AND TELL ALL YOUR FRIENDS HOW THEY WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND TO FIX THE SITUATION!) Alas, the manager here said he would ""take care of it"" and assured me and my friends that he would ""make this right.""  He offered dessert (but REALLY, who wants to eat after something like this happens?!) When he came back with the check, all he'd done was take 25% off the bill - and this only happened after we complained several times that simply taking off the Chicken Tikka Masala off the bill would not do. After calling the general manager over again (and yes, we were being VERY civil) he finally gave us 50% off our bill.  In the end, the sheer lack of service and desire to really, truly ""fix the problem"" ruined our night. We (and all of our friends) will NOT be back. Please, don't waste your time coming here. There are so many better Indian restaurants in this city (ones without sanitation issues)!

4.0,5/16/2010,"A group of us shared the Tamarind Scallops,  Zafrani Murgh Tikka (chicken with saffron), shahi paneer.  The food was all very good, probably better than a lot of Indian I've had in the city, but I'm not sure if it was enough to warrant the super high prices and the small quantities.  Good thing I wasn't that hungry beforehand!The decor was very elegant and classy.  The clientele at dinner was mostly pretty sharply dressed and I did feel a tag underdressed in jeans.  I probably wouldn't go back by myself given that they fall low on the value scale, but I might take out of town guests there (especially if they're paying!)",1,3,2,Michael L.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,161,7
3.0,4/17/2010,"I was a bit surprised when opentable could not get a table at 6:30. I knew it was Friday and all but living up the street from this new place, we decided to stop by around 7. To find the place empty. WTF. It did pick up around 8 though.We walked in right when it started to drizzle. We were led to a two top on the upper level that was claustrophobically positioned against the wall with no view of the lower level area. No thank you. We decided to eat at the bar instead. Apps:  Uttapum (lentil + rice pancake = great), Chimbori Jalwa (crab meat with Madras curry, etc - awesome), Murg Malai Kabab (yogurt marinated chicken - delicious).Mains: Chemmen Halwan (jumbo prawns that unfortunately were small and quite bland) Shahi Paneer (well, paneer... - it was OK), wild mushroom and truffle oil Nan (pretty good).We skipped dessert and left. The place looks really nice. Immediately upon walking in, my first thought was, uh oh - we have a 66 situation (which I miss early days of dearly). I hope Tamarind Tribeca sticks around - the bar is nice to grab a drink at but I might stick to having Indian food delivered from Salaam Bombay on a Sunday night while watching my CBS line up. I am not a fan of places that have dozens of staff members hovering over your area like helicopters. I hate having my drink pulled away from me when I had TWO more sips left! I enjoy my last two sips! Okay?I agree with roderick, as I felt slightly underdressed in a purple hoodie over a t-shirt, jeans and pink sneakers as most people seemed to have thought they were going on a Titanic - black, gold, pearls and all. I missed having music in this place as well as some personality from the staff. You're way downtown now... we're quite relaxed here. Fit in.",12,11,10,Bartholomew K.,"New York, NY",825,192,170
5.0,4/11/2010,"By posting a Private Message (PM) from one of his buddies, Atif I. has broken Yelp regulations, who have determined that it falls outside our Private Message Guidelines.As a valued member of our community, we hope you will continue to provide great reviews, while keeping in mind our Private Message Guidelines. See you on Yelp!Now, on with the review!I was deeply honored when Atif and Srini, the Michael and Sonny Corleone of Yelp, invited me to dinner. When they make you an offer, particularly an offer for fine dining, you cannot refuse. They ask you once and they do not ask you again. Just a simple ""family"" rule. Walking in, I was cheerfully greeted by the manager of Tamarind. At least I think it was the manager, because he was quite well-dressed and went out of his way to greet everyone in his immediate vicinity. Quite the gentleman, I must say. When you first come in, the bar is straight ahead, though at somewhat of an angle. There are two levels for dining, which means there are many tables available. Good thing, because it seemed that every table was booked.  And every customer just oozed ""high class,"" with the exception of this reviewer, of course. Seriously, I doubt anyone else was wearing a hoodie over an Incredible Hulk t-shirt. At the table, you find gold-colored plates with ""Tamarind"" emblazoned onto it. I noticed that the busboys made sure that each plate was facing the right direction, so each customer could make out the plate. The service was just outstanding. Our waiter really made us, or at least me, feel really relaxed, giving us suggestions about what to order, if the dish was too spicy for me, the yogurt he would bring out to help with the spiciness, etc. OHHH and how could I forget about the hot towels they gave us, before we started the meal and right after finishing our meal. I love that kind of service.For appetizers, we had Uttapam, which is a lentil and rice pancake, filled with mushrooms, eggplant, green chiles and coriander. We also had two other appetizers which I cannot, for the life of me, remember. As for entrees, I had the Thikat Kombdi, which is chicken with ginger, spices and chili paste. That was truly delicious, and not too spicy. I mean, I had ten glasses of water but still. I also had the Athirachi Kari, which is lamb in green chiles, onions, coconut, mustard seeds and star anise. This was only my second time eating lamb, and if all lamb is as soft and juicy and delicious as this one, I will be a convert. My only complaint was my drink, a Bloody Orange Cosmopolitan. The fact that it's a Cosmo should have tipped me off, because I'm a dude and what business do I have ordering a girly drink? But it was way too strong for me, like Schwarzenegger-strong. But who cares, when I am surrounded by great food, great service, great ambiance and most of all great company.This was my second-favorite eating experience this year, bar none. My first? The three double-cheeseburgers and chocolate shake from White Castle.Oops, I guess I'm toast - bye rodney.",13,11,12,roderick A.,"Jersey City, NY",187,767,308
5.0,4/11/2010,"I linked the yelp address for Tamarind Tribeca and wrote: ""Here's the place. Only for directions. I am hopeful the rating will go up after our reviews"". ""yes, when I saw it only had two stars, i was worried. but then I remembered who I was going with, and that put my mind at ease.""I had the great pleasure of dining yesterday at the recently opened Tamarind Tribeca with Rod and Srini. Tamarind (Gramercy) is my favorite upscale Indian restaurant, and just the place for a toast to the health of an old yelp friend. I have been a fan since 2002 and have taken quiet satisfaction in Tamarind moving up the ratings and in getting thank you notes from friends for the recommendation. What I LOVE about Tamarind is that they retain the inherent Indian soul of the cuisine while providing an elegant, though understated, ambiance and attentive service.As we waited for our food, Srini pointed out amongst the diners a lady with a hat - I noted that she could pass off as one dressed for the races at Ascot. While Srini has had his reservations about the staff in the Gramercy location (the core team is visible at the new location) - I noted that from the maitre d to the staff, smiles were welcoming and effusive (perhaps from recognition of an old, though irregular customer). The inherent charm of India is embracing diversity and making it part of the cultural fabric. Nowhere was it more apparent than in my specialty cocktail (Srini's recommendation) the Ginger & Pepper martini (Absolut Peppar, ginger, lime) that had notes of spice with the refreshing taste of lime. Though Rod found the blood orange cosmopolitan too strong for his liking, I did think the cocktails had something for everyone, evident from the buzz at the stylish bar and cocktail area.""Where we take you on a culinary journey across India"" is what you read on their website. Truly, India has some magnificent regional cuisines, and Tamarind does really well in executing on Southern, Northern and other regional favorites. This was evident from our appetizers: the Utthapam (lentil and rice pancake - spelled differently), Kachori (flaky patties with lentil and green peas, seasoned with dry mango powder), and the Hyderabadi Nizami Keema (grilled lamb strips and mince - with cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg in a baked nan pao). Our entrees progressively moved up the heat index starting from the Athirachi Kari (lamb simmered in green chillies, onions, coconut, mustard seed, and star anise) to Thikat Kombdi (chicken with ginger and chili paste) to the vegetarian option of Channa masala (garbanzo beans, pomegranate powder, ginger, and tomatoes).This is the one area where I give the most marks to Tamarind in executing flawlessly - they don't dumb down spices in order to attract a more diverse clientele (though they DO guide you on the spice level of a dish). Srini, not fully appreciative of this fact, asked the waiter to make the Channa Masala EXTRA spicy. They delivered. As I noted the dry heat, and warned Rod away from this dish, Srini leaned forward and whispered to me, ""Pardon my Mumbaiya speak, but, G%^# ..."" I believe hearing the dignified Srini mouth a cuss word is reason enough for giving a place five stars! :DDesserts were exceptionally well executed. Rod enjoyed the white chocolate fennel mousse cake, I the Ras Malai (cottage cheese dumplings with saffron and cardamom) and Srini the traditional Kulfi - which finally extinguished the fire in his mouth.So, Tamarind is truly new and improved with a menu larger and more regionally diverse than that in the Gramercy location, new drinks and desserts, and plusher digs. People may see Tabla and Devi as upscale Indian, but spicing a dish with cloves and cardamom doesn't make a cuisine Indian. Tamarind is not your student days' lunch buffet, but even then our meal for three was 25% cheaper than my meal at Devi last week. And, if Tamarind Tribeca can finally win over Srini - it will certainly delight you!",27,20,27,Atif I.,"New York, NY",177,642,1772
5.0,3/28/2010,"Tamarind Tribeca is a significant improvement over its decade-old prequel in Gramercy.  And has to be in the 'top three' list of any Indian restaurant league table in New York.Firstly, the setting.  This Tamarind takes on the persona of its neighborhood -- lofty, spacious and industrial.  The mezzanine level adds a dimension to the restaurant that grows on you over several visits.  Of note, the crowd is a mix of well-heeled finance and media folks, causing a departure from the feel of typical Indian restaurants.  The restaurant is likely not a good choice for a casual meal.Secondly, the service is several notches above the experience at the Gramercy version.  The maître d' seems gracious and welcoming, and the number of staff on duty seemingly exceeds the number of patrons, except in the busy hours of the evening.  Importantly, the staff seem well-trained.The food is superlative, assuming one sticks to a subset of the extensive menu.  If there is a reason to take away a star from the rating, it is the variability in quality of execution across the menu items, that are drawn from diverse cuisines in India.  Try the bhojpuri samosa appetizer, but skip the uttapum.  The dal makhni is robust.  Try it with the Afghani nan or the laccha parantha.  Wash it down with the ginger and pepper martini, not the cosmopolitan.Tamarind Tribeca is the best choice for good Indian food in a fancy setting in Manhattan, especially if you can sidestep the minefields in the menu.",17,13,13,Srini V.,"Manhattan, NY",467,463,97
