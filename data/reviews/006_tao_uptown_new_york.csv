4,4/27/2019,"I'm going to be honest . I didn't come to Tao uptown for the food , but rather for the experience and the ambiance that Tao is known for . The expectations for the food weren't that high , but I was genuinely surprised . I got the orange chicken and lychee martini . My boyfriend ordered the pad Thai . The orange chicken was great and the portion was the perfect size . The lychee martini was sooo good. It wasn't too strong or too sweet- it was just right .The pad Thai I would not recommend. It just didn't taste like authentic pad Thai. Is the food anything remarkably better from that of another Asian fusion restaurant ? No . But if you want to go to a cool spot with great music for a birthday or special event , I'd recommend Tao . Also ,Parking was easy to find, which was another plus for me !",0,0,0,Nicole P.,"Queens Village, NY",2,27,6
5,4/23/2019,"We were in town and a family member suggested that we checked it out. We went on a Monday night for dinner. I had the basic shrimp fried rice instead of the noodle since I wasn't that hungry. My boyfriend had the beef with white rice bowl. The drinks were amazing, I believe it's called Tau tini, nothing to sweet or sour. It's a beautiful atmosphere with the giant Buddha architecture facing us. The only thing I would have wished our waitress would checked up on us to see if we were satisfied but she was too busy making sure the men across us were satisfied. But I highly recommend this place!",0,0,0,Tracii B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,3,0
1,4/18/2019,"I used to go to TAO multiple times to have sushi rolls. I experienced an unexpected feeling last time I went, that I don't think I will ever be heading back to TAO again. The sushi rolls that I tasted, tasted really off. I shrug, maybe the chef changed. I come home, and I feel dizzy. Dizzy to the point where I almost stopped breathing and had to get an ambulance. I ended up throwing up non-stop. I was at the hospital for nearly a week, due to food poisoning! While the decor is really nice and the food is good, I wouldn't bother going to a restaurant that doesn't have the decency to serve FRESH sushi rolls.",0,0,0,Catherine M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,9,1

4,4/4/2019,"Tao, Tao, Tao....I know you're pretty over priced for Asian food but I get it. The decor, ambience and vibe that you give me is 50% of what I am paying for. We made a reservation for 7 people and were seated right away when we get there.Chilean Seabass got me last night. It definitely hit the spot! My favorite so far. Your sweet and spicy shrimp tho is just average. Spicy salmon roll is also one of the tables favorite. We had to order another one because it was not enough for our hungry and tired group.

1,4/3/2019,There is nothing lucrative or alluring about over priced Asian fusion.What can be said about a few scallops in basic Thai curry? I'm not sure what led to the massive diarrhea I had but my speculation is the food. The other thing that occurs is young hostesses that are eagerly bouncing around so middle aged men with erectile dysfunction can make small talk while I wait thirty minute to get my stinking drink.

3,3/30/2019,"I've been to this fine establishment about almost three years ago to celebrate a former friend of mine's birthday, and I can't say I was impressed with the food, (at the time, I wasn't accustomed to Thai food so wasn't aware of the best things to get on the menu, so I settled for pad Thai which I didn't like) but I was impressed with the scenery and level of service. This is a wonderful place to celebrate a birthday, or landing your first big job, or gig. It's also a wonderful place to bring your beau on a date. Next time I come here I will most likely order the spring rolls and dumplings (I had the pleasure of tasting Thai rolls and dumplings at another restaurant and was pleased) I can't wait to come back, and live out another one of my Carrie Bradshaw fantasies.

2,3/30/2019,"Tao used to be my go-to. Having friends in town, birthday dinner, etc.but lately I've been super disappointed with the quality of the food. On two different occasions I've gone to Tao and had my favorite, the Chilean Seabass skewers, BOTH times the seabass tasted like ammonia. So while in the restaurant I did some research. When a fish taste like Anonia that means that the fish was dead before they killed it, and that the fish had actually started its decomposing process. Tao is toooo fancy of a restaurant, so serve anything but fresh fish. I probably wouldn't frequent there again, unless it was on someone else's dime.",0,0,0,Chanelle H.,"New York, NY",24,69,70
2,3/30/2019,"This is very hard to write as Tao uptown has been one of my favorite places to eat for the past 10 years. After last night I will not be returning.We had a reservation for 8:15 pm and got seated at 9:00 pm. The waiter had the worst attitude and was very unapproachable. It made it difficult to get good service. We ordered our steaks with teriyaki sauce which did not arrive with our order. I asked the waiter for the sauce again, it took us 15 minutes to receive it , the steaks were cold at this time. When i brought it to the waiters attention he just stood there and looked at me, awkward!!! The food was not the same, they replaced the Kung Pau chicken with an Orange sauce chicken, big mistake. The vegetable fried rice arrives cold and the rice was hard in texture. When i made this reservation for my daughters birthday i confirmed that they were serving Mochi, it's on the menu (it's her favorite)They said they do, when it came time to order they said they were out of it. All in all it was a very disappointing experience",0,0,0,Shirley H.,"Manhattan, NY",35,20,0

I especially liked the branzino, hanger steak, and chocolate peanut cake. I've been here for dinner too and had a great experience. The special sushi rolls and small plates are especially delicious. The cocktails are expensive but worth it. Really fun sophisticated ambiance and attentive polite servers/hostesses.

1,3/17/2019,"Food at this uptown location was no better than a PF Chang, over priced. What makes the experience one I won't forget is the attitude of the hostess on a Sunday afternoon. Extremely rude and a bad attitude with the way she behaved with my kids.

It was a packed night when we got there about half hour before our reservation. But it wasn't long before our time came to be seated. I had ordered the Thai noodles. They were very good. But my favorite part was the decor and the mojito. Oh that mojito..... It was amazing. The pricing was fairly decent given where we were. Great for dates or special nights out.

5,2/25/2019,"This is your go to upscale Asian food spot. You can come here to celebrate a birthday with a big group or it can be a great place for an intimate date. While you wait to be seated there is a bar/ lounge area where a waiter can get you drinks (we went for the red dragon, it was great). The service was prompt, the ambiance was nice and the food was great. We started off with a sushi roll and pork pot stickers. Both tasted really good. The pot stickers were crunchy and hot and the sushi tasted fresh. For our entree we opted for the Singapore Mei Fun noodles and asked for it to come spicy. It was good and spicy but kind of dry so we asked for Hoisoin sauce which made the dish amazing.For dessert we tried the banana pudding which was topped with tempura bananas and freshly cracked wafers.

I love the atmosphere of this place, high ceiling, exposed brick walls, and the sort of modern-Asia sort of theme going on. The service was spot on, and of course the food, completely amazing. We ordered the Chilean Sea bass and the wasabi crusted fillet, cooked medium rare. Both were fantastic. The steak was cooked perfectly, the Sea bass full of flavor, also cooked perfectly. It's so easy to ruin a piece of fish by over cooking it, and the chefs here clearly know what they are doing. The wok-cooked veggies that were served with the Sea bass were also spot on. I love nearly anything with a pan-Asian twist. We also shared a bowl of the hot and sour soup for an appetizer and it's also some of the best I've had.

The most important thing about a restaurant is the food and it matches the beauty and stellar atmosphere of the restaurant. We ordered king pao chicken, pork lo-mein, pork potstickers and sushi.

My server Danny was very accommodating and responsive from the start to finish. The staff even the hostess made this day memorable for us. They were smooth, efficient and excellent. Everyone enjoy their meal. I loved every dessert they had on the prefix lunch. The venue was tranquil, relaxing yet trendy at the same time.

5,2/12/2019,"Huge fan of the prix fixe lunch here!It's almost become a weekly tradition for me. $31.50 for 3 courses is totally worth it. On the other hand, the dinner is much more expensive and I wouldn't recommend it unless for a special occasion. Drinks menu also on the pricier side at $18 per cocktail. I've tried every every item, and would say my favorite appetizer is either the shrimp skewers or short ribs, favorite entree is Kung Pao chicken or hanger steak with fries, and favorite dessert is banana pudding or chocolate peanut cake. The ambiance is perfect - dimly lit, two levels, modern and sleek design, with a view of the giant Buddha. Service is fast and waiters are well trained.

3,2/10/2019,"Overpriced and trendy are what comes to mind when I think of Tao. Expect to pay as everything is over priced. Avoid the ""small plates"" not worth it, you're paying for the presentation. The entrees are sub par. The Chilean sea bass by far was the best of the three entrees. Nearly $20 for rice no better than a local Chinese restaurant. So why go? Go to say you went, go to see the beautiful Buddha, go for the napkins in the restroom, and the dessert that is worth every single calorie. There were 2 standouts: the excellent service and the dessert. $400 with gratuity for 3; two rounds of drinks, small plates, entrees, and a side of rice. The dessert thankfully was on the house.

4,2/10/2019,"I came here last night for a friends birthday dinner. I originally went to the other location before and loved it and since they were booked we ended up coming here instead. So I want to start off saying the decor and music was amazing  the hostess was super friendly and helpful even with the craziness of people all smushed by the entrance. And our waitress was great and very friendly and accommodating. The menu was a good size and since we all werent sure of some of the items on the menu we just got a bunch of things and all shared. Which is how the waitress said is done there, so kind of like a family style menu , which is great so everyone tries a bit of everything! We ordered 3 apps the veggie dumplings, the pork pot stickers (reminded me of gyoza LOVE) and spring rolls of course. Then for entrees we got fried rice, lomain, steak (love the sauce), and orange chicken. All great and tasteful! Some of us ordered alcholic beverages all great! The one reason I did not give 5 stars was due to the over packed environment . you couldnt even push out your chair without hitting the person behind you. The waiting/lounge area I did not like , it was overly packed with all of the people waiting for their tables and people just coming for drinks and the bouncer told us to move over ""theres no where to move??"" I prefer the waiting area at the other location much better its much larger and spacious so everyone isnt smushed together. Overall a good experience!",1,1,1,Dana M.,"New York, NY",9,64,41

Although the food is absolutely delectable every time I go and I truly enjoy the service although at this particular one, there was a server who complained right in front of my guest while I attempted to run to the atm and get cash for his tip. I'll never forget this because he was truly distraught over 15% tip on the bill from the other patrons, I decided to give cash yet there was still a complaint to other servers.... About us as patrons. Should never be done especially in public. I was also hoping the connection to a night lounge as other Taos have but this one didn't have the in-house connection.

We ordered the chicken dim sum (pan fried) as an appetizer to split and it was good, nothing really special to it just a good flavor and nicely pan fried creating that extra crust. For dinner I had the wasabi crusted filet mignon with onion rings. Onion rings were amazing and were fried perfectly, I did wish they came with a signature dipping sauce. The steak was a little over cooked, asked for rear but was leaning more towards medium rear. It was still a nice cut of meat and the crusted wasabi on top really gives it a nice flavor.

Well first we had reservations and were over an hour late and thought they would have canceled it but customer service was so wonderful they made it work for us when we finally arrived! (Typical Saturday traffic ) I have to say this place is pretty amazing from the decor to the upscale but laid back ambience. They have this waiting area when you walk in and wait for your table to be ready near the bar and it can get a little over crowded and a little uncomfortable. Some ppl will end up ordering and having their meal on the exact table you're waiting on and then you find yourself awkwardly watching someone eat in front of you with their children. Besides that small flaw which can easily be fixed the place is my new favorite! Prob the best/freshiest Asian food I've tasted yet!!! I can not wait to return!! Amazing!

Loved the skewers and the spicy tuna. The spring rolls were ok. I got the kung pao chicken for my main entree with white rice. The entrees are HUGE. I shared it with my party of 5 and together we were able to finish it. I got the mango sorbet for dessert. Wasn't a huge fan of the sorbet being in coconut milk.

The food was good, just like I remember, and our server was good as well. It doesn't get much better than their sea bass! However, one of the security team ( I assume that's what he was) was so incredibly rude to girls in our party. While standing around trying to get out of the way while we waited on our table, this man came up to my daughter and her friends and asked them if their IDs were real or fake bc he would be able to know and he would call the cops. They were not even attempting to order a drink at all. It was just very rude and unprofessional and kind of set the tone for the rest of the experience.

Also I asked for a steak knife and they told me they don't have steak knifes and that the steak is precut. Which it was but sliced.

5,12/26/2018,"This place was great. I've heard this is the best location and the food is the best here. First time coming here and I enjoyed myself. I've been in the same area as the downtown location which has a lounge area for after hours and boy was there a wait and a crowd! This location is huge with 4 stories and a lovely design, I fell in love. The usual. Location is very popular because at first the only reservations that were available were for 11pm for dinner, but after a few calls something popped up for an earlier time. Due to traffic on a rainy evening, calls were made again and we were still able to keep our reservations. The atmosphere was bomb, the music was a good mix, the staff was great and attentive. Only downfall about this spot is that the restrooms are only located on the lower level, so depending which level you are seated, you'd have to go down a few flight a of stairs. Shout out to my waitress for running a whole level herself and still keeping a smile on her face! On this evening the restaurant was packed, every level had a full house at 10pm. We went off reviews that were already made on here regarding what to order. There was a little bit of everything on our table. Portions are big enough to feed a party of four, definitely recommend ordering appetizers as well just to get a taste of everything on the menu. For starters we had the Jumbo Shrimps, Veggie Spring Rolls, & Dumplings. As for dinner we ordered the Mandarin Fried Rice and Crispy Orange Chicken which also came with a side order of white rice. If you aren't sure what what's on the menu, ask your server what they recommend as well, it's usually the good stuff. Drinks were good and strong, actually drinks are way better when ordered at the bar. Overall I'd come back for another dinner date at an earlier time.",0,0,0,Karen K.,"New York, NY",10,82,155

I would like to start off by saying I was extremely late to my reservations (didn't plan out the Christmas traffic properly) I tried calling to inform them about it but no one responded the phone so I left a voicemail. Finally, my boyfriend and I arrive to Tao and they tell us the wait may be up to 45 minutes. We understood since we missed our reservations. Literally within 15 mins or less they call us to our seats. The hostess sat us down on the third level, it was secluded from the rest but we had a view of the whole restaurant. I loved that they sat us there, it kinda felt like we had special privileges. Haha. Our waiter was extremely nice, he was attentive making sure we were good with the food and drinks. My boyfriend had a bubbles and berries and I ordered the lychee martini. The lychee martini was by far the most delicious drink I've ever heard! My boyfriend had to switch over and have one too. For starters we got the tempura asparagus. It was perfect, it didn't fill us up but held us off until the entree. For our entree we ordered the grilled rare tuna and shellfish in sizzling pot.

Beautiful ambience and we sat down and picked right off their 31.50 lunch menu which had a plethora of different options for apps, entrees and desert. I had to remind the waitress to refill everyone's water glasses - but instead of refilling, they give you a new glass - which sort of overcrowded the table, especially when they bought all of the food out. But, other than that the service was a 4/5. The food was amazing, wow. Ambience was great as well. The fortune cookie birthday cake is so great- don't bother bringing your own cake.

We were very surprised to see the place packed when we entered and every table got filled up as the meal went on. The interior design looks similar to a Buddhist temple with tons of Instagram worthy shots. Our waitress was very friendly and helped us with any questions we had about the menu. I ordered the crispy tuna sashimi roll for an appetizer. It was a real delight. Crunchy and packed with flavor. And the edamame and light wasabi sauce were nice accompaniments. My miso glazed Chilean sea bass entree was simply heavenly and to die for. It was mouthwatering, very flaky and everything a piece of fish should be. Loved the wok vegetables that came on the side as well! We also ordered broccoli and eggplant for the table. Very delicious!Our meal ended with our waitress bringing us chocolate fortune cookies which weren't bad.

I always wonder how they managed to get a giant Buddha through the doors! It's beyond my understanding.I ordered a few different dishes. The lobster dumplings are great. I usually always order that. I also usually order the pad Thai but it's really not very good. I only order it because my kids won't eat much else but it's lacking flavor. I also ordered spring rolls or egg rolls which were awful. They should leave those for cheap Chinese food take out restaurants.I don't usually order the sushi but I must say I was impressed. It was so soft and fresh. I felt like I could have eaten 10 rolls but I wouldn't because it's so expensive. I would have had to spend 300 to be full so I did fill up on the fried bad egg rolls in the end so I didn't end up in a fast food line after.

The shrimp fried rice hardly had flavor and the duck spring rolls were good but almost tasted like it had curry in it, which I didn't enjoy. My husband got the miso marinated sea bass and it usually isn't a good idea to get fish delivered, but this tasted great and fresh. I ordered the pepper filet mignon steak and it was amazing. I ordered it medium rare because I knew that it would cook a little while traveling and it was perfect when it arrived. The steak was very tender and the sauce that came with it was amazing.

The hostesses were very polite and friendly. We were greeted almost immediately by our server (I'm sorry I'm blanking on her name but she was great). We started with apps (chicken lettuce wraps, hot and sour soup, and short ribs). The chicken lettuce wraps took us by surprise. FLAVOR TOWN!!! So tasty and perfectly balanced. Slightly spicy but in all the right ways. The short ribs were cooked well and also very satisfying. The soup was delicious and nothing like traditional carry out places. Definitely deeper and more intense then what we are use to. Apps get an A+ all around.I had the kung pao chicken which was some of the best I've had in a long time. The chicken was crispy and juicy. The sauce was thick and spicy as kung pao should be. Generous chucks of bell pepper, celery, and onions accompanied the meat. My gf had the bronzino which was prepared well. The skin was crispy and the flesh was buttery, flaky, and melt in your mouth delicious. We had also ordered a side of eggplant. The texture almost threw me off completely but if you can get past that, the flavor was devine. Definitely a unique take on eggplant. I've never had this good dessert from an Asian restaurant. Being chocoholics, we opted for the choco parfait and choco peanut butter cake. Both were equally amazing and the passion fruit in the cake worked surprisingly well. We were not rushed out and felt comfortable to take our time finishing. Everything was superb and would definitely return! I must also mention that the lunch portions were larger than expected.

Some love it, some expect more and are not impressed and that's why the ratings vary. We got reservations for a Saturday night. I researched a bunch of Yelp reviews and schooled my SO on what to wear because a bunch of reviewers did say that you have to dress to impress. However unless your dinner at Tao is followed by a night of dancing at Lavo which is right opposite to this gorgeous place you should be fine with jeans and a cute top for women and men can wear a polo and semi formal shoes. Yes celebrities often frequent the spot, so if you want to take cute pics with Katie Holmes  wear what you look best in! They have a bigger lounge lounge so if you have no reservations, you can spend time in lounge area with drinks and apps. Since we had reservations, we were ushered right to our table. This place is so huge! I mean you will be surprised! It is beautifully designed with a big Buddha on the back wall and a koi fish pond.The server was with us shortly after we sat, he explained the menu in as much detail as he could and suggested some drinks.

It lacked the warmth and welcoming feeling we have felt in the past. This time around we travelled with our two children (1 yr and 4 yr old). The server did not not smile a single time, did not offer any recommendations and we felt snubbed.

We had the chicken lettuce wraps and short rib for appetizers. Each was delicious. The chicken was very spicy though, I only recommend it for someone who can handle it. For our entrees, my boyfriend ordered the Branzino and I ordered the Pad Thai w| shrimp. The Branzino was phenomenal, it was sweet yet, citrusy and savory ALL in one. The pad Thai was a great portion, very filling but I didn't think it was anything special. The atmosphere was breath-taking. I've never seen a restaurant so beautiful before! Even the bathrooms were gorgeous! My boyfriend freaked out about the urinal because it had a water fall hahahaha. The service was just ok. Not very personable or impressive.

4,7/29/2018,"This was a somewhat random lunch pick for restaurant week.  I booked an early lunch for 11:30 as we had things to do and when my son and I got there at 11:25, the front door was still locked!  Within a few minutes after 11:30, the doors opened and, WOW what a beautiful space.  I was hoping that Tao would offer both a beautiful atmosphere and delicious food, and they definitely did!We were seated along the back wall of the main floor.  Now that i've seen the space, I might ask to sit along the second floor balcony.We started with spicy basil chicken lettuce wraps and shrimp skewers for apps, and were immediately informed they were out of the lettuce wraps.  Our gracious and kind waitress, asked management if we could make a similar substitution off the regular menu...and she was told no, we could not do that.  I guess I understand, if you let one person do it, then....but on the other hand, it would have been a nice gesture on Tao's part.For mains we chose the Asian BBQ hangar steak and spiced fries, and the Sashimi Chirashi bowl.  The steak was fantastic, perfectly cooked and seasoned, and while the fries did not taste spiced, they were VERY good!  The Chirashi bowl was tasty and packed with fish, it came with a vegetable roll that was absolutely beautiful, but mostly flavorless.We both decided to do for dessert (an inexpensive $5 add on-thank you Tao!  some other restaurants offer a dessert add on for $8-10 which is ridiculous, and goes against the general spirit of restaurant week spirit)My son selected a chocolate cake with peanuts and I threw myself at the mercy of my server, and I am SO GLAD I did!  The banana pudding, the dessert that was brought to me was honestly one of the most delicious desserts I have ever eaten in my life, and I don't really love bananas!  It was a bowl of fresh bananas and what tasted like a house made nilla wafer type cookie, layered with the lightest and freshest tasting banana mousse.  The top was sprinkled with a crushed sweet cereal and topped with a warm tempura banana.  It was an absolute standout!  Yes, you should make a special trip for this!After basking in the atmosphere and having a wonderful lunch, we left Tao uptown happy, with definite plans to return again!",0,0,0,Kerrie D.,"Portland, ME",277,483,1015

Called them. They said it wasn't an issue.  (Very hospitable front of the house staff)We arrived and this Tao location is pretty big, it didn't have loud music that others described that not.  It wasn't packed at all.  Maybe 15% of the tables were occupied.  So it was a nice relaxing environment for the first night getting settled in. I don't eat meat or seafood, actually, so I asked them for some sort of noodles dish. They accommodated and it was actually really good.Had a great meal.Only thing I'd say is that my guest was a little annoyed at the fact that they didn't check on our table - Maybe because it was getting close to closing time for the staff, so they were winding down from a busy day. It didn't bother me, but something worth mentioning. The Buddha is cool. We were sat close to it.Looked at it once as we walked to our table and didn't look at it again while we were there.It's not this crazy thing to Marvel at and take pictures with but if you're a tourist...

4,6/12/2018,"I had my eye on this restaurant ever since I saw it on SATC several years back.  Well, on my recent trip to NYC, I finally got to check it out...and I thought I'd add some thoughts on it.  First of all, as expected, the decor was stunning...from the striking trio of ""female in red print dress"" wall decor on the way in, to the eye-catching Buddha statue, to the dark, sexy, candlelit ambience throughout the restaurant.  As usual, the place was smaller than I had anticipated...but still had that bigger-than-life feel.  I can definitely say that Tao Uptown made my Top 10 list in terms of ambiance (and this includes some unbeatable contenders in Paris, Italy and Hawaii).  I've been to Tao in Las Vegas, and I thought the decor in this uptown location was a tad more dynamic as well.  The menu was equally impressive, with an array of unusual appetizers and entrees reserved only for restaurants of this caliber.  Now, the food?  Again, Amazing!  I had Pork Potstickers and Lobster Kimchee Fried Rice...and both were melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Extremely overpriced (especially for the relatively small portions), but for the overall quality of the food and the decor, it was worth it.  The service was good, not great.  The waitress started off kicking, but waned near the end...slow on refilling my tea, then making me wait for the bill for minutes on end.  That's where it lost a ""star""... earning a four, instead of a five-star rating.  One tip:  Book ahead!  Aside for Sundays, most days were booked weeks in advance...so I had to resort to going on Sunday.  Still, if you're traveling to NYC, I definitely recommend checking out this ""showcase"" restaurant.",0,0,0,Rose E.,"Charlotte, NC",83,164,483

We ordered a temple salad and a lobster and kimchi fried rice. Their portions were quite nice, not too big or too small, and they gave extra veggies for the salad which is always welcomed for more vitamins. The rice was ok, but it was quite salty, and I barely tasted any flavor from the lobster and kimchi. The salad was much better. It came with edamame, lettuce, lime juice and Asian pear. The combination was delicious, not too acidic or flavorful to maintain the taste of fresh veggies. Service was good too.

The gentleman I would assume was mod or floor host, stood nearby all night but not once checked in. A server (female) from another table passing by was quite unpleasant to one of the birthday girls when she (my friend) was getting out of the chair and nearly knocked into server. Frustrating I understand - when you see a big group, all one one table, but the level of hospitality I would expect from such a prominent hospitality group employee, she did not portray. Next George the bouncer, granted trying to make sure a near by table was not bothered (a popular Spanish artist), could not have been more disrespectful if he tried. Staring at anyone sitting with our table who were taking pictures (with each other). Then towards the end of dining experience, saying loud enough and close enough for our table to hear ""I'm just waiting for them to all get lit of here"" accompanied by hand gestures (management feel free to check cameras and just witness the cold experience).As someone who not only has previously worked in hospitality management, but more importantly as someone who dines out 5-7 times a week...I would urge anyone to search for another midtown or uptown venue.

Being a lover of Asian food I couldn't wait to have a taste of a little bit of everything on the menu.

We all ordered drinks except one of us who was visiting and had forgotten to bring her ID which was a bummer but wasn't much of a problem. We all ordered our own very unique cuisines as well as signature drinks. The first thing I realized as I took my first bite of my meal was It was extremely overly salted. Now I love my spices and salty foods but unfortunately It was salty to the point where It just didn't taste right. I didn't mention to the others at the table till one of them said exactly what I was thinking. At this point we didn't want to cause a scene so we just nibbled and poked at the food until we closed our tab. As if the night couldn't get any more bitter (like our meals) , our friend took a small sip of one of our drinks and the waitress almost had a heart attack.

I was with just one friend and idk if the service was bad bc we were just a two top, but my server didnt pay too much attention to us. I had to ask other servers and runners/bussers for things like extra say e, more water, change for a $20, etc. The food was good, but not great. Not really worth the price. I got the chicken pad thai and it was pretty dry. When i asked for extra sauce, it took 15 minutes which was annoying since my food was pretty much cold. Ive have much better pad thai for $8.

3,4/29/2018,"I came here last night for a birthday dinner and it was fun. The reason for my 3 star rating is because my favorite dish ( orange chicken ) had some type of taste in it that I didn't like. I don't know if it was some type of curry or spice but I just wasn't feeling it. Now on to the positive - the Lo Mein was delicious, I didn't try the sushi but my friend liked it so I believe that it was good, & the dessert was very delicious and rich. It was the salted caramel ice cream lava cake that made my night ! I would also like to say that my Don Julio margarita was only okay. It didn't taste as strong as other Don Julio margaritas I've had in the past but I did have two drinks. We also ordered shots of don Julio which I'd have to say were in a huge shot glass & that was greatly appreciated. Overall the place was pricy but had a great vibe and I loved the old school music. If my chicken was better I would have given 4 stars. The best part was when they played mine and my BFFL's  good luck song Beautiful by Snoop Dog. I loved that !!!! I still like downtown better but I would come back to sit in the lounge and have some drinks. This time I'll order a patron margarita!",0,0,0,Jessica P.,"New York, NY",379,126,237

I was surprised how quickly our food and service were delivered with amount of people they had. The plating was neat on fancy, ceramic dishes. The food was pretty good. My friends went to Tao Uptown and they said their dishes were salty even though it had good flavors. However, the seasonings were on point and all of our dishes was not salty at all. Although, I think the dishes were slightly overpriced. We also got giant fortune cookie as dessert which was filled with white and chocolate mousse.

They definitely don't skimp on the alcohol and it was delicious. When we were seated.

For the appetizer I ordered the Spicy tuna tartare on crispy rice and was not disappointed. Tuna was perfect and the plating was impressive. I ordered the wasabi crusted filet mignon for the entree and the meat was so tender and cooked perfectly. My date ordered the mandarin fri d rice which I thought was bland but considering it's rice, what else can you do. The dessert was by far my favorite part. the fortune cookie blew me away. There was ample mousse on the inside and neither the chocolate nor the white chocolate mousse was too sweet. The fruits that cake on the side were fresh.

That being said, it ABSOLUTELY delivered. We attended for a birthday and were seated within five minutes of our reserved time, and our server was an absolute pleasure. He was able to give spot-on recommendations and had our food out promptly after ordering, which was impressive given how crowded it was.For a started I got the hot and sour soup, which came with a side of shrimp toast. If you've never had shrimp toast before, like I had, you will NOT regret trying it. The soup complimented it perfectly -- it was really a match made in heaven. As a main entree I got a sesame salmon filet with udon noodles and vegetables, which was also so good that I came a hair short of licking the plate straight clean.The desserts are also out of bounds. Believe the hype and get the giant fortune cookie, which is a giant cookie filled with white and milk chocolate mousse. The cookie tasted indescribably better than a normal fortune cookie -- you can really taste the almond! And the mousse was so silky that I could cry.It's a bit expensive, so be fore warned.

We didn't make a reservation in advance, but I'd recommend it since the place filled up very quickly during the lunch rush. We arrived early and had no issues with seating. I was so impressed by how large and well decorated Tao was inside. Obviously when you enter the main seating area, your eyes are just drawn to the giant golden Buddha. The whole vibe just felt modern and chic, with of course some Asian inspiration in decor. Because it was restaurant week, we all decided to do the lunch menu since it included a few great options for appetizers, entrees, and dessert. I started with the papaya chicken salad, and was so surprised how large the portion was for a starter for one person. It was delicious so of course I ate all of it. For my entree I went with the Asian BBQ Hanger Steak with Spiced Fries. I felt odd getting fries for lunch at such a nice place, but holy cow they were so good. No regrets. I couldn't stop eating them because the flavor of the spices and the crisp of the fries were that good. The steak was also perfectly cooked medium rare as requested and it was wonderful. As a dessert I got the chocolate peanut cake. The cake itself was moist and felt decadent without being overly heavy. It had a bit of a hint of a coffee flavor which complemented it. The roasted peanut ice cream served on the side was also quite good. I would have eaten all of this if I could but I was already so full from all the dishes before. Whoops.

2,2/10/2018,"I've been a loyal TAO patron for years in Vegas and New York but the service & the food quality was so deplorable, I highly suggest anyone attempting to go here to steer clear. The hostess and concierge upon entering were lovely. They seated us in the best spot as poper my reservation request to be near Buddha (requested over a month in advance). However, the wait to get to our reserved table was an additional hour!Our waiter was overwhelmed, and inattentive. He would not give us suggestions on food choices based on taste. Rather, he would leave us unattended for lengths of time (~15-20 minutes) to let us decide. By the time he came, we had specifically told him that two of us wanted to split pad Thai, and get the garlic shrimp tempura tapas, while my other friend went on to offer shrimp and lobster rolls & another entree. Our issue: birthday girl is allergic to peanuts and he didn't tell us or at least clarify! Another issue was we did not know he can not place an order unless he took all of our orders.. so it took another hour to order. We received our food, obviously turned away the pad thai away after noticing which I had a bite of.. it tasted like sticky fish broth in flat noodles that even the shrimp was flavorless. Everything else was mediocre at best... not 5 star quality.  What bothered is was that he didn't even provide two plates for the pad thai (prior to realizing there were peanuts) knowing we were sharing. I couldn't get his attention so I asked another waiter..Only thing he got right was the fortune cookie for my girl's birthday.. other than that,  he also never physically handed us the bill so we sat there for an additional hour waiting for it.. when it was placed at the corner of the table. That's lack of etiquette. Another waiter dropped glasses and silverware tripping on a chair and the big spoon smacked my ankle. I picked it up, put it in the table and he apologized profusely. My waiter should've at least been a little courteous. An 8:15 PM reservation pushed to 12:30 AM, and while I loved the company I was with, not a single waiter offered to help us take a photo & they did notice me getting up so many times too. You just don't treat people like this.

The waiter came up to me and suggested menu items that could be made specially for me so he suggested items off the menu that they could make vegetarian and with no fish or shellfish. For appetizer they gave me veggie dumplings and for entree they gave me the option of rice or noodles, I picked noodles and got a vegan fried rice with tofu.

5,1/4/2018,"Classy, unpretentious, fusion, modern, very polite staff, excellent food. I went here for the New Years Eve event. For the price we paid, I think my friend and I ate the value of appetizers and drank the value thanks to the open bar. Bartenders were awesome and courteous. Since only my friend and I were eating, no one rivaled us for the spring rolls, chicken satay, wagyu beef sliders, or shrimp tempura. Music was some sort of ambient house music which had a monotonous bass and was pretty dreadful. I think they played two songs which my friend and I recognized between us both. However the music matched well with the atmosphere and deco very well, some sort of modern sexy vibe. Great bathrooms and very clean of course, but yes there was a line. (Why is there always a line in the women's restroom?) Mandatory coat check at the front of the venue. The first floor was turned into an open dance floor with the big buddha in the backdrop and koi fish in the pond. Several VIP tables on the edges of the room and upstairs. Open bar on both floors. Overall the entire experience was great (especially the staff) but the music was the most disappointing part.

The reservation was 10:45, which is super late for my own dinner likings but surprisingly the restaurant was in full swing as if it was 8pm. Even though some people were running late, they did not rush us and we were seated promptly as soon as everyone arrived. We had a nice side booth in the main dining area with a nice view of the statue and fish pong (yes there are real fish swimming around!). For dinner I stuck to what I know/love and had the fried rice with shrimp. It was literally perfect, and I didn't need to add any soy sauce or extra dressing because all of the flavors were on point. You could tell that the shrimp had been seasoned with love and that the fried rice was thrown in the wok and whipped around until the chef's arm was tired. I literally mean it was perfect! My friend had a chicken entree that was sooo good I almost regretted getting my shrimp, which says a lot.

I spoke with other families waiting to eat and all of them were waiting well beyond their reservation time and we're all infuriated. What's the point of upholding a reservation??! Absurd and ridiculous. The ""manager"" was absolutely useless.

I asked ""so it could be 10 more minutes, it could be 30. You're just unwilling to tell me??"" And his response was ""I am not able to say how much longer"". I get that the place is full and it's a very popular restaurant, but you don't let people who make reservations wait 30+ minutes for a table in New York. Get it together TAO.

It was difficult for me to decide, however the tuna tartare to start followed by the diver sea scallops won me over. The only draw back was our server was hustling and I felt like we did not get his full attention. We  go here on each visit to NYC. It is fabulous.

The hostesses seemed a little snobby, which is honestly so astounding to me. Their attitudes came off as a little bit snarky, snappy, and disinterested. If I'm paying a restaurant money that gives you a job, I expect you to treat me respectfully rather then as a bother. The atmosphere is a little too loud, and the lights a little too dim.  The food is amazing, and the servers tend to be very kind. Unfortunately, I got the feeling that the waiter I had was pressuring me to keep ordering more and to spend more money. For example, I was stuffed after three courses when the waiter set down two desert menus (most waiters ask if you would like to see a desert menu first). Then when I stated that I was too full, he continued to ask if I wanted dessert. When I finally got the message across to him, he seemed sad/angry that I didn't want dessert. It was very awkward. The prices are also a little too expensive...I could see what I ordered being more around $60 (and that's pushing it) then $100. The fortune cookie fortunes that they give out gave me a weird vibe.

The ambience of the restaurant is great and I love the decor, which makes is a great place for dinner or drinks. However, I didn't feel like we got excellent service. We had a 5pm reservation on a Sunday night and were seated immediately. We had to wait a bit for our server to arrive and he seemed to come by our table pretty infrequently. We had empty drink glasses multiple times and had to ask for our check in order to make it to our show on time. I was a little upset that I put on our reservation that it was my birthday and they did not acknowledge it or remember it. My husband has to tell our server while I went to the bathroom and the first words out of his mouth were: ""we don't offer anything for birthdays but we'll put a candle on a dessert if you buy one."" I don't really care about getting the desert for free but it just came across a little rude. Not quite the experience I expect for a tab over $100.

Its a nice touch. There are usually a bunch of hostesses in black club dresses making sure everyone is ok.  I ordered the chilean sea bass and squab wraps. Both were decent but sea bass was overpriced especially considering it was farm raised fish. After about 10 minutes we were seated upstairs. The place is beautiful especially from the higher floor. We order some apps. Edamame was very good, so were vegetable dumplings, tempura was good not great. Ive had the house cocktails before at the larger downtown location and theyre poppin but we all opted for water. For entrees I had the grilled snapper with a bok choy salad. Again good not great.

The first drink we had, a lechee martini was disgusting and my friend actually had to request them to be remade. The second round was ""eh"" but more palatable. However, the real kicker came when the waitress came to order the drinks. Apparently you need to give them a credit card for the tab, which is understandable in the cocktail area. HOWEVER, when I (a female there with my boyfriend) went to give her my card, she refused my card on the basis that ""we don't take cards from ladies""...as much as I wanted to be flattered I was absolutely humiliated.  Not just for me, but for my boyfriend, who is always very generous and paid for everything else that night. I WANTED to buy him a drink. Not to mention she made a show out of it in front of our friends. Apparently her boyfriend worked at the bar upstairs, perhaps she felt a certain sense of entitlement to dictate who and who not to accept payment from.

Good portion size and tasted good.-Sashimi Chirashi Bowl: loved the plating of this dish. The sushi wasn't bad but fell apart really easily, which was a little frustrating. The bowl itself had a good balance of sashimi to rice, and the rice was slightly dry.-Chocolate Peanut Cake: this was the best part of the meal! The passionfruit on the bottom was a nice touch and the ice cream and cake really complemented each other.Side note: the bathrooms may be a little confusing because they are marked ""Yin"" and ""Yang"" and don't have any other distinctions.

The giant buddha statue, the large tables with rose petals, the strong flavors in the food... you get the idea.3. Come here in a big group. Always way more fun here and they have the space to accomodate you.4. Make a reservation, but be prepared to wait for a bit as they get your table ready or whatever. You can grab a drink in the lounge/bar area near the entrance while you wait.5. Don't go too overboard with the drinks! At 18 bucks a cocktail, these can add up pretty quickly if you get too drunk and carried away :)6. Have fun! This is a place that's not stuffy in the slightest sense, so try to let loose as well.",5,0,2,Melville G.,"New York, NY",124,361,697

I've been a couple of times and the service has always been very good. It's a very upscale Manhattan take on Americanized Chinese food. I've had orange chicken, Peking duck fried rice, spicy tuna, and chicken satay - all were very good. But if you're looking for traditional Asian, this isn't the place. Tao is outside the ""tourist zone"" so, while it's always busy, you don't have to deal with hordes of tourists. It can be sort of loud - but in a fun way - and really does feel more like a club than a restaurant at times. Lively bar area with lots of seating.

As a tourist and first visit I would ask the waiter what are the recommendations to try and he gave us a quick dishes and said check the menu and I will come back when you ready! and just left.Price yes as expected it's high but not really worth it, I've tried a lot of Asian Fusions and it was way better quality, service, and a similar price of this or maybe less.Another thing that I didn't like the darkness of the place, when it's too dark how you would expect us to read the menu or see the food or even share the pictures without flash.So overall its between 2 and 3 stars places if you don't have choice and this is the only open place around you would come and try it.",2,0,0,Mishari A.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,317,105

However, I was disappointed with the food, for the price we laid. Please note this review is only based on the vegetarian food we tried at Tao. The pad Thai noodles were too sweet, the tofu inside was chewy and it had few peanuts in the dish. The vegetarian egg rolls were really huge making the ratio of veggies to the roll really high, which spoilt the overall flavor. The vegetarian dumplings were tasty, they were topped with pickled cucumber salad which added a new flavor to the dish.

The cocktail girls are prettier. The food is rather authentic (not as delicious and unique as Buddakan). The Buddha chicken is terribly dry tho. The noise level is high. A fun night out yes. A heart to heart talk probably not.When they first opened in late 1990s we went in, attracted by their door, not knowing what it was -:). One of friends that night later said, her husband was asked to invest as the 4th partner but he declined, thinking it's too risky. During one of the dinners there with her, the managing partner was there and treated us desserts.Reportedly, it was first, a 19th century stable for the Vanderbilt family and then a movie theater. The focal point of the restaurant is the 16′ Buddha in the back, on a pool staffed with Japanese carp. It has 300 seats. The ""sky box""/private room on the third floor used to be the projectionist's booth. The visible difference is, we didn't wait even after a couple of changes to our reservation on a Friday night.I always feel it's a little regret that Chinese restaurants, in general don't serve decent desserts. I think it's ok to have a few popular items even they're not Chinese, especially in Sichuan cuisine ... oh I'm off the chart here - got carried away. Tao's desserts are delicious (fusion gives them a big leeway!) compare to other Asian restaurants. I particularly like their molten chocolate cake.The bathroom maiden or guardian or watcher ... not many restaurants employee them (Irene goes to cheap eat - go figure) but so far I find them to be unnecessary and burdensome, except the lady at 21 Club who reminds me of old world grace and charm, a bonus to the restaurant.

1,6/5/2017,"WHAT IS THE APPEAL? I have been here 4 times because 1) I am a good sport and tag along when different friends/ associates want to see what they hype is about and give it a shot and 2) I am nothing if not fair minded when I go places. I am happy to afford any place a second chance. But I've given them 4.Let me start with the good. 1)Decor is nice in the Las Vegas over the top ritzy way. It is impressive, I'll give them that. That said I find the co-opting of a rich culture in order to be chic a bit unsettling but I digress.2) The visual wow continues with the food. Some of the plating is quite inspired and makes the eating seem almost criminal. However I would say an equal amount of plates seem haphazard or down-right unappetising (messy piles of overlapping mixed foods) I'm not opposed to this as this is reminiscent of the ""plating"" at our favorite corner chinese take-out establishment but I don't believe it fits with the vibe this place is going for. Again.... I digress.3) Three out of the four times I was here the service was polite. I did find that on busy nights it was a bit hard to get attention but the servers were very attentive once they came. One time I did experience an issue with raw food (pork so it was potentially risky) and the staff was far from apologetic or accommodating. Barring mishaps however, everyone was polite.4)Social Points maybe? This place has cred and you might see some celebrities. Yipee.And now the less good.1) Menu/ Food. This food is neither authentic nor innovative. A place claiming to represent a particular type of cuisine has to either pride themselves on tradition or on a fresh vantage point on a classic. For a place borrowing color and decor (Buddah and the large Quan Yin statue) the food should at least borrow inspiration from this culture's real cooking techniques. I don't expect this to be authentic cantonese food or anything like that but it should at least use similar flavor palates and cooking techniques. If they wish to innovate then they need to have exciting new takes on classics or divorce themselves entirely. Molecular gastronomy is doing entirely new things but they don't claim to be chinese food.2) Quality/execution. The food wasn't executed well. It was alternately bland or overpowered by a single ingredient (some of the herbs were used so heavy handed that some food tasted like a bouquet). It lacked balance or appreciation for the (allegedly) fine ingredients used. The meat in noodle dishes was rubbery and lacked juice. When tried separately it was often over salty. I am not an MSG fearmonger but I do think it's often lazy cooking and I am reasonably sure it was used heavy handedly in much of the food.  There was a lot of fried food that felt like it was deep fryer with heavier oils (not the light stir-frying that is more so found in traditional chinese cuisine and even American-chinese food.) Even my local take-out restaurant managed less greasy fair. On the bright side a thirsty customer is a drink purchasing customer... When food is not to the liking of the customer (or is demonstrably wrong as in the aforementioned cold, raw interior of the pork) the staff is not accommodating and blames the customer.3)Portion/value- This place is expensive. If it were great quality I'd happily pay it. I find the portions often very underwhelming and loose calculations of dollars per bite are a fun but upsetting game to play. Drinks are actually inventive (but some gambles don't pay off) but at 19+ a piece they quickly price out average consumers. Even simple mixed drinks seem stingy in alcohol. I really wanted to like this place. If it were even a smidge better I might consider it a good date spot if only for the wow factor but frankly... I don't want anyone I'm dating to wrongfully assume that I think highly of this overproduced under-loved commercialized mess. If I have to go again as a tag along I am going to eat ahead of time in some of chinatowns hidden gems or maybe treat myself to a $300 tasting menu at a place that actually respects their food. Then I'll pregame a little bit and join my friends once I'm ready for dessert. Dessert at TAO is not terrible. Nothing to write home about but not terrible. I may seem like a hater but I sincerely think the popularity of places like this brings down the respectability of the food in the city. If you are looking for a high end experience please go to Per Se, Daniel, Nakazawa etc. If you want trendy but solid go to Cosme or honestly just go into chinatown spin in a circle and point and wherever you go you'll be blown away by the quality (and low cost) of the food (Not as good as Flushing's offerings though in my opinion).",1,0,0,Matthew G.,"Woodmere, NY",0,11,0

I, of course had my favorite Tao drink which is the Ruby Red Dragon and it is still amazing. I wanted to update my review for a few reasons. 1. I tried some new food 2. Our server was amazing (supper friendly and very good service) 3. The customer service was great. 1. So for our appetizers, we ordered the Tuna Tartare, edamame, and the pork belly special. The Tuna tartare was amazing and from what I hear the pork belly special was great too (just not my thing so I didn't have any). For our entrees, we ordered filet mignon pepper steak, kung pao chicken, crispy orange chicken, and the Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon with Tempura of Onion Rings. Everything tasted great and came out quickly. The only hiccup of the night was that the crispy orange chicken was not so crispy and came out under cooked. We told our server and he immediately fixed it and had the manager come over. 2. Our servers name was Craig. He had such a great personality, (very positive attitude, making jokes, etc). It really makes the experience so much better when you have a server who has a great personality. He also handled the under cooked chicken perfectly. He apologized, got the manager, and got us a new one ASAP. He also brought us out a complimentary dessert which had 4 of their fabulous desserts on a platter. It was amazing!!!3. The customer service was great. I loved how they handled the under cooked food situation and obviously it is the correct way because I am still writing a 5 star review for them. Tao Uptown is a great place with quality food that you can bring your friends, your family, or your co-workers to.

2,5/29/2017,"Wish there was a 2.5 stars rating option. My opinion of this crazy busy noisy restaurant is that it is a nice place to go if you want be in a bustling trendy eatery and charm your company or date with its very low light ambiance. Some of the food was nice and tasty, but a few were not.  I expected better from a place of this repute. Whatever you do..don't order their Kung Pao chicken. It is absolutely the worst I have ever had in my life. Not only it was made totally wrong - savory and sweet, (BTW I  am 45 year addict of Sichuan food) the chicken chunks were tough and fibrous. For the prices they charge they could at least use good quality meat. Even the  pieces in the chicken fried rice stingy and chewy. The coconut shrimp was excellent; the best of the 23 different dishes we ordered.

5,5/22/2017,"Been here several times and never leave disappointed!Usually get the $29 lunch special and it's definitely worth it.The ambiance is relaxing and romantic, a bit too dark for a day if you want to see the people who you are dining with. But perfect for an evening. Both floors are decorated with bright lights--the total effect is actually magical. You feel like you're somewhere far from the chaotic city. Music and the noises of the fountains make up the background noise.Appetizers: 3 chicken skewers with peanut butter sauce were a pretty big portion. The sauce was amazing. The vegetable spring rolls with that same sauce were even better--three huge crunchy rolls that are perfect for that generous portion of sauce that you'll want to eat by itself. The soup with shrimp dumplings was delicious too, albeit somewhat spicy, so beware. For the main course, sweet 'Korean' potato fries and skirt steak are perfect choices. Sweet fries are drenched in spices that give them an edge--perfect, doesn't need any sauce. I can eat those fries just by themselves, as a snack, at any point in time if I could. The skirt steak portion is on the moderate side, but the meat is well-marinated and tender.The dessert was THE BEST chocolate parfait in my life, and I've tried plenty of those. Seriously, not trying that chocolatey, carameley, warm-cold, rich, mindblowing parfait is unforgivable--you will never regret or forget that dessert.

The food was mediocre and I was nauseaus after eating there. This was not even the first time when I felt sick after having dinner at Tao. Definitely there is something is wrong with their food, either not fresh or too greasy, I m not sure about it, but I was so nauseaus..

We were shown first to a table by the entry/exit route for the kitchen. At our request, we were moved to a slightly better table next to the lobby. Evidently, this establishment has seen better days. It probably does the bulk of its business as a club. The restaurant ends feels old, tired and significantly overpriced for Asian fusion fare that's fairly run of the mill.

We had reservations for a birthday dinner, waited for about 10 minutes when we arrived.  They have a super nice waiting area set as a lounge with a bar, which is perfect for keeping you occupied for the wait time. When you walk into the main room, you see that the restaurant has a HUGE statue in the center back and it is beautiful. It's a big open area and you can visibly see the upstairs floor. Tables are a bit squished together in order to maximize seating, this place was literally packed without a single empty table and I don't blame them at all. Our server was so pleasant and friendly, the menu is divine. This place is definitely finer dining, expect to spend about $100 for two. Between my date and I, we ordered the miso glazed sea bass and the shrimp pad thai. Portions are small, so if you have a big appetite, definitely order an appetizer. Both were absolutely heavenly, savory, flavorful, and delightful. I wish I could use more words to describe but it was such an amazing experience from the first bite to the last bite. Best sea bass I've ever had, best pad thai I have ever had. Though my wallet was not happy, my stomach and taste buds were ECSTATIC. The birthday dessert was mind-blowing. They brought my friend a HUGE fortune cookie, with fortunes for the whole table. You crack open the fortune cookie to find mousse and assorted fruits. It was a great finish to our meal.

First we had reservations at 9pm and we were seated at around 9:45pm, we stayed by the bar and waited until our table was ready. It was 8 of us, for a birthday dinner. The waiter was great, i wish i knew his name. We had dinner which was ok, we ordered like 5 dishes, which were pretty big dishes. We saw people were taking turns going upstairs to take photos with the Buddha statue. So we paid and waited until it was empty upstairs, we headed upstairs for our turn for photos. We were rushed out by a security guard because a smaller group of like 4 wanted photos, and wanted to skip us! They went to him and he came to us kicking us out and telling us we have to move to then proceed and give them space for their photos! If you have a group of girls taking turns to take photos you should let them finish, it helps with promoting. Instead he let the 4 not friendly people take photos. I'm not sure if he knew them but thats what it seemed like.! I had to rush and take the birthday girl a quick photo!

First, I'll talk about the venue, atmosphere, and decor. This place follows an Asian theme, the name itself is a giveaway. The lounge area right before you enter the dining area is a quite cozy but the lighting is pretty dim here. My date and I sat there first and ordered a cocktail at the bar. There were people having dinner there and other people just relaxing and talking. It has relax atmosphere to it. After 30 minutes, we were escorted to the dining area for our reservation. We were seated a few tables away from the BIG Buddha statue. The room was spacious. They have a second floor seating area that allows you to see the diners below. The lighting was much brighter in comparison to the lounge area. Our waiter came to us right away after we were seated. Lets talk about food. My date and I ordered the kimchi lobster fried rice ($34) and the sea bass fish dish ($45). I was not happy with the fried rice. It was very salty, I barely tasted the kimchi and the lobster. I expected chunks of lobster meat in the rice but I was disappointment. The fish dish was quite good but the portion was unexpectedly small. On to the dessert, which is the main reason we came here. My date ordered the giant fortune cookie dessert (15) and told the waiter to write Happy Birthday with my name. Tao did not disappoint me. The dessert had a nice presentation which included two candles for me to blow out. Throughout the night, our waiter was very nice and attentive.

3,2/25/2017,"I had high expectations for Tao because it's supposed to be a high end Asian cuisine restaurant, but sadly, me and my friends were disappointed. We ordered a crab meat roll, Asian greens stir fry, Pad Thai noodles with chicken, crispy coconut shrimp, wasabi crusted filet mignon with tempura of union, imperial wagyu ribeye. Crab meat roll: We didn't enjoy it because it was very dry. They give a lot of crab meat inside the roll, but it was dry, no moisture in the crab meat. Asian greens stir fry: very well seasoned. It's a traditional Chinese vegetable dish, and they made it very well.Pad Thai noodles with chicken: I liked it, it was very well balanced between sweet and savory. Chicken was a bit dry but still good. Crispy coconut shrimp: my favorite dish of the night, it was huge!! You taste a hint of coconut but not too overwhelming. Wasabi crusted filet mignon: dry, very dry. It came almost well done when we ordered medium. The wasabi didn't go well with it at all, it felt like I had a pile of sand on top of the steak. Imperial wagyu ribeye: very dry! It was such a shame to destroy such a beautiful piece of meat. Service was okay, nothing special.

I was hesitant to visit the one in New York that it wouldn't meet my expectations but it was incredible, i enjoy the food, the music, the staff and the ambiance. For starters the waiting area makes you feel welcome and sets the tone for the rest of your evening. The food was amazing and exceed my expectation I would say this was even better than the one in Vegas. The portions tend to be rather big and can be shared. Only down size to our visit was that we order orange chicken with a side of Pork fried rice with no veggies and they mixed it up in the kitchen, we had to wait over 20 min to get the rice, the manager was nice enough to comp our order but by the time we got it we had already eaten most of the chicken and it was getting cold. I am a chicken kind of girl and the Chicken Satay was ginger licking, the peanut sauce is a most. The donuts for dessert are also a must, they bring different sauces such as caramel and chocolates.

I've had scallops where I prefer the preparation a little more seared but this one was just as good. The wasabi crust on the filet was an amazing way to give a, normally more boring, slice of beef a good amount of character. The giant fortune cookie kinda speaks for itself if you see pictures.

He even knew all of the good things to recommend which was pretty great if you ask me.

A perfect example of don't judge a book by its cover. It also had an awesome mixture of the Asian culture as well as an Americanized feel to it. It seemed like a high end trendy kind of place for people to hang out at the bar too.Enough of the little things though, heres what I thought of the food. We ordered some rainbow rolls, eel avocado rolls, and a bunch of other things, but did not really have them. I thought the rolls were definitely above average, and very tasty, but it is a pricey restaurant and I do not know If I would say it would be worth it for the amount you get. For dessert, we ordered some donut looking pastries, and the giant fortune cookie. The donuts were just okay, and I did not take that much of a liking to it since it did not taste like anything extraordinary. But the Fortune Cookie was incredible. Actually one of the softest things I have had, with a very fresh, chocolatey inside. I thought the powder was a great touch on top, and the taste of a fresh fortune cookie alone was a new experience for me that was amazing. Also, since it was so big, and well presented it was a very unique dish that I really liked. Overall, I would come back here, but only on a special occasion most likely.

2,2/4/2017,"This has to be one of the most overrated places in all of New York. Went here with a group for a friends birthday. From the moment we sat down the waitress had an attitude and just seemed unhappy, which having waitressed for many years I get, but it's your job ya gotta push through. The food was beyond over priced and on top of that it just wasn't good. I shared a sushi roll as an appetizer and ended up sending it back because it tasted the way a fish market smells, which is not how sushi should taste! I had the Pad Thai entree which was so-so, but Land Thai Kitchens Pad Thai is half their price and significantly better. Lastly, someones cocktail came out with a bottle cap in it, when he pointed this out the waitress she rolled her eyes and got him a new one. She still charged him for it, which isn't a big deal, but it's just bad practice.

2,2/3/2017,"I wanted to give 1 star initially but the service is great and there were a few items that we had were decent. I've postponed my visit for years since I do not care for places like Tao, mediocre food that's ridiculously overpriced. I didn't like the decor, I don't think it's that nice but to each their own. I came here to get rid of a gift card that we've had, literally for 3 years and I've made an excuse not to go every time it's come up. I should've tried to use it on the location downtown...You can pretty much wear whatever you want during lunch. Lots of families were dining there, it was also Chinese New Year and 1/4 of the restaurant seemed to be filled with Chinese diners. Interesting....We both had the pre fixe lunch menu as well as 3 other dishes. I had the shrimp skewers, Kung Pao chicken, banana pudding. L had the spicy Thai seafood dumpling soup, Asian BBQ Hangar Steak and the Chocolate Peanut Cake. We also ordered the popular spicy tuna tartare on crispy rice, King Crab California rolls and a Spicy Lobster with shiso and tobiko roll.Most diners ordered lunch specials and drinks. We weren't going to drink that day, but maybe that would've made the food taste better. So our rolls and appetizers came out first. The only thing that was good and fresh were the spicy tuna tartare on crispy rice. It just wasn't spicy at all. If you've had it elsewhere, ex. Bond St, Koi, etc... they're all pretty much the same. It's good here, but not great. The rest of the appetizers were pretty bad to just edible. What I will assume was the King crab cali roll tasted like tuna fish, yet looked like crab, portions are tiny for $20+? But did I really want more of this terrible food? The spicy lobster roll was better than the crab but not by much. We ate it all since we don't like wasting food. I really wanted to complain about those King Crab rolls but L wouldn't let me. L claimed that a true reviewer doesn't complain, so...I'll just complain on Yelp. You can definitely get better ""sushi"" at any CHEAP non-authentic Japanese sushi restaurant. It boggles my mind as to why this place is packed with diners.. did everyone receive a gift card as well?The spicy Thai dumpling soup was horrible but L was raised not to waste food. I had a sip of the broth. Nothing spicy about it, pure limey taste. We both knew exactly what it reminded us of. If you've ever had encebollado de pescado.. which is basically an Ecuadorian fish soup with pickled onions. The soup itself looked exactly like it, I would know, L was raised on it and I myself have had it numerous times. Nothing Thai about the dish. Thai soups are much more in depth this was plain acidic with old dumplings. My shrimp skewers were decent, not the freshest shrimp, but definitely edible and the sauce was good. L's hangar steak was cold, chewy and overcooked. It was salty, the fries were over-seasoned. I had the Kung pao chicken since it's one of their popular dishes. The rice was cold. The chicken is pretty good. White meat. Fried well, but over sauced for me. The chocolate peanut cake... oh what a disappointment. Barely any chocolate.. mostly peanut butter flavor... way too much unnecessary peanut powder. In the end I was just playing with his dessert. The only reason to come to Tao is their banana pudding. I'm not a fan of bananas and I actually liked it. Tempura fried banana wasn't greasy at all and the custard is really light with more slices of bananas mixed in. I brought it home since I only ate 1/3 of it but L finished it before I could get a bite.This is definitely a 1.5 rating since we did not enjoy the food, but service was fantastic. It's not the waiter's fault that Tao doesn't serve real food. I don't even know why they need chefs in the back since there's literally no skill involved in making their dishes. The sushi roll literally fell apart when I grabbed one and placed it gently on my plate. The food can't be made fresh since it comes out so fast.We're glad we finally got rid of our gift card so we never have to return... I actually ate a slice of pizza from My Pie just to cleanse my palate and it was so nice to have something that tasted fresh and not overly seasoned.",1,0,0,Marina C.,"East Elmhurst, NY",141,544,198

A drunk woman sitting behind us was dragged down to the floor and through the dining room after creating a scene. The managers and staff were in shock and it was apparent that no one knew what to do. It was also apparent that if this woman wanted to sue the restaurant she would win as she was thrown to the floor several times after she said she was calling 911 and would leave willingly once the police arrived. We told our server to please take away her cocktails and to tell management to simply leave her sitting there and call the police. That's when our server took the cocktails and another server called the police. I am sure several customers including the drunk woman called the police as well. In an effort to remove her 2 men who worked there threw her to the ground. She managed to get back to her seat and they did it again. She struck another woman in the head while kicking and screaming. It was terrible and unfortunately is considered abuse. It also really disrupted my mothers birthday party since we sat right in front of the drunk woman. The entire episode lasted about 10 minutes which is quite a long time to see cursing, fighting, screaming and dragging. It was not professional and it was scary. They need to have a staff training on what to do if this happens again. Everyone heard the lady's head hit the ground when the staff took her down. I am absolutely certain things like this don't happen often but the way it was handled was mortifying.

The appetizers were just ok but pricey. The bill came out to be $255 for the 3 of us. On top of that, we tipped the server 20%. The server didn't even bother thanking us for the tip.

Never once did I have to ask for more water. They refilled it at least 5 times. We had a salmon tartare appetizer that was delicious!! Would have liked it more if it had some crunch element and a tad more jalapeno, but still AMAZING. THEN,  I had the signature miso glazed Chilean sea bass, it was flaky and delicious, but a slight bit salty for my palette. I would have liked it better had it come included with rice. My friend tried the sea scallop but it was overwhelmingly salty that after two bites she sent it back and ordered the same dish as me, it came with rice but not enough to mask the saltiness. They gave us no problems for returning it. Scallops were huge and cooked properly. My other friend ordered the filet mignon. It was cooked medium, properly and of course, as tender as it should be, but it was missing wow factor. We had the huge fortune cookie dessert with fruit, molten chocolate cake, and some ice cream: BEST DESSERTS IVE EVER HAD, in my 27 years of existence!! That's saying something..We ate it all and it was sinfully delicious bite by bite.  So maybe food isn't Michelin star quality, but it's definitely still pretty good.

Both courses were great. The only improvement that could be made is a little more seasoning on the chicken in the Pad Thai. Good value for money.

Sniffing around for food. Absolutely disgusting. Lost my appetite and got quite mad. I love dogs, have three of my own, but do NOT want to go to a nice restaurant like this and eat with animals at my feet.  If I wanted to do that I'd stay and eat in my own kitchen.

I had looked at the menu prior to making reservations. Got the Pork Pot Stickers w/ a chili glaze (spicy) for starters. Then to share we got the Tao Angry Dragon Roll with Eel and Kabayaki Sauce & the Chef's Roll with Tuna, Salmon, Tobiko, Avocado; both were equally tasty, but we ended up sending back the Chef's roll and getting a second dragon roll. It just had to much of curry taste for us! We also ordered the Mandarin Sizzled Fried Rice with Roast Pork, Asian Green Stir Fry, along with the Dragon Tail Spare Ribs and a side of Sake Salmon & Unagi fresh water eel sashimi.

My favorite thing on the menu is the chillean sea bass because it's sweet,soft and practically melts in your mouth. The fortune cookie dessert is very good as well and pretty big.

The only downside to our experience was our seating. We had reservations which let us be seated right away. However, we were placed at a small table that was wedged between two others. We had to move our bags so the people next to us could have space. There were two floors and a decent amount of tables open so I don't know why we had to be squished into a crowded section. I recommend asking for a roomy table. The best part of the night, though, was the dessert. We got molten chocolate cake to share and it was absolutely perfect. The cake was warm and moist and it sat in a sugar cube shell that was beautiful and fun to break. It was served with vanilla ice cream and raspberry sauce. Our entrees were also great.

Hostess said she would text when the table was ready.  Restaurant was packed (they cram all the tables in and there's barely any room to walk).  There was no place to stand or get a drink at the downstairs bar so went to upstairs bar (also crowded) but managed to get a drink. Waited for an hour but no text.  Checked in with hostess and there were still two parties to be seated ahead of us.  Waited another 15 minutes on a bench near the stairs to the bathrooms (!) in the back of the restaurant and then left at 10:30 because we were hungry and had no place to wait and didn't want to wait another hour to try the food because the restaurant was still packed with large groups.  Got a text from the hostess at 10:35 that our table was ready - an hour and 20 minutes after we had the reservation.  No point in making a reservation at this place and there were no apologies for the long wait.

The pad thai was good but had too much egg in it. The waiters didn't come back to us to make sure everything was okay. I had requested a birthday dessert, and it never came.

The women who seated us ran off without me while I closed out our lounge tab leaving me a bit confused and wondering. Our waitress was great and so was the food. We had lobster wontons and rock shrimp apps, both delicious. The vegetable medley w noodles and orange chicken for entrees were great too. I have been a server and a hostess so I get that it can be frustrating and being late is super annoying but the way the entire hostess staff handled things was unsettling.

Today, was shopping around that area, my friend and I went in at about 430 to grab a quick bite and reminisce about how much we loved the place. It's been about eight years since I was last here, and I was surprised to see the place looks exactly the same.  No updates,  no upgrade, nothing whatsoever, exactly the same only two tables were occupied and yet we were asked if we had a reservation which was so stupid, should have been gone somewhere else but we still decided to sit down.  Even though almost on the tables were empty, we were seated right next to the kitchen.  We ordered drinks and appetizers, and the very snooty server told us that the chef preferred to put the entire order at the same time so can we please order our entire meal and dessert right away, you kidding me right? Since our drinks were on the table, we did not want to seem rude as we would've gotten up and left right away The appetizers were very OK, the dim sum was cold and very chewy, and the tempura was tasteless,  and given the attitude, we decided not to order any more food and paid the $80 bill and left  I do wish we would have just stuck to our memory of the place being awesome and not walked into this really snooty tourist trap today, very disappointed",0,0,0,Sensible R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,69,6

He enjoyed the steak but someone in the kitchen sprinkled an enormous amount of a dry powdered spice all over the frites. My chicken pad thai was one inedible mushy combination of sugar, tough chicken and noodles.  Dessert:  What could they do to banana pudding except use an inordinate amount of sugar?  Mango ice cream was a highlight.Service:  Revolving door servers who can get it to the table.Our busboy assumed we would want to take all of our uneaten food home, but we would never want to be reminded of it again.  Thankfully the place is so dark one wouldn't be able to really see the dishes.",0,0,0,Bea M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,22,0

Honestly, the food was pretty good (since it's the city and a popular place I guess overpriced drinks and food is accepted).The purpose of the 3-star review is from the upstairs bar/lounge. The chairs at the bar were all taken and a group of us came in, a bit early and decided to go to the bar. All the chairs were quickly taken, and the sushi bar on the left had empty chairs. I pulled one up to the bar discreetly (Full disclosure I had a full day of classes and a clinic internship, and I was carrying a huge bag- so even if not to sit on the chair but drop by stuff so my back wouldn't have to be strained). As soon as I put my jacket on the chair, a waiter walked up to me and informed me that I cannot have that chair, and proceeded to start to remove my own jacket from the seat so that he could move it back.The sushi bar had only two people and a bunch of empty chairs.

2,10/1/2016,Is this a theme park or a restaurant? After sampling it a few times it's more likely the former stuffed with a state of the art stereo system. It's as if the owners are hoping you'd be too occupied staring at statues of Buddha rather than paying attention to the food. Because as soon as you get over the music and the lights you realize the food is Asian-inspired bar grub masquerading as haute cuisine.

5,9/28/2016,"Best upscale Chinese food in NYC! Trust me my last name is Tao so I would know. TAO has amazing Asian cuisine and it's quite authentic flavor wise. I brought my relatives from China here to try the food and they thought all the flavors were comparable to the top restaurants in China. The ambience is as always amazing, a little dark for old folk but cool for the younger crowd. We tried almost everything and it was all delicious. The typhoon lobster can probably feed 10 people with just the claw, it was the size of the dinner plate. The sand pit lobster was also delicious, the scallops amazing, the steaks perfect, the lamb chops cooked to perfection, and the kung pao chicken always a favorite. For appetizers, you have to try the spicy salmon on the crispy rice. We also tried the duck spring rolls and lobster wontons which were equally as delicious.

4,9/8/2016,This is a review for the restaurant not the club downstairs. Tao is prob one of the most popular Asian cuisine restaurants in the city at the moment. Tao has multiple locations across the country. There is a restaurant upstairs and a club downstairs. I have eaten at the location in Vegas multiple times. But usually don't frequent the Manhattan location because it's always crowded. I love the Decor inside Tao. It's dark and there are statues and the colors are amazing and really set the Asian theme paired with your meal. You must make reservations!!!!  Or you can wait over 1 HR easily for a table. Tao is really popular with the younger crowd. I always see people bringing there dates or girlfriends here trying to show off. It's very loud inside. The mood is intimate. But you will more than likely have a hard time hearing of you bring someone on a date here. The food is always good and consistent. This is my personal opinion. I enjoy coming to Tao. But it is expensive. The food is good. But I could  get food that taste just the same but cheaper in the city. I truly believe you are paying for the NAME Tao! The food is still very good. But I would rather go to a quieter place for a date. Tao is great if you are going to have some dinner and then go party down stairs. They marketed that beautifully. I will be back to Tao. It's a place my friends frequent. I have never had a bad meal and any location across the country. Just make sure you make reservations or you will  be sorry!,7,4,4,Josh M.,"Manhattan, NY",540,547,2523
4,9/7/2016,"What an amazing place to celebrate my birthday. From our lovely waiter, to the tasty food and even tastier dessert.. It was a night to remember. We ordered the shishito peppers, spicy tuna in crispy rice and the lobster spring rolls to start. Everything was perfect and delicious. We ordered another spicy tuna on crispy rise (STCR) for how good it was. Our main dish was the sea bass of course. The miso topping on it was heavenly. Best dish hands down.

1,9/5/2016,"This was a colossal disappointment. We made a reservation for two and were seated at a communal table with two (actually very lovely) people. That was fine, I suppose. The waitress recommended the $43 sea bass to me and my partner ordered the orange chicken. After the food was served, it was super mediocre but since the waitress didn't come by at any point thereafter, we didn't get to voice this. Couldn't even get my water refilled. The waitress asked if we wanted anything else and I expressed my disappointment with the fish. Instead of apologizing she said told me that it was a very popular dish and that people have different tastes. Her lack of grace prompted me to ask for the manager. He was also terribly ungracious but reluctantly removed the fish from the check. That would typically have been enough for me to skip writing a review and write the evening off as an anomaly. Alas, the ladies at the other end of the table experienced a similarly poor quality of service and we commiserated about it. This place is really resting on its laurels.

4,9/4/2016,"Hands down one of the coolest looking places you'll ever eat dinner at. Dimly lit, loud house music playing, giant Buddha statue watching over you as you eat. It's trendy and fast paced inside. The place just oozes with New York attitude and style. My boyfriend and I ordered sake bombs and the presentation was impressive. Not your traditional sake bomb that requires you to pound on a table allowing the chopsticks to let your shot drop into your beer. It came in this contraption that dropped it in for you with the push of a button. $16 a piece, a bit steep but that's the city for you. We also ordered the shrimp tempura roll which surprisingly only came with 5 pieces. It was delicious but I expected a bigger portion. My favorite entree here has always been the wasabi encrusted filet. I actually order it every single time I'm here and I've been here a hand full of times. This particular time I think the wasabi crust topping was over cooked which gave it a burnt kind of taste, the steak itself was really good though. They also brought out our entree when we were still eating our appetizer, which I hate. They need to have better timing because a lot of people don't like that. I love this place though and I wouldn't let something like that deter me from coming back but I definitely will start trying other things on the menu from now on! Also,the location is perfect! You are steps away from the 5th avenue shops and a 5 minute walk to Central Park! Tao is a must if you are around this area!",2,2,3,Danielle M.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",686,115,307

4,8/28/2016,"We held a friend's birthday party here the other Friday night. There were 8 of us, so we ordered a bottle of Sake and Wine to share, as well as the sampler appetizer platter. It runs about $25 a head, but it contains 5-6 of their most popular appetizers (favorites of ours were the sea bass and tuna over rice crisps). For entrees, most got the Pai Thai and like it. I ordered the peking duck fried rice. Very good and a hearty serving.Considering how popular it is, we made a reservation in advance for our large party. They only seat full parties and hold the reservation for 15 mins, so make sure you're all there and on time! We had one get stuck in traffic, but the hostess was accommodating and sat us anyways. The wait staff was also excellent. Our waitress was attentive and friendly. The ambiance is pretty amazing as well. This place is deceiving large with tables on 3 floors. All have a great view of the giant Buddha and koi pond in the back. A perfect lively, trendy spot to celebrate or catch-up with friends. Overall, my experience at Tao was excellent. The only reason I knocked a star off is due to the exceptionally high price tag. I'll be back regardless!",0,0,1,Marelle C.,"Manhattan, NY",192,154,0
4,8/27/2016,"Took my boyfriend here this past Friday after making reservations earlier in the week. Embarrassingly, the woman couldn't find my name on the list for what turned out to be a misspelling of my name on the reservation list, despite being called twice earlier in the day to confirm my reservation. For poor hostess service and the fact we had to wait for a table, I took a star off. However, the dining experience, atmosphere, food, and waitress service was great. Appetizers are hands-down the best part of the menu. Chilean sea bass and miso glaze: Melts in your mouth, and makes you die a little from happiness.Wagyu appetizer: ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. Came out looking like a pizza since it's thinly sliced and topped with herbs and bean sprouts, but you could tell how smooth and tender the meat was when pulling pieces of it off the dish. Imperial Vegetable Rolls: Nothing special. It's just big. Wouldn't waste money getting this again. The wasabi sauce it comes with also burned my sinuses. Entrees were good, but definitely not as good as the appetizers:Chinese Sausage and Fried Egg over Fried Rice: Very solid entree choice, and I can see why it's a yelp review favorite. A perfect blend of meat, veggies, and rice.  Curry Scallops: You get 4 huge scallops in spicy curry sauce with some white rice on the side. First time having scallops, and that spiced coconut curry sauce is a dream. Desserts: Banana Pudding: OKAY, so honestly, I got this only because I saw so many crazed reviews about it. I love to bake, and I've made banana pudding based on the Magnolia Bakery recipe, and TAO's pudding tastes EXACTLY THE SAME. The only difference is that TAO puts two fried bananas and crumbles extra wafers (and I suspect graham crackers) on top of the pudding for added crunch. BUT, from my experience, making banana pudding of pretty much the same quality and flavor costs only $1 per serving while TAO charges $11. A brilliant way to profit, but if you've ever been to Magnolia's Bakery OR like to bake yourself, this pudding is nothing special, and you can easily make it at home.Service: Super cheerful waitress, who made you feel welcomed at every moment. Also our water glasses were never empty. Price:Total bill was ~$150 not including tip. I think this is a fair price considering the quality of the food and experience, and hopefully knowing the price will help others determine whether or not to go here for their next date/dinner!  What I recommend you get: 1) Wagyu Appetizer 2) Chilean Sea Bass Entree (you get two skewers with a chunk for the appetizer, but it's so good, you'll probably want more) 3) Banana pudding ONLY if you've never had it before",0,0,0,C J.,"Warren, NJ",457,59,2

4,8/18/2016,"Came here tonight for business dinner! Upon walking in you are greeted by a dimly lit Buddha statue. The ambiance in Tao is trendy. There's dim lighting, loud music and awesome Buddha and Asian cultural influences while maintaining a gritty New York attitude! Our party sat near the stairs facing the giant Buddha. To be honest, Tao reminds me of The Sea in Brooklyn. Although if I had been to Tao first I would probably say the same thing about The Sea. In the background there is deep house music playing. Think I caught the song Deep Inside in the background ha.Upon reading some Yelp reviews I wanted to try the cocktails and got the:Lychee martini - sweet lychee, but tasted just like lychee juice&Ruby red dragon - was recommended by waiter, had a pomegranate juice taste, not strong alcohol, not sweet. Neither of these cocktails really impressed me but the rest of our party enjoyed theirs. For dinner we ordered appetizers to share:Hot edamame - what you expect, plain tasting, needs saltTuna tartar - memorable, tuna was good.Chicken satay - a bit dry, definitely use the peanut sauceSatay of Chilean sea bass w/miso glaze - AMAZING!! Melts in your mouth, sweet, tender. For dinner entree I chose the:Chinese sausage fried rice with fried egg because i read some reviews of other Yelper's experiences. The fried rice was good, but it wasn't what I expected in terms of flavor. It tasted like typical fried rice and to me was lacking some flavor maybe hot sauce. I got to also try the Pad Thai, but I also think it was missing a kick of spice for me. I definitely should've gotten the Chilean sea bass for my dinner entree as the majority of our party did and they thoroughly enjoyed that. Overall experience: I think Tao has good potential in the Asian fusion delicacy, maybe I am harsh because I've grown up around Asian cuisine my whole life, but I can see why many people enjoy Tao. Nonetheless the service in Tao was amazing, never had to ask for food, drinks or refill, as the staff was always refilling our cups or there for us before we needed them. I really appreciated that! The service is really what brought this place to a 4 star for me because I was a bit let down by the food besides the Chilean Sea Bass. I'll be back to try some other items like the Waygu beef.Thanks Tao!",3,0,1,Derek M.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",462,181,286
2,8/18/2016,"In my opinion, this place is just a fancier version of P.F. Chang's targeted for a younger crowd. I don't think that anybody here is actually trying to get some authentic Asian food, but rather just food and drinks. I was here with my coworkers, and we ordered a wide array, from appetizers all the way to dessert. The food here is not bad, but not great - there's not much more to say about that or to go into specifics. Where the food lacks, this place clearly tries to make up for with presentation and the overall environment. The music is blasting here, so forget trying to have a conversation at normal volumes. It's like being at a club, but sitting down with a drink waiting for a seat. The dining area is also packed, like tables at a shopping mall cafeteria.

4,8/18/2016,"I'm giving Tao a 4 star review because the service was very good and pretty good food with large portions. But while the decor is very lavish and exciting to look at, the whole pan-Asian cuisine and decor was a little overwhelming in not a good way. I have no problem with the huge Buddha. I think it's grand and stunning. But looking at a hostess who isn't Chinese wearing a qipao in a ""pan Asian"" restaurant was a bit bothersome. It's not a costume to put on for patrons of the restaurant. Also the overwhelming amount of photos of just Asian people, mainly elderly. I see where they were going, but the point is that Asia as a continent is not one conglomerate. So seeing an overwhelming amount of photos of East Asians (and somehow no one else despite the abundance of Thai food on the menu). This includes photos of monks also. It didn't sit with me well. However, in regards to the food for restaurant week/ lunch prix fixe, it's a great deal. The portions are huge. I liked my vegetable spring rolls a lot. I had the hanger steak for an entree. I liked the steak a lot but the fries were far too salty. Like I could barely eat them, and I loooove steak and fries so I was disappointed. The banana pudding was also a big serving (especially after all that food) but very good. There's a small fried banana, banana pudding, a crunch topping and pieces of cake and banana mixed in. All in all I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food and the size. The service was great. But again, the vibe coming off the decor...

It made me sad to know that I would not be able to get a dish like this at home. My friend ordered the Kung Pao Chicken, and it was much more similar to a sweet and sour chicken.

Service is fine, but they don't really go out of their way for hospitality. They are unwilling to separate checks or take more than four cards, so large groups will probably want to avoid this place. It's their loss though, our group took up the table for quite some time figuring out how to pay.

4,7/15/2016,"Tao has a pretty unbeatable lunch prix rice! I wanted to take my sister somewhere special for her birthday and the goal was to make her feel like a queen! Pono was our server and he made her experience feel like a priority. He told us interesting stories about the space itself. How once, it was a theater and before that a horse stable for the wealthy and if you looked at the back wall you could still see those details. The space here is stunning from giant statues and a koi pond. It's an escape from the hustle bustle of midtown. My sister was impressed and thrilled.I always get the same app and dessert schtick for my prix fixe meal. Always start with the veggie rolls. They are gigantic, filing and delicious. The second course, I have had a seared tuna salad but this time I had the branzino and it was spectacular. Two beautiful fillets. Dessert deserves a drum roll. This is literally the best banana pudding in town. And it comes with one deep fried banana that at first resembles a Twinkie. And then when dip in the layers of cookies and pudding and hot banana, you are experiencing dessert ecstasy!! And when I pretended to have to head to the restroom to get a candle in the dessert for my sister..Pono was like, you are too late, it's taken care of. They had a happy birthday sign in chocolate and the candles in strawberries. And Pono and I belted out happy birthday and my sister was so happy!

5,7/12/2016,"Came here after dinner at Lavo this past Saturday night for drinks in the lounge. The front lounge is an awesome spot to grab late night drinks or cocktails before dinner. Even with a reservation, they usually make you wait at least 20-30 minutes here for dinner, so it's nice to have the dark intimate lounge with couches to relax in. You can actually eat in the lounge too, but it gets very crowded from around 5-11 or so on any weekend night. Drinks I'd recommend are the tao hito and lychee martini. They pump deep house vibes through the speakers in the lounge to enhance the mood. For dinner, there are two levels, and I prefer upstairs. The third floor is the private skybox room, have never been up there but seems cool. There's a giant Buddha statue with a koi pond underneath at the back of the restaurant that I always make sure to visit before leaving. As far as dinner goes, it's great Asian fusion food. We've been coming here for about 8 years now, and I can recommend the sushi, the kung pao chicken, the seared pepper steak, and of course the giant fortune cookie. So good! The guys who own Lavo and Tao are doing it right. There's also another bar/lounge on the second floor at the back if the downstairs entry lounge is too packed. In the winter this place is overrun, but in the summer when everyone heads out to the hamptons it's much quieter.I've come here for New Year's Eve open bar too, pricey but a great night. They removed all the tables and brought in a dj in the main room, was a great night. This place is super trendy, not a place to bring the parents unless they are open minded as it is loud too!

2,7/11/2016,"I went to Tao (uptown) for dinner on Thursday evening and it was all good till I saw the bill. Now, I have been to Tao a few times, I like the vibe and food there. What happened is saw a bill of $8.50 for ""still water"", which is essentially filtered water served in their own bottled flasks. It's not bottled water but basically filtered tap water. I do get it that its an expensive place and but I also feel very strongly that if a place is charging you so much for food and drinks, should have the decency to serve drinking water (not even factory bottled water) for free. Basically for me it was being charged for ""tap water"" and mind you the waitress wasn't forthcoming in explaining ""different types of water"". Anyway, usually my experience at Tao is decent but this one thing (charge for water) really was a dampener. Its a total rip off.

4,7/6/2016,"Pretty legit place, the prices are a bit high though for what you're getting. Let me simplify, don't get any of the non fusion dishes, aka anything that sounds pure chinese. It tastes like chinese take-out, TRUST ME, we ordered the lou mien with pork and it is identical to take-out lou mien with pork. The kung pao chicken too, sadly.What you do want to get is the sea bass and fuck that is good, definitely 5/5. The lobster won tons are also legit as hell. The dragon spare ribs are legit too. These are the things (the more fusion/western), the dishes, that you want. The ambiance is cool, giant budda on top of a live japanese koi pond as you can sort of see from the pictures. Definite loungy vibe in the entrance and bar area and even carries over to the dining area. I'd come back again, but certainly avoiding anything that sounds like a pure chinese dish. We spent 72$ a person, i'd say it would be worth it if the chicken and lou mien pork dish were replaced with actual fushion dishes that are on par with the other good dishes i mentioned.",1,1,1,Xi L.,"New York, NY",176,484,179

And they told us it would cost $25 for that service.              The cake that I got had macaroon toppings. But when the cake was served none of us got the macaroons.

So pretty much we paid $25 to get our macaroons stolen/eaten by the workers. And now I'm mad cause I wanna know where the hell are my macaroons?

It's also dimly lit inside with very cool, sleek decor filled with status and flowers.  Favorite Menu items:-TAO Angry Dragon Roll with Eel -Rock Shrimp Lettuce Cups-Sweet Onion Rings -TAO Lo Mein with Roast Pork -Kung Pao ChickenAll of these food options were both delicious and extremely filling. Things to note: -Dress to impress, it is very upscale/classy.-Make reservations well ahead of time.-Great place to go for date night if you want somewhere romantic.

The two orders of filet were overlooked even though we requested medium rare. The meat in the lo mein tasted a bit off. When we got home two of our guests became very ill, both had eaten the lo mein and were ill throughout the night.

Service was great, the staff accommodated to all of my parties needs without any hesitation. The food was delicious. My starters were the Rock Shrimp Lettuce Cups along with the Sweet Onion Rings. For the main course me & my date shared the Kung Pao Chicken, the TAO Lo Mein with Roast Pork, along with the TAO Angry Dragon Rolls. All fantastic selections!The Cons: My biggest issue was the location of the bathroom. If seated on second floor be prepared of the hassle of making your way down to the basement, which is honestly how I would describe the location of the restroom in TAO. The items on the menu were a tad overpriced but that's to be expected with prices in Manhattan.  The portion sizes were slightly disappointing.

3,6/6/2016,I really give it a 2.5 and that's ONLY because of the ambiance and decor of this place.My family and I had reservations at 8 but did not get seated till around 8:30-840ish. Let's start by saying this place is on the expensive side. Something you should expect from a place such as Tao. I decided to go basic and order the orange chicken. $32 and it doesn't include a side of rice. Rice was an additional $8. Hard to believe but sum it up and you're basically paying $40 for orange chicken.... Long story short I would rather eat pandas expresses orange chicken. I also tried 5 other dishes from family members and those dishes were mediocre as well. Food is way over priced for the quality you get here. I feel like the people who left reviews here stating the food is good cant overlook the decor of the place. The ONLY thing I liked about Tao was the the bid Buddha statue and ceiling. Music was also loud so it's hard to speak to each other. Would I come back? No. Would I recommend anyone to eat here? No. 2.5 stars from me,0,0,0,Kody V.,"Herndon, VA",187,72,28

I also tried the overly sweetened Pad Thai... no thank you. And I also ordered the ""pecking duck"" fried rice, which did not actually come with pecking duck, but just duck. Service is slow.

2,4/27/2016,"I rarely write negative reviews, but felt in this case that I needed to.To start off on a positive note, the food at TAO is incredible and delicious.  Everyone in our party loved their meal and was happy with it.  The decor in Tao is beautiful, and definitely ""picture perfect"".  Despite the two big positives, the staff at this location was BEYOND rude, which completely ruined our experience.  I made a reservation a month in advance.  It was for a party of six for my friend's bachelorette party.  The party (especially the bride to be) was more than thrilled and excited to go to Tao, as it looked amazing online.  Our reservation was at 8:30pm.  We arrived on Saturday night, ten minutes early.  We were told we would have to wait ""a few minutes"" from one of the hostesses, which we completely understood because it was Saturday night and we were a few minutes early.  We waited...and waited...and waited.  At 9:00pm, one of my friends VERY politely asked the hostess when we would be seated (as she has worked in the restaurant industry for years, she considers politeness and understanding to be extremely important).  The hostess very rudely informed her that it would be ""10 more minutes"".  She did not apologize for the wait, give a quick explanation, or even try to act nice or smile.  At 9:25pm, another friend approached the hostess, again being quite polite (despite the fact that we had been waiting for nearly an hour over our reservation time).  This time, the hostess was even ruder, and again, did not apologize.  My friend asked for the manager.  When the manager came out, he was not friendly or apologetic.  He looked at us as if WE were being the rude ones, as we were asking why things were taking so long.  He did not once apologize or sympathize with us.  Finally, at 9:40pm, we were seated.Upon arriving at our table, our waiter was not kind or welcoming.  He did not introduce himself, but simply looked irritated (and I do not believe he knew that we had been waiting).  I VERY kindly informed him (thinking that he didn't have anything to do with the seating delay) that we had been waiting for over an hour, so we had time to look at the menu, and everyone knew what they wanted and were quite hungry. I asked if we could order (and not have the standard ""look at the menu time"".) He nodded, did not smile or act hospitable, and took our orders.  We were all taken aback by how unwelcoming he was (I do not even know his name because I am fairly certain he did not give it).Finally the food came out (which I again state, was quite delicious).  One of my friends did not receive her dinner.  Upon telling the waiter, he did not apologize or admit the mistake, but instead looked annoyed and asked her what she wanted.  I have NEVER seen a waiter act rude to a guest as if THEY were being annoying when the guest is being kind to the waiter (I understand that sometimes rude guests deserve some rudeness back, but we were being EXTREMELY polite).  My friend, understandably, was quite upset (and hungry).  She THEN became angry at the waiter, telling him how unprofessional he was being and how we had not ONCE been given an apology from anyone on the staff.  He stared at her, did not apologize or admit a mistake, and said that her food would be out soon.  After that, our waiter never returned to our table.  He never once came back to see if we wanted drinks or just to check on us.  Not ONCE.  Someone else brought my friend's delayed dinner.  At one point, we wondered if maybe our waiter had gone home, but saw him, minutes later, across the restaurant.When we were done eating, the manager came over to our table and told us he had ""comped a dessert"".  He never once apologized or admitted that we had been not been given the best service or anything of that nature.  We didn't need a free dessert.  We just needed some kindness from the staff and ONE apology. In conclusion, if you are going here for great food (and only that), it is a nice place to go to.  However, if you are going here for great service and a wonderful evening, I would recommend going elsewhere.",0,0,0,Sam C.,"Middletown, CT",0,8,0

I understand their is a busy wait for walk-ins, but to have a reservation and still have to wait over an hour for your table is outrageous! Not only do they not turn enough tables but they make you think twice before making a reservation at any time. The only reason i give an stars is because the servers are very knowledgeable and make you ordering different dishes easier , i had the 100yr old Kobe beef for 2 that was $300 dollars , but it was well worth it melts like butter in your mouth , the appetizer was the Oysters which you could tell were fresh , obviously not caught that same day but they weren't frozen nor were they smelly so on the $$ , will definitely come back for the sushi which is usually delicous!",0,0,0,John B.,"Staten Island, NY",0,7,6

And has saved my a$$ on numerous occasions. Their delivery and service is always impeccable. And the display of their catering orders is unparalleled.

Overall we did not have any issues with our food or service.I ended the night with two cocktails called the Pama Sutra and Lychee Martini.  The Pama Sutra was my favorite; it had tequila, pomegranate liquer, and fresh lime.Overall great experience, but for the price point,  I believe there are better options in the area.",3,2,3,Rashon B.,"Atlanta, GA",97,43,27
5,4/19/2016,"I went to Tao a few weeks ago with a friend who suggested that we try it out. From the very beginning, it was a wonderful experience. The decor of the restaurant is unique. It has beautiful sculptures and a classy atmosphere that is both sophisticated and inviting. The ambience is comfortable and the lighting gives the restaurant a cool demeanor. The food matches the elegance of Tao's design. My friend and I started with the Sushi, which was well made. The main dishes included seafood and grilled pork, which were prepared with great care and were incredible. We finished the meal with a nice desert dish that featured ice cream, brownies, and fresh berries.This is perhaps the most authentic Asian food in all of New York.

5,4/3/2016,"Early turn of the century, can't remember the exact year probably '02 but what I do remember is the feeling of first walking into Tao. One word EPIC. Like walking onto the set of an Indiana Jones movie. Very surreal, majestic feeling comes over you. If it's your first visit get their earlier than you reservation go to the second floor bar, order a Taotini and take it all in. The views the ambiance the music. I'll just say all of your senses are going to go for a ride. Every time I walk in or out of Tao I feel the same. Like I went on a vacation for a few hours. You walk through the doors and your on the other side of the world. Any time you can get that feeling while living,  working and more importantly surviving  in this city of ours I can't put a price on Tao. It's my daycation destination after long day or week. Coming here often for 13 years the staff has changed often and I don't think I have every had a reason to complain about any service. Management is on point. The food is consistent. My favorite dish the Satay of Chilean Sea Bass with Miso Glaze hasn't changed since I started coming here. I crave it. Everything on the menu is done right and delicious. I haven't had a bad dish yet in my visits. Someone asked me once if it was authentic Chinese food. My only response I could think of was that it was the best of what ever it was that I ate.

My cousin had the shrimp and her mom had a chicken dish that was probably the best thing out of all. Service was ok. Not great. For 3 people the tab was $200 with tip. So not worth it.

1,3/29/2016,"We went to Tao (E. 58th St.) for a surprise birthday dinner of 10 people on a Saturday night. Big mistake! It was for my sister's 60th birthday and I arrived with 6 helium balloons. I was told by the doorman(?), and then the manager, that I would not be allowed to bring the balloons in as they might escape and be stuck on the 40-foot ceilings. I was told I had to leave the balloons in the coat room. I explained that I had weights to tie the balloons down, it didn't matter. When we entered without the balloons the noise level was extreme and the entry/bar area is so crowded that there is almost nowhere to stand. We had asked for a table in a quieter corner, this didn't seem to be part of the reservation. They seated us on the main floor, although it was questionable if even being on the balcony would have made a difference. All evening there is a pounding, unrelenting bass beat (not any music that we could discern, just a beat) that must be at 80-90 decibels. It makes talking to anyone other than the person immediately next to you impossible. The restaurant is also significantly dark and several of us needed to use our phones or lights to see the menu. Half our party was 20+ year olds, and they equally found the volume ear shattering, to the point of causing headaches. To be fair, we found the food and service to be good, and they didn't rush us out. I would say the restaurant is predominantly a hangout for 20 somethings that want to feel trendy. All night long people are taking photos of themselves with the giant Buddha in the background. So if you want some decent food and a trendy place, perhaps this restaurant is for you. But if you value your hearing, wish to speak during your meal, and would enjoy reading the menu without extra light, I would look for somewhere else. It's a fairly pricey restaurant and you can do better somewhere else with a more pleasant experience. Under no circumstance would any of us return to Tao.

1,3/12/2016,"Why eat here?I get being seen at Tao. There's that incredible Buddha, that Eastern inflected house music that seamless flows from one song to another, those sweet yet strong cocktails. It's a place for the Gram, a place to show off to your friends in Ohio on Facebook or put in the back of a Snapchat filter.But the primary activity here is eating and on that score, Tao falls woefully short. This is Asian food for people who think that Asia is a country. There's more sugar in these entrees than the entire kitchens of certain restaurants in Hunan province.Let's review the some of the menu sections. We start with dim sum, a rather rigidly defined set of Cantonese small plates served in the morning. Here they just the first of two appetizer sections, including a Peking roll (from Beijing), a Chicken Gyoza (Japan) and Pork Spring Roll (Thailand). Not one of these dishes would be recognizable as dim sum, although all have certainly met the deep fryer .Small plates include edamame, which is hard to screw up, a run of the mill salad and several items of seaweed. This are a large number of options, but ask for advice and waitress will helpfully push towards the wagyu. For poultry, you have a condensed version of what is served at PF Changs: Crispy Orange Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken, a huge Peking Duck and something healthy called ""roasted thai Buddha chicken."" None of these are any good. If for someone reason you find yourself here for a meal, steer towards the raw and simple. The sashimi is better than you might expect, and it's hard to go wrong with the self-cooked pieces of meat from the shabu shabu. Avoid the fried items, skip the dumplings and definitely stay away from the desserts. The very worst part about Tao is the price. This food would still be bad if it was one-third the price, but it wouldn't be offensive. Instead I worry there might be dinners turned off from Chinese or Japanese food because they had to spend $11 on edamame, $14 on an egg roll or $30 for orange chicken. When you are spending more than $80 a person on a lunch that doesn't include alcohol or dessert, it needs to impress.

As for the appetizers, I think the shrimp tempura was definitely my favorite. The shrimps were huge and the sauce that accompanied it was even better. The chicken satay was good too but I preferred the shrimps a little more. The main course and appetizers were extremely filling nonetheless.And of course, there is no better way of ending a birthday dinner at TAO than getting the giant fortune cookie at the end, right? The cookie was actually really awesome, loved the chocolate and vanilla custard filling too. And when they say it's giant, it's really very giant. I could not finish the cookie to save my life, my bestfriend had to devour it. Overall though, I think this place is great for any special event. It doesn't come off every daunting and gives off an amazing sexy ambience that I loved! I think my only critique would be the long wait time even after making reservations. My bestfriend had reserved a 7:30pm table and the restaurant had told us there was a 15 minute hold. Even though we got here long before the hold had even begun, we had to wait till 8:15pm for a table. That is why I am giving the restaurant a four instead of a five rating, reservation timings is something they need to work on. But regardless though, I wouldn't mind coming back to celebrate another birthday!",2,1,0,Fariha K.,"Bronx, NY",113,171,103

The food however was lackluster (perhaps with the exception of the lobster/shrimp roll in the dim-sum menu - which frankly is a roll not a dim-sum guys...). The wagyu pepper steak was hard to distinguish from a common Chinese fast food beef plate. Food aside, I was a little let down by how rushed serving was - let us enjoy the atmosphere! We weren't even done with starters that we were served with the main course - begs the question, did you guys already have it cooling off somewhere until we're ready for it?One last thing - don't take away our plates one at a time as we're going, that is NOT good service...

When you arrive they give you one of those vibrating and flashing things to let you know when your table is ready. If you're early you don't get one. If your party isn't all present you don't get one. I can understand not seating a table if not everyone is present but not giving the 'beeper' is just a bit bizzare.

Ordered various starters which were mediocre ( especially the peking duck spring rolls), the chicken satay was not very authentic. Aus our main course we ordered various plates and types of sushi. We ordered around 5 pieces of O-Toro Sushi Nigiri, one of them with a big hair on- very disappointing. After That we had the Pad Thai and the Peking Duck ( Which our friend from china confirmed had nothing to do with a peking duck). Service was not good at all. The waiter was rude and grumpy. Filling our wine glasses up very fast just so he could bring us a new one. The Desert on the other hand was very good. The Doughnuts especially.

3,2/20/2016,"My reasons for going to TAO were on the selfish side, I heard a story about someone's first day on the first job and 15 years later they still had vivid memories of it because their manager treated them to a fabulous lunch. And I wanted someone to remember me too, after I'm long gone, even if it was for a faint moment, I would somehow exist again in memory.An that opportunity came with a new coworker and I took it. That being said I felt Tao would be an experience for both of us since ether of us have ever been there, but we heard about the place, it was famous!!!I made online reservations and ask to be seated under the Chinese Calligraphy ceiling or next to the giant Buda and the ponds. But when I got there I was seated in the rear sofa section under the U shape balcony seating space that was made in order to increase restaurant's capacity,The balcony make the space under it real dark and hard to see the food.The place was only 20% full at the time so I don't understand why they put me there. So no view of the ceiling, nor the Buda or the ponds. Then they seated another couple next to us in the same sofa who were yapping loud. My quest for immortality were fading real fast. We had a variety of items from the dinner menu and not the lunch time special, but most of which were not memorable or signature dishes, except for two, I'm not a tea person but Tao had this delicious green tea, that I had to ordered another pot.  And I liked the taste of the thin slice filet mignon that you cooked in a ginger scallion broth that is boiling at your table with some wasabi dipping sauce, The only problem is they sell the meat by the oz and it was hard to visualize how much you should order. The service was so so, and slow and we skipped the desert since we were here already over two hours for a lunch break from the job. And after we got the bill the waiter never came back to us, so we just left after leaving the cash after waiting 10 minutes.Would I come back, maybe, because after all that my coworker was still impressed and raving about the experience.

Did she really just ask us this?!? We are all medical professionals and in the midst of us reuniting and splitting the bill 9 ways with cash and cards this was not done on purpose.  I asked how much did we tip.  She said $36 on a $402 bill.  Even though the service was subpar we would never tip that low it was just miscommunication or miscalculations.  We all started opening our purses to get out more money.  She stood there with a cold, snobby look on her face.  As my one classmate handed her $40 she said that's enough took the money and walked away! From the beginning we were apologetic, she never once said thank you, sorry for the confusion any of that!!! We could not believe this happened to us!

5,12/26/2015,"I came here to celebrate a friend's birthday, and I was highly impressed with the food, but not with the atmosphere. We had a reservation, but ended being seated an hour after the time we reserved. The waiting area was an overcrowded bar lounge that was so loud that it was hard to hold a decent conversation and be able to hear. The workers and other customers were trying to get through, and were pretty rude about trying to get through. How do you expect me to move for you if this place is jam-packed enough as it is? I'm trying my best not to be flush against another friend while still giving you room to get by, so it would be nice not to glare at me and realize that if you were in my position, this would be the best you could do too. Throughout the entire wait, I was constantly pulling in my friends so people could get by, but honestly, if they just had a more spacious waiting area that was not where the bar was, people would not be so frustrated trying to wedge through people.Once my group was seated, the service was nice, they constantly made sure our glasses were filled. Most of us ordered the Wok Seared New York Sirloin with a side of shiitake mushrooms and potatoes. The steak was perfectly medium rare, had a nice sear, and very tender. The sauce was slightly salty, but since I prefer food that is heavier on the salt, it was fine for me. The potatoes were crisp and colored wonderfully. We finished off the night with the famous giant fortune cookie filled with chocolate and vanilla mousse. I was never a fan of fortune cookies that come free with Chinese takeout, so I was a bit hesitant to try this. But since it was all over Instagram and a top favorite, I couldn't resist the temptation. The vanilla mousse was much better than the chocolate mousse, but that might be because I'm not huge on chocolate flavored sweets. The fortune cookie itself was light and better than I expected--definitely did not taste like the cheap fortune cookies. The texture and flavor is similar to a belgian waffle cookie, it's crisp and has a strong vanilla flavor. Overall, the food was delectable, but the music volume could definitely be lowered drastically--I felt like I had no choice but to converse with only the people seated closest to me, or risk losing my voice screaming across the table.",1,0,0,Annie K.,"Manhattan, NY",62,163,1377

And to top it all off, when we said we were leaving, the head hostess just said in a very sarcastic and snarky manner - ""enjoy"".  I am not sure how the food would have been after all these years but the abysmal service was enough to turn me off from even staying for the food.

I went with a friend on a Thursday at 6pm. Make sure to make reservations! I have to say that every inch of this restaurant is so well thought-out, it is a sight for sore eyes. From the waiting lounge to the seat dividers to the fork and chopstick holders, and of course the beautiful ceiling and the Buddha in the middle of a pond .... The ambiance is gorgeous. Even the bathroom is awesome! There are perfumes and other random things you might need while out. Anyway, Tao is perfect for dates and fancy get-togethers. We ordered the Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice for our appetizer. Loved it. I got the Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon with Tempura of Onion Rings. It wasn't the best steak I've ever had (compared with, say, Capital Grille or Benjamin's), but it was still pretty great. I'm not so sure the wasabi went so well with the meat, but I was curious to try it and I'm glad I did. Loved that they cut it up for me so it was easy to eat.  Friend got a roll of sake and a roll of smoked sake. I had a piece of each and loved them.

Made it hard to hear people around the table-None of the veggies dishes stuck out - very very standard pad thai (we all thought it was too sweet), simple lo mein noodles with a small amount of tofu, and the asian greens were like any other I've had - would expect more creativity when paying premium prices -Way too pricey - I think our veggie dishes were in the 20-30s and the meat dishes the other individuals ordered were easily higher.

After which we all ordered their specialty drinks that were out of this world and off course were brought out a shot each on the house. Whatever that shot was, It was outstanding. Top 5 mixed shots I ever had. We did order entrees and they were really good, I got a spicy/sweet chicken dish and it was spot on! After all this they served us all of there desserts and when I mean all I MEAN ALL!!!

Servers can get a little overwhelmed once the bar lounge gets crowded, but they do their best. I would suggest either sitting directly at the bar or reserve a table for more immediate service. The restaurant has a very warm, loungey, club vibe with the latest hits playing in the background. You'll find a bunch of after work groups, handsome looking visitors and celebs frequenting this joint. As for the food, most dishes are prepared properly and as one Yelper mentioned, food choices here are a bastardized version of popular Asian cuisines. My favorite of those altered food options has been the Sea Bass. A nice sized piece of glazed Sea Bass cooked to perfection every time. Bathrooms are downstairs, so if you're on the balcony level be prepared to go down two flights. If you've never been, be prepared to come out of your pocket a bit as dinner can be pricey; you're paying for the name and location of the restaurant after all. Lunch is much more pocket friendly.

I have had better Thai food from hole in the wall places that offer lunch specials at a quarter of the price. As a self proclaimed foodie I am beyond disappointed; I'm mortified. The management team needs to taste their food and seriously decide if this is the kind of food they think should be served at such a well developed venue.

We started with the pork potstickers and they were so amazing I've been craving them since we left 2 days ago. Perfect way to start the meal and very light on the stomach so you still have plenty of room for the entrees. I got orange chicken and my boyfriend got tuna then we split the lo mein. The orange chicken and tuna were both very typical but still good, but the lo mein was delicious. The man next to me did think the orange chicken looked unbelievable that he just had to get it after he saw me eating it. The dessert finished the night off on a great note.

4,10/7/2015,"My friends and I celebrated a very special occasion here on a Monday evening. Somehow the reservations were a bit screwed up, so upon arrival we had to wait for an extra 10-15 minutes for a table. It was really crowded. Barely any room for movement. See, I've been to the Tao on 9th Street and it's beautiful and spacious so I was a bit disappointed seeing this one being so cramped. I guess I'm comparing the two, but we were finally seated.We sat a round table for 6 not too far from the 16 foot Buddha. We ordered drinks and our food as well. Our waiter wasn't the best but he was there I guess. My Patron Margarita was super weak. I didn't feel my usual 'umph'...my best friend tried it and said the same thing so I know I wasn't going crazy. I ordered the Typhoon Lobster with Fingerling Potatoes & Spicy Stir Fry. I am not a steak lover and I have this phobia of chicken not being chicken at Japanese/Chinese restaurants. (Thanks Facebook). So my only option was seafood, then the food came!I get pleasant flashbacks thinking of my food. My lobster was the best I've had in a very long time. So well seasoned and juicy! Everything was satisfying until I tried a potato...honestly the potato tasted as if I put a teaspoon of salt in my mouth so I didn't eat the potatoes but everything else was awesome and fulfilling. Once everyone finished their plate we had to keep asking the other waiters to send for our waiter...he was gone for quite some time then he'd show up & do it all over again. But we finally caught him and ordered the Giant Fortune Cookie Platter for desert.Desert was pretty cool. We basically tasted everything that was on the desert menu and dibbled & dabbled into it. But the best part of the night was reading our fortunes. Mine read ""If you got some action last night...Smile."" There definitely wasn't any smiling for me  but my friends fortune read ""That wasn't chicken."" Lmao she had the Chicken Pad Thai!!!!! I never laughed so hard before. How twisted!

I was not interested in ordering the traditional Asian foods on their menu so I settled for the Wasabi crusted steak either onion rings--- NO. Horrible. The wasabi ""crust"" was a nasty mash, ugh, just an unpleasant texture in your mouth. The steak was way over cooked for a medium rare, way too chewy. Did I mention once you take away the failure of a ""crust,"" it has no seasoning and no flavor? But for a $43 steak, I doused it with soy sauce and ate it anyway. If I didn't have any sauce, I wouldn't have even ate it. And service here, sorry you can do so much better. More standard than standard for such a restaurant on the upscale side. The server was more friendly than our actual waiter. At least he came to fill our water without asking, while we can ask a million times and try to flag our waiter down and she would be nowhere to be found. And when I go out I can't go without a drink, and I LOVE peach, once I saw the peach cosmopolitan I ordered it right away. I mean, it's a classic how do you go wrong? No peach flavor. That's the worse. To give a peach lover a peach Cosmo with no peach. It wasn't bad but wasn't what I expected. It was just fruity like gummy bears, but very light alcohol.

We had to keep looking for our waiter and ended up asking random employees to help us because he would always be missing and barely ever checked up on us.

Well allow me to list just a few of the reasons:-- Service has declined dramatically. It took about 40 minutes to get our food today, and when it came we only received half of it. The sushi came 15 minutes later, and only after I asked 3 different servers where it was. The table next to us complained their food was taking forever...and they arrived after we did if that tells you anything.-- Food has declined dramatically as well. Shrimp Tempura Roll was terrible...greasy and bland. I've had better sushi at Whole Foods for half the price. Kung Pao Chicken contained raw pieces of chicken, which was fairly disgusting. It also contained peanuts (despite requesting no peanuts). Noodles were bland and greasy, although the shrimp was good.Steamed vegetable dumplings were a strange consistency and were nearly empty. A very odd appetizer - avoid it.-- The manager finally came (at our request) and was a bit indifferent. He apologized for the new cooking staff, saying the kitchen had a few glitches, and offered us a free dessert. We appreciated the offer but didn't want to dessert so we didn't take him up on it.Overall I think Tao has become nothing more than a tourist trap.

Lounge  is nothing much. While we were standing by the lounge closer to the hostess table David Ortiz (Big pappy) from Red Sox walked in. I was right there. He leaned over & asked for a table for 2. Time was Sat Aug 29th 8.30 pm. Girl said no we don't have anything available. Ortiz is still standing there & trying to figure out where to go to eat. I walked to the hostess & told her find Ortiz a table & he is a famous baseball player. She totally ignored me. Ortiz left. We got our table. There was a empty  table in our section the whole time. They have to put some people up there with experience. Not interns. You think Ortiz will come back there again? I am a Yankees fan. Do not care for Red Sox players much.They really have to revamp the  place. We sat on the 3rd floor private room. 1 waiter running around all by him self. Took forever to take our order. But the food is still really good. Asked the tall white male waiter to take a picture of us when we were ready to leave. He said he cant because his help is not there. That was the kicker.

The table we were sitting at was see through with rose petals at the base. And that giant buddha? Love it. They do pack a lot of people in though. I was there with a group of at least a dozen and it was very hard for us all to sit together comfortably, of course that may have been because some girls wound up bringing people we hadn't been prepared for. The waiters were very accommodating though and continued to shift our seats and tables around so we could all be together. Over the course of two hours we had numerous bottles of wine, shared plates, and delicious desserts. While I can't remember the exact things we ate for dinner I do recall not being very impressed. There were various types of sushi, salads, noodles, and rice dishes but nothing stood out. Even my pretty tipsy self wasn't that into it. The saving grace in the food department was definitely dessert. Those were DAMN delicious. We got a couple orders of the banana pudding, molten chocolate lava cake, and giant fortune cookie. My favorite of the three was the pudding. It was silky and absolutely luscious, but maybe a bit lacking in the actual banana taste. The lava cake was good, but a bit too dense and decadent for me. I'm not the biggest fan of desserts that are super chocolatey so it wouldn't be something I'd get again. The fortune cookie was yummy, but definitely gimmicky.  If I were you I'd come here on a date night, but maybe just stick to drinks and dessert?",3,0,1,Tessa D.,"Back Bay, Boston, MA",269,223,584

3,8/21/2015,"I was honestly expecting a lot better. The service is great, they have very attentive staff and the decoration is amazing. In fact, those are the reasons they got my 3 stars. Problem is, the number one thing that matters to me from a restaurant is... well.... the food. Sadly, in terms of taste, Tao really disappointed me --and my mom, too! I actually ordered a Filet Mignon and there was some spices on it that I couldn't figure out that gave it a really chalky texture. I like my filet mignons juicy, thank you very much. Further, the avocado tempura was a greasy mess. Tasted like I was sipping oil. No, no, no, Tao! To top it all off the bill was almost $200 for 2 people. I'd say the best part of this was the Buddha and the wine, which made me see 2 of the Buddhas, which made me happier than when I saw one. :) This is one of those places that you should go to once and only once, to experience it for yourself.

My date had the Chilean sea bass which was excellent.  A few hours after dinner I became very very sick and spent the entire night vomiting.

4,8/12/2015,"My best friend and I loved Tao downtown so much that we've made it a point to try every Tao establishment we can find. I wasn't nearly as impressed at this location as I was at the downtown location and at the Vegas location, but it was still pretty good.We came for lunch during restaurant week. This location seems smaller than the downtown location. Decor is zen, peaceful, awe inspiring, and beautiful as ever, though! I'm always blow away by the GIGANTIC Buddha statue, this one was no exception. Really trendy, chic, and elegant interior design with a modern pan-Asian meets NYC night club feel. Our server was not good at all. First of all, he seemed annoyed to answer any questions we had and was not helpful in making selections at all. Usually, at other locations, the servers are BEYOND helpful. This guy barely checked on us. I was not impressed by Tao's restaurant week offerings. I started with a drink, the Canton-ese. It had pepper infused tequila, ginger, and pineapple juice, almost like a spicy margarita, even came with a little pepper on top! It was definitely an interesting drink to have, but I would definitely only have one. Too strong and odd of a flavor, but not bad tasting at all. Although the restaurant week offerings were minimal, I think I chose the best of the items. For an appetizer we both started with the satay of chicken with peanut sauce. AMAZING. Generous portion of this appetizer and the peanut sauce was incredible, I literally could have drank the entire cup of sauce! For anyone who loves Thai peanut sauce you must try this! It was my favorite! For my entree I chose the Asian BBQ Hangar steak with pepper spiced fries. Another generous portion! Fries were spicy and incredibly good, cooked to perfection. The steak was amazing, very tender and flavorful. A bit tough to cut, but really tasted to perfection! Lastly, I ordered the banana pudding for dessert, not expecting much. It actually was incredibly good! Banana pudding with crushed up vanilla wafers on top and a banana pastry on top! Really, really, good, but I was so full that I couldn't finish it. The service lacked, but the food did NOT disappoint. It never does! Everything I ate was on point to say the least.

I don't think I'd come back as often as do if not for the reason my office is a block away and the 3 course prix fixe lunch.

But I like the mushrooms, veggies, and cilantro addition.Seared sesame tuna salad: this was a great item. There was crispy wontons, pea shoots, sweet tangerine segments, bean sprouts and edamame with a nice sesame ginger dressing. The tuna was seared to a nice medium rare.Chocolate zen parfait: upscale version of my favorite childhood dessert, dirt cups minus the gummy worms. The scoop on top is not vanilla ice cream as I hoped but whipped cream.I also had the Tiger Lily cocktail with shochu, st. germain, lime and cucumber - delicious!

The drinks were great, but I'm not a big fan of the lychee taste so if you like it just go with it and try the lychee martini. The filet mignon was well cook, flavorful and juicy. The big fortune cookie is an amazing and different dessert due to the combination of fruits, icecream and the huge fortune cookie.The only thing I didn't like was that there's too much noise and the place was really packed but, it doesn't really matter since that's a good sign though. You are going to wait a lot too so be ready.Try to get a reservation and arrived on time because we got there late due to the traffic, and had to wait at the bar for a long time. The bartender was nice and attentive. Decoration and atmosphere is incredible beautiful.

Lighting is dark and romantic, even at lunch. We had chicken lo mein, moo shu chicken with pancakes and crispy chicken with rice. All were good except the pancakes were un-toasted/raw and had no taste to them. They would have been edible if someone warmed them up in a pan before serving. I rate it a three stars because it's a little overrated for the price. Although the ambience is unique, I expected the food to be more outstanding and special.

We were immediately seated near the 16-ft buddha, and enjoyed seeing the live koi in the water beneath.This is a HUGE restaurant in terms of height. Did you know this space was once owned by the Vanderbilts, as a stable?!? Then it became a theatre (hence the Skybox on the 3rd floor), and now it's TAO. For appetizers, we tried the seafood dumpling soup and the bang-bang chicken salad, The seafood soup was incredible! Plump, juicy, crab filled dumplings, in a spicy broth. The bang-bang chicken salad was disappointing: too peanuty, too sweet, and the shredded chicken was tough like rubberbands.The entrees were good - the salmon was perfectly underdone (tastes better, IMO) and not too smothered in any sauce. The Mu-Shu chicken was enough for 2 people! A little heavy on the egg (and not enough high quality, non-chewy pieces of white meat chicken).The desserts were the highlight from an otherwise normal lunch - so amazing! My date had the mango sorbet in coconut milk, and couldn't stop raving about it. My chocolate parfait was creamy, chocolate-y, nutty, and amazing.

The bathroom stalls have pinball machines in them which is kind of cool. The prices were pricey for what they were offering. I ordered the chicken pad thai.

The tables were spread apart so it didn't feel like you were right on top of the people next to you, which is something that occurs at many of the nicer restaurants I've been too. We ordered the Peking duck spring rolls which were delicious. For my main meal course I got the filet Mormon black pepper steak. It tasted as good as it looked. The meat was tensor and it came with the perfect medley of vegetables with it. It was cooked in a nice sauce that complemented the taste. For dessert we got the two six pieces of chocolate.

Almost to the point where you can't hear (at least in the lounge area). You get to the main dining area and there's this massive Buddha-like sculpture in the back of the room. How it got in there, I dunno, maybe it dug up through the earth, or maybe it was beamed down from space. Either way, it's a centerpiece that you can't ignore.The decor is top notch, seriously, but onto the food: As a table, we ordered a tempura sampler platter, which was awesome. Lots of good veggies fried up to golden perfection (at least I think it was gold. The inside is pretty damn dim, so according to the law of BlueBlack-WhiteGold who knows). For dinner, two in our party got Sushi (they said it was good), two got the Chilean Sea Bass (which was dank), and I got the NY Sirloin. Huge 10oz steak that was perfectly cooked, thin sliced, with Shitake Mushrooms and spiced homefries. All of our food was absolutely delicious, I think that may be one of the best steaks I've ever had...and at an Asian Fusion restaurant.Please be forewarned, this place is pricey. But...

But Tao has so many positives.  For one, the interior design is just beautiful.  I'm pretty sure you all scrolled through all the pictures, and took a gander at that impressive Buddha sculpture.  If you plan on going, make sure you walk to the bottom of the sculpture to see the Koi fish, and their surprisingly friendly selves!  If you're lucky, you can sneak a feel when no one is looking! (I tried to make it sound less pervy as possible).We were placed at a table that had a glass top, and the bottom was made out of stone that held water with rose petals floating at the top.  It was just so creative and pretty.  I feel like I'm about to write a whole essay on the aesthetics of Tao, because there is just so much detail to take in!There are three floors.  We were seated at the first floor.  At the tip top of the place, there is a third floor.  It looked super exclusive.  Of course we wouldn't be seated up there 'cuz we are mere common folk! ;-(Anyways, now... the food!  Was so good!  My BF ordered the Lobster & Shrimp Pad Thai, and he says its the best Pad Thai he's had.  I ordered the Soy Ginger Glazed Salmon with Udon Noodles and Spinach, and I loved it.... I loved it so much that, my soul died a little when I left my doggy bag at the restaurant! ;-(But without a doubt Tao's gets 5 stars.  Oh!  And another memorable thing is it's Chocolate and Vanilla Mousse Fortune Cookie!

The waiter advised us well, made solid recommendations, and food did not take long to get to the table (we were starving!).We did a lot of shared plates. Loved everything, to be honest. Delicious and easy to share. The shared dessert plate was the cherry on top: exceeding expectations. The cocktail menu was good; wine list was so-so. Be careful with appetizers: they are size able. Sushi was good though not outstanding.

4,5/28/2015,"For the bargain price of $29.50, Tao serves a 3 course lunch special until 4:45 PM. That's a deal! The location (Midtown East) makes for a worthy spot to grab a bite and have a business meeting. The decor is interesting with extremely high ceilings, interesting Asian-Style art pieces, and huge statues. The establishment is dimly lit- something to keep in mind if you have sensitive eyes. The choices for the lunch pre-fixe are from 1 appetizer, 1 entree and 1 dessert. The list of options is not huge, 5 or 6 things to choose from in each category- but enough choices so that there is something to suit the likes of just about anyone. I started with the hot seafood dumpling soup. A very big bowl of hot and sour broth with 4 very plump and well seasoned seafood dumplings. I came in for a late lunch and was rather hungry before this soup. It left me wondering if i would be able to finish my lunch! I was torn between the salmon and rice or the sushi for my entree. Since I had the salmon and rice the last time I was at Tao, I decided to opt for the 3 sushi rolls. These were very good, however, I was a little disappointed with the portion. The meal came with 4 pieces of spicy salmon, 4 pieces of california roll, and 4 pieces of avocado and cucumber roll. I am used to the standard roll having 6 pieces and even though I had a hearty soup appetizer, i would have liked to have the extra pieces in the roll. I should note, the spicy salmon was the best I have had in the city - MORE PLEASE? By the time dessert came out, i was definitely full. There is only one dessert item i would ever order from Tao (unless its the specialty birthday cake i had on my 30th), and that's the banana pudding. This banana pudding is made with crushed fortune cookies and garnished with a slice of banana tempura. Its my absolute favorite banana pudding. Washed it down with a creamy cappuccino.

We all ordered and the hot dishes (pad Thai and fried rice) came out first while the sushi plates came out about 5-10 minutes later. Not great service. The food wasn't bad, just way overpriced for what it actually was. I did enjoy the specialty dessert my friends and I all shared: a giant fortune cookie filled with chocolate and vanilla mousse.

The very worst part of our dinner were the wine glasses. We ordered a nice bottle of wine and it was served in the worst glasses I think I've ever seen. Won't return to this restaurant. Too many great choices in NYC and certainly better glasses. I'm not even that picky.,0,0,0,Melissa M.,"Wilmette, IL",0,2,0

4,5/4/2015,"This place is worse than expected because of the noise. It is surprisingly famous given the size of the Buddha right at the center of dining room. The cooking style is supposed to be labeled with ""Asian Fusion"". As a Chinese, I think this name often suggest the restaurant in any particular style of Asian food. Often, restaurants labeled with these names are open by Thai or Vietnamese. I ordered Pai Thai, a cocktail and a shared dish of vegetables with my friend. The food is not too bad. However, one interesting thing about this restaurant is that they have a person standing beside the tap in the bathroom and normally people will drop a dollar tip after using the bathroom.",0,0,0,Luping Z.,"Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY",53,30,18

I assumed since you had drinks you had been helped' (we had drinks from downstairs while waiting for our table). Our official waiter never introduced himself. He came by to ask us if we were ready to order and I said I had a question. He said ""wait a minute I will be right back to answer your questions"" and took off. 5 minutes later the water guy comes back to take our order. Food was dropped off, nobody ever came by after that. I had to get someone's attention to ask for a drink. The second time we saw our official waiter was when he dropped off dessert menus at our table.

Crispy coconut shrimp with Thai peanut sauce: good, well served, accompanied by rice.

We did the squab lettuce wraps, spcy tuna tartare on crispy rice, lobster wontons, and crispy coconut shrimp. The shrimp is an entrée but comes with 6 pieces. The shrimp and lettuce wraps were our favorites. We then moved onto sushi - we got the chef's roll, dragon roll, and a tuna roll. All we pretty good. Tasted very fresh and we were all very satisfied.We each had our own dinner then. The plates we got included lo mein, sizzled fried riec with pork, pad thai, miso glazed Chilean sea bass, and a few other plates. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food.Dessert - we did the molten chocolate cake, giant fortune cookie, and chocolate spring rolls. Everything was pretty yummy but the fortune cookie is pretty cool. Highly recommend it!Decor was trendy but it was a little loud inside - especially as it got closer to 9 the music is pumped way up. Overall fantastic experience and will be going back.

2,4/14/2015,"Good: GoodService: doubtable I go to Tao often. Usually the food is good, while the service had been bearable. But today, I found hair in my dish. I'm not talking about just any hair, but a foot-long hair that was mixed in with my food. I didn't ask for any complimentary service; but at least I was expecting an apology, which I didn't get. Instead, I got attitude. The server rudely took my plate away and threw the ""new"" plate down on the table - AFTER everybody had finished their meals. I felt it was me who made the mistake of ""discovering"" the hair in MY FOOD and interrupting the server's busy schedule. At other restaurants, when things like this happen, one would expect at least a ""sorry"" and may be make it up to you by offering complimentary coffee or desert.

Waiter was extremely friendly and knowledgable. Went over the entire menu with us and made wonderful suggestions. We started with the chicken gyoza and spicy yellowtail roll. Both were fantastic. Main dishes were the crispy coconut shrimp and sea scallops...both were fantastic, only the scallops came with mushrooms (which I dislike) but I just moved them to another plate. We also had a side of lomein and broccoli in black bean sauce. We ate everything and were way too stuffed for dessert.

These plates are so small that it's about 4 bites of food per plate. The only thing that really stood out was the spicy tuna tartare over crispy rice . Everything else was just pretty mediocre , even the dumplings . Also, for my main course I ordered the soy glazed miso salmon with udon noodles and spinach . Udon noodles and the sauce were amazing , however there weren't enough noodles , and the salmon was fishy , deff not fresh salmon . Also , before I forget . Let's talk about the horrible service . Firstly the hostess escorted us to the table dropped the menus on the table and cut me off to go back to her hosting station and didn't even wait for anyone in my party to sit down .

2,3/3/2015,"This restaurant is huge and the decorations are beautiful with a humungous Buddha statue. You could definitely get lost in this place (not really). It is a beautiful place, however the food and the staff do not measure up. The sushi is not the best I've had and for the price I paid for it, it better damn be the best sushi I ever had (btw I am a sushi FANATIC! I love it). Unfortunately, this place was a very big, over-rated, disappointment.  Sad to say I will not be returning based on the quality of the food, the extremely over-priced dishes, and the unacceptable customer service. My boyfriend and I were sitting at our table and right away our server gave us some water. However, she never returned, although she walked past our table about 10 times. 25 min later a different server came by to take a drink orders. He was really nice and he took all of our orders but he wasn't even our server. Our real server didn't come back until the end of our meal to collect her check and tip. I recommend choosing any other sushi place in NYC before coming here. One note to add, it could have been the location we chose because I do believe there is more than one location. The one we went to was on E 58th st. This place could be sooo awesome if they stepped up their game. Maybe some nightly entertainment would be cool too!",0,0,0,Candace G.,"Arlington, VA",75,29,26

5,3/2/2015,"My first visit to Tao was in Vegas a few years back. My boyfriend and I had dinner there right before we boarded the plane. I remember bringing some Sausage Fried Rice back to New York and my mom loved it. I didn't get to expirience it well since we were in a hurry to board the plane.I reserved lunch for restaurant week and got there 15 minutes early. As soon as I checked in with the Hostess she sat us down. That was nice that they didn't make us wait. Our waitress was very friendly and nice. She gave us suggestions and answered all of our questions. I like going to eat somewhere and you see the excitement in the waiters faces when they talk about a dish they recommend. For restaurant week they had $25 lunch deals. Normally, its $27.50 (I still think it's a good price). For appetizers, I ordered the Chicken Satay from the restaurant week menu and Squab with Lettuce from their regular menu which is priced at $16 its good to share with 2-3 people. I felt the Squab was a little salty but it was still good. For my Entrée I ordered the Salmon and it was delicious ! My boyfriend ordered the Sausage Fried Rice with the short ribs and he enjoyed that a lot. Our waitress kept refilling our sodas and I like that she was very attentive.For dessert, I chose the banana pudding and it was delicious. Since we missed the chance to get dessert in Vegas, we ordered the Giant Fotune Cookie that was filled with Chocolate Mousse inside and served with Fresh Fruits on the side. It was cute how it came with 2 fortunes :)Service was great and the food was even better. I will be craving that fortune cookie so I will definitely come back.

3,2/20/2015,"Food: 5 StarsService: 1 StarI was here recently on a Saturday night. We were a big group, party of 12, which TAO should be able to accommodate since a bunch of their rounds tables seat 12. We had 9pm reservations and didn't get seated until 10:45.  I understand other diners like to linger at their tables, but I have been to other popular restaurants where the waitstaff will give diners a time limit when others have reservations later on and I think TAO should do this.  During our one hour and forty five minute wait we were repeatedly told, ""Just a few more minutes.""  During this time we were all starving and when we asked for appetizers they declined to serve us appetizers and said they would give us a complimentary dessert. Since we already had a cake we brought, and we were starving while waiting, paying for appetizers would have been preferable to a complimentary dessert. The complimentary dessert sampler was excellent but they knew we had brought in a cake for dessert so our stomachs were not able to appreciate all these extra sweets. For Asian fusion this is one of the best for it's food. Every dish we had was fantastic. I got the coconut shrimp which was not too greasy and was served with a very tasty sauce. The steamed vegetable dumplings were pretty good, but they kept falling apart as I was eating then with chopsticks. The edamame was tasty.  I like how the large round tables have the turning serving top on them to make it easy to share with friends on the other side of the large table.  The decor is very fancy, they have a bunch of tables that are good for large groups.  Something I didn't like about the place was that the music was so loud you had to yell just to talk to the person next to you. I know some people like that club-ish feel when going out for dinner, but I think I was over it by the time I was 25.I would return on a weekday where I am guessing there would be less wait for a table if you have reservations?Sorry I am not posting a bunch of photos.  Due to the very dim lighting my photos didn't turn out well.",3,0,0,Nicole C.,"Manhattan, NY",109,121,477

The reservations were made a month in advance and when we got there, they told us we'd have to wait 2 hours to get another table because it was ""physically impossible"" to seat another person at the table. I have worked in the restaurant industry before, I get it...there is an 8 person table and 10 person, etc. But like, physically impossible that you would make us wait 2 HOURS?

Made a reservation a week in advance just for the two of us because I thought it would be a good idea being that this place is very popular and very busy. When first walking in, there's a free coat check which was very nice. Going in you have to go through the lounge/bar area which was also used as a waiting area and you could order both good and drinks there if you just wanted to eat in there. When we got there, (a few minutes early) we were told to wait for a few minutes. After 10 minutes, we were given our seat. For an appetizer I got their TAO Temple Salad and this it was really good! It consisted of spring lettuce, red cabbage, edamame, bean sprouts (my fave), a few pieces of fried wontons on top, and it was all drizzled under their house made dressing which tasted like a vinaigrette, sesame seed, peanut dressing. Really good! Great portion and flavor. For my main course I got a Shrimp Tempura sushi roll.  It was mediocre. It was severed with a side of spicy mayo and the sushi itself was good but what I hated was the fact that it really wasn't rolled very well. My sushi kept falling apart, making it very difficult to pick up as well as to eat. Disappointed in that for sure. For dessert I got their banana pudding which was served in a bowl with a banana and crust layering and was topped with two prices of fried banana. Pretty good.

4,1/31/2015,"This place has been my list of restaurants to try  for a while. It was worth the wait. I received a call earlier in the day to confirm my reservation, which I really liked, since I made my reservation several weeks before. When I arrived I had to wait in a crowded doorway and then waiting area for about 15-20 minutes. Not a ton of time but considering they we so efficient in calling to remind me about my reservation,  I thought I would have been seated sooner. My cousin and I were seated upstairs.  The ambience of this location is very chic and surprisingly large. Please note that they maximize every inch of the space here. Lots of tables! The huge Buddha, dim lighting, and what I assume is Chinese writing  on the ceiling really gives this place character. I feel it's a great place to throw on some heels if you want to turn your FAB factor up, but I definitely saw more than a few casually dressed diners. My cousin and I got a few items we wanted to share. We got the chicken gyoza, which I really liked but was a bit salty; and the crispy tuna sashimi roll with edamame, I enjoyed. For our main courses, she got the  Soy Ginger Glazed Salmon with Udon Noodles and Spinach and I got the Orange chicken. The salmon had no seasoning, at all, but the noodles salvaged the meal. The orange chicken was great. Just the right  amount of sweet. But the course that made this place a winner for me was by far the dessert.  The molten chocolate cake with coconut ice cream and the fuji apple blossom with vanilla bean ice cream and caramel sauce was EVERYTHING.  I live for a good dessert and TAO gave me  all I was looking for. Now this place was packed from my 7:30 reservation until I left at 11 and the crowd never dwindled. I know the servers were busy all night,but I'm big on customer service and I will say my server did not meet the grade in my book. He never introduced himself, problem number one; he only asked if our food was okay after we got our appetizers,  huge problem number 2; we had to flag him down to tell him you wanted to wrap up our food and to look at the dessert menu, and finally it took forever to get our check.

We sit down in the lounge area and this cocktail waitress was so rude! She came by to order my drink and I didn't know what I wanted and she walked away and rolled her eyes... Really?!?!!

1,1/19/2015,"The food was ok, I am leaving the review based on service. We placed our order with a very friendly waiter who disappeared without submitting it to the kitchen. An hour later, we had to flag someone else down who explained that our server left & re-state the order. No big deal. We then waited another hour for our drinks to arrive. It was after the appetizers were already out. We ordered a bottle of sake. It should not have taken an hour. There was a mix up on one of out orders, which was corrected after several attempts to bring us the wrong dish. Again, not a problem. When the check arrived there was a mistake on it, $5 more but because it was taking so long to flag someone down, we let it slide. When we did submit our payment, the waiter returned to tell us that our 15% tip was inadequate. We told him that the service was pretty bad, and that the math worked out to almost 18%. He apologized, but at this point the girl that was most vocal about leaving a higher tip lost her cool. She complained to the manager, and he said ""I will take better care of you next time"". He should have walked over to the table and apologized. I'm not asking for any freebies, just to be treated better when getting billed $500 for ok food.

3,1/17/2015,"The name attracts people, but this place can be broken down into two categories: Food and Atmosphere..While it's nowhere near comparable to the one in Vegas, its an upbeat lounge atmosphere that can border on club in the bar section. Regardless, it's a great place for  a group dinner an upbeat vibe. The music is fairly loud in the dinner section which makes for a fun vibe and a great place for a pre-game dinner before heading out elsewhere or over to the bar section.The bar section is separate from the dinner side and is filled with couches and a good sized bar. On certain nights it's better than others, but either way it's always good time and a cool place to make a night of it. Not one of the top places in the city, but definitely a good option. The food is just ok. I've had the pork lo mein on a few occasions and it's decent, but is on the bland side and lacks anything to make it memorable. The same goes for other dishes as they are all average at best.Great atmosphere, trendy scene and average food is how I'd summarize Tao in one sentence.",1,0,1,Kevin M.,"Princeton, NJ",770,911,1675

I tend to stop by more on occasions for drinks this is still enjoyable wish they would offer some type of happy hour but still seems like they don't. We had reservations but as usual there was still some waiting before we were seated , probably waited about another 35 minutes or so not terrible.Reservations are not necessary since u can eat at the bar but having reservations certainly do help specially since this place seems to always be crowded. On the cocktails we tried the Tao-Tini good drink in a Martini glass kinda small my new favorite is the Pama Sutra this is basically a pomegranate margarita very tasty nice amount of liquor. On the appetizers Jumbo Shrimp tempura with garlic chile sauce is very good. Bamboo Vegetable steamed dumplings & Shrimp tempura roll also very good & so was the Rock shrimp lettuce wraps these were very tasty. Main dishes Kung Pao Chicken still amazing tasting , great as well is the Orange chicken both come w white rice. We decide to get an order of the Vegetable fried rice , so good. Tao Lo Mein with Roast Pork was delicious , good portion nice tasting. Wasabi crusted filet Mignon with tempura onion rings nice tender piece of meat. On the specials they had a Lobster & Shrimp Pad Thai , this had a bit of a overpowering curry taste over all the dish was not bad good size dish. Finally for dessert we enjoyed a variety which included the Giant fortune cookie delicious filed with white & chocolate mousse. Yummy Mango & Coconut ice cream , Mandarin sorbet w fruit also very good. The Apple blossom w vanilla bean ice cream very tasty as well as the Molten chocolate cake. This place has not changed much food is still very good , prices are pricey specially on the cocktails but overall it is still a nice place to come for dinner w friends.

4,1/6/2015,"One is awed immediately upon entering the restaurant. In typical New York City fashion, often times the exterior of a business in no way describes the grandeur of the interior. Upon walking into the main dining area you were greeted by 30 foot high statue of Buddha... Reportedly imported directly from China... which the seating areas surround. Even for a jaded foodie like me it was an impressive site. The menu was relatively complete although I would've liked to of seen more vegetarian items... Not a great restaurant for a vegan... But my dinner partners had plenty of choices and both beef, chicken and seafood.  The servers were knowledgeable and accommodating in a very New York way meaning they were to the point and direct without being rude. Customizations to the orders were met with equal accommodation. Even though the restaurant was packed service was quick and the food was serviceability tasty, not fabulous, but very very good.We dined with five adults and four teenagers and the check before tip came out to the mid-$500s (that included appetizers main course and the dessert plus adult beverages -  we r not heavy drinkers) which is very reasonable for a New York City restaurant.I encourage you to go to Tao for the experience of it.  The food won't disappoint but the ambience will impress you.o",0,0,0,Jeff S.,"Birmingham, MI",2,10,1

I went here on Saturday 1/3/15 for my 31st birthday with some friends and despite waiting 45 minutes for a table since someone was doing their wedding there, the manager turned our sour tasting experience to a mouth watering adventure.We had a seared tuna appetizer (single piece), a round of saki bombs that arrived to the table in a medieval looking contraption that has the shots sitting on top of the pint glasses half filled with beer and two rods you need to push down on to release the shot glasses, this was definitely an eye catcher since everyone in the restaurant wanted to see our special delivery, and finally a dessert boat filled with a huge fortune cookie filled with chocolate and white chocolate moose, assorted ice creams, apple turnovers, and a molten lava chocolate cake. Needless to we were extremely pleased and my friends and I will definitely  be going back to Tao. My friend did all of the ordering from an assortment of appetizers: miso glazed sea bass (amazing), 2 chicken satay, 2 tuna tartars on rice cakes, 2 duck spring rolls (my favorite), lobster spring roll, short ribs (also another favorite) and a variety of entrees: shrimp pad thai, kung pao chicken, scallops, and one other that I can't recall.

The pros: The atmosphere is super swanky and sexy and we sat right near the  big Buddha. The presentation of the food is whimsical and the food is fun to eat. The portions are actually pretty big (for small plates and appetizers) and we were pretty full that we could barely finish the sushi and we had to take home the fried rice.  The cons: Most of the food was not good. The fried rice was burnt and greasy, they did not use the right type of rice to make the sushi rolls, the Kobe Tempura was bland,  and the duck spring rolls were just regular spring rolls with a little piece of meat. Do not order the UNI or Toro here, it is not tasty.Overall I give it 3 stars because I did enjoy my tiger lily drink and the only thing worth talking about is the Kobe Sashimi ( I could eat like 10 plates of these) and the Tuna tar tar on top of the crispy rice.

5,12/22/2014,"I chose Tao this year, for my 21st birthday dinner, and what a great choice it was! Last year I went to Sofritos, and boy was it a totally different experience... in a great way of course. I had reservations for 8:15 on a Monday night and, lucky me, there was traffic everywhere. I got pretty frantic in the taxi, LOL. I wanted to make my reservations! When my boyfriend and I got there, it must of been around 8:30 PM; when we walked in, we were greeted with smiles and told to wait in the lounge area until our table was ready. LOL... A lot of people-watching goes on in there; I guess people are trying to see who's who. Girls looking at girls high heels, then, when you catch them starring, they give you this fake smile. It felt like high school all over again. Anyways, we were seated in the lounge area for about 15 minutes when my boyfriend decided to buy a bottle of Champagne. So we ordered it and my table buzzer went off... time to eat!Once we were seated, they brought out the bottle in the bucket of ice, and always made sure my glass was full. The waiter, the hostesses, and those guys in tuxedos walking around with walkie talkies in there ears all were very polite and I felt like a princess :) I ordered the crispy orange chicken with jasmine rice and a couple cokes on the side, my boyfriend had the filet mignon pepper steak very well done please haha. The food was amazing... thinking about it now is making me want more, Great flavors! The chicken was delicious... so delicious that I was full and took the rest of my order home with me, and ate it the next day! Happy birthday to meeee.

2,12/21/2014,"Tao has a very large dessert menu. O wait that's their regular menu. Yes Tao needs to understand that there are more flavors besides sweet and savory. I didn't really walk into the place with high expectations but I did want to see the gigantic space everyone talks about without the need to stand in line to pay for a $24 lyche martini which I would probably get swatted out of my hand accidently by some douche named Troy or bimbo named Mckenzie. I'm actually surprised that there isn't a Tao in Times Square because it is truly a tourist trap with a lot of kids running around and Times Square quality food. Now on to the food!The duck spring rolls barely had any duck in it so I basically ate a crappy spring roll but paid 8 times more. The vegetable dumplings didn't have any flavor but the pickled veggies underneath were good and had just the right amount of acid. The tuna tar tar over fried sticky rice was alright but the tar tar itself wasn't mind blowing. I had a few pieces were the sticky rice was waaay overcooked. The wagyu beef slices were pretty decent although it as on the sweet side. O yeah everything I mentioned so far had a side of sweet soy/ginger/wasabi sauce because apparently anything Asian tastes like wasabi infused teriyaki sauce with sesame seeds sprinkled on top of it. The satay chilean sea bass was cooked well but again there was too much sweet/buttery sauce over it. The wagyu roll was completely absent of taste and creativity  so I had to drown it in more brown wasabi sugar water sauce. The one thing I did like about this dish is it came with a side of mushroom/edamame/seaweed salad that was very good. The fried rice was dry and over priced and I fully regret getting it because I thought nothing was going to fill me up but all the sweet sauces (and probably msg) left me stuffed. Now onto the sushi.The dragon roll was basically a smaller dragon roll you can find at any other Japanese place run by a non-Japanese person. The Uni was alright but didn't have that blissful melting moment. Lastly I didn't get the Toro but just by looking at my GF piece I didn't see any fat on it. She was very displeased with it too. Basically the entire time we were there we were listing places we could have gone to get better stuff.. at a fraction of the price. Lastly was the actual dessert even though I probably consumed my weight in sugary sauces. Of course we went with the giant cookie. The mousse was alright and I appreciated the giant side of fruit. I'm very upset because there's literally no exploration of flavor or ingredients. It's all just sweet savory and maybe a hint of spicy. They took a lot of familiar Chinese Korean and Japanese things, tweeked them a little and added a zero behind the price. The funniest part was the (2) things I enjoyed the most were little things next to the main dish (pickled veggies and a mushroom salad). The service was actually quite excellent.

1,12/4/2014,"I have always liked TAO as far as the food is concerned.  The service can improve a bit.  What I am going to complain about is:  I had made a reservation two weeks in advance for a party of four.  Two days before the reservation, we had another person that wanted to come.  I called and asked if we might be able to add one more person, and was told that if we added a person, we would have to wait until 11:30pm for a table. There was no customer service, no explaniation, no appoligies and no sympathy.  She didn't even care that she had just lost a party of five for dinner.  Must be nice to have so many customers that you don't need to satisify needs of others.

She obviously needs more training and learn how to smile and greet guests.  She made us feel like we were bothering her and she'd rather be home on her couch relaxing on this rainy day.

They forgot about us until we went up to them about 30 minutes later and asked why we weren't seated yet, and then we were seated in less than 1 minute. . not good. Again, I got the red snapper and still liked it. And my boyfriend got a steak, and his wasn't even brought out hot. It was barely room temperature. I think they should bring their food out hot fresh from the grill. And it's not really Asian food. Asian inspired yes. They have sauces on their food that are Asian (sweet and sour) and also bok Choy. The molten lava cake and coconut Ice cream dessert is a must!! So good. Also, they have a handy charging machine downstairs that I love. It's free and you can keep your phone locked in a pod while you're there.

The Kung Pao chicken comes with white rice and the chicken comes with onions/peppers and drizzled peanuts on a separate plate. It was very tasty and delicious. The peanuts are not overpowering. The Hanger steak was okay and the fries were a bit over seasoned. For dessert we got the chocolate zen parfait.  It was okay. Maybe because I was full.

2,9/26/2014,"Stunning interior. Who wouldn't be impressed by their giant freaking Buddha. However, the food .. they call it Asian fusion but it's Americanized Asian food . I thought I was getting a bargain for their lunch prixe fix menu which comes with an appetizer, an entree, and dessert. But after tasting the food, man, it was not worth nearly $30. I felt like I was paying an extra $10 to admire the Buddha and the surrounding decor, which pretty much, I was. I got their spicy dumpling soup to start--my two Chinese/Asian American friends did not like the dumplings. They said the dumplings tasted frozen and then defrosted. The soup itself, we liked. My friend said it reminded her of tom yum kun. For the entree, my friend and I got the seared tuna salad. It wasn't bad, but nothing really amazing either . Lastly, upon our waiter's recommendation, I got the banana pudding. This was my favorite part of the meal, but take that with a grain of salt as the rest of the food was lackluster. My friend got the mango sorbet in coconut milk, which we realized later was supposed to be their version of a popular Asian dessert. Oh . Overall, the food is not that great, and I will probably not be coming back, but I really enjoyed the interior.",3,0,2,Yumi I.,"Brooklyn, NY",532,24,0

2,9/20/2014,"Gorgeous restaurant in the heart of the city. Unfortunately, they tend to cater to whoever they know or feel like accommodating, which is very disappointing. It's always a production to get your group seated (even when you have a reservation) unless you're tipping the hostess or have some type of connection. You will wait about an hour over your reservation time every single time, which is why I prefer to go to TAO Downtown. The hostess staff always seems to get into it with the guests because of this and they are not nice about it. I'm not sure if this is their strategy to have you spend money at the bar while you wait but when you begin to notice, you will see several people walking in & getting seated immediately. Not my type of place. If you do have the patience to wait, ask to be seated near the huge Buddha; it makes for some great photos. I was with a large group and tried a bit of everyone's dish so I think it's safe to say that everything is delicious here.

The fried rice is also inexplicably really good -- as in, I can't explain why it's better than any other fried rice I've had, but I enjoyed it immensely.Four stars because of the price -- I get that it's a popular place, which drives up the price, but I'd rather get similar quality food at a lower price.

It was certainly busy, and we did wait a while for our table, but that's to be expected from a restaurant like this, especially on a saturday night. When we were seated, the service was great and we didn't have to wait too long for our food. I tried the spicy tuna rolls to start (my fave) and then I had the Hong Kong XO shrimp, which was delicious but a little too spicy for my weak taste buds. I wasn't drinking, but the cocktails looked equally as yummy. We then shared the giant fortune cookie between four of us (after reading on yelp that it was a must), and it did not disappoint.Overall a restaurant to definitely visit at least once, more times if you like the busy restaurant scene and good quality asian food, and don't mind spending a little bit exta, as it is pricey.

This is one of nyc's top restaurants so I highly advise to make reservations in advance. Though they do expect walk ins the wait can be for a few hours. They do accommodate waiting customers with a lounge/bar where you may also order appetizers. And on some occasions the live DJ is accompanied by a live musician, which really adds to the festivities.

Generally the whole food was pretty salty. My favorite from all the food we had was the sea bass. Lobster Wontons with shitake Ginger broth was a bit creamy, making the mushroom and lobster too overwhelming and oily. Tuna Tartare & Pork spring roll was ok... It wasn't anything special.The pecking duck... um... was NOT worth it. 78bucks for mostly fatty skin? and dried up flat buns?? NO.the pecking duck house is close to 50 bucks and has better quality than this. It was very disappointing. I would go again for the beautiful atmosphere, but I will definitely keep in mind to order somthing safe that isn't too outrageously pricey compaired to the quality of food.",0,0,0,Yujin O.,"New York, NY",138,203,110

For appetizers, we had the pork dumplings and a lacquered beef short rib.  Holy Toledo.  The dumplings were good, but the ribs stole the show.  They were of the melt in your mouth variety.  The crispy orange chicken is generally better than what you will find at your typical neighborhood Chinese joint and is accompanied by baby bok choy.

1,7/12/2014,"I'd never been to Tao before, but as soon as I stepped inside, I wondered if I had been transported from the upper reaches of Midtown East to Meatpacking. It very much has that faux-'cool' vibe going on, and the space is huge - a big ground-floor dining area, as well as an upstairs that seats a good number of people as well. The ladies at the desk didn't explain the concept of the pager-like device you are given very well (it just lets you know when your table is ready), and the service was cursory at best (although, based on the tip, you wouldn't guess it - more on that later).As for the food and drink - the drink selection is quite limited, with your typical 'imports' from Europe (e.g. Heineken, Stella) or some Asian beers being what you're limited to on the beer side. As for the food side, it's an assortment of pan-Asian options, from the Japanese (teriyaki-style meat dishes) to 'Chinese' (crispy orange chicken) and Thai. Perhaps the first thing that caught my eye was the fact that the prices are...a bit high, to say the least. There's no edamame in the world that is good enough (or would be served in a copious enough quantity) to be worth $10. While what was served was fine - it had a bit of salt sprinkled on it - by no means did it justify the price. Maybe because they serve it to you in a steamer typically used for dumplings, they think it's fancier? As for food, I went all-duck and went with duck fried rice and the duck spring rolls. The former was fine - the duck meat was pretty standard for Peking duck, and the fried rice was solid overall - kind of hard to screw that up unless you let it sit out for a long time after cooked. The spring rolls were markedly less impressive; even though spring rolls have less extraneous substance than, say, a regular Chinese-style duck roll would have, it was really difficult to taste the duck in it. While it comes split out into 6 smaller bites, I ate 4 and called it quits after that.What really peeved me about Tao was that while we split the bill between both myself and my friend, they kept the suggested tip for the entire bill on both receipts for less. Given both of us had a few beers at this point, we simply tipped off of this - and as such, realized the next day we basically gave the waiter a 30%+ tip, even though he probably barely warranted 15% at best. That's extremely deceptive and not a good business practice at all.

No matter if the foods are good or not, the decorations are good enough for a reason for you to go. It is EXACTLY the same characteristics of China you v seen in any Hollywood movie...The restaurant is very dark, but you can still details on the walls and the roof, calligraphy and Buddhist. The decorations and furniture are all wood-based. Completely classical.   There are two huge Buddhas in the restaurant. One is laying down, located in the lounge, and the other one is in the dinning hall. The designer uses lights to put different effect on the Buddha. Sometimes, you can see the Buddha looks at you, and sometimes there are petals falling down towards him.The restaurant has lots of great designs more than I can describe by English. (Only Chinese can describe such fabulous Chinese designs)As a Chinese, I am amazed by the decorations of the restaurant as well!!!Foods:The restaurant doesnt have a very high rating probably because Asian people are not into the foods there.

Can't really go wrong with most of the menu items and they have many options for different food preferences.  Satay of chilean seabass on the small plates menu is a nice start.  The dishes were consistent and served timely.- Fun cocktails beyond standard fare- Service was good. All the servers were friendly and helpful.Cons:- Loud and moderately touristy.  It can't be helped in a restaurant of that size but it was hard to hear after a certain point.  So I wouldn't take clients here for dinner.- Annoying reservation rules when not really necessary.  We had a party of 10 and the restaurant was half empty.  We were told they only hold reservations for 15 minutes, they would seat a partial party in extreme circumstances but you would have to start ordering right away and/or you would only have the table for 2 hours and have to leave.  Not cool guys.- Price.  I'm not shocked by the price point but since a lot of people go here who don't live in NYC, a $15 cocktail for essentially a restaurant chain (that is slightly past its prime) is a little on the high side.",0,0,0,Natalie L.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",9,45,1

It was my anniversary and my husband and I had a 6:15pm reservation.

Our waitress was sloppy in appearance and rushed us from the moment we sat down. Tatyana, Natalya? Asian girl. Our food and drinks arrived in short time which was the only plus for the night. We had the lobster wontons to start, the sandpot lobster and XO shrimp as entrees, 6 different cocktails and the giant fortune cookie as dessert.

4,6/10/2014,"My friend was visiting New York from Norway for the first time. Therefore I was looking for a more upscale, celebration venue. Tao definitely lived up to the expectations. We started off with some appetizers and cocktails. Satay of chicken with peanut sauce was a good pick. Not overly large but enough for a starter. For drinks I decided to go with their Lychee Martini (big fan of lychee's). What was amazing about the cocktail is the amount of grey goose it contains - practicallyundetectable but trust me, it's there. It kicked in after the first round. My friend, hesitant when it comes to innovations ordered a TAO-hito (pretty much a regular looking mojito). What I've noticed was that the flavor was much more defined and tasted somewhat oriental. A very good mix. They also didn't go easy on the liquor(thumbs up)! As for the main course I decided to have the Roasted Thai Buddha Chicken. Very well seasoned, medium size dish. Chicken was fresh and juicy, perfectly grilled and served in a appealing way. As a seafood lover with the taste for oriental seasonings my friend had the Crispy Coconut Shrimp with spicy Thai peanut sauce. Being from Norway (one of the biggest fish exporters) she can be very picky and particular when it comes to seafood. But she loved it! Shrimps were fresh out the water, crunchy on the outside but tender like a cloud on the inside. They did have a very defined sea stench but I guess that indicates their freshness. The bottom line is we were both pleased with our choices. We both loved the famous Buddha statue and the interior. Two things we were not particularly happy with was a 150 dollar tab (dinner for 2 + 2 drinks each) and the size of the entrees.

The fifth person arrived at 8.10pm, so we entered again and we were given a thing that was supposed to vibrate when our table would have been ready. So we started waiting at the loud and crowded bar. At 8.30pm I asked how long we had to wait for, and the lady told me that the people at our table had just paid and that they would have called us in a few minutes. We waited for another 25 minutes, and at 8.55pm I went to the front desk and told the lady that we were giving up. She told us the same thing as 25 minutes earlier, i.e. the table was about to be ready but we were too hungry and bored and we were there to celebrate our friend's birthday. The only thing the lady could tell us was ""I am sorry"". So we opted for the Modern at the MOMA where the staff was incredibly accommodating, nice and professional. I don't get why at TAO they take reservations when they treat you as you just popped in and were in a mood for queuing and waiting. I honestly don't expect such a bad service in a restaurant that is so expensive and with such high standards. I don't think I'll ever try to go back.",0,0,0,Mary D.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,8,0

3,6/4/2014,"We had dinner for 9 of us, and it was a rainy night, so despite the entire group not being there on time, they held our reservation for 30 minutes. On a busy night this was appreciated and almost led me to a 4 rating, but the food and the noise level and the cramped quarters make it an OK experience and I cannot justify a 4. We were seated after a cocktail at the bar area, and we had a nice round table which facilitated talking to all, although the noise level was really high due to the music as well as being seated upstairs, which defeated the purpose of the round table. Wait service was good, and the waitress took care of us and was attentive despite having a busy area to serve all around us. We ordered a series of appetizers to share. The best part was the sushi, which consisted of fresh sushi and generally spicy tuna.  Nothing really special about them, although the fried rice medallion topped with tuna tartare was the best item. The dumplings, pot stickers, tuna and others were of good quality but really nothing special about them. Not memorable either.... The shrimp tempura was deep in batter and this overpowered them more than needed. For entrees we ordered 7 entrees to share.  These included the special chicken, shrimp, General's chicken, Pad Thai noodles, Pork ribs and tuna.  All tasted OK but there was nothing to show off the ingredients of the dishes and they felt like they were being thrown together to serve vs a meal....which led to a feeling that all the tastes merged and were not distinct.  For example, the ribs were large and fatty with a small amount of cover leading to more of a blander taste that was not appetizing - half were left behind. The Pad Thai was soggy and noodles were not whole and were really more a 'mush'.I have been to Tao before but I am not going back in a hurry. It was a great place some time back but the quality of the food is not worth the effort or the price, regardless of the magnificent Buddha overlooking the dinner.",0,0,0,Marios D.,"Manhattan, NY",196,509,822

For dinner the four of us ordered an appetizer and entree each and then split everything. Pork dumplings are forgettable, peking duck spring rolls are delicious, tuna tartare is delicious, but the squab lettuce wraps were the best appetizer we had.For entrees, the short ribs were by far the best thing: tender, perfectly cooked, and the most delicious rub/marinade or whatever they cooked it in. We could have foregone everything else and only had this and been perfectly happy. Scallops were fine, but the creamy sauce they came in seemed sort of heavy. The snapper was also great. Mei fen noodles forgettable.My favorite thing that night was the banana bread pudding.

So many mixed reviews here but I must say the experience we had during a recent client lunch was pretty darn good! We were seating on the balcony level overlooking the main dining floor below and the views added to the overall experience here. Nice landscape of the massive Buddha preciding over the facility. Our waitress was wonderful and took care of us even with special requests. Never had to wait for our water glass to be refilled. Our food was brought out as requested and we were quite pleased with our selections.The three course lunch deal I chose consisted of Vegetable Lo Mein Salad, Hanger Steak with Miso and Asian Spiced Fries, and Chocolate Zen Parfait for dessert.

Wanted to take a nap back in my office.Sure, this is a pricey spot for food and drink when coming for dinner, but the lunch deal can't be beat and you get a nice amount of food for the price. Also, it's an affordable way to check out TAO if you have never been here and don't want to break the bank.

We were not seated until midnight when my reservation was for 11pm. (Probably more of our fault but still. We were starving.) When we were finally seated, they were missing napkins and a set of utensils for one of our six people. I was thoroughly annoyed but mostly because I was hangry (hungry & angry). Our food, however, made up for it.I had the salmon and udon noodles which was DELICIOUS. It was very similar to the flavors that I'm accustomed to, obviously, but this dish was really perfected in terms of flavor. My boyfriend had the peppered steak which I thought would come as a big slab of meat. However it was more stir fried-esque; lots of vegetables and came with rice. He also had an order of the pork fried rice. His food was also very very good. The ruby red dragon cocktail was also superb.I informed the waitress that it was my boyfriends birthday prior to ordering and asked her to please bring a fortune cookie with his name scrawled across the plate. I thought she had forgotten but after she saw we were done with dinner, she walked past our table, we exchanged a glance and a couple minutes later, we got our dessert. The mousse center was so good!Aside from the long wait to get into this place, I really did enjoy it. It was also far less expensive than I expected.

And with the sauce it came with was just extra unnecessary salt. My main entree, on the other hand, which was the coconut jumbo shrimp, was fantastic. It was embedded in a rich coconut vinaigrette, something I can safely say I've never experienced in my life. It was a fantastic combination however, and I sweeped my plate clean.

We were seated upstairs but the tables were so close together that it felt like it was communal dining. The  menu looked good and we were drawn to a paragraph on the menu that suggested that the diner could be creative, and the impression was that we just had to ask the waiter and within reason we could mix and match our food choices. Wrong - my colleague saw that they didn't have a red thai chicken curry but they did have other chicken dishes and they had a red thai seafood curry... when we asked if they could do a red thai chicken curry (being creative as suggested) the waiter flatly said no and that the only dishes they had were those on the menu!! When he was asked for some suggestions as to what was good, none were forthcoming. When we did order the food, it was average at best. The service was far from what we expected of a restaurant of such high standing -it seemed to be that all that they wanted was to get us through the courses as quickly as possible so that they could get the next occupants of the table in.

I love food and I did not enjoy my dinner here. It was a birthday dinner and we ordered 6 appetizers to share - I didn't like any of them. There was nothing special about any of the rolls we got (duck roll, vegetable roll....).For the main dish I ordered the xo shrimp with string beans. The shrimp was overcooked and rubbery, the sauce was plain and it honestly tasted like Chinese takeout (price tag x4).I always finish good food or take it home but I couldn't even finish half of it. I declined to take it home. My bf got the wasabi crusted filet mignon which he asked to be cooked medium rare. It came out pretty much well done.

3,3/7/2014,"An alien on a foreign planet is what I'm usually like in places like this. Expensive and a bougie hip b list celebrity crowd. I'd rather eat at a greasy diner than deal with a scene like this. However, friends from Canada were visiting NYC for the first time and really wanted to eat here. So I made the sacrifice and booked us a table on a weeknight. Surprisingly the only times available were 9pm and up. Seems it's the later you eat the cooler you are. I took a 9:30 availability and then worried I wouldn't be able to stay awake by the time we ate. My friends and I arrived and after checking our coats we stepped into the restaurant at the hostess table and could see I already was regretting this decision. Wall to wall packed with people and though we were offered to have a drink at the bar before our table was ready, we couldn't have gotten to it even if we wanted to with the insane crowd in our way. One of my Canadian friends, an ex college hockey player decided to literally fight through the crowd and get us some beers. Luckily she was successful and about ten minutes later she returned with a tray of Heinekens which my group of friends drank happily, literally arm in arm with absolutely no elbow space. We were finally seated and I have to say the decor is breathtaking. We were seated at an upstairs table with a perfect view of the giant Buddha statue. Our waitress was excellent - I believe her name was Melissa - and she answered all our questions  regarding dishes and portions with patience. I got a great vegetable and rice dish that was filling and delicious while my other friends ordered a ton of appetizers to split and share.

On entrees, the kung pao chicken and mu shu pork were both tasty - middle of the road, Americanized versions, but well executed. Desserts were good across the board (banana pudding, chocolate mousse, and the giant fortune cookie, which was fun and the best realization of a ""dessert"" chips and dip I've ever had).

I made reservations using Open Table and changed the reservations to a later time to accomodate all parties. I have a confirmation that this change happened. When we checked in, our reservation was cancelled out of the system and we were told that we had a reservation an hour earlier. The beauty of Open Table is that it keeps track on all the changes, so I showed this confirmed change as well.Sadly, the restaurant did not care and did not do their best to accomodate us at all. They were going to TRY and seat us within 45 minutes. But, they were doing us a favor because clearly we made the mistake. Um - what? My much nicer friend tried to see if in fact they would help us out and  spoke to a manager - he was equally rude and condescending to we ultimately left the restaurant and had a great meal next door at Sarafina.

3,2/26/2014,"I had update my review and remove one star to register my extreme annoyance with the bathroom attendant (not just this particular one but the very presence of an attendant in the first place). The NYT had a piece about the attendants at Balthazar. Now I think Balthazar could dispense with this degrading throwback to another era, but it's Balthazar and one could view this as re-enactment or historical artifact. But this is TAO: a VERY overpriced but outstanding Asian fusion restaurant for bankers who haven't yet made it (i.e. they don't live on the Upper East Side, they just play there) with nightclub music so loud you could be a little deaf a day or two afterward. But that's true of nightclubs generally so you know what you're getting. It's always jammed and sometimes you're in the mood for a scene like this. Tao isn't Balthazar. There is NO need for a bathroom attendant and who the hell uses OTHER people's hairbrushes and combs in a public bathroom? I'm not a germophobe but that's just repugnant. I wasn't eating there. I live 5 blocks away and sometimes I want banana pudding. So I walk in 18 degree temps 5 blocks and have to use the restroom. I'm not a mechanically savvy person but I am pretty sure I can figure out how to turn on water. Then when I didn't tip the woman, she stared daggers at me. The prix fixe lunch for 25 is a deal. HUGE amount of food. Enough to takeout and split with someone if so inclined. And everything is delicious from that special kobe beef sashimi to the thai dumpling soup to the rolls.

Peking Duck Spring Roll $16 (With hoisin sauce).+. Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass $38 (With wok vegetables).+. Wok Seared New York Sirloin $36 (With shiitake mushrooms and Szechwan potatoes).+. Giant Fortune Cookie $12 (Filled with white & dark chocolate mousse)Overall, we gave this Asian-Fusion restaurant 4 stars based on the following:- The ambiance is nice!- The decor is interesting!- Liked the food we selected a lot!  The Peking Duck Spring Roll was so crispy on the outside with tasty fillings in the inside.  The accompanying homemade duck sauce tasted so unique that I asked for seconds haha.  The Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass absolutely took my breath away!!!!!  The Wok Seared New York Sirloin was cooked in pefect medium temperature in the inside with a perfect seared layer on the outside.  But we felt the garnish part had an overdose of salt.  Or maybe we both got used to eating bland food?  -LOVED the Giant Fortune Cookie SURPRISED by my fiancé!!!  I wasn't going to order this dessert because I was already full to the max.  But he insisted in surprising me with this special treat since I kept on mentioning about it hehehe.  They even wrote ""Happy Birthday"" on the plate after my fiancé secretly whispered to them that it's my birthday =)- The background music is very trendy but a tad bit too loud for us to converse and hear each other.- The 2-seater tables are too close to one another, which gave us less privacy,- The restrooms are so well-prepared that they even have perfumes and colognes for us to spray on.  Note:  Be careful in going into the wrong gender restroom.  (Remember that Yin=FEMALE and Yang=MALE)- Prices are high, but in turn, I had a fantastic birthday memory!  =)",6,4,4,Patricia C.,"Queens, NY",169,790,4108

He even brought out their allergy guide! 5 stars to Tao for knowing their stuff and protecting patrons!Everything we ordered was cooked perfectly and we really enjoyed all of it. We started with the edamame, the vegetable egg rolls, the short ribs, and the chicken gyoza. The sauces were awesome esp the mustard that had a great kick! Tasty, tasty! Then we ordered the wasabi encrusted steak and onion rings, the mandarin fried rice with roast pork, the Lo mein with roast pork (custom made by the chef since it regularly has fish oil or sauce), and the Kung pao chicken. We ordered the steak medium and it came out medium. Perfect. The food and drinks came out surprisingly quick for a Friday night we were impressed!The bus boy came over constantly while we were eating and/or talking to ask to take away plates that still had food on them which got annoying.

Not many places can uphold a name and still cater such an array of clientele.The service was very quick and to the point. I didn't like that very much. It's not a welcoming vibe or did the waiter care to help us order after we stated we we're vegetarian and ate fish. A huge turn off in my opinion as an experienced waiter. I really came here because I hEard such rave things about this place but for myself there we're many options. We got the egg roles and they we're fine. The crispy rice with spicy tuna atop we're very tasty, that's the one dish I was really impressed by. We also ordered dumplings with scallion and chives. The presentation was beautiful because they made it look like carrots and the taste was fine but it wasn't anything outstanding. It was okay, We also ordered the sea bass skewers because they came highly recommended. While they tasted fine, it tasted exactly like the skewers from sushi samba. At least at samba they give you 3 skewers for the same price while here you only get two. It tasted exactly the same and didn't have a Whow factor in my opinion. I plan in giving this place one more shot for lunch cuz I've heard their lunch menu is great, we'll see then but for now, I'm not impressed by anything other than the sheer size of the place.",2,0,1,Isaac E.,"Flushing, NY",55,54,86

Greeted in a cramped waiting area by 2 hostess who promptly confirmed our 11:30pm  reservation time. It was this past Saturday night,(day after V-day) so the place was jammed pack. Waited around 10 mins to be seated upstairs in a small cramp space near the bar, where I could stretch my arms and touch the couples table next to us, which was a tad annoying. Setting was very intimate, however it would be better with a larger group. Waiter was quite rude, typical NYC waiter wants you to get you drunk and give him a larger tip. Be aware prices are up there, $22 for a voldka with cranberry you tell me, it was delicious though. Anyway lets get to the food.Part 2The food was quite mediocre thai cuisine. I'm not sure what golden flakes every else was eating but it could of definitely be better. Prices are high and portions are extremely small. I recommend trying the fried rice. I ordered the salmon and she had the pepper steak, both were pretty tasty but again it was nothing special, just average. If you want sushi from here its $5 per piece, so get you soy sauce ready.

I see here men with '90s stripped shirts or deep Vs and pointy shoes and baggy jeans eye-balling the place non stop for women, and women that look like a bus dropped them off at the same time because they all smell like hairspray so you get the idea!   Now the restaurant upstairs  and downstairs is a rip off, they put the name of the chef on the menu but if I was the chef I would be embarrassed to represent that food, which is the same quality you get from any Chinese take out joint, I had duck which was boney and uncooked, the desert I had ice-cream which felt like it was scooped out of a Costco 3 gallon bucket, then comes the attitude of the waiter which he was completely inpatient with us and at some point he started taping his knuckles on the table, well it was a birthday and we were a group of four and didn't want to ruin the atmosphere of that evening, that's why we stayed hopping it will get better but I left with bad bad memories, never again to be returned at this bridge&tunnel dungeon!",0,1,1,Jim J.,"Flatbush, Brooklyn, NY",0,9,0
5,2/1/2014,Incredible atmosphere with amazing food makes Tao my favorite place to eat in NYC. Chilean Sea bass skewers are the best appetizer in NYC hands down. It actually melts in your mouth. The squab lettuce wraps are a must as well and if you aren't in the lazy mood cooking your own steak is pretty fun. Only suggestion definitely get the sausage fried rice over the duck fried rice. As much as I love duck the two can't even be compared. If you are craving duck get the peking duck spring rolls. 5 Stars for Tao.,0,0,0,Matt K.,"Manhattan, NY",102,76,0

There are either 3 or 4 levels and we got seated on the very top which turned out to be very nice. There were only about 8 tables and there was one waiter and one bus boy to the level. It was very romantic lighting and beautiful exposed brick walls. Although dinner cost almost as much as our hotel night stay during christmas in NYC, it was well worth it. We started out with an order of gyoza and tuna tar tar on crispy rice. Both were unbelievably good. We got 2 pieces of kobe beef and 2 of yellowtail sashimi. I wasn't really impressed by the kobe but the yellowtail melted in my mouth. Then we got a rainbow roll, and 2 specialty rolls. Between my date and I, there was plenty of food.

To prevent further embarrassment we left because I'm sure a big scene was going to be made from that argument. I came out to spend money and have a good time.

Nobody batted an eye at my corduroy pants or ""sensible"" shoes.We had to wait for our reservation at 9, but to be fair, our party had gained one more member and some of us had been running late.

It's very dark in the downstairs lounge, so you really do need the candles on the tables.Upstairs is bright and offers a great view of the giant Buddha statue. Our waitress, Megan, stayed cheerful and on the ball despite the fact that our tipsy selves must have tested her memory, and patience! I had my first cosmopolitan here. It reminded me of a grapefruit flavored energy drink I love.The food is elegant and delicious. We all shared a bunch of appetizers. My favorites included a salmon roll with avocado and some chicken dumplings. All the seafood tasted as fresh as it should. Edamame was classic as well, and they served a lot of it.We had a surprise---live drumming! The drummer came to our table and let some of my friends play along. I think my biceps scared him away from me though.Tao is priced accordingly to top notch food and service, for neither of which I was prepared. This is a former Girl Scout fail.

5,12/15/2013,"Total tourist alert -- I came to TAO the first time several years ago because I had seen the Tao grand opening episode on SATC and it looked amazing.Came as a broke college student back in 2009 and it lived up to the hype, even if all I could afford was the dumplings from the appetizer menu and one cocktail. All tourism aside, the restaurant is beautiful, well-decorated, and despite the sometimes (very) long waits, the hostess staff manages what must be a plethora of reservations relatively well. The bar is loungey, but for the crowd this place pulls, it can get awkward. Lots of couches and seats everywhere taking up space. The actual dining room area unfolds below a giant Buddha and lots of water features. The waitstaff is good, but not every waiter and waitress I've had here lives up to what I would expect the standard to be. Nothing to write home about. More recently, I came back (no longer in college nor broke), and after living in Boston for a few years, the menu at Tao is appropriately priced. I wish there were a few more options, though. It seems that they are trying so hard to be unique they are missing some key items. I ordered sushi and I think it had dill in it, which wasn't listed (as another reviewer said -- beware of mystery ingredients that you wouldn't expect!), and I did not enjoy it that much. The food was fresh, the presentation was great, and the flavor was fabulous with the exception of that added dill. Regardless of the few drawbacks, I do really enjoy Tao.

It is absolutely delicious, if you like both ingredients, this is a must try! All the ingredients come together very well and the rice is firm, but also buttery smooth. Some have reviewed the pork pot stickers, but they are worth another mention because they are yummy! The dough is very well-textured to the point where it enhances the taste of the filling. I've had pot stickers where all you taste is the dough, but these were perfectly prepared. The pork filling melted in my mouth. Lots of reviewers have raved about the sushi here. I think it is ok. I like simple sushi rolls where the fish is the main focus over crazy special rolls where there is an explosion of flavors in your mouth that is everything but fish. We had the spicy lobster roll and while it was good, I wouldn't go back for the sushi. In general, I have found that Asian fusion restaurants do well with non-sushi dishes. But again, that is my own bias. The drinks here are very well mixed and worth the prices. Try the tiger lily for something different. Very refreshing consisting of elderberry liqueur, fresh lime and muddled cucumber. And as many have commented, the ambiance is absolutely gorgeous. They play loud techno music which can be irritating, we had a difficult time carrying a conversation across a small table for two.

Don't get me wrong, the ambiance and food was amazing, but because we felt rushed the entire time we were there and got mixed messages from the wait staff, the experience made my friend and I just want to get out of there.  We hit up Tao for lunch, were seated immediately with reservations, and was asked if we wanted drinks. Then we ordered. I got the fixed price lunch and my spring rolls were delivered. You get 3 rolls on a plate. 5 minutes after delivery, the wait staff came back asking if I was done with the plate (Mind you, there were 2.5 rolls still on the plate. Do you think we were done?) From there, they were back and forth at the table about another 5 times interrupting our conversation and asking if we wanted to have our plates taken away (mid-meal.) Then came dessert. My friend did not order dessert, but had told the wait staff that she had a cupcake (which she patted as it sat on the table, and the waitress acknowledged.) The staff came back with 2 spoons, as I ordered dessert, and we assumed she could eat her cupcake. Mid munching through our desserts, the waitress came back and let us know that outside food cannot be eaten in the restaurant. Then why was a spoon given to her and why did she not bring this up before she walked away the first time? Very confusing signals.

We ordered some dishes and the food was okay, to be honest though its overrated and I'd rather stick to regular Chinese take out. The worst part of my experience though is when we asked to speak to a manager. I wish I would have gotten his name but it slipped my mind at the moment. I cant even begin to express how rude the manager was. We wanted to address a concern with him and he was so rude talking down to us and making smart comments.

The moment we walked in, I was already impressed by the beautiful presentation - a giant Buddha waterfall statue in the back, spiral bamboo plants behind glass, large glowing hanging lanterns, and a huge Japanese scroll dancing across most of the ceiling. It's a very classy place, and I was glad that I dressed up. We arrived at 7pm, and the hostess informed us that there would be a 30-minute wait for a table. Since we wanted to get served right away, we opted to sit at the bar on the second floor. Great choice, as you get a fantastic view of the entire restaurant from there.Their specialty cocktails were delicious! Each signature drink had a unique blend, and I went with the Pama Sutra and Lychee Martini. We both had a plate each of the Spicy Tuna Tartare and the Chilean Sea Bass Skewers with Roasted Asparagus. And although I wasn't a fan of the texture of the crispy rice that came with the tuna, the sea bass IS TO DIE FOR. The sauce that it's marinated in tastes so magical, I could have eaten four more servings.As far as sushi goes, we had their smoked salmon roll with sweet wasabi sauce and the angry dragon roll - both of which were fantastic. And what made the night even better? Ordering the dark chocolate spring rolls in orange marmalade dipping sauce for dessert! Do I sincerely believe Tao deserves a 5 out of 5? ABSOLUTELY.

5,8/14/2013,"Let me start out by saying that this is, without a doubt, a Finlay approved restaurant.My #FancyDad took myself and a couple of friends out for dinner while visiting New York for a conference this past weekend.  I have been to Tao several times before in the past for a girls lunch, birthday and other occasions but wasn't yet in a part of the Yelp world so this review is very much over due.I love everything about this restaurant - from the moment you use the brass circular handles to open the heavy wooden doors, the ebony, royal purple lighted bar and lounge area, massive Buddha over looking the entire restaurant, the glass rose table, cocktails, food, service and beyond.  If one looks over to the left of the Buddha, they see a DJ who is spinning great house-like music all night long.  It does make this restaurant quite loud especially when the tables are tight and you can hear other people easily.  Despite that, this place is truly a feast for the senses! (As well as for people who can afford the occasional $$$$ dinner).  Incredibly trendy and chic, Tao is so very Upper East Side without being terribly stiff and rude.  The space is cavernous and looks as though it could be a trendy restaurant/club in the meatpacking district downtown.  I always start off my time by wandering over to the small, intimate bar/lounge space.  There are plenty of couches to sit on but get taken up quickly by pretentious-y people.  Luckily enough, my #FancyDad got a spot by the bar and we enjoyed a Lychee Martini while my friends enjoyed a Jade Blossom and Pama Sutra.  Each drink was juicy, fruity and refreshing.Eventually, our beeper buzzed and lit up and we were escorted to our table - but not without squeezing in between other tables and waiters.  Our table was squished in between other tables that another guest thought he was entitled to more room.  Sorry honey, but have some class and ask a waiter to resolve your problem and not give an eye to my father. (Read that, Tao? Might want to be more aware of this situation.)  Before I could fully sit and exhale, Graham, our marvelous waiter, came over to ask if we wanted water and if we wanted to drink.  From there, the drinks were flowing and we all got several dishes to share amongst ourselves.From all the times I have come here, I learned that TAO is a place where you share your food.  Sure, the portions for appetizers are good for one person but they're all so delicious you can't not try to try everything.   For birthdays, their trademark fortune cookie cake is a must-have even if it is not your birthday.  The service is always quick and efficient and you are left in your own version of asian-fusion heaven.Back to this past weekend, we ordered the following:          -Hot Edamame          -Lobster Wontons with Shiitake Ginger Broth          -Squab Lettuce Wraps          -Thai Crab Cakes with spicy mango chilli sauce          -Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice          -Peking Duck for Two          -Chilean Sea Bass with vegetables          -Pepper Steak Stir Fry All of the food was fantastic but with minor let downs.  The crab cakes were tiny and only came with three. Not good sharing amongst four people - dually noted. The Squab Lettuce Wraps were divine but not enough squab and in fact, the sauce didn't do the squab justice.  There wasn't that much tuna on the crispy rice.  The Pepper Steak Stir Fry was not what was expected.  It was certainly delicious however Stephy P. and my #FancyDad thought it would be spicy or perhaps have more pepper, it wasn't. The Peking Duck came with extra skin on the side and I thought it was perfection however my #FancyDad thought it could have been more crispy and could have offered more skin.  I kind of agree.The dessert, of course, was amazing.  Ingrid S. and I shared the Mochi.  My favorite was the green tea, it was spectacular.  My dad had a wonderfully rich tasting apple tart while Stephy P. had creme brulee. Pretty sure we all wished we could be rolled out of the restaurant but alas, we all either walked or took the subway home.This is easily one of my top favorite restaurants in Manhattan and of all of New York in general.  I can't wait to come back.",1,1,2,Anna F.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",262,241,2187
3,8/14/2013,"Tao is a place you go for atmosphere and ambiance, not excellent Asian fusion cuisine... The food is fine, don't get me wrong, but good enough to keep me coming back.

4,8/14/2013,"First of all, I probably would never go here if it weren't for my friend's fancy pants Dad being in town. I'm lucky enough that he so graciously has not once but twice treated me to a culinary adventure! Second, I'm honestly only notching down my star rating because of the ambience. This place is way way too loud and slightly Hampton's upper east side deuchy to be heard over a martini and Giant Buddah figure. But the place is really gorgeous. Giant Buddah IS watching over you while you eat in the dining area. The bar area is a little cramped but still stylish and trendy playing on colors of ebony, gold, and different hues of red. There's also a small pool in front of the giant figurine on the main dining floor with these gigantic orange and white fish that appear to want to eat you. I think they are what we call Koi fish. The four of us had a little bit of a wait which was no problem because we saddled up to the bar area to sample some of their unique and interesting cocktails. One of my friends and her Dad had ordered Lychee martinis respectively and I opted or hoped for something a little less sweet but still ended up with another sweet concoction. Though, it certainly wasn't bad. I ordered the Jade Blossom to start: Hangar One Pear, Midori, fresh Pineapple and Sparkling Sake. I think the Sake was what sold me in that one but the Midori made it a bit like a jolly rancher. I also ended up having the Peach Cosmopolitan and the Pama Sutra. I was a freaking GIRL that night. The Pama Sutra was definitely the clear winner because it was loaded down with Don Julio Silver Tequila and Pomegranate Liqueur. I also sampled my friend's Tao-hito. See what Tao did there. Tee hee. It actually was a quality Mojito. Moving on from the drinks which I could talk about forever because I'm a lush. . . . . We ordered a large round of appetizers to share amongst the table; starting with hot edamame. The best of the appetizers were absolutely without a doubt the Lobster Wontons with Shiitake Ginger Broth. Its mouth-watering and melting in your mouth. We also had ordered the Squab Lettuce Wraps, very similar to something you can get from those Peking Kitchen chains but of a higher quality. It's diced up squab meat with hoisin sauce in a lettuce wrap. Still tasty. Thai Crab Cakes with Mango Chili Sauce - Slightly spicy and not enough in an order. You get 3 tiny cakes. Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice - Honestly, this was one of my favorites merely because I FREAKING LOVE RAW TUNA. I could write about it for days and this was fresh and decadent. For all of the prices of everything we literally each got 1 of each and if I were paying, I'd be pissed about the prices. The small plates are genuinely small and meant for 2 people. Thank God we're fatties and ordered 4 items. For entrees we decided to do the exact same thing with a family style dinner. Peking Duck for Two - One of the best ducks I've had in a long time. Probably not since I was a teenager and my own Dad took me to Shun Lee Palace. If you can remember a meal from when you were 13, it has to be memorable. But the duck was crispy and moist at the same time. SO rich and deserving of numerous merits. They lay some of the extra crispy skin out around the fresh chunks of meat as well. The flour wraps that they provide to go with the duck honestly were kind of pointless because we just wanted to eat the duck as it was. I personally opted that we also try the Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with Wok Vegetables. I could write a book about this Chilean Sea Bass. It's the best fish I've had in my entire life. I usually don't order fish in a restaurant, so that probably explains that one. But it melted like butter on your tongue and the summer vegetables were a perfect accompaniment sopping up that sauce. Last, Steph P. choose that we get the Pepper Steak Stir Fry. Honestly, it was just okay. I could have done without that dish because it didn't leave anything impregnating on my mind. Finally, we finished this amazing meal with desert. I split a trio of green tea, red bean, and vanilla Mochi with Anna. Her father got a divine apple baked tart with a very rich vanilla custard ice cream. And Steph had the best freaking crème brulee that I've ever had in my life. I'm always hesitant over trying things like this because it looks like flan to me and I hate flan with every fiber of my being but this was outstanding. Needless to say, this was an amazing experience and I would go back again if I had money. But I feel they over-charge on appetizers for sure and that the noise level is slightly over-whelming. Sorry for the book.",4,5,3,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",844,1384,11457
4,8/13/2013,"I hate to say it, but I really enjoyed my meal here and without saying, the decor is gorgeous!!! I came in having very low expectations since I feel Asian fusion always strays too far from the Asian side and too much towards the Non Asian side. This is another place I give props to since it has stood the test of time and it is still pretty busy. BTW there is a lot of eye candy here. =)The food:Miso Sea Bass- This dish might be/should be their signature dish. I was so impressed how good it was and with typical Asian fusion it would be too sweet but this was not the case. The fish was slightly crunchy on the outside and had a nice sweetness from the soy and miso and a nice flaky meat inside. Definitely my favorite thing here. Peking Duck Spring rolls- I remember liking this dish, I thought it was nicely crisp and the duck had a nice flavor that wasn't too ducky. It might have leaned a tad too much on the sweet side, though.Molten Chocolate Cake- I think this was the first place I remember who served the molten chocolate cake and I think it's the best I ever had. It has a great liquid chocolate center, the outside cake wasn't too soft and the toasted and shaved coconut added a nice contrast in texture. I am a fan.",0,0,0,Ben L.,"Queens, NY",978,1001,2785

5,7/17/2013,"Was here on a Saturday night, made reservations a few days before for two people at 7pm. If you want to come here, I would definitely recommend a reservation because this place is always busy.Was seated at the first level (where the big Buddha is) and we chose the Ruby Red Dragon cocktail because we were in the mood of Yuzu citrus (a citrus flavored Sake) for the whole day. The cocktail is very good, sweet and perfect for ladies. Under the recommendation of the waiter (and of course the temptation), my bf ordered the 12oz Grilled Kobe Ribeye with Yuzu Cilantro Butter (well it's his birthday afterall) and I ordered Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass (my favorite kind of fish). We also ordered a piece of Uni (Sea Urchin) Sushi and two pieces of Toro (fatty Tuna) sushi.We both agree that the Kobe Ribeye was very delicious. The Yuzu Cilantro Butter did give it a very refreshing taste and the beef was cooked perfectly. The Ribeye was very soft to chew on. However, we also agree that it doesn't worth $85 and that the Chilean Sea Bass was a better deal. The Chilean Sea Bass melts in your mouth and brings you to heaven, which is a better experience than the Kobe Ribeye. The Uni was pretty good, and $8 per piece is a pretty reasonable price for this restaurant, but I wouldn't go here for sushi. Seriously in Manhattan, there's a lot of restaurants that provide quality sushi with a cheaper price. The fatty Tuna were also good, but the best fatty Tuna I've ever had was still in Hirua in Fort Lee, NJ. The waiter was pretty attentive and patient. I believe this restaurant is best for group dinner because the ambiance here is for you to socialize and enjoy a good dinner.Would definitely come here again, but gotta save up first cause this place is not cheap!",1,0,1,Ivy T.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",92,105,124

Since I was early I could not be seated which was not a problem, but, the girl at the desk was kind of rude about which is why I had to take away one star!!! I did not expect to be seated, she was automatically rude for no reason. I had a couple of drinks while I waited for my friend. I like to people watch so I did not mind waiting.

I have to say: I was impressed to say the least.  At the entrance, there are beautiful cast iron doors and a small Buddha and within, there is a dark ambiance that makes you feel like you've stepped into another world. You really do forget where you are because the interior is not designed to relate specifically to NYC; it's designed as a temple.  My guest and I arrived late for our reservations but despite the line up and the crazy amount of people already inside, we were accommodated in the lounge for about 40 minutes, then taken to our table. The lounge or bar side of the restaurant is comfortable and designed a lot like a communal space. The couches are low and there are tables between couch like benches, so guests (strangers and friends alike) can sit beside each other or back to back. There is a small bar and seating that lines the walls. In the far back is an amazing and enormous Buddha statue that overlooks the lower level dining area. There is also an upstairs level for additional seating.  It is a pricy place, but you have to know that going in. For 2 people, our bill was about $100.

May be it always did and I just got older. :) Also, although we had a late dinner (after 9PM), due to Tao being a ""hot spot"", the food still took a while to arrive. However, everything we ordered was either very good or great, and we ordered pretty much every kind of spring roll, dumpling and tempura to share. My favorite spring rolls were the peking duck ones, and I also loved the sweet potato tempura. None of the dumplings were particularly memorable. My husband's scallop entree was excellent, though a tid bit over spiced. My friend's husband had the roasted thai buddha chicken and absolutely loved it.

Delivery was about 45mins to 1 hour which is expected I suppose.The lo mein was really good! I like the texture of the noodles. They weren't super greased up with oil like most other chinese restaurants and still the portion for the price point was fair. They also had some vegetables outside your standard carrots/onions which I liked. I want to say it was broccoli rabe...but I'm not sure. Regardless it was good.The emperor ribs...bad call on this. I got it because I saw one of the pictures on yelp but it was not too tasty. Firstly there were ~2 ribs where the meat was just unchewable or fused with the tendon/fat and just couldn't be eaten. It's just a waste of a rib! Furthermore, the sauce wasn't ""wet enough"". The ribs were rather dry and the cooked texture of the meat was a bit too well done for my liking. If you haven't already guessed, I like my ribs tender/fall off the bone and wet.The molten cake was pretty good. Served with toasted(or roasted?) coconut shavings and ice cream. By the time I got my cake, the heat probably overcooked it a bit during travel time, but It was still good nonetheless.

We also had the orange chicken, which other people liked but did not stand out to me.The real highlight of the meal was the giant fortune cookie for dessert. I was skeptical about how good this could be since fortune cookies are usually somewhat tasteless and stale. But the cookie combined with the chocolate mousse really made for a delicious pairing. We also got chocolates which were very difficult to bite into, would not recommend.Ambiance is clubby with a pulsing dubstep undertone at all times and somewhat dark lighting.

4,3/31/2013,"First time at Tao for a bday dinner and my initial impression was very good. Very nice atmosphere everyone was well dressed and looked sexy very nice appeal. We started out with the pork spring rolls and shrimp tempura for appetizer. Delicious! I just wish there were more. Presentation and taste was great but definitely not enough to share. For dinner everyone tried something different. Reading other yelp reviews I decided to try the Tao-hito and the love potion. I've had about 100 different mojitos and this one was average. The love potion was great though. Definitely recommended The food was very good but the desert is what made the night. They ruined the filet Mignon with some kind of wasabi topping but If you get it without its delicious. Very tender and tasty.  The Orange chicken was a little too orange for me but the lobster crab bowl was absolutely scrumptious. The giant fortune cookie, the banana pudding, and the lava cake are absolutely delicious. The chocolate cake comes with the most delicious coconut ice cream I've ever tasted. The banana on the pudding with tempura was perfect. The entire table shared in my desert. The mousse for the giant cookie gave it a great balance. I can go on and on about the deserts. Overall a great place for a get together. $1000 for 9 people wasn't bad. Will probably go again",0,0,0,Douglas W.,"Mount Vernon, NY",14,105,104

5,3/25/2013,"ME OH MY.  I went to Tao for a birthday dinner.  Where do I even begin?First and foremost, the restaurant is like a palace.  There's a huge buddah man in the back with plants and water.  There are high ceilings and the tables are spacey and comfortable.  I absolutely loved the feel of it - so lavish and boogey, but authentic. For starters, I ordered a Mojito, which I believe they call a Tao-jito.  It was easily the freshest, smoothest, best tasting mojito I have every had.  One of my dining partners ordered a cucumber mojito, which was just different enough to be EVEN BETTER.  Literally like earth shatteringly good - I wish they came by the pitcher.  We got a couple of appetizers to share.  The skwab lettuce wraps were awesome - only critique is that there could have been more lettuce.  The pork spring rolls were so great, too with a chili thai sauce (or something, but it was orange and great).  My favorite though were the chicken dumplings.  The dipping sauce was to die for, and the meat in the dumpling was plentiful and juicy.  Really a sensation.  For dinner, I had the short ribs and a side of Pork Lo Mein.  The short ribs were definitely delicious and sooo soft, I just wish they had come with a little bit of rice or something.  The Lo Mein was AMAZING. Lo Mein for me is hit or miss, but this was spot on with a perfect balance of meat, veggies, and noodles. Others in the group ordered orange chicken, sushi, etc.  Everyone was generally satisfied. Now my friends, we come to dessert.  For my friend's birthday, they brought over a dessert place for the table.  On it was a variety of ice creams and sorbets, a chocolate lava cake, some chocolate pieces, fried bananas, and to top it off, a HUGE fortune cookie filled on either side with chocolate and vanilla mousse. We smashed it to pieces and dipped the cookie into the mousse.  Such a perfect amount for the group.  It was definitely a pricey meal, but everything was incredible, from the food to the service.  Go on a pay day! ;)",2,2,2,Andrew L.,"New York, NY",59,25,0

Visitors - please don't go here if you're looking for a good Asian fusion place!! Yes, it's huge and impressing with 3 floors, grandiose decor, and live drummer. I think they are trying to create an experience. But, once the food reaches the table, the starts going down hill. Tuna tar-tar (appetizer) was awful. Who puts a hash brown type potato cake with tuna?! On top of that it actually tasted like a bad frozen hashbrown. Ordered the Salmon with Udon & Spinach. Absolutely tasteless. I had to add loads of hot sauce, soy sauce and wasabi to get some flavor to the whole dish. Vegetable eggrolls would have been better from your local Chinese take-out.

3,2/27/2013,"OK, let me get right to it. The vibe, the building, the food, the drinks, and the 45 foot tall Buddha are all just amazing and if it weren't for the harried and pretty crappy customer care, this place could be one of the absolute best destinations to dine in the city.Let me start with the good. Ambiance: This place is an ultra-cool and really, by New York standards, EPICALLY-SIZED restaurant. With three levels of seating, expansive ceilings, and theatrical lighting, the place feels like a very well done theme-restaurant in the suburbs of Denver. (Yes Casa Bonita, that was a shout out to you.) The Koi pond, the huge buddha, the Chinese calligraphy on parchment across the ceiling, the lounge, and the dining areas are all inviting, and sexy.The food is wonderful. The Potstickers were the best pan-fried dumplings I've ever had. Period.  The Peking duck spring rolls were fantastic. There were essentially three traditional spring rolls chopped in half and served sushi roll style with a dollop of hoisin sauce on each one. They were served on a beautiful dish with a recessed sauce pit for easy dunking. I should note that all of the plate-ware and presentation was beautiful.We had the Crispy Spicy Tuna roll with avocado as well. Traditionally sushi-restaurant style. Very well done. The roasted Buddha's chicken, which essentially, was a traditional Chinese restaurant style chicken and vegetables sautéed in a light and tasty sauce with rice was great as well.Also we got the Peking duck fried rice, which is no more extravagant than it sounds.By the time we'd gotten through that, that was enough for the main course for three of us. We finished, as per many Yelp reviews recommendation, with the giant fortune cookie. This thing is simply awesome. It's an enormous fortune cookie that then gets filled with white chocolate mousse on one side and chocolate mousse on the other and is served with fresh fruit. It's huge, sharable, and delicious.So, all of this said, why the three stars? Where's the other two stars??It really comes down to service and staffing. The predominant vibe is simply that of an annoyed and overworked server force. The trouble started two steps inside the door with the woman at coat check. We came on a cold Sunday afternoon. I was looking around and sizing the place up as one of my guests checked her coat. Another group of women came in behind us and tried to decide whether to keep or check their coats. One of the women asked the coat-check attendant, ""Excuse me, is it very cold in there?"" The coat check attendant mysteriously answered, ""It gets pretty crowded. It's not so busy now, but it will get packed."" At this point, I assumed that the coat-check woman had misheard the guest and so I interjected, ""I think she was asking about the temperature."" To which the coat check woman spun at me and said, ""I KNOW what she asked me."" My hands involuntarily went up like I was being robbed, ""Apologies."" I said. ""Just trying to help."" Then, we were briskly ushered up to our table. Our first server noticed the table wobbling and said, ""I'll just get something to fix that."" And disappeared. Completely. Eventually another server came along. She had the look and attitude of someone on negative autopilot. We put in our drink order, which included a Gibson Martini. Our first server resurfaced with a device to stop the wobbly table and we thanked her before her fellow server arrived with our drinks. When the Gibson got put down in front of my dad, it was a curious yellow color with a big lemon twist in it. Now, a Gibson Martini is really only defined by one thing. Cocktail onions. That's it. That's what makes it a Gibson. So my dad says, ""Excuse me, I'd ordered a Gibson Martini?"" Our waiter gives my dad a look like he's made of stupid and says, ""Yeah?"" So my dad uncomfortably explains, ""Well, a Gibson is just a martini with cocktail onions."" Our server immediately says, ""Well we don't have any cocktail onions.. Do you want me to take it back?""  My dad weighed whether it was worth it and finally said, ""No, I'm sure this will be fine."" So now that she was there and we were making our selections we asked a question about the Buddha's chicken. She curled her lip up and said, ""It's, you know...chicken... sautéed with vegetables."" Again with a look and energy of, ""You ever had chicken? Idiots?""  Once the food was served, we were very happy just to be feasting away. But soon the busboys were like plate sharks swimming through the crowd, ready to whisk half empty plates away whether you were done with the food on them or not. We had to hold our plates to the table most of the meal to make sure they stayed. To sum up...if you're dinner conversation at a restaurant turns into a conversation ABOUT the failings OF the restaurant, the restaurant isn't doing something right. TAO has great potential, but the whole staff needs a guest relations retreat. Stat.",2,1,0,Carson E.,"Brooklyn, NY",79,186,5
2,2/26/2013,"Nothing really excited us. The freshness and presentation of the food failed to meet our expectations. We have tried several restaurants with the theme of Asian fusion. This one does not give us the feeling of Asian fusion. The taste of food should be more American oriented, which means people like us who are from Asian countries feel they are strange. One more thing, I don't know if it is proper to bring it on here. As the restaurant has Buddha, we assume the operators of this restaurant at least know something about Buddhism. As far as we know, most restaurants which have themes that related to Buddhism are vegetarian restaurants. All of them emphasize the importance of a quiet environment which can make customers feel sort of Zen. This restaurant is very crowded and noisy, and provides all kinds of meat.

Why bother taking reservations if they make no difference? And I get that it's 35F outside, but the restaurant was being kept entirely too warm.

Amazing flavor, though would've liked a bit of the pot sticker sauce for dipping.Two sushi rolls - serviceable but nothing spectacular. One of them came with a chili mayonnaise that took up way too much real estate inside the roll and left it squishy.Coconut shrimp - the belle of the ball. Huge king prawns, six of them, with great coconut breading and a generous portion of Asian slaw. Wonderful.Peking duck - beautifully cooked with crispy skin, not at all oily.Chicken sausage fried rice - husband says it ""wasn't worth the cost of admission"".We were a party of two couples.

Came here for my bestie's birthday, Otherwise, I don't think I would ever set foot in a restaurant that serves Chinese take-out quality food at such steeping prices.  -I got the crispy spicy tuna tartare thanks to the rec from my fellow yelpers. It was seriously just mediocre (even below, if I dare say) for 6 pieces at a whopping 19bucks. Jeez. -We all got some sort of crab cake/shrimp thing and it had way too much sweet/sour sauce on it -I tried my friend's pepper steak (it was stir fried with a bunch of vegetables) and the meat was way too chewy.

3,12/27/2012,"If it wasn't for the hostess stand right by the door, you might think you accidentally walked into a night club instead of a restaurant.Went here with a large party for lunch.  The place is huge.  As you pass the hostess stand, you walk into the bar area, which has several seats and tables scattered in front of the actual bar.  Pass the bar and you'll enter the dining area with, as many have already mentioned, the huge Buddha statue in the middle.  The dining area is crowded and it was a little bit difficult for our party to find out way to our table - not because we're obese, but there were about 20 of us.  I was a little bit annoyed that they seated us at a table that could comfortably accommodate 18 at best, but we managed to squeeze in.They have a very reasonable prix fixe menu for lunch which I would recommend.  It's not a bargain by any means, but you're paying for the ambiance and the opportunity to sit in front of a huge Buddha statue while you eat.  Nothing on the prix fixe menu was amazing, but it's probably enough to satisfy you for lunch.  I ordered the chicken satay - the peanut sauce was really good, but the satay was just ok.  The soy ginger glazed salmon was a good balance of marinade and salmon.  We ordered appetizers for the table and the one that stood out was the spicy tuna tartare on crispy rice.  I love crispy rice and spicy tuna is good with anything.  It was a great combo, as simple as it is.  Some people in my party were less than thrilled with it, but I enjoyed it.Service was ok.  I know our waitress really tried.  But given the size of our party, it can be difficult to make sure everyone gets what they ordered.  We all ordered from the prix fixe menu, but our waitress seemed to constantly confuse two people in the party for each other.  Their plates were mixed up for appetizers, entrees, and even desserts.  I don't get it.  They look nothing alike and they were sitting on opposite ends of the table.  It wasn't that she didn't care - it's just seems to be an honest mistake that she made over, and over, and over again.  I probably wouldn't have thought twice about it, but I was still pissed that we were seated at such a small table and not at that grand banquet table on the third floor.If you're male and need to use the restroom, you can go downstairs and find a trough where five guys can pee if they were to stand side-by-side.  It reminds me a bit of the old Shea Stadium where you're basically peeing into a large gutter.  I don't know why they did that.  I guess urinals are not chic enough for this place?In conclusion, this isn't a bad place if you're in the area and want to try something 'upscale' and different from the typical midtown fare.  There are lots of nicer restaurants in the area that have great food, but sometimes, don't you want to sit in front of a huge Buddha statue while you eat your slightly above average tasting Asian fusion food?",0,0,0,Brian C.,"Manhattan, NY",26,270,0

Knowing that the bill probably came up to over $700 for 7 people, it's quite an expensive meal for an establishment and quality of food like Tao. Service was adequate and not over bearing. Food was hit or miss and overpriced. We had rounds of appetizers and entrees to share. The good: seabass entree, lobster spring roll (chunks of lobster meat) and some beef dish which was super tender. The bad: The hefty price tag that did not equate to the quality of the food, plus the loud music and quite frankly, tacky decor!BTW, Jeremy Shockey was sitting at the table next to us and he was super cool, said hello and shook our hands.",0,0,0,vicky c.,"Forest Hills, NY",10,84,0
1,12/11/2012,"Rude, long long wait, average food, too touristy, crowded, and loud.A business partner took us to Tao for dinner. My initial impression was okay - the food was average, there was a wait to be seated despite coming in time for our reservations, the bar was over-crowded and restaurant very loud. The big Buddha statue is tall but in a corner and not that visible in the dimly lit restaurant unless you know about it. We ordered several appetizers, since they were filling we went directly to dessert. We ordered the molten chocolate cake and giant fortune cookie. The fortune cookie was good and a novelty, chocolate cake okay. Overall the food was nothing to write home about.On our wedding anniversary, I decided to take my husband here to check out their entree menu. We had a reservation and were running 20 mins late. I called 12 mins after reservation time and told them that we were stuck in traffic and just 5 mins away, they refused to hold our reservation, but asked us to come over anyway. Okay so we went. The front desk women were completely distracted, disorganized, and disinterested. She told us she would give us our pager in 5-10 mins, and forgot all about it. We had to remind her. She said the wait is 20 mins, even if that. Okay so we waited. 30 mins later we asked again, she said to wait another 25-30 mins, when we protested since she had just said that 30 mins earlier, she barked at us that we were late for our reservation. Overall the entire experience was horrible, even when I called the person was extremely rude and the front desk women were terrible as well.By then we had decided to just leave. Go to Tao if you want to spend $$$$ on average food or go through throngs of people. The restaurant is completely over-rated. NY has so many good restaurants, not worth throwing money here and being treated rudely. Needless to say we took a cab to Avra, their sister restaurant just a few blocks away, were seated within 15 mins, and had a wonderful meal in a much more friendly atmosphere.

This is where we waited for our table to be ready because despite a reservation, we still waited for about 45 minutes. Either way, it was a pleasant wait and the cool ambiance helped it go by a bit faster. Finally, we were sat for dinner, and luckily enough, right in front of the 20 foot floating Buddah. It was a spectacular sight and the beginning of a special night. Shortly after being sat, we ordered a delicious Kobe beef carpaccio, magnificent mango topped crab cakes for appetizers and then each ordered a different and fantastic fish for entree.

Tao did not disappoint one bit.We were sat at table 131. Ask for this table! It's the best in the house - middle of the balcony overlooking the buddah and tables below.The restaurant has a certain 'I deserve to be here' arrogance about it.

The waiters are well-informed and recommend exactly how you approach the extensive menu.

Once we were all there (it took about 20 minutes for all of us to show) we waited over an hour to be seated. The hostesses were more like table Nazis both before we arrived and up until the point we were seated.

The food in my opinion was subpar with the pricing. The food is average Asian fusion food that can be found less expensively with better service in the City.The place is obnoxiously loud, the food (once again) is overpriced and average at best, and the service was okay (but the hostesses are downright horrible).

Toa is solely a trendy experience and not a recommended destination for foodies. We ordered a couple appetizers and several entrees but none were worth mentioning. Definitely not a place you go to experience authentic Asian cuisine since the food tastes like P.F.Chang's takeout with added sugar. The people watching is fairly hilarious though.

I started off with the Lobster Wontons with Shiitake Ginger Broth. Amazing! The broth is absolutely delicious. By the end of the dish I was practically licking the bowl. Next, I opted for the Crispy Orange Chicken. I suspect that my dish was one of the first orders that was prepared by the chef. While extremely tasty it was not as hot (temperature-wise) as I would have expected. In addition the chicken was extremely hard, which further confirmed my suspicions that the chicken sat around while the other dishes were prepared. Trying to bite through this tough chicken took a toll on my hand as I tried unsuccessfully to use my chopsticks. By the third piece of chicken I was in need of a fork.

3,9/8/2012,"""Grab the food as fast as you can so you can try every dish!"" That was our motto for a family style dinner party of about 30. This review should be useful for anyone planning a big party here. In our case it was  a 30th birthday, for 30 friends. Catchy, right? Well, unfortunately, they don't have tables that fit 30 and they ended up awkwardly separating the party into two tables, one round and one square. The birthday boy was sitting on the square one with family and some friends. The rest of the friends occupied the big round table. Awkward, since when people would come to greet him, they wouldn't even notice a whole other table of people they knew as they passed by it (not even sure they realized it by the end of the night). So the tradition of making toasts to the birthday boy and everyone listening was somewhat lost on the entire party. Well that and the fact that it was so loud with ""popular"" music being spun by a live DJ, as well as a drummer at some point walking around the tables (We thought it was a stripper at first, as there was a table of bachelorette celebrating girls that the guy headed straight to, but alas, as disappointed as I was, it wasn't a stripper).The party was strictly held from 8:30pm to 11pm and they mean business. As the minutes were ticking closer to 11pm and our last leftovers of dessert were taken away...there was that, let's start cleaning the table so that they don't order any other drinks thing hanging in the atmosphere. While it took a little while for everyone to get there on time and sit down and order drinks, what followed was a well timed appetizer, entrée and dessert at all appropriate times. The funny thing was that we had no way of knowing whether there will be enough food for everyone and so people would grab food as soon as they could from a large turning round plate that stood in the middle of our (round) table. It was almost like the survival of the fittest. To be fair, there was enough food for everyone to try every thing that came out of the kitchen. But the psychological aspect of anticipation and the unknown took over our physical needs of survival.  While some people were trying to be polite and modest, others were on a mission (including moi - I am not missing the taste of that wasabi steak something). Otherwise, face it, while some may be dieting (and eating less), others have no qualms about anything that looks new, exotic and delicious - bring on the yummy.It is a blur now, on what actually came out of the kitchen. I do recall dishes of green sides, as in green leafy vegetables. As nutritious as those may have been (although they were soaked in some sauce or other) there were not popular at all. So I'll cheat a little and have to reference the menu (for what I can remember at least, since our pre-fix menu was limited):- Vegetable dumplings - were OK, nothing to rave home about. The dough was a bit too rubbery for my liking as if it stayed out after cooking for a little more than it should have.- Tuna tartar something on crusted rice - this was kind of cool, at first you think its tuna tartar on a piece of toast, and you're like ""whoa"" and then you're like, wait its actually rice.- Wasabi pepper filet mignon - this one was interesting, was done ""medium"" with not too much flavor outside of the crusted wasabi on top of it. - Glazed sea bass (?) - this was probably the favorite for everyone at the table, so would recommend trying it.What stood out was definitely the dessert. Fine, I'm biased since I'm a big dessert person:- BIG Chinese cookie with chocolate and vanilla moose on either side and fresh fruits, including lychee, strawberries, blueberries...- Banana awesomeness: fried banana on top of a pot of banana, cream, cookie(?) mix - awesomeness! So the dessert I would give 5 stars, but SEE ABOVE for the variety of things that brought it down to 3 stars, particularly it's the management of a large party. This place is just not ideal for large parties.",2,1,2,Anna V.,"PECK SLIP, NY",310,220,317

Well, because the portions are tiny. At least with Chinese take-out you get plenty. My chicken and udon dish was meh. I've certainly had better udon at my local sushi joint.

I personally wouldn't recommend coming here for any formal business meetings or get togethers because it can get very loud and boisterous during the evening hours. Sadly, I've been here many times but always end up ordering different things (not sure why), so I can't really recommend or comment on any of the dishes. However, in terms of ambiance, this place is the way to go! It reminds me a lot of STK (in the meat packing), same concept and great looking crowd. I'm sure I will be back again. So, I will update if I happen to stumble across any new/notable dishes worth mentioning! :)",3,0,0,Dana C.,"New York, NY",15,19,0

I first went in 2007 and again in 2012 and I think there has definitely been a decline in overall experience at this restaurant. The service is okay as well.

I think not. The best part of these rolls was the pineapple sauce I later used to dip my entree in. The meat was good, but there was a lot going on, and not necessarily in the taste department- sweet potato tempura: yummy -- simple yet delicious- avocado tempura: hello creamy and salty deliciousness, why have we never met before- orange chicken: pretty good, your standard asian orange chicken dish so no complaintsI wouldn't be back.

3,6/30/2012,"We went here last night for my daughter's 21st because she loves this place.  It had been a few years since we had been here.  We got there around 8 pm (reservation for 8:30) and sat in the lounge to wait and have a drink.  It was packed and the noise was deafening.  Service a bit slow - took about 15 minutes to get drinks. But the cocktail waitress was very nice.  By the time our full party arrived it was 8:30.  We were seated in minutes despite the fact they were very busy.  I appreciate that they can manage their reservations.  I have to admit, the dining room is spectacular.  The giant stone Buddha, the dark tables, the stone sculptures in little nooks around the wall, the Koi pond, the ceiling.  Even though I knew what to expect it was still impressive.  We were seated near the Buddha at the back of the restaurant.  That was a good location - not as noisy as the center of the room.  I had ordered a flower center piece earlier in the day and there it was on the table as planned.  Our servers were attentive and friendly.  We ordered a round of appetizers first, and after that we ordered dinner.  As the evening wore on there was a live saxophonist playing along with canned background music and that was really nice.  He played some continuous soft jazz riffs that were pleasant, and later came down, chatted with my other daughter (she graduated just recently as a saxophone performance major) and then played happy birthday for a large group not far from us.  OK so why only 3 stars?  Really, it's the food.  I guess I had remembered the food as being interesting and delicate.  But I was disappointed.  For appetizers we ordered chicken dumplings, duck spring rolls, egg rolls, roast pork, spare ribs.  The dumplings weren't bad but everything else was heavy, salty or slathered with sweet sticky barbecue sauce heavily laden with hoisin - like something from a bottle.  The entrees were not much better.  We got the crisply orange chicken (the best dish there in my opinion - although sweet, the chicken was moist on the inside with just the right amount of crunchiness), XO Shrimp - again swimming in a heavy sauce, filet mignon with peppers (I'm told that was good - I did not try it) and another steak dish I do not remember, with mushrooms.  Actually the highlight of the food was the giant fortune cookie.  Not because it is spectacularly good, but because it looks really cool.  And the fortunes in it were fun.  They also put candles in it for my daughter.  It's very pricey - for 6 of us the bill was about 600 dollars, before the tip.  But we did order a lot of food.  Steak dishes here are ~ 35 dollars, and the chicken will run 27-29.  Seafood ranges from 27 - 38.All in all, not a bad celebration place if you want a gorgeous setting and pleasant service.  You can find much better food elsewhere.",2,0,0,Denise J.,"Montpelier, VT",12,101,70

We waited for 2 hours, standing in the lounge. I kept debating about leaving, but for every minute that passed I figured we would be getting close to being seated. And I was starving. The place was packed, we couldn't even get to the bar to have a drink. The lounge was full. The tables were cramped and close together. The hostesses were quite rude. Not to mention it's SO loud that you can't even hold a conversation without having to MIME your words out to the person you wish to speak to.After we finally were seated at the tiniest table known to man, the waiter took forever to even get our drink order.

Honestly, I was not looking forward to this place because I hate Asian fusion.However, service was great and the food delicious.

You should get:- Chilean sea bass skewers (probably the best thing I ate that day)- spicy tuna tartare on crunchy rice- spicy eggplant appetizer- anything seafood in generalYou should avoid:- some beef dish with fries on the side: the beef was requested medium rare but was presented medium. The meat was pretty tough even for a medium. - chicken skewer with peanut sauce appetizer (chicken was tough, sauce too sweet, all in all not memorable)- orange chicken (it was good, but not great, and there are other entrees that are better)This review makes me seem like I love seafood, but I actually don't like seafood in general. I don't even think I mention seafood hardly in any of my other reviews. I just think the seafood options were that good.Desserts were good, but not memorable.

3,4/26/2012,"This place defines paying for the atmosphere. Appetizers were decent but the entrées were below par. I got the orange chicken and it honestly wasn't much better that the same dish from Golden China. I mean it was essentially ten mini deep fried nuggets atop plain white rice. I don't know about you but that's not worth $27 dollars in my book. But I guess you pay the $27 dollars since they had to pay for the 2-story tall Buddha and waterfall urinals. We went for a friend's birthday and overall we had a good experience. The atmosphere is over the top so I guess it makes up for the food expense. The saving grace of this place is that it was a Friday night so Richie Cannata patrolling the dining area on sax. He played on numerous records with Billy Joel and the beach boys. If you're a fan of either of those acts, this man is a legend. He pretty much just improvised to all the house music going on, (i.e. We Found Love), and did a stellar job.  Now whether or not all that made up for the overly expensive feed I'm mot sure. Just know before you go here, you're going to have to wait for 45 minutes after your reservation, (after they made a huge fuss when you made the reservation that you had to show up on time), just to sit and pay for the atmosphere and not the food.  I'm all for paying for the overall experience but when it comes to restaurants, the food has to be a selling point.

The music is very loud and the place is very crowded. And it only gets worse as it evening gets later and later. I had to scream to get my order heard.However, the food and ambiance made it for me. The food was absolutely delicious. The Tuna Roll (which apparently ""can't be missed"") was one of the best pieces of sushi I've ever had. The spring rolls, both the peking duck and the pork ones, were a bit ""eh"", but the Singaporean noodles, the fried rice, and the fish were excellent We also ordered three sides of vegetables, Asian greens, green beans, and shitake mushrooms, all of which were good. Also got the dragon roll and the chef's roll. The dragon roll was superb, the chef's roll was great as well. Soup dumplings were wonderful and served in a bamboo steamer. None of the food was very authentic but it was VERY APPETIZING. And the best part? The portions were HUGE! Had we known the portions were so large we definitely wouldn't have ordered so much! For the price, I'd definitely say it was worth it.The place is very trendy and upscale. Perfect for a group of friends ready to have fun. The place has three levels of seating, all open so it wasn't congested. There is a huge Buddha statue and live musicians.

They do have a big miscommunication there! I guess it is because the music is so loud, that they can't hear each other. We definitely had to over-scream the music and by the end of the dinner our voices were gone. The food is nothing special. The sushi/rolls were not good - too much rice and the fish doesn't really taste fresh. People who were with me ate only half of their main courses. An appetizers were fine, but we didn't order anything that is hard to make. This place is to see and to bee seen, that is I guess why they don't bother too much about the food.

That and the music is the only reason I gave the rating of four stars.  We ordered shrimp tempura and onion tempura for our apps, they were both good, nothing outstanding, but typical tempura. We also had the Spicy Thai soup, which was amazing! If you don't like spicy stay away!  For dinner I ordered the Pad Thai with shrimp and my fiance ordered the Wasabi Steak with greens and jasmine rice. We also shared a spicy tuna roll, which was outstanding!  My Pad Thai was absolutely amazing! Some of the best Pad Thai I have ever had.  The portions were very generous for my dish, as well as my fiance's. We did not have dessert, but I did see quite a few giant fortune cookies come out and they looked really good.  I have to say our server was very patient and kind.  My fiance has a peanut allergy and she was very helpful about finding out what was cooked without peanut oil or sauce.  She described the dishes really well and never rushed us.  She was also very attentive to our needs and brought things right away.  I would definately go back.",1,0,0,Amy M.,"Nutley, NJ",13,13,3

I have had every entree and dessert (on the prix fixe menu) and have loved them all!!! I've also had quite a few desserts from the regular menu. The molten chocolate cake is easily my favorite!

3,1/22/2012,"I've been here twice. And it was 2 totally different experiences. My first time here I wanted to give this place 1 star. I didn't write a review, but I did hold those memories close when I went back. I'll tell you the story about both experiences, because it truly is night and day. My dear friend wanted to go out for his birthday and he chose Tao because he had only heard how awesome it was. We get there, we have a reservation, and our waiter could care less. We were dressed casually, maybe more casual than he was used too. I'm the last to arrive and we are seated and all my friends already have their drinks. I order a beer. It was raining, my hair is fro-ing out, I did not feel like a frilly drink. Our waiter disappears for over 10 min without bringing over my beer. I catch the eye of another waiter and order through him and explain that I've been waiting longer than some people have been seated and served drinks around me. Our waiter had also addressed another table and brought them their drinks (so at this point I'm just pissed). Our waiter comes back, takes our order and has somewhat of an attitude the whole time. Rolling your eyes when I ask you a question about the menu just gets you a lower tip. (Maybe our attire hinted towards a lower tip, but I usually give 20% or more if the service is good, so snap judgements just gets you what you expect.)  After our meal, I got some shrimp dish that left me very unimpressed and could have been hotter (could have gotten something so much better in chinatown), we thought about dessert, but our waiter disappeared again. I asked another waiter where ours went, and quickly asked for the check because I did not feel like wasting another dime on our overpriced meal. Neither did anyone else at my table. I forget when they brought the hot towels to our table, but usually you get a terry cloth towel. This was a regular fabric napkin that happened to be hot. My friend asked what this was and commented on how its usually terry. The waiter rolled his eyes and begrudgingly explained what it was, like we should already know this, and just made us feel like we were below the standards of who he usually waits on. I don't care if we were wearing potato sacks and were talking like a bunch of hill billies, you should never feel like you don't belong if you are paying for a service. It was rude and inexcusable. We left and I told the hostess about our poor service and how rude our server was the entire time.My second experience here was pretty amazing. I went out to celebrate the engagement of a friend. We have reservations and I'm here 10 minutes early. I grab a drink with a friend at the front lounge area. It was good, but I could not remember for the life of me, what it was. Everyone arrives and we are seated upstairs. Our waiter comes over and is extremely nice. He makes his recommendations and is really personable and friendly. Totally different service. Everything comes out in a very timely manner and its just and overall better experience. He makes recommendations throughout the evening and we even got dessert! Everything tasted good and was served hot (and in a timely manner). And we are dressed just as casual. One friend is actually in a sweats! It really seems like it all depends on your waiter here. If you get that waiter I described in the first trip to Tao, do us all a favor, and complain about him to the host. I never wish unemployment on anyone, but that waiter was obviously not happy about his life or his working situation. He should not be in the service industry.",0,1,0,Lizz K.,"San Francisco, CA",77,109,2

3,1/5/2012,"Came here last week on my mom's suggestion. Her xmas gift this year was a day in the city - complete with b'way play and dinner. She had been here before and had nothing but good things to say about it, so we made reservations. It was her day, after all.We arrived before our reservation (which was for 4:15), and I was surprised how crowded the place was at such a weird hour (it was 3:50). I imagine it was due to the fact they have a prix fixe lunch menu that ends at 5:00 (best deal in the place). Fortunately our table was ready and they could seat us early. After my eyes adjusted (boy, I'm getting old), I could properly glance around the room. Decor was typical asian themed, the giant Buddha was a nice touch, but I could do without the club-y lounge-y music.To the menu: no offense, mom, but it was a bit lackluster. Especially the sushi rolls (she had suggested this place because she knew I love sushi). But I guess it's typical Asian fusion on the east coast.. for a price. The server suggested the edamame to start, so sure - why not. It was good. We did the lunch special - I had the lo mein salad, the sesame tuna salad, and the coconut mango dessert. Mom had the bang bang chicken, the kung pao chicken and the ginger fruit dessert. Everything tasted good, but after living in Seattle, I guess I've developed a more discerning palate.Want to give this place a ""3 minus"" rating due to service. After being greeted and sat at our table (all fine), and receiving our waters (also timely), after our server first came by and took our order, it was impossible to find him again. Not once was my water refilled despite me asking (if you see an empty glass, you should fill it up). And our desserts were served without utensils. We tried flagging down numerous staff but to no avail. So eventually my mom got up and found some.

2,12/30/2011,"Disclaimer: I will sound like a food snob and I will be taking full responsibility for it. I lived in Manhattan for 14 years and considered myself a foodie, having a discerning palate. Yes, quite. Mmm hmm. I was never big on Asian fusion though and didn't get a chance to try many restaurants. Then I moved to San Francisco and discovered a whole new world of food. Since a big part of the San Franciscan population is Asian, the cuisine is spectacular and the fusion  perfected. What does this have to do with Tao? Well, I've been completely spoiled and therefore fully disappointed by Tao. I fully bought into the hype and walked away completely confused. Th food is just... not very good. I was expecting to be blown away and instead I was salted away. Everything was overseasoned and slightly overcooked. We had 5 people in our group and they all were completely in love with everything. I was dumbfounded. Then it hit me (SNOB ALERT - you've been warned) - these poor souls have no idea what Asian fusion should taste like.We ordered a few things for the table. The duck rolls were too salty and saucy. The tempura was too doughy. The orange chicken tasted like a Chinese restaurant dish that's 5 times the price. The best thing was my Kobe burger, because it had nothing on it, but its meatiness and my iced tea.Conclusion: Overpriced (dangerously), overhyped, and disappointing. Yes, the decor is nice, which is what you're really paying for, but not nice enough to return or recommend.

Of course they wouldn't seat us as we were not all there even though I told them we would start to order drinks and food, she said our table wasn't ready anyways.

When we had all people there 10 min after our reservation, she gave us our pager and said our table would be ready in 30-45 min.... REALLY!!!! We have a reservation and you are still accepting people at the door and giving them the same freakin' time to wait!!!! Yeah, the hostess with the mostess was NOT and should be fired for that kind of shyt!

You'd expect it to be more amazing than you could possibly imagine. But no, it's just orange chicken, less sketchy than what you'd get at the cheap Chinese takeout place down the block but still just what you'd expect orange chicken to taste like.None of the food blew me away. I went with a few friends and tried the things they ordered. It was really just ""good,"" not great and definitely not amazing. I ordered one of the special sushi rolls and was so disappointed by how bland and chewy it was. I have eaten better special rolls at cheap sushi places in midtown. No one complained about the food, but no one raved about it either. If everything cost half as much, I would have given it 3 stars.There are so many other places you could go in the city where you can get an assortment of mind-blowing entrees for the prices they charge here.

We were both really happy with our drinks. (they include a piece of raw sugar cane in the TAO-hito which I just love) For dinner, we did it family style so that we could taste a few different things on the menu. We had the steamed Chicken Gyoza dumplings with Napa Cabbage and Soy Dipping Sauce, the Pad Thai noodles with shrimp and the Satay of Chilean Sea Bass with Wok Roasted Asparagus. My personal favorite was the sea bass. It was absolutely exquisite. I have never had any fish taste so good. The pad thai was probably the best I have ever had as well. As for dessert, I was looking for something without dairy and to my surprise they did not have much of a selection. The only non-dairy dessert was the mandirin sorbet which I particulary was not in the mood for. So instead, we shared the banana pudding which came with fried banana on top which I enjoyed. All in all, I would have given TAO 5 stars but they fell short on non-dairy dessert options which was a downer for me. Hopefully, in the near future they can fix that.

The dessert was freshly made donuts with dipping sauces that seemed to melt in my mouth.  The waiter was very helpful and prompt so he received a nice well deserved tip.  I liked Tao and will Definitely go back to survey the nightime action.",1,1,0,Klysha R.,"New York, NY",144,250,136
2,8/25/2011,"Went there last night on a date and was completely turned off. Shortly after I sat down I realized that there was gum on my chair, which was now transplanted onto my pants. As the staff watched me attempt to pick it off, the closest thing I received to an apology was ""do you need club soda?"" Call me old fashion, but at the very least I expected a manager to come apologize or, dare I say it, comp a round of drinks off our bill. I guess that was too much to ask. In regards to food, we split the crab cakes, the seafood Thai egg rolls, and the steamed chicken dumplings. Again the service failed us, as the food was brought to the table all at once, WHILE I was still standing up still picking gum off my pants. The only reason this is a 2-star review is that the food wasn't terrible, despite the dumplings being cold by the time I was able to try them. Seeing as this was my first time at this restaurant I'm not sure if the following is standard procedure, but the server required us to sign the check before paying for it. This seemed a little strange to me, especially when the server said that they have had problems with patrons complaining about being over charged on their credit cards and that the policy was put in place in order to prevent this from happening in the future.

4,8/7/2011,"AMAZING dining experience! I'm so glad I had the chance to try Tao in New York instead of Las Vegas. The interior reminded me a lot of Rama in San Diego, with an enormous Buddha statue gracing the main dining room area. The restaurant was built in a huge loft-like space with multi-level seating that could've functioned well as a nightclub (and, in fact, reminded me a lot of the Las Vegas location), yet was still intimate enough for a nice dinner.I don't have anything bad to say about any of the items we ordered, because all were really superb!We ordered the following items:- Pan fried chicken gyoza dumplings- Avocado tempura- Pad thai w/tofu- Chinese broccoli- Banana pudding w/fortune cookie crustAs I said, every single dish was just delectable! Not only was the dining atmosphere enjoyable, but the food was fantastic and definitely worth the price!Save room for dessert. DO NOT MISS the banana pudding.

3,8/6/2011,"One of the premier go-to expensive ""Asian fusion"" theme restaurants in midtown, complete with dim cavern-like lighting, two levels of seating, a lounge and bar area, and the attitude to boot. One of the few restaurants I've encountered on OpenTable that requires a credit card for a LUNCH reservation during the week. And don't even try to ask to be seated at your table unless the entire party has arrived (no matter the current occupancy). Alas, maybe I just need to ""get with the program"" and climb firmly onto TAO's bandwagon. They have a pretty decent fixed price lunch menu for $26.50 (this price is current only as of the date of this posting--the last time I swung through the price had gone up $2 from $24.50--when I half-jokingly asked our waiter why the price hike within a couple weeks, he sort of laughed it off, didn't answer, and kept moving...). I tend to gravitate towards the Kung Pao chicken and seafood dumpling soup, although both are quite greasy (is this a rainbow-hued oil slick coating the surface of the soup?). On the last go-around some of my co-workers ordered what looked like deeply fried egg rolls that none of them could bear to finish. Our office wasn't the same for the rest of the afternoon... If you're not distracted by the (what I hope are) tourists constantly getting their photos taken in front of the Koi pool topped by a monstrously large and out of proportion Buddha statue, the atmosphere can be almost soothing and relaxing. However, if you find yourself needing to use the necessary, it is found down a harrowing (and again dimly lit) flight of stairs tucked away in the back of the dining room. Once you are deposited into the cellar, you are met by three doors. The one straight ahead is unmarked--not even approaching that one. Then, to your right and left are glass doors marked Yin and Yang (with corresponding symbols). If I at one point knew which was the feminine and which the masculine sign, I was now rendered ignorant and immobile. The gentleman who almost crushed me as he also bounded down the narrow staircase behind me was also at a loss. After fumbling around for a while, embarrassed, I finally worked up the nerve to enter the WRONG bathroom and startled both the bathroom attendant and myself as I quickly made my exit. Gladly, the rest of the meal was uneventful and there was a refreshing tropical fruit sorbet dessert to round it out. After paying and heading for the exit, we were forced to cower against the building while our eyes adjusted to the harsh light of day as we emerged from the darkness of our mealtime cavern. At least none of us were hit by a city bus or taxi as we stumbled across the street heading towards what we hoped was a ""Walk"" signal.",3,4,2,Alexander W.,"New York, NY",38,60,8
1,8/1/2011,"A huge mistake to go to Tao. I wish I can give a zero for it. My husband and I ordered peking  duck, it was for two persons and we paid $68 for this dish. I was told it should be a whole duck removing the bones and with pancake. When the dish came, we saw that in the whole plate, there were  only 5-6 tiny pieces of duck meat , two legs and 10 pieces of just roasted skin. There was even some hair still on the skin. It was gross. It was such a small portion, eventually we still felt very hungry and have to eat something else. It was such a joke as we paid $68 for it!Now let's talk about the taste. With such a small portion and high price, I expected for at least delicious taste. Guess what, the taste was not good at all but also  it was not so bad either. Because it almost did not have any flavor, just some dry roasted duck flavor. I have tried peking duck at Shun Lee Palace, the taste was much much better with a bigger portion. I really think that even the peking duck of China Fun has better taste and huge portion with only $20.I will never want to come back to Tao again.  I think they spend too much effort to make the place look cool while not spending enough effort to make their dishes more unforgettable.",0,0,0,zi x.,"Manhattan, NY",3,189,0

3,7/1/2011,"Went here for a birthday dinner couple nights ago. We were a party of ten and they cramped us all in one of those circular tables. Loved the ambiance. It felt as if I wasn't in the city, except the fact that the giant buddha freaked me out a bit. We made it family style and ended up ordering practically half the menu. We started off with some starters and virgin cocktails (they only have 2 drinks avail. virgin and I forgot the name but it basically tasted like fruit punch... The portions of the starters aren't big so you have to order in multiples. We got edamame, crab cakes, spicy tuna tartar on crispy rice, lobster wontons, grilled rare tuna, miso soup. My favorite was the lobster wontons, which also came with some mushrooms and the spicy tuna. We ended up getting another round of the spicy tuna tartar but the second time around the rice on mine wasn't grilled all the way and was falling apart but was good nonetheless. The miso soup was also surprisingly good since it was made with clams and for our entrees we got crispy coconut shrimp, sand pot lobster, peking duck, pork fried rice, vegetable fried rice, hong kong xo shrimp, sea bass with roasted asparagus. Everything tasted good but nothing too special and not worth the price.For dessert we got molten chocolate cake, apply blossoms, fruit trio of oranges, berries, giant fortune cookie, chocolate spring rolls, and assorted ice creams and sorbets, and pudding. It came in this long plate and the best was the sorbets! The fruits were bleh... as if out of a can...and the cake was pretty good. I think I was too full to actually enjoy them all.I only give 3 stars because although the food is pretty good, it's a bit over priced and the waiters try to send you out as fast as they can and it SHOWS. If people are spending a lot of money eating your food, you should at least have the decency to let them take their time. After they took away our food as we waited for dessert, one of the waiters dropped a plate on a cup as they were cleaning and it broke the cup and the glass got scattered. There were pieces of glass all over the table and some on our clothes so we asked them to change all our plates but they probably should have also changed the table top as there were still pieces of glass........sooo dangerous.

I'm a huge Buddha so this place MUST be Asian"") but doesn't unintentionally seem derisive in the process. I guess trendy is the perfect word to describe the vibe, and maybe my lackluster attitude can be attributed to the fact that I'm over trendy and just want a low-key, no frills place where I can get a few drinks, eat some good food, and enjoy time with my friends, husband or family.

I can assure you this was not the case.After getting the manager involved, we were told a table for 4 would be ready for us in 20 additional minutes (40 minutes after arrival).

3,5/4/2011,"I have been meaning to write this review for a bit now, but i knew i would go into detail to better help those who would be wondering about a few things. I went on a Saturday two weeks ago.      To be honest i would give this place a 2 1/2 stars. The only reason i gave it a 3 is because of the decor it is a very pretty place and the serves was good.       Now to get into the good part (or should i say, the more detailed part) The food ehhhhh ehhhhh, overpriced. I have very Strong sense of taste and smell so i am very picky VERY; with that said, i will be honest. The drinks are severed miniature so be prepared. My favorite dish was the appetizer which was the dumplings and we also had some sushi dish it was salmon and avocado and i think fried onions.  The dumplings omg wow wow wow i wanted more yummy. The sushi i didn't have any but the whole table loved it esp. my best friend she is a die hard sushi fan.      The entree: well i had the roasted Thai Buddha chicken, blah it hardly had any flavor... i could go on about how it was so plain. Moving on my brother had the filet Mignon (it is not accompanied by anything else so watch out) he ordered a side dish of potatoes which you have to pay extra for. I snacked on some of the potatoes, hehehehe what? it was my birthday! the potatoes were not good or bad just plain no taste no magic. Can i say his meal was good or bad? no, but knowing the critter (my brother) he was quiet while eating and he is the type that would make it known the food is good while eating.       My cousin had a salmon dish, I'm not sure which one, but that was good that was the best dish out of all of ours. My best friend ordered the TAO lo mein with pork, again OK but not good nor great. I have to say if i were to base this review on the food it would get a 2 because it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. I've had better from places that served more and from places that were less expensive. The serves; i give that a 4. The decor wow, that gets a 5 it is so nice to look at. We all had our glasses of wine except for my best friend (she was still recovering from the night we had before) my cousin had pinot grigio, my brother pinot noir, I.... yes me, I.... had the cabernet sauvignon Ahhhh what would i do without you in my life? oh, my dear cab.

3,5/3/2011,I went here with a group of people for my friend's birthday. I hear a lot about this place so I was very excited to be going. The ambiance was lovely and the decor was beautiful. We were sat in front of a huge buddah statue. It was pretty crowded on the Saturday night that I was there but my party got our food extremely fast to my surprise. The food was not up to par for the price. I paid $38 for a sirloin steak and there was only about 7 small strips of cut up steak on top of shiitake mushrooms drowned in teriyake sauce. The steak wasn't that bad. Normally I like steak sauce on my steak instead of teriyake sauce but I was told this restaurant did not have any. The potatoes my meal came with were terribly seasoned. I had to order white rice separately and that was an extra $5. I must say the white rice was the best part of my meal. Did I mention the overpriced watered down drinks that came in tiny cups with ice filled to the top? This place is nice if you want to go out with friends and have fun but if you're hungry and want good food and to be full when you leave I suggest going elsewhere.

Even though I work only blocks away I managed to still show up a few minutes late. They had reservations for 9 but we didn't get seated until about 9:30, just for being 5 minutes late? This place is unnecessarily crowded and I can't say that I care for much of crowd. Definitely not my type of people but we'll run with it. We were given a table upstairs, right by the bar, with the music way too loud. With the music, the translations from portuguese and the broken english, conversation was tough. The men and I were the only ones drinking (surprise?) and they knew how to pick their wine! I'm not sure what the exact wine was that we ordered but it was a cab sauv and delicious! We started with shrimp tempura and crab cakes - tempura was great, the sauce especially had a nice zing to it! The crab cake balls were alright, I liked the sauce it came in much more! I ordered the salmon with udon noodles. The salmon was slightly overcooked so that made it a bit tough to get through. The noodles on the other hand were great. The flavor of the sauce with the spinach and the thick noodle worked amazingly well, except it got a bit too oily by the end. But overall not bad.The rest of the women all ordered a shrimp dish that looked pretty great and got good reviews - I tried some of the green beans and they were delicious. The men both ordered the steak and I was a bit anxious to get their feedback on it - given that they get amazing meat any day of the week back home in Brasil - but they both cleaned their plates so I'm guessing it was still good.  So overall, everybody was happy with the food and the drinks but I still think it's way overpriced for what you get.

The food was...there's a Chinese word for it which literally means thick but is meant to convey a lack of refinement and that's what I kept thinking when the dishes kept coming out.  I got the Crispy Tuna Sashimi which was this thick-skinned deep fried spring roll with tuna in the middle; the Wasabi Encrusted Filet Mignon was also heavily encrusted and came with 3 thick, undercooked onion rings with some wilted greens that were supposed to look modern but ended up looking sad; and dessert was fried banana bread pudding which had that same puffy, undercooked batter.  Other things at the table were potstickers (?) that looked undercooked, a couple sushi rolls that were anemic and doused in sauce, and a few different desserts.  I think my favorite dish of the night was the fruit with sorbet.  So I may not have gotten the ""usual"" food experience since it was Restaurant Week but regardless, they should care about the food they put out all of the time and we ordered non-RW items and they were equally unimpressive.  I do have to give them credit for putting together a good looking restaurant but without the food, what's the point?  I could go to a club if all I wanted was drinks and ambiance.",0,0,0,Margaret T.,"Brooklyn, NY",530,358,80

The chicken was overcooked/dry, the chilean seabass texturally was good, the flavor profile was lacking...or rather over done?I did enjoy the kobe sashimi though.Perhaps it was just that we came with a party of 17, (which I'm grateful that they accomodated us on such short notice) but I really wish they would refine their sauces and food quality.On the Pros side:Staff is really accomodating and the place looks amazing.

1,4/1/2011,Tao what has happened to you!  I wish I could give you no stars!  All of the dishes I so raved about in my first review have now become inedible.  The kobe beef dishes were actually so disguisting we had to send one back.  I honestly believe that they are no longer using true Kobe Beef but actually using a cheap replacement.  There is no way that the same beef is being used as in previous years.  The food was so putrid my boyfriend and I left starving!  Nothing upsets me more then seeing anyone waste money on terrible food!  We will NEVER set foot in here again.  Thank you Tao for ruining a 6 year anniversary tradition.  You should be embarrassed.,1,0,1,nicole g.,"Staten Island, NY",160,62,0

2,3/30/2011,"When they said Tao was Asian fusion, they probably meant 'non-Asian people who can cook but don't know Asian cuisine's interpretation of Asian flavors'. Saying that this place is HIGHLY overrated is an understatement. They get two stars for accommodating our initial 2 tables of eight into a single 17 person table. But the food was ridiculously salty. Heavy heavy heavy on the sodium and sauces. More water please! The duck spring roll had a nice crunch and I love hoisin sauce but it was mostly all I tasted. The sashimi kobe beef was okay but definitely not worth $26! Kobe tartare tempura was salty. For dinner, the Miso Chilean Sea bass was nothing special. The New York Sirloin was drenched in sauce. Thai chicken was dry. The best dinner was the filet shabu shabu cause you get to cook it yourself in the broth. The giant fortune cookie was amusing. You actually get two fortunes with it. More for show than taste though. I still cant wrap my head around why the restaurant is so crowded for such terribly mediocre food.

And, depending on where you place PF Chang's on your list of culinary indulgences, that may be a fine thing. In which case, feel free to spend your hard-earned  money (a lot of it) at Tao. But for the rest of us without unlimited excess cash to spend on mediocre food, I wouldn't waste your time, money, or calories. Tao is basically the closest a restaurant can be to a club. The food isn't bad but rarely inspired or good, the space and people are beautiful, and the prices are wallet-gouging. To be fair, we ordered the cheaper dishes on the menu, so I have not had the luxury of sampling their kobe ribeye or their take on the peking duck.

BORING!Nothing on the menu peaked my interest - I ended up getting the Rock Shrimp special with Truffle aioli - bland and forgettable.Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumpling with Crunchy Cucumbers - why did I like eating the Crunchy Cucumbers more than the dumpling themselves? The dipping sauce for this didn't help with the flavour of the dumplings.Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno and Ponzu Sauce - this was a joke and not even spicy.D actually wanted their Zen Parfait and wasn't aware that was only for Lunch time.

4,3/1/2011,"Weeeellll....What can I say about Tao? I like this place for many reasons... To start - I like trendy places and Tao is one of them... Décor is nice, music is good, people look good, and food is good.The only downside I found is that the bar/lounge/waiting area is too tiny and when it gets packed (which is every night) people are literally on top of each other and I like my space when I have a nice martini or two... That's why I don't usually go there just to hang out by the bar and make sure I get a table. But if you like to snack at the bar, they have full menu there as well. As it comes to food, even though I tried many things there before, I pretty much order the same things when I go there because they are really good:To start I usually get couple of sushi rolls (spicy tuna roll is a must) but most of their special rolls are good and different.I also like to get Dumplings (Have tried them all and all are good) and Hot Edamame of course.My two favorite main dishes (From The Land) are: -Kobe Beef Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth with Wasabi Dipping Sauce: I love it because it's delicious and because its fun to eat. They bring a big boiling hot bowl and you cook it yourself - it's a fun dish. -I love their Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon with Tempura of Onion Rings. I think it's a great twist on Filet Mignon. Wasabi gives it just enough bite and makes it delicious. My favorite sides are: Pad Thai Noodles with Chicken; Any type of Fried Rice you choose is fine.Dessert: I have had few desserts there but two that I can remember is Giant Fortune Cookie which IS giant and fun to share for the table and Mochi Tasting (I am sucker for mochi and always get it when I see it). If you don't know what mochi is - it is different types of ice cream in dough. Try it - you might like it. Hope this helps.",4,0,1,Irina M.,"New York, NY",30,21,117

That was annoying enough to keep me away int he future, but when I called the next afternoon about my card they told me three times that my card was not there.

There is no room to even adjust your seat while sitting at your table because they are all positioned so closely to each other. The drinks were super sweet & mostly syrup. The bar tab quickly adds up. Best part of all they are rude when you call to dispute any charges. Our lovely waiter took the liberty of adding an additional $133 dollars to my card.

From the service to the food I just wasn't impressed. Neither my husband or I were impressed with our food and we have had much better at PF Chang's or Pei Wei so for the price it wasn't worth it. The kicker was when I went to the coat check and they had lost my scarf, hat and gloves. The college girls working the area didn't seem very concerned with this and kept questioning if I ever gave them to her. They wanted me to call back in the morning and see if they were found later. I didn't have plans to be back in the area the next day so I insisted they continue to search. They finally found my bag of items and didn't even give an apology for the issue.

The Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with vegetables is a strong standout as well.My friends went crazy over the Orange Chicken - which I thought was decent, but not as much of a star as the Filet and the Sea Bass.  Sugar Dusted Doughnuts are a great dessert option, and come in a cute Chinese takeout box.  If you're looking for an over-the-top dining experience with a large group that's willing to spend $$ (Special Occasion Group?

The staff (hostess, coat check girl, our waiter, and the bus boys) was friendly and the food was yummy. Kobe beef tartare roll was amazing! The beef melted in my mouth, while the rice was lightly tempura'd. The Peking duck rolls were nice and savory, though I feel like they could've  been less salty. The Dragon Tail Spare ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender with just the right amount of the char siu marinade - that was probably my favorite dish of the night. The peking duck for 2 was a bit of a disappointment. While the skin was nice and crisp and the meat was tender, it was all very one note.  I think it would've been more of a success as an appetizer for four, rather than an entree for two.

This restaurant is definitely trendy and has been for years. Like others have stated, you are paying for the ambiance. The Buddha is amazing as well as the lighting and configuration of the place. While I only ate here once, I found the service to be pretty good but the music was too loud and the food was definitely overpriced. I am willing to pay top notch for a great meal but it has to be great and accompanied by great service and ambiance. Like others, we waited over an hour to get our reserved table. Two drinks at the bar came to nearly 40.00 with tip (should give an idea of the prices). Our dinners were really good. We started with appetizers had a main and then desert. All said and done the bill came to about 200.00. Would I go there again? Probably not. Why?

3,12/24/2010,"The restaurant is a trendy place on 58th ave with a huge buddha displayed as the centerpiece. It specializes in asian fusion so you'll see a lot of familiar dishes like Pad Thai, Peking Duck, Fried Dumplings, etc etc. But the quality is a whole notch higher because of the ingredients used, the way it's displayed, and... because it's Tao. We ordered 4 dishes: Mandarin Sizzled fried rice with Peking Duck, Wok Seared New York Sirloin with Shiitake Mushrooms and Szechuan Potatoes, Roasted Thai Buddha Chicken, and Teppanyaki Swordfish with Ponzu Butter and Asparagus Tempura. (Actually 5 dishes including the 8 dollar edamame beans that we were conned into thinking was a complimentary dish). I would say my favorite was the Roasted Thai Buddha Chicken. The meat was soft and the sauce it came it was so delicious! The fried rice was just fried rice. Sirloin was too tough and chewy for me. I don't really eat anything beyond medium rare. The swordfish wasn't moist enough, so I almost choked. I really liked the sea salt on the edamame beans though? Anyways, dessert was a great finish. We got Tao's famous Giant Fortune Cookie. Served with fresh fruit and drizzled chocolate, this big fortune is half filled with chocolate mousse and the other half with white chocolate mousse, and not to forget 4 big fortunes written out on long scraps of paper! We also got banana pudding, which was not as good but it wasn't disappointing. It had fried bananas on top of fortune cookie crusted banana pudding. It's a dashing place to go to for the mood, the crowd (some celebs), and the aesthetics, some dishes, and definitely dessert.

If you must have Kobe beef then just get the sashimi appetizer if anything. The Shabu Shabu Kobe sirloin was nice to try (you simmer it at your table) but there are far better things on the menu, especially for a better value. Other establishments have much better Kobe. The sushi is of fine quality but the sushi menu could be more extensive. I would get the Omakase (chef's choice sushi platter) to be sure you do not leave the place hungry. For the main meal, I also really enjoyed the grilled rare Yellowfin tuna, lacquered pork, and the salmon special was decent but again I was not a big fan of the sauce this was in. Be a family: share the meal with your company and enjoy the many diverse tastes this place offers! The beer menu is typical for Asian fusion (not extensive) and I would recommend the Mohito or Blue Zen over the Saketini which I found to be gross.

We had reservations for 10:30pm on a Thursday and we arrived a few minutes late (which is a big deal in NY since you need a reservation for pretty much everything). However, they were nice enough to accommodate us. It was pretty packed to L.A. standards but for NY apparently it was not. We waited at the bar for about 30 minutes and enjoyed a cocktail while we waited. The decor was pretty much the same as the Tao in Vegas. The bar/lobby is located just before the actual restaurant, but once you are seated, it is pretty roomy and perfect for large parties. Even though it is packed and kind of loud, oddly it is still intimate. The lighting is perfectly dim and there is music in the background. We ordered a few appetizers, which were delicious! I ordered the sea bass for my entree and it was absolutely delectable. It was melt-in-your-mouth buttery and soft. I cant remember the desert but at the end of the meal, we were all smiles. It is a little pricey but so worth it for great food and ambiance. It was four of us and the total for 3 appetizers, 4 main entrees, two desserts and 4 cocktails was around $400. Right across from Tao is Lavo, which is also a restaurant/club. We walked right on over there to burn off the calories dancing. Reviews for Lavo will be posted shortly.

I have never tasted food like this. The orange chicken, the ribs, the rice, the lo mein - all of it was to die for. Really. For dessert, we had a sampler platter of sorts, which was awesome. We had dessert wine, coffee with baileys, hot chocolate and cappuccinos- which quality and taste surpassed any that I've ever had.To top it all off, we saw Adam Lambert there and actually got a picture with him!

I'm not sure where to begin, but after eating there I was left with the distinct impression it's a highly refined scam, everything is designed to separate tourists from their money. The only good thing going for it is that it looks very new york. Huge statue, brick walls, multi levels, cool lighting, obnoxious house music playing all the time, so new york right? ""Like, oh my god, right from sex and the city! We don't have anything like this in Tulsa!""Everything is about 3x the price it should be. I tried a few drinks and they're all sickly sweet with no finesse at all. The appetizers are awful: the pork dumplings taste like scallion, you can't taste any lobster in the lobster dumplings, the crab cakes are dry and bready, and the onion rings come with literally TWO rings. TWO. What the fuck. I ordered the ""sand pot lobster, shrimp and scallops in black bean sauce' for $34, trying to get something for my money. What I got was a bowl of dry white rice and a big bowl of chopped lobster covered in black bean sauce. No scallops, no shrimp. I couldn't get half the lobster meat out because they decided to coat it in slippery black bean sauce. There wasn't any sauce to put on the rice so I had alternating bites of dry white rice and steamed lobster. Also, the black bean sauce is mostly on the shell, so it was really just un-buttered overcooked lobster. Saddest way to spend $34 at a fancy restaurant. The most bizarre thing about it is that everyone seems so content. All I can imagine them thinking is ""We're in new york, of course everything is expensive! Look how big that statue is!

It was packed on a Tuesday night, full of 30 somethings just getting off of work, 40 something cougars, 50 something old dudes looking for a cougar...you know the drill.Nice enough bar area but when it's so packed with people waiting for their incredibly late (and probably reserved) table, it can get a bit annoying.Now, on to the GOOD. The part that made me give 3.75 (4 by decimal hating Yelp) shiny stars.The inner dining area is really cute, nice atmosphere with a giant buddha welcoming you.My colleague ordered for the table since she was an experienced taoist (as in the food, not the philosophy)... ROASTED SHISHETO PEPPERS- a little appetizer that is not nearly as spicy as they look...but TOTALLY delicious.SATAY of Chilean Sea Bass with wok roasted asparagus- This was a highlight for me. I mean...fish.... ON A STICK. Genius. And totally yummy. Highly recommend this cute little nummy.LOBSTER WONTONS with shiitake ginger broth- these were pretty tasty, but I felt they paled in comparison to my Satay and shishetos!SUSHI- we had a few rolls which I thought were pretty tasty, but not out of this world. I forgot to ask the name, so you are kinda on your own on this one. But, I would say that they were tasty and worth trying.DESSERT!- banana pudding was awesome. rice pudding was good, but the ginger ice cream on it was really tasty.All in all, with about 2 drinks per person, we spent around 350... so, it's not the cheapest meal in NY, but I definitely wasn't feeling ripped off.Try it out, it's worth it.",1,2,1,Jaymi W.,"San Fernando, CA",422,207,115

It does get very crowded and you do have to wait a bit even if you have a reservation, but they have a great loungy bar section while you wait.  The waitstaff was great and everyone loved their food. They didn't skimp on portions and I was very pleasantly full by the end of the meal and knew I had gotten my money's worth. I had the temple salad which was tasty. I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass which was the best fish I had ever had. It literally melted in my mouth. I would highly suggest ordering this for an entree. For dessert, I got the chocolate spring rolls which were a bit too hot and too rich for my liking but it didn't stop me from eating them!  Overall, a great place.  FYI, if you're a vegetarian, don't get the pad thai-they use shrimp in it which they conveniently don't tell you until you ask about it.",0,0,0,Anjela D.,"Great Neck, NY",4,39,0

The fish is some of the freshest I've had, outside of Japan. The SEA BASS is worth dying for. The desserts are also excellent. I've been 3 times and will undoubtedly return.

After having been to the one in Las Vegas in The Venetian I had to check it out. It had a totally different feel to it then the Las Vegas one. This one had a much larger open space encompassing it and the huge Buddha is pretty cool too. Food was great, drinks were great. Just being able to people watch in the wide open space was pretty cool. There is an upstairs and a downstairs and a private party above the second floor. I had a few of the special sushi rolls and my other half had some sort of steak with mushrooms that was off the wall good! Everything was great about this place except if you drive into the city you are paying about $30-$50 to park near this restaurant. It was something worth checking out but nothing I would crave again and again. Overall, I would recommend trying this place out.

The atmosphere was cool, though very similar to Buddhakhan or Ajna.  The giant Buddha in the back was pretty cool.  The food is decent.  I would avoid any of the fried rice dishes (or for that matter, any dish you can get in a Chinese restaurant cuz it really doesn't taste any better, they just charge you 3x more).  However, some of the Asian fusion dished were very good ( wasabi crusted filet mignon, XO shrimp with long beans, banana bread pudding).  The only thing I wished this place had was a dance floor because the DJ spins some pretty good trance music.  4 stars for the cool scene as much as the decent food.  And remember to dress up before you go.",1,0,0,David T.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,12,5

The exception being that it's Asian food and no cheesecake but the same premise that it's a huge restaurant and they heard you in like cattle.  I don't like that as it makes me feel uncomfortable with there being hundreds of people crammed in a dining room.  At the same time being in the business I have respect that the place was packed so they are making $$$, which means they are doing something right.  There prices are pretty fair for an east side restaurant which helps pack the place especially their restaurant week deal which was pretty damn good $35 for small plate, entree and dessert.  I was part of a table of eight, there was a table of 20 behind us and another table of 14 to the side amongst a bunch of tables of 4 -6 people.  So I wondered how could service be good but it surprisingly was on point.  I was impressed by this.  Food was ok...i've def had better Asian cuisine but my friends enjoyed the food.  Respectable cocktail and wine prices.  Ambiance was ok...like i said before a big place that overwhelms , I think Buddakhan and Buddha Bar have a nicer design with the same concept.  Music was house with too much beat, between the noise of all the people all I heard was thumping bass, a little annoying.I would like to go back when it's not restaurant week to get a different perspective...but 8 of us ate and drank for $600 including a gratuity, which I think was pretty damn good.  Will check it out again and am curious about the ginormous fortune cookie that I saw come out even though it looks gimmicky.",0,0,0,Jesse S.,"Cranford, NJ",14,5,0

You have friends that are willing to peruse the exhausting list of restaurants for you. Ended up at Tao with a group of six not really knowing what to expect. While we missed our real reservation, eventually we did get seated upstairs and from there the food came flying out. We got handed a regular menu and prix fix menu.

4,6/29/2010,"Went here on a Sunday night so getting reservations weren't difficult.  We had a group of 6 of us and waited at the bar for about 30 minutes.  While at the bar, I ordered a Mai Tai which was kind of weak.  Something was missing and it could have been much better.  The waiting area was nice and swanky but it was fairly empty there.   When we were sat down, we ordered a round of drinks and 2 orders of squab wraps. They were amazing, the sauce that came along with it made it.  One of my friends ate about 4 wraps alone.  The waitress was quick, nice, and efficient.We decided on eating family-style so we ordered 5 dishes and shared them.Spicy Tuna Tartare-This was a pretty good dish, not the table's favorite but I liked it.  It could have been colder, seem liked it sat out for a while but was still good.  However, the crispy rice that it was served on had weird texture and kind of took away from it.Pad Thai- This was pretty good, perfectly cooked noodles and nice texture.  The chicken was of good quality and it was an overall decent dish.  The sauce was a little sweet and wasn't the most authentic but this was one of the table's favorites.Crispy Coconut Shrimp with Spicy Peanut Sauce(my order)- This dish came with 6 jumbo almost prawn shrimp which was perfect for our table.  These had a tremendous amount of flavor and the peanut sauce and slaw that came with it was awesome.  Overall, nice-texture and very fresh shrimp.  This plate made me reconsider ordering family-style since I wanted to eat all 6 myself.  Everyone liked this dish as well.  Sand Pot Shrimp, Lobster, and Scallops with Black Bean Sauce- a little pricey($39) but very good as well.  Almost had too many veggies and not enough seafood.  The sauce was very good but I've had black bean sauces from local Chinese restaurants that was just as good and a whole lot cheaper.  Though I loved this dish, it didn't seem like a table favorite.  Again, fresh shrimp(didn't get to taste the scallops and lobster)and an overall good quality dish.  Overpriced in my opinion but good.Kung Pao Chicken- This was a good dish as well, nothing special but a very solid, good-quality dish.  Not much better from a local fast-food joint but the sauce was surprisingly light and tasty.  It didn't taste a an MSG laden dish like most restaurants but this isn't a dish I'd order in an upscale place like Tao.  The dish really didn't add a gourmet spin on Kung Pao Chicken or didn't  ""upscale""(verb) it.Funny Tidbit, the part of the menu with poultry  says ""from the sky"".  Hmm, I didn't know that chickens were from the sky.  Got a laugh out of that.  We didn't have any room for dessert unfortunately.  Overall, good restaurant albeit a little pricey.  You pay for the name and atmosphere.  The service was very good and the crowd was pretty chill.  We actually got out of there spending $48 each including tip so not bad for an ""upscale"" meal and drinks.  It didn't blow me away but was slightly above-average.  This isn't anywhere I'll go regularly, maybe on special occasion.  It's like an expensive PF Changs.  I liked the food better at this one but obviously the atmosphere at the Vegas one.  The food did taste a little different at each location.  I'll definitely take my wife here who couldn't make it this time; this would be a great place to start off the night on a party or birthday night.",2,1,0,Roy L.,"New York, NY",125,250,0

4,6/25/2010,"I read somewhere that a prix fixe is a value meal in a rented tux. Nonetheless, I love a prix fixe lunch. It curbs indecisiveness and offers an easy way to know exactly how much you will spend without the need to calculate (who really likes math anyways!?!?! hehe). My friend wanted to come here during one of our quarterly shopping trips to NYC and when I saw they had a prix fixe I was on board. I started with the Peking duck spring rolls which were not even remotely reminiscent of Peking duck but were pretty tasty all the same. The Shanghai scallion beef left a little to be desired but was edible although not too different from many take-out Chinese dishes in terms of the taste. The Zen parfait was phenomenal though; I definitely would get it again and this is coming from a guy who is serious about his desserts! My friend decided to forgo the prix fixe and got the Kobe burger instead. Truthfully I was more delighted by his entree than my own as the burger was delicious; luckily we always share! HAHA. I would rate this as 3.5 stars based on the food but our waitress was great and the place has a cool atmosphere (we were seated right next to the koi pond which was full of beautiful, and HUGE, koi).

They do try to make dishes with unusual names and if you're adventurous, you'll pick the ones that are actually good. Portions are at least filling.Bang bang chicken salad wasn't bad. The Shanghai beef was a bit too sweet. The peking duck egg rolls were an interesting dish, but the inside felt a bit mushy in texture, not the stringy duck I'd expected. The miso salmon sauce was good, but a little too oily and the salmon was a bit dry. The chicken pad thai was good, but too sweet.

For example, sweet-n-spicy Chinese bbq chicken in a flour tortilla wrapped with a light ranch salad with crispy noodles. See how this is fusion? Because ranch flavor does not occur naturally in Chinese cooking. Get it? For all my complaining about the audacity of their decor and menu, Tao still gets two stars because the food was actually very good, very well made, the service was excellent, and the overall experience was enjoyable.",1,0,0,Sue Y.,"Foster City, CA",52,304,198

The staff is efficient enough and the decor is a little cheesy, but fun overall and won't interfere with the amazing food.

4,2/28/2010,"I'm surprised by many negative reviews here by the fellow yelpers. Ok, the food is not amazing, but I think the overall ambiance is pretty nice. The cocktails are pretty good also. Tonight was about my 5th visit to Tao though I'd have to admit I wouldn't go there nearly as often if I didn't live in the same neighborhood. This is a good place for a group business dinner or to bring an out-of-the-country guest to show a typical mass Asian fusion restaurant. I have to say I do like the ambiance - the brick walls, high ceilings, it's airy and not too loud. Tonight the 3 of us shared cod satay with asparagus (yummy), chicken satay (stay away), crispy tuna (ok), crab cake (yummy), pot stickers (can do without), shrimp and lobster spring roll (yummy), duck fried rice (fine), and fillet mignon (yummy). Overall the food was good, but this was a bit too much for the 3 of us. Also I found each dish was quite salty, so it's not for folks who are on a low sodium diet. For desert we had mango rice pudding which was way too sweet. I had a giant fortune cookie with moose before which was better. For cocktails I had peach cosmo and another grapefruit cocktail, both of which were good.  But with the food they serve, wine would go much better than sweet cocktails.This place continues to be a scene and you may need a bit of patience particularly when you deal with the arrogant maitre d.

1,2/19/2010,"My one-star rating of Tao is based on the service that my coworkers and I received there last night - service that was bad enough to ruin our entire dining experience and completely overshadowed the good food that we were unable to enjoy.We were sure to arrive on time for our reservation so they wouldn't give our table to someone else, but two members of our party were yet to arrive.  The hostess told us to have a seat in the lounge because she couldn't seat us until everyone arrived.  The rest of our party arrived about five minutes later, and we proceeded to wait for our table for about another half an hour.  When I finally approached the hostess to check up on the status of our table, she very rudely told me that we should have come and gotten her when the rest of our party arrived (i.e. we should have done her job for her).  She told me that she had booked another reservation for our table at 7:30, so we would have to be sure to be finished by then....Are you serious?...  I have worked in several restaurants - as a hostess, waitress, and bartender - so I've been behind the scenes and can say with total confidence that THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.  Sure, you might put a reservation at a certain table ahead of time, but if the previous customers at that table aren't finished with their meal by the time the next reservation rolls around, you find a different table to seat the next reservation at.  It is BEYOND tacky to put your customers' table on a timer, ESPECIALLY for a restaurant of the price point and supposed quality of Tao.  After ordering a couple rounds of drinks and appetizers, we placed an order for our entrees.  A few minutes later, the hostess actually had the nerve to come over to our table and started attacking me about how ""we had made a deal"" that we'd be finished by 7:30 and how now she'd either have to: a) cancel our entree orders, b) tell the kitchen to rush-order our entrees and she'd ""give"" us 15 minutes to finish, otherwise c) she would have to relocate us, mid-dinner, to the crowded lounge area where we would be allowed to finish our meal.  Our response to all three options was 'no', so they continued to hover over us, urging us to hurry up and finish, then neglected to offer dessert and preemptively brought us the several hundred dollar bill.  Classy.All I have to say about my dining experience at Tao is ew, ew, and EW.  I don't care how elite and important your restaurant thinks it is - your paying customers are the reason that the employees have a paycheck and the reason the restaurant continues to exist.  It is the restaurant's job to accommodate their customers, because that is what their customers are paying for.  Tao's ignorant, shallow method of maintaining an elite image - being rude and unaccommodating to their customers - proves that they are entirely unworthy of a classy and elite clientele.  New York City has plenty of other lounges and restaurants to choose from that ALSO offer customer service, so do yourself a favor and go to one of those instead.  I won't be back.",6,0,0,Meredith R.,"New York, NY",378,86,3

4,2/17/2010,"Tao actually deserves 3.5 but I'm rounding up because I generally had a pretty pleasant dinner experience here, no fuss, no pretention, no ""wtf did they just serve me"" moments.Service is friendly enough but not very attentive which is fine by me, the menu needs very little explaining. The hostesses at the front are in lala land, they look like they'd rather be elsewhere. The servers look bored but are nice, the busboys are probably the only staff members that look like they enjoy what they do. Food is served in generous portions, good for sharing..very flavorful..maybe a bit toooo flavorful? Not good for those on a low sodium diet. (Had the orange chicken and filet mignon with udon). Not presented in any special creative way but food's not art here, it's just food but it does look yummy.Decor: Beautiful. The huge statue in the back of Tao is the main centerpiece, the interior is exposed brick, and there is this big unrolled scroll ornament hanging from the ceiling. Nice touches everywhere. Price: Not that Asian food isn't worth it..I mean it's one of the most delicious group of cuisines ever..but knowing how much orange chicken costs at a take out joint or even at a family Chinese restaurant, I just don't feel like the price tag is worth it.I'm sad I couldn't enjoy Tao during its hey day...it's since become a major tourist attraction and most of the patrons looked like they were families from the 'burbs of NYC. Honestly, why would a kid want to eat at Tao? They'd be happier running around at Chuckey Cheese or Dave&Busters. Despite the chic and sexy decor, the ambiance doesn't quite match the decor.

4,2/7/2010,"Great fun! This place is rather like a nightclub with food - really great food. Seating - this is a vast restaurant across two floors. The tables are large and very well spaced out.Service - I've been here many times and rate their service very highly. The bartenders are very nice. On two occasions the bartender followed us to our table with a round of shots. Presumably because we left a good tip - nice that it's appreciated all the same. The waiters never seem over stretched which surprises me as Tao is always packed. They take time to explain the menu and are patient when asked to repeat things. This happens a lot as the music volume is club-like.Drinks - they have full bars on both levels. I love their cocktails. The Taohito is my favourite. Be prepared to drink a lot as you'll likely wait at least an hour for a table - even with a reservation.Food - it amazes me that the food here is so consistently good. I expected that in return for the night clubby vibe and the fact that most people are drunk, the standard of the food would suffer. Quite the opposite. My boyfriend loves he satay skewered chicken. My favourites are the Spring Rolls and the XO Shrimp with String Beans. The portions are huge. Unless I'm ravenous I find that two appetisers is plenty.Toilets - The toilets are situated way at the back of the ground floor, down a couple of flights of stairs. If you are seated on the first floor this can turn out to be quite a trek. They are kept very clean by the attendant.TipIf you are hungry and want to avoid the wait I'd recommend not bothering with a reservation and eating at the bar upstairs. I've only ever wait 10 mins max for a seat bar and they serve up the full menu. You have a great view of the entire restaurant from this bar so it's good for people watching.On one occasion our wait exceeded 2 hours in spite of our reservation.

3,2/6/2010,"I went to Tao for restaurant week with my girlfriend and got the  3 course prix-fixe dinner. Generally speaking, I'm somewhat skeptical about fusion restaurants because they bring a lot of good dishes but don't really offer a harmonious meal. Looking back, Tao was certainly no exception to this rule.In regards to the restaurant week menu, I would recommend the Crispy Tuna Rolls as well as the Sea Bass. Also, I would recommend staying away from the Tao Salad, which is literally a bunch of field greens drenched in dressing. One last piece of advice would be to avoid the Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon, which again isn't particularly special in any way (the wasabi crumbles off to leave behind a flavorless filet). The one pleasant surprise of the evening was the desert. I got the Banana Bread Pudding, which is somehow both delightfully light and creamy. As for my girlfriend, she got the Chocolate Spring Rolls, which are complemented with a tangy orange sauce. Both dishes were absolutely delicious. Other facts - the restaurant is certainly beautiful and the atmosphere is great. The only drawback is that couples are packed close to each other on a series of small tables on the top floor - it makes for somewhat of an uncomfortable dinner, especially if the neighboring party is noisy. If you can, try to specify that you'd like a large table when you're making your reservation or simply book a table for 3 people.",4,0,0,Berk U.,"Cambridge, MA",38,76,19

In fact, I avoid people that describe places like that, too. Reality is a neat place.Anyway - we walk in and were greeted by 4 hostesses, each one given a specific task.  Like, the one that says ""hello"" can't actually check for your reservation.  And the one that checks the reservation can't actually tell you where to sit, that's Deanna's job. On our way to our table we brushed by power happy hourers in stillettos, tight ""bone me on the desk"" dresses, and powder blue merger ties.  Everyone looked around to see if everyone else could tell how important they were.  The tables were about the same.  But you know what, it doesn't matter who is around you, it's the company you keep, and I had the best company.  Our seat was great, I could see the big buddha perfectly.What I couldn't see was the menu.  Now, I know at 33 I'm getting pretty old, but if the lighting is so ... well.. dark that I can't even see the printed word, that's just not good.  I had to have Frank read the Prix fixe, which was a lucrative deal.  But we wanted tempura avocados so we skipped it.Tempura avocados and asparagus were GREAT.  Light crispy coating, none of that turtle shell thickness that, when chewed, creates a coating on your tongue that you have to slough off with a spoon.  I also had the kobe beef sashimi because my victimized soul wanted some raw red meat.  The serving was a ""small plate"" that cost 28 bucks.  I wouldn't say it was totally worth it, but it was deeeelish.Edamame was good.  The Pad Thai was excellent.  They were right on point with it, and I've had some crap pad thai lately.  It's freaking good.  Our waitress was fantastic if not a little cheesy, but in our jeans and warm weather gear (and lack of power ties and rubber ta tas) we probably appeared to her like Minnesota tourists looking for the Sex and The City experience.I docked some stars because of the self important turd crowd and for my #1 pet peeve (which adds to the self important delusions) - FORCED BATHROOM ATTENDANT.   COME ON.  I know how to turn on a faucet, I know where the soap is.  I know how to grab a paper towel myself and I know where to put it.  I also know that you turned the faucet on as I emerged from the single stall to make it awkward for me to go to the other sink.  You also smuggled all the paper towels to a location under your arm so that I would have to reach past your outstretched hand to get one myself.  Truly truly ridiculous.As we walked out, I had to move aside for two suited galoots, not the other way around, and one woman in head to toe sequins and a full length fur.  And Frank said, and I'd like to conclude with this, ""look at all these people thinking they're so important.  It's a glorified PF Changs!""",1,4,1,Kelly S.,"Cleveland, OH",119,14,0

4,1/19/2010,"Ambience: 5 Peppercorns (if a bit crowded and a bit of a corporate-chain restaurant feel)Service: 5 peppercorns (with one small caveat *)Food: 3 Peppercorns (thai curried chicken taken off menu. BOO!)Price to Value Ratio: 4 (our bill for 9 people was $1,000! - we drank a barrel of liquor... . You'll do better than us alcoholics.)ADMONISHMENTS/RECOMMENDATIONS:1. If going for dinner, consider earlier reservations between 5 to 7. After 7  it starts to get extremely crowded.2. Be sure to look up and notice the ceiling.  3. Try the roasted asparagus. Yum.4. Large parties know that 20% grat will already be added on to bill.There was nothing (save for a minor issue) that wasn't terrific about our experience here.  We had a party of 9 and had reservations for 6:30. My husband and I arrived early and enjoyed a drink and appetizer in the bar which came to us in lightening speed.  Even though the spring rolls were really egg rolls - they tasted awesome and the portion was large.  Our waitress was pleasant and very pretty which  to the whole zesty atmosphere.   Even though our party was arriving a few minutes late, we were immediately accommodated upon their arrival.  This place is gorgeous.  We had a great table smack dab in the middle with a tremendous view of the 20 foot Buddha. Don't forget to look up and see the japanese scripts above you - very cool. The speed of service was impressive  (I almost wish our food didn't come as fast as it did).  We had every appetizer on the menu.  Each were delicious - but too much fried stuff.  The roasted asparagus was absolutely delicious - I could have ordered that as my whole meal (not sure if this was an actual menu item or if it was a garnishment to the appetizers?)  The Kung Pao Chicken was extra spicy and delicious  - again, I could have had just the veggies and rice part of the meal and been satisfied.  The veggies were so good! *  The only caveat was that they were evidently in a rush to rotate our table and subsequently removed two drinks before our friends were done drinking them.  We let the manager know that was totally uncool and he gave us a ticket for 9 free drinks which was exactly the right thing to do.  The place is definitely crowded and tables are confined, but that's Manhattan for you.  Although close quartered, It wasn't claustrophobic. I thought it added to the excitement rather than detracted.  We are definitely taking friends there when they are in town.",2,0,1,JC C.,"Denver, CO",5,118,21

I had the duck spring rolls, the glazed salmon, and the sorbet. The spring rolls were excellent. The duck was moist and juicy, and the rolls themselves were cooked perfectly and not too heavy. The salmon was perfectly cooked and spiced nicely, however there wasn't very much sauce on it so I asked for some more. It comes on a bed of udon noodles which were nearly the best part. They had so much flavor and were also cooked nicely. The sorbet was good, nothing exceptional, but it came piled with different fruits which was nice. Overall, a nice place and good value for lunch.

Great location, beautiful architecture and design. It's REALLY packed for such a large space, which is probably great if you're in the front, by the bar. But let's get to the meat--and the noodles. The food varied, from edible to average to superb. Vegetable dumplings: YUM! I never though I'd like it, but it was so flavorful. Their Peking duck rolls were good too, but honestly were comparable to regular Chinese food. The salad (forgot what it was called, sorry) was delicious but tiny. Still, a nice appetizer. The main course was pretty good. Let me start off by saying I am a f**king carnivore, that is I love meat. Because of this, I was incredibly disappointed by the wasabi crusted filet mignon. Honestly, it was a waste of cows; I almost turned into a vegetarian. There was some bass dish--and I don't like seafood--but it was delicious. The kung pao chicken was good, as in, Chinese takeout good. There was also some noodles in a fish sauce (again, forgot the name) that was amazing, I ate SO much of it.The best part was probably dessert. Everything was good. Omfg, coconut ice-cream? Insanely good. The fortune cookie was great, but in a cheap restaurant way. Lava cake (or whatever it's called) was pretty good, but simple not good enough. I don't think you could go too wrong ordering dessert, just be sure to try the coconut ice cream!All I could tell you about the drinks is that they're pretty strict; no card no service.

The sad little pager they give you is just like one of those chain restaurants. Pagers are meant for the hospital not a restaurant.2.

The service is so uncomfortably efficient - the appetizers come out of the kitchen within mins of ordering and the main course was on the table seconds after we took the last bite of our appetizers.5. The greeters/hosts/hostesses aren't friendly at all - no welcome, no thank you - they are like what i imagine the greeters are like at gitmo.the food - pretty good, especially the sea bass. too much oil, nothing incredibly creative.

2,10/1/2009,"I came here one time a few years ago during a conference in New York with my co-workers.  First off, I don't care where a restaurant is, anything that is ""Asian Fusion"" is going to be expensive.  No matter how good or bad the food is, the Asian Fusion monster is going to get your wallet whether you like it or not.  Multiply that by New York prices and you got Tao.As I walk into Tao, I notice that it a real yuppie joint.  I think happy hour must of been going on because it's filled to the high heavens with yuppies.  There's nothing wrong with yuppies talking about their Porsche Cayennes and trust funds sipping an $8 Anchor Steam but it's just not my scene.  Yes I've caught bits and pieces of Sex in the City and let me tell you, the ladies here stole their whole style from Sarah Jessica Parker (although they were way better looking). After passing the Big Buddah in the middle of the dining area, that signaled to me that an Asian guy most likely didn't own it.  Although I like the Asian theme just as much as anybody, there was one thing missing. ASIANS.  Straight up, I think I was the only Asian person there. I'm not joking.  The food was aight but nothing too special.  Seriously, you can't really screw up lettuce wraps thank god.  The best thing on the menu....? Those Hennessey and Cokes I ordered.  They got me sauced up enough to actuallly enjoy the ambience that is Tao and the walk back to the hotel.. The service was pretty good from what I remember since he kept on bringing me Hennessey and Cokes all through the night.  I must admit though, it was good knowing a bit more about my coworkers.  Overall, skip this place and head to Canal Street.  Chinatown is way more authentic.  You don't think so? Try getting a glass of water ... told you.",3,4,2,Jason Y.,"South San Francisco, CA",58,157,0
2,9/29/2009,"Give me a break! First off, I always liked the Las Vegas location of Tao and was really craving their seared tuna and spiced eggplant and decided to make reservations here one night after work. I made these in advance and showed up a few minutes before the reservation to be handed a ""beeper"" like one you would get @ Cheesecake Factory or Red Lobster. After standing there for about 20 minutes in an insanely crowded waiting/bar area, I started getting a little frustrated. We didnt look like we were moving anytime considering all these people who were there before us were still waiting. I had to go to the restroom as we were waiting and noticed that this is definitely the restaurant that many tourists pick because it was featured in Sex & the City. Nothing wrong with that, but it's definitely not the restaurant it used to be. Now it's just a trap to make some extra $$. Aside from the tuna that I was craving, the food was your standard fancy (and some not so fancy) Asian-Fusion.

I got the seabass--it was very sweet and too buttery, i felt like the grease was coming out my pores by the end of it. My boyfriend go the steak and noodles which were limp and soggy rather than crisp and flavorful--tasted like week old beef lo mein from the chinese take out around the corner. The decor is nice at this place--definitely go here if you want to see pretty people.

Yes yes, the decoration is beautiful, and theres a huge buddha (which, fyi, i don't think any restaurants in asia actually have buddhas in the establishment....it is a religious symbol after all. It's like having statues/paintings of Jesus in a restaurant...) But that's pop culture for you. We only came for drinks, thank god.

We got to restaurant a little bit before our reservations, we had a drink or two or three :-) at the bar. The drinks were amazing. I had the tao-tini and the love potion. Both were super yummy and strong! Once we sat down we decided we would just share a bunch of meals. We started with the scallop tempura and then moved on to the Kobe beef plate, lobster and shrimp spring roll, king crab sushi and chicken pad thai. All 5 dishes were to die for! Once we finished dinner I was beyond stuffed. I didn't think I could eat anything else, but I was talked into getting dessert since it was my bday. Well thank god we got it. This was the best part of the whole meal. We ordered the jumbo and I mean jumbo fortune cookie.

4,9/18/2009,"Generally I believe Tao is a bit overpriced...despite the quality and taste of their food (it's great).  So I really like it when Tao is part of Restaurant Week.They do offer a moderately priced lunch menu, and when you combine that with Restaurant Week....Tao becomes even more enticing.For appetizers, the veggie dumplings were quite tasty.  I mean, you wouldn't have thought that it was only filled with veggies.  The chicken satay was okay.  I've definitely had better, so these were decent.  The little salad that came with it though was also pretty tasty.  I probably would have preferred more of that instead.For entrees we shared between 2 dishes...the salmon and a chicken dish...which for the life of me I can't remember what the name was.  It was their version of General Tso's chicken though.  The salmon was cooked very nicely and I preferred this over the chicken.  The chicken wasn't so bad, as it was more chicken than breading...but there was an interesting after taste.  I'm wondering if it was due to the green bell pepper that was part of the dish...but who knows.As the Restaurant week menu is always a 3 course meal, dessert involved some fruit (to try to stay healthy), and the fried banana dish. Again, can't recall the name, but you'll know it on the menu when you see it.  Fruit is fruit, and though I enjoyed the lychee...we all knew it came from the can.  The fried banana was really good.In general, I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a good trendy New York restaurant dining experience.  I mean seriously...how trendy can you get with Tao?  If cost is an issue, I'd recommend to go during lunch (if Restaurant Week isn't happening).  It's moderately priced for lunch...pretty spendy for dinner.I would request to sit downstairs though, as you get a better view of that big old Buddha.  Upstairs is okay if you're trying to have a conversation without yelling.  The place can get a bit noisy...but I think the noise is just amplified because it's just a large empty space with all that ceiling.",0,0,0,Iza P.,"Atlanta, GA",218,273,398

When we got in the restaurant was completely empty. It didn't make sense to us until we left around 645 when we had to push people out of the way to get out of the restaurant. Mind you this was soon after the restaurant had opened.The first time I went here one dish really caught my eye and my palate, the duck fried rice. As I said, the first time I went there it caught my palate, it was juicy tasty and fully of life. The next time I had it, two years later, it had lost all its tastiness. It was dry and thrown together. The restaurant had also gone from being packed out the door to half full.

Everything was way too salty and tasted more or less the same; and if it wasn't salty, it was bland. I don't know if it's because it was restaurant week or what, but isn't RW supposed to give you something to rave about so that you WILL go back even during its full-priced times?The worst part was the dessert. We all chose something different, and yet the sorbet with fruit was the best one. Come on, really? All you have to do is scoop that into a bowl and sprinkle some blueberries and raspberries over it, and that's the best tasting dessert you have? I can put that together from a grocery store for less than $10 that I can eat multiple times!Maybe the food got better. Who knows?

The drinks were almost impossible to avoid Vodka, which can be quite fatal for someone who is allergic to this popular poison. I asked the bartender to suggest a drink for me that doesn't have Vodka and she was not helpful. I proceeded to ask her to substitute vodka for some other ailment, she was again not helpful. Surprise, surprise! Even some of the drinks that didn't state Vodka had drinks that derive from it. But what are the chances that you'll be allergic?

Once we FINALLY got seated the food was just okay. The pot stickers were decent but nothing to write home about. The pad thai wasn't life changing and the chocolate eggrolls for dessert were a little TOO chocolaty for my tastes.. Overall not worth the wait.

We were seated upstairs which is a lot less exciting so I definitely recommend asking for a table on the 1st floor. The bathrooms are also located down a flight of stairs from the main floor so if you're on the second you have to do a lot of walking to get there. Also bad news if you are wearing a short skirt/dress, the walls on the stairs are glass...We started with the chilean sea bass skewers. It was absolutely incredible. 2 skewers of soft, melt in your mouth smooth sea bass with a sweet/spicy glaze served over roasted asparagus. Presentation of everything we ate was gorgeous too! Then they brought out 2 pieces of the sweet potato tempura, 6 pieces of yellow tail maki, and 6 pieces of the eel maki. I am not an eel fan, but my sister persuaded me to try one and holy moly is that good sushi. The tempura was a little less exciting but still great. Then we had the sashimi trio which is served with a little salsa-ish thing on top of each piece of fish, and a slice of jalepeno. SO good! Not recommended for a date though, picking up the fish with chopsticks and not spilling the salsa all over yourself is pretty hard. Finally we had the miso glazed salmon with udon noodles. This was my absolute favorite. The fish was again, melt in your mouth amazing, the noodles were deliciously sweet but with a tiny kick, and the whole thing made me want to have a foodgasm right there. We were way too stuffed for dessert but the guys next to us ordered the giant fortune cookie which looked fantastic. It is in fact giant. The service was extremely attentive. Timing of the dishes was perfect. We didn't feel rushed at all, they brought out everything we could have possibly needed so we never had to ask for anything, and the waiter seemed to really care about how we were enjoying our meal experience. The drinks were really good as well. I had a ruby red dragon and she ordered a mojito. Both were tasty!Just an overall fantastic experience.

I know, I know, its a busy place, and especially for a Friday night... but we were left waiting an hour and a half (with a reservation!) due to a faulty buzzer that never went off. We had gone to the desk a few times to check on the time, and each time were told that we weren't up yet. Then, the host came over and exclaimed that he had been buzzing us for-EVER and why hadn't we come up to be seated! Well. So its 10:30 at this point and I am ready to gnaw my arm off... we had ordered potstickers at the bar to stave off our hunger, which were really friggin good. Me and my two girlfriends each opted for the prix fixe menu. I selected the salad for my app, which was really, REALLY good. The dressing was phenomenal. It had a funny name too but I can't remember right now.Next came the wasabi-crusted filet mignon... had really high hopes (how could you not with a name like that!) but it was a little cold, and I had ordered it medium-well. It was alright but nothing out of this world.The dessert was awesome though, I got chocolate spring rolls with this tangy fruity sauce. Really, really good.I've been to Tao before and the ambiance was great, we were seated right in front of the Buddha this time.

Went here for my third and final restaurant week dining experience (Ok maybe I will go to one or two more, you never know.) I came in expecting small portions and generic food. What I received were generous portions of high quality food, presented in a creative way. To top it off, service was attentive. I started with steamed vegetable dumplings. The dumplings were light and flavorful. Entree was salmon served with udon noodles. It was presented on a raised dish. The ginger seasoning was just right and unlike many times I have Asian inspired salmon, it wasn't too salty. For dessert, I had a simple scoop of sorbet, not even sure what flavor it was. I enjoyed the fresh berries, lychee, and black sesame seeds that accompanied the sorbet.

The Kung pao chicken is definitely not authentic but it still tastes great and again the portion is huge. I packed the leftover to go. Finally, the pudding is creamy and bananish and goes well with chocolate spring rolls that my bf ordered. The most amazing part about Tao of course, is its decor and atmosphere.

The decor is obviously great and I loved sitting on the second floor balcony looking down. But the service, OMG, is horrible, not to mention stuck up! My party of 8 arrived at 7:30 for 7:45 reservations and were told to wait until the entire party arrives. One person was running late and arrived at 8:00. When I went up to inform the hostesses that we had all arrived, they ignored my presence. When I finally got one of the girls' attention, she hands me a buzzer and says they will buzz when the table is ready. Why had she not given it to us before? We were only missing one person in our party! We had already been waiting for 30 min. We then proceeded to wait another 45 MINUTES before being seated. When we were finally seated, our server does not show up for 15 min. They were definitely short staffed for a completely packed restaurant. Other things to note: 1. Tao is not that vegetarian friendly- though they have several veg options that will get you by, the several vegetarian dishes I have tried there are mediocre...so if you are veg, dont go for the food!2.

4,7/20/2009,"While the decor and ""attitude"" of the restaurant are selling points for some, what always made Tao great to me was that it was an Asian place with good desserts.  Asian AND with good desserts.  That was their edge to me.I'd been to Tao a few times, mainly for birthdays, and had always had a great meal and a good time.  This more recent trip was more of a ""good"" meal and a good time as several menu items have been changed. The dessert menu has been changed a good deal - so no more Chocolate Raspberry Wontons.  (Why take this off the menu?  It was why I came here to start with!)  Luckily they have other good desserts, though the Giant Fortune Cookie was sort of a letdown.  The previously-awesome Fuji Apple Springrolls are different now too (they used to be light and flaky - now they're more doughy and chewy).  Boo.My advice: If you've eaten here before, make sure they still have what you want before you head out to dinner as they've changed their menu.  As for appetizers, don't get the ""new"" chicken satay - it was weird.  Instead, get the awesome Chilean Sea Bass.  It's still good food and a memorable experience, but know what you're getting into.  (And know that Cokes, at 3.50 a piece, are NO free refills!)",0,0,0,David W.,"New York, NY",7,58,0

We got the Peking Duck spring rolls, Lobster wontons, Chilean Sea Bass, Mandarin Sizzle fried rice with pork, and the Black Pepper Sizzled Filet Mignon with udon noodles. Spring rolls were surprisingly not as good as I thought they would be, they had a slightly mushy consistency that was odd and definitely not worth the price. Lobster wontons were flavorful and delicious and the sea bass was just a little dry for my taste. Fried rice was mediocre in my opinion, just normal fried rice, but the filet mignon was delicious and definitely my favorite dish of the night, although one of my roomies did find it a tad salty. For dessert we got the giant fortune cookie (delicious and I definitely recommend it!) and the fried apple blossoms which were just ok. All in all, pretty satisfying food but nothing amazing. However the ambiance of the place is definitely nice, very classy and elegant, and I loved the giant Buddha above a small pool filled with carp, very nice touch. Service was also very attentive.

3,7/9/2009,"When I left Tao, I was reasonably happy with my meal.  As the hours passed, the novelty wore off and reality set in.First of all, I have to say that I didn't pay for this meal, which usually makes any meal taste a lot better.  For this business dinner, I was able to order anything I wanted and I couldn't wait.I started off with a saketini from the bar.  It was described as sake, cucumber vodka and a hint of orange.  Well, that hint was more of a declaration, as the orange flavoring overwhelmed any taste of the sake or cucumber.  I normally look at orange as a good thing, but it really just took away from what would have been a refreshing and crisp beverage.  So I switched to the Moet & Chandon Brut Rose, which was much better.We started with the roasted shishito peppers and the kobe tartare on crispy rice.  The shishito peppers were delicious as always, and the kobe tartare was surprisingly flavorful.  I enjoyed the taste, but I'm not sure if I could have had much more than a couple of bites, as it was very rich.  It is a great dish to share.As I was perusing the menu, I have to take a moment to say how interesting I thought it was that they had a section called, ""From the Sky"".  I thought it was seriously hilarious.  I'm not sure why.  Maybe the mental pictures of hunting video games that went along with it...I noticed that a majority of their sushi rolls were fried or accompanied by heavy sauces.  I was really hoping that a restaurant with such a great reputation would have more actual sushi in their rolls, as I really like raw fish.  I ordered a piece of uni with quail egg, the crunchy spicy yellowtail roll with crushed onion rings and the Tao angry dragon roll.  A few moments later, the server returned to tell me that they were out of uni.  I gotta stop talking it up, people are always out of it!  So I went with the baby tuna instead.I figured that the spicy yellowtail roll would be fried since it was described as ""crispy"", but I didn't bargain for the huge globs of mayo on each piece.  I am not a fan of mayo, and trying to scrape it off was not working so well, so I just gave up and focused on the angry dragon roll.  I'm not sure what was so angry about it, it was just avocado and eel.  Good, but it seemed pretty mellow to me.  The baby tuna was interesting.  Very tender and sweet.  I was unexpectedly pleased with this as I was expecting your run of the mill piece of tuna.  I also liked how they presented the quail egg in the shell, standing on end.  I'd never seen it done that way.  Pretty cool.For dessert, we had the mochi tasting, which was by far the highlight of the meal.  Six different flavors arranged like they were being racked up for a game of pool.  We had red bean, vanilla, strawberry, chocolate, green tea and mango.  The red bean and mango were definitely the best.  The others were very good too, but they should have changed the name of the green tea to lavender, because it had a very strong lavender flavor.The ambiance was very nice inside and it had a great crowd for a Tuesday night.  I just wish they would rely less on mayo and fried fish and more on quality and flavor.  I would have been ok with it if we would have been at a $16.99 all you can eat sushi buffet, but for $17 a roll, you can get much better elsewhere.",1,1,1,Andrea H.,"Chicago, IL",381,478,144
3,7/7/2009,"When you walked towards Tao from the outside, it may not seem like much. However after you pass through the heavy exterior doors, you enter into a world that's Asian but not quite. I guess Asian fusion would be the appropriate term.The first thing I thought to myself when I entered Tao was that, god damn that is a big ass Buddhist statue. The restaurant also had a huge imperial scroll decked out with a lot of Chinese characters that I cannot read for a ceiling. All Tao needs at this point is a giant cherry blossom tree in the corner to complete the Asian theme trifecta. While the restaurant is decked out from top to bottom with Asian themed decorations, the restaurant also maintains a very club-like feel with its dim lights, fast paced club mixes, and the tendency to make you wait for a half hour before seating you even though you had made a reservation beforehand and its Sunday night at 11pm and  plenty of tables are visibly available, in the same way how most clubs make you wait.The food at Tao wasn't particularly good when considering the price. In fact, some of the dishes were downright disappointing. The kobe beef roll or whatever it was called maintained the soft marble texture the beef is renowned for, but it still tasted pitifully plain. The vegetable dumplings were garbage and surprisingly the cheapest appetizer, the pork gyoza was the only thing that wasn't bad, but the sauce it came with was another story.Go Tao If you are willing to shell out big money for big ass statues, trendy spots, and loungy club music, because it is clear the selling point for this place is not in the food.",0,0,0,Danny L.,"Philadelphia, PA",72,192,79

The progressive house music sets everything on fire and gets you pumped up. This place oozes coolness.The waiting area is in a bar area and is a great place to socialize. Within the two story restaurant there is a giant Buddha statue that spans both floors and is an impressive site to see.The food is an Asian fusion and is wonderful.

Six of us arrived at 9:30 and were told that we could not be seated until our entire party was there. I get the policy but when the other two didn't arrive until 10pm, our table was looonnngg gone so we waited at the obscenely crowded bar/lounge. We drank some drinks (pricey but hey it's Tao), and 45 minutes later we had a table. I am not pissed at Tao but at my inconsiderate friends that didn't even apologize. Ugh, enough of that back to the review.The ambience at Tao is beautiful albeit a bit dark (I could barely see my food). The music is LOUD and this is from a former club kid. I mean I had to shout, do sign language, and do interpretive dance to speak with my friends across the table. However the tunes were stellar just too loud. My appetite was shot to hell so I didn't taste the sushi and shrimp entree my Mister ordered for me (yes, I was pouty--it was my birthday and I could cry if I want to). It did look good and the vultures (I mean my friends) swooped down for it when I told them I wasn't eating it. However the flights of sake were very tasty and as the night progressed I forgot about the crazy wait, my inconsiderate friends, and enjoyed my giant fortune cookie birthday surprise.

It tastes like a little bit of spice was added to it that separates it from your typical kikoman Japanese soy sauce. For me, this was a nice surprise, but I don't think everyone would enjoy it.Normally, I order fried rice as a side dish and it blends into the rest of the food, but the lobster fried rice stood alone. And I know Tao is a top restaurant, but I still expect places like this to screw up something as simple as rice. But, they didn't. It was cooked just right and the lobster made it even better.The sushi dishes, on the other hand, were missing something. I don't remember which rolls we ordered, so they weren't terrible, but they weren't memorable at all. The only thing I do remember was that the sauces/extras that accompanied the sushi overwhelmed it. I don't think I'll go back to Tao unless I have a good reason.

The restaurant also offered hot tea in many different flavors, each pot is enough for two people although you can also get larger pots.App:I got the Peking duck spring rolls with Hoisin sauce. There were three of them, although the spring rolls were very heavy, there wasn't enough of a balance of meat filling with veggie filling so it got very tiring to eat. It was also quite salty.Entree: I got the wok fried NY steak. It was beautifully presented, but also a bit on the salty side. Dessert:The banana bread pudding was definitely a standout. It was creamy, with fresh bananas and super yummy. The portion was also very large. This was a great dish and I highly recommend it.I would normally give this restaurant 4 stars but I was very disappointed with the attitude of our server.

3,5/30/2009,"I came here for my brother's birthday which constituted a party of nine. We had a really attentive waiter willing to help us out with recommendations, etc. I got the seared tuna. It was good; the seasoning didn't mask the flavor of the tuna, which is something that I usually hate about about getting seared tuna regardless of how much I love tuna. The problem with it though, was that I thought it was more cooked than it should have been. The vegitables that came with it were good accented the tuna appropriately. The waiter got us a desert sampler to simplify the selection and give my bro a few candles to blow out for his birthday. The sampler came complete with a massive fortune cookie which included the right number of fortunes for everyone at the table.Altogether, the food and experience where actually on the better side of good. The problem is that every time I go to Tao, I want it to be amazing, and the food consistently falls just short.

3,5/5/2009,"I'm NOT a fan of the Tao in Vegas, so I didn't have high expectations of the one in NYC. Tao is one of those places where you come only for the upscale ambiance and to come and be seen. Don't get me wrong, I love the trendy upscale restaurant/lounges, but the food has to be at least somewhat decent. Tao definitely misses the mark on the food aspect... FOOD: *Duck Spring Rolls: Ehhh, not good. The roll was very dry. Instead of having duck in it, it had taro. I love taro, but this is not what we ordered. And, what's up with the straight out-of-the-bottle sweet chili sauce? It did NOT go well with the ""taro"" rolls. *Scallion Beef: It was just ok; nothing special. It was cubes of beef with onion, bell peppers, and scallion. It was quite salty, so you had to eat plenty of rice to drown out the salt. *Banana Bread Pudding: OMG! This dessert totally redeemed our experience at TAO. It was more a trifle than anything--layers of banana pudding layered sponge cake and topped whip cream/chocolate shavings. The banana pudding tasted like fresh, ripen bananas whipped into rich yumminess. The sponge cake was similar to the kind in chinese cakes: very light and airy. One of my friends had the kobe burger which he said was dry and flavorless. My other friend had the salmon which she barely even touched so I guess it was that bad! SERVICE: Staff was pretentious. We had to flag down our waiter several times to get more water. I had to ask 2 times for my chili sauce. Keep in mind, it was NOT even busy; less than 30% of the restaurant was filled. AMBIANCE: The restaurant was BEAUTIFUL (hence the 3 stars). Like I said this is a place you come for the ambiance only. I loved the red/gold decor, the high ceilings with chinese characters, red brick walls, and the Quan-Yin statue (it's NOT a Buddha statue) with the koi fish pond. With that being said, it's a good place to hang out for drinks, but NOT to eat.

4,4/26/2009,"Tao is a great place to come, once in a while, for a special occasion. It's energetic atmosphere and over-the-top decor make for a fun night, but not somewhere you'd just come to for dinner on a random evening. Tao has now been around for a while and is certainly not as trendy or cool as it once was. However, it remains a favorite of many, and yes, does also get many a tourist. I'm ok with it being a little touristy, since it's for special occasion only. The bar scene is very big at Tao and they have a pretty large cocktail cocktail menu including wine, beer, and sake. The menu is pretty large and broken into dishes from the sea, sky, and land. It has a strong Chinese tone, but also includes dishes that are Thai, Korean, and Vietnamese. Some favorites from my dinner are as follows. Both the Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumplings with Crunchy Cucumbers and the Pan Fried Chicken Gyoza were delicious. For entrees, the Peking Duck (for 2) and Soy Ginger Glazed Salmon with Udon Noodles and Spinach were the best of the table. We came for a birthday and had called in advance regarding a special dessert. They do a dessert platter that was FANTASTIC! A little of almost everything on the dessert menu. A delicious mousse-stuffed giant fortune cookie was my favorite, (including slighty dirty fortune,) but there was something for everything. Another notable dessert was the ice cream filled mochi ball. We were still talking about the dessert as we walked down the street. It really stole the show. I would definitely come back for another fun birthday dinner. The food is good and the restaurant is quite a sight. it has a clubby type of atmosphere, which tends not to be my favorite, but works for Tao.

The decor of the venue is nice, on our last outing we sat next to the fish tank/pond/statue. We sat and waited and waited maybe 15 mintues before the waiter remembered that we were guest. The service is always hit or miss so we buckled down this time out, normally we would leave after about 6 minutes of waiting. (sorry, to many places to eat in New York City)The food really depends on what you order, we stick to sushi and fish. Normally both are decent, not the best ever but decent. The portions are light, so you will be hungry after the fact. Most of the time you experience over cooked fish so beware of that. I definately recommend going for drinks, but it gets crowded and crowded fast so if you are there ask for a table so you can drink in peace with out being bumped by wait staff or other people.

3,3/12/2009,"I experienced an internal conflict with my approach for this review of Tao. As a place to meet for drinks, Tao is a visually-stunning destination with a chic atmosphere and dramatic interior. The lounge area can get crowded, but it's a lively, energetic, and aesthetically attractive crowd (I've been waiting all week to use the word aesthetic in a sentence haha). The bartenders certainly know how to make a drink (as they should at $15+ a glass!). Therefore, as a lounge, I would give Tao a 4 star review. However, I feel the quality of Tao as a restaurant has fallen off a bit, as I was disappointed with the food and service of late.Specifically, I used to enjoy the Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon, but the last time I had it I was uninspired. I'm not sure if it's Tao or if it's me, but something changed. For a Filet Mignon, the meat was tough while emanating a dull taste. The tempura onion rings, while good, did not provide much of a compliment to the wasabi crusted meat. The sashimi and rolls served at Tao were good, not great. I suggest the angry dragon roll.The service at Tao has always been so-so, bu I do realize I have to keep things in perspective and that we (my party) choose to dine at Tao for reasons other that the service haha. However, the reservation staff desperately needs to be upgraded, for the past two times dining at Tao, I've had to wait at least 30 minutes to be seated (and, judging from other Yelp reviews, I'm not the only one complaining). I'm not sure if Tao does that by design, but I would believe that an inefficient reservation system would have a negative marketing appeal for Tao, no matter how impressive the Buddha statue is.Since Tao is probably known more as a restaurant than as a lounge, I ended up putting more emphasis for my rating of Tao from the point of view of the whole dining experience.

Major Sex and the City fans, they wanted to go here and I made reservations for 6 at 10:00PM during the weekend. We got there exactly on time. Tacky house music was blaring (I seriously thought I was in Moscow or Kiev for a moment). But you know, whatever. 6 Europeans can enjoy it. Then they handed me the buzzer beeper vibrate thing. 30 minutes passed. My friends began passing out from jet lag. I went to the maître d' who stretched his hand to shake mine and looked disappointed there wasn't cash there. He said a few more minutes. Another 30 minutes pass. I send the male in the group to check. The maître d' told him they will make up for it and just a few more minutes. 5 minutes later the buzzer vibrates. The maître d' informs me that the group of people are taking photographs at our table so wait longer. Total wait time: 1 hr 15 min. I couldn't give a fuck about the food at that point. The lobster dumplings were good though and service was attentive. That's why this place gets a star. But I will never go here again and I discourage anyone from going.

They even serve mustard sauce and sweet & sour sauce on the plate for dipping. Come on, It's only three spring rolls on the plate. )Entree : Chicken Pad Thai(a good size of pad thai but too watery on the bottom and chicken didn't taste fresh to me.

5,1/18/2009,"If you happen to be staying or touring (or living) on the east side, Tao is a great best, and it had held up since its opening. I recommend arriving some time before your reservation to enjoy a cocktail in the front bar, which is really nicely appointed with armless seating, which is conducive to talking across parties. The room is structures to make that accommodation. The bartenders are friendly, not really the typical New York types that act like little cash-making machines and move on to the next 10% tip. Our bartender took some time to introduce us to the special cocktails and chatted us up for a while. The coolest part of the restaurant is the huge-ola Buddha that dons the back of the space. Since this eatery is one of the larger ones you will dine in, take it all in! We found out an interesting tidbit of Buddha trivia while we talked with the waiter: 1. the lighting within the Buddha are actual candles, not bulb that someone flips on and off. 2. the candles are hand lit using a scaffold that they place behind the Buddha each night. Imagine being the hostess who has to climb the 40 foot scaffold in your heels to light each individual candle on the structure! As far as the food is concerned, it is creative, Asian-inspired, tasty fare created rather than made, sculpted rather than presented. I tried the spicy tuna tartare for an appetizer ($14). I figured that it would be one of the least popular items, but the waiter confirmed that lots of people like it and return for it. The sauce was really the best part here. For an entree, I had the Soy-Ginger glazed Salmon with Udon Noodles and Spinach. It's probably not the most daring pick I could choose, but the salmon was a good size -- about 7 ounces, and the fusion of ginger and soy made it really a pleasant dish. ($26). For some of the greatest doughnuts you've ever tasted, hold out for Tao's. The sugar-roasted doughnuts are ""like my dad used to make."" Crispy, toasty, and served with some killer ice creams. ($9.)

In fact, Vegas must be contained, like a disease, within the Clark county limits. But I digress.What's wrong with Tao in New York? The attitude. Not only the place closed at 2 am on a Saturday night (did I mention this was in New York City?), but even though the waitress, who was nice enough, brought us a round of drinks shortly before the closing time, the security- aka the ubiquitous black bouncer - kept coming over to our table rushing us to ""wrap it up, folks"". When I pay $12 for a cocktail, and the bar serves it to me, I expect to be given the time to finish it. I don't give a damn what Tao thinks of itself in Las Vegas, but in New York, and San Francisco as well for that matter, unless the law dictates that the bar must close NOW, nobody rushes me to leave.  I'll leave it to Tao to not give a damn about my business, either.",0,0,0,Evg R.,"San Francisco, CA",19,94,0

We scored a great table on the top level overlooking the buddha and other diners.  I love the dark/mysterious feel going on and I thought our server was AWESOME.  He was fast, polite and helpful.  He was patient with this hickster and always kept my water glass full (a true sign of a decent server!).For NYC, I did have great expectations, b/c well, it is ALL about the food (hello, new season of Top Chef and enough restaurants that one could eat three meals a day for like five years and never repeat a meal).  I don't consider myself that much of a foodie, b/c ...I live in Chain City USA, so I definitely wanted something unique and something I couldn't get in Indy, which is fairly easy :).In any case, I got the sea bass and stirred fried veggies.  I also ordered a specialty martini (I believe it was raspberry but I can't remember now).  What I do remember?  That I loved everything!!

4,11/20/2008,"When I think of Tao I often think of something along the lines of ""tourist trap"".My friend took me to dinner here and although a little over-hyped it was overall a great experience.Once crawling with A-listers, I thought those moments were long thrown out along with Jen and Brad's marriage and most recently Madonna's marriage.But I guess the footprints left behind by the A-listers last way longer than their own reigns in lala land. Turns out Tao's still pretty hot in touristy circles.The earliest reservation I could get was for 10:45 on a Thursday night. It was crowded, I was starving and was almost tempted to leave.But reality is, there's nothing like eating a meal with a ceiling-high Buddha watching you happily. Well, maybe happily is an overstatement. My favorite by far was the Sashimi of Kobe Beef. It was thinly sliced kobe beef that melted in your mouth. The Crispy Lobster and Shrimp Dumplings were incredibly unique and came in a ginger sauce. It leaned more towards a shumai than your average half-moon dumpling and was definitely wading serenely in a ginger-spiced saucy bath. It was NOT normal dumpling behavior.A nod towards the Chinese inspired restaurant- we opted for the Peking Duck. It was sizable and pretty tasty, although compares nothing to what they serve up in the famous brown-paper wrapped duck houses in Beijing. But okay getting off tangent. I opted for the Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass which I thought was wonderful. I think it's something about that slightly sweet, earthy flavor that gets me every time. I enjoyed every bite. Flaky, soft and just the right amount of natural flavor vs seasonings.Lastly, in an attempt to get some vegetables in, we opted for a side of Hoi Yin eggplant. Although I enjoyed the flavors, I thought it overpowered the eggplants (they're such followers they'll soak up and conform to any flavors they come near anyways).For the price and the wait, it's probably not worth going back but I do have to admit it was a great experience and the food almost made me believe I was a fan of ""Chinese"" food after all.",2,1,2,Lianne Z.,"New York, NY",333,279,5

4,10/23/2008,"We had a lunch reservation at Tao in New York City last week. Our host and tour guide for the few days we were in town suggested Tao and took care of the reservation. We had an incredible lunch at Tao. The theme was fantastic. The food, the table settings, the decorations and the layout of the restaurant were all very impressive. My lunchmates split a sushi dish that I was clearly too afraid to branch out and try. I liked that they ordered one dish and the server actually recommended they try something else. He was very adament in his recommendation and said he stood by it without undermining their original choice. I would hate to speak for them, but they seemed very pleased with their decision to follow his suggestion. I am a big fan of a knowledgeable wait staff, especially when the servers interact with the table more than for just taking an order and refilling water glasses. During the week Tao offers a prix fixe menu for lunch. Apparently it used to be under $20, but it is now $24.07. The menu (pdf) offers a variety of pan Asian dishes. I ordered the Peking Duck Spring Rolls with Hoisin Sauce, Kung Pao Chicken and the Chocolate & Raspberry Wontons with Vanilla Ice Cream. I traded one of my duck spring rolls for a skewer of chicken satay from one of my lunchmates. I definitely made the right choice with the duck. The spring rolls were moist and delicious. The hoisin sauce added a nice light flavor if used, but I opted against for the most part. I was expecting a spicier dish in the kung pao chicken. Believe me, I was not at all disappointed to find it was not spicy. I would have eaten and enjoyed it had it been spicy, but it was great mild. It was plated with very roughly chopped bell peppers and cantaloupe. I am a big rice fan, so I could have eaten more than the single scoop at the center of my plate, but there wasn't really any room in my stomach for more. The chocolate and raspberry wontons were delicious. They were a little too big for one bite and a little too hard to cut to make into smaller bites, but that has never stopped me before and it didn't stop me at Tao. The ice cream was drizzled with caramel and chocolate sauce. Any time ice cream is involved I am happy. I was incredibly impressed with the amount of food we got and how much I enjoyed it for a $24.07 three-course lunch. I highly recommend Tao in New York City.

The food had great taste, and was served very quickly for how packed the restaurant is.This is not the place if you are looking for a romantic quiet dinner, but rather the fast paced, trendy, NY life.

3,8/22/2008,"THIS IS A MUST READ!!!!!! SO U CAN KNOW THE TRUTH :-( THE BEGINNING: June 04 2008, finally came along. It was a long waited and over due to go to the gr8 TAO! We had reservation but still had to wait at least 20mins to get seated. We were greeted by a beautiful hostess, and I guess that's the only smile we saw the whole night from any of the staff! Our sever Daniel V, came along and asked use what we wanted to drink, no smile, not polite, and very old! What a bad server! My friend orders a blue long island and Daniel V has no knowledge about what a blue long island is (how hard is it, the word explains itself), very uptight, and had an attitude problem all night. After he took our drink order he asked if we would like silverware, we said yes cause chop sticks really wasn't out thing. THE WAIT.................. Since the long anticipation of TAO, everyone decide not to eat the whole day, boy where we hungry! So we started to order some appetizers, thinking it would out in 15mins (15mins or less is the average for all restaurants). But waiting and waiting 25mins passed no apps!!! I the mean while one of my friends had a couple of questions about the menu and the waiter Daniel V answer them with a attitude, using his pen to point to the menu and flinging it in all directions as he was talking to us. I seem that we where looked down upon just because we where in our mid 20's, maybe we where the youngest ones Daniel V had ever severed??? AND MORE WAITING.......................... Well its been 30mins now and I still have yet to get the apps!!! I flag Daniel V down and ask him where our appetizers, he says to us ""they will be out in a couple of minutes!"". I asked him why is it taking so long and he got real close into my face and said ""would u like to talk to a manager?"", I said ok. So some big fat manger comes to us and tells us it will be at ur table in 2mins, I asked why is it taking so long and he said ""just try to enjoy your meal"", WHAT???? That does not answer my question! APPETIZERS: Finally we get the appetizers, and guess what, Daniel V never brings us sliver ware. OMG!!! Can this night get any worse. WE HAD: Imperial Vegetable Egg Roll :-( Peking Duck Spring Roll with Hoisin Sauce :-| Bamboo Steamed Chicken and Water Chestnut Dumplings :-) MAIN: After the apps I had kung pao chicken and boy was it good, I wish there was a little more rice tough. So as where done eating we see a bunch of servers including Daniel V standing near our table looking at us and laughing????? DESSERT:I flag him down so we can order dessert, which was probably the best thing about TAO! A gr8 fortune cookie, yummy molten chocolate cake with coconut ice cream and a good espresso. THE CHECK AND THE TIP:Our check was $290.00, and we tipped him out $50.00(which was way too much because of his attiude!!!!)! It was like tossing money into the garbage!!!! I would rather burn 50 dollars then give it to that animal! Never again, never again will I go back!!!! OVER ALL GOOD FOOD, BAD SERVICE!",0,0,0,Supa T.,"Elmhurst, NY",7,23,90
4,8/14/2008,"Went here for the $24.07 prix-fixe lunch on a Wednesday afternoon. The place was pretty crowded with business people and definitely some tourists. I actually thought the food was pretty good and the portions a decent size for the price. To start off I had the chicken satay (comes with 3 pieces of chicken) and my friend ordered the duck spring rolls (also comes with 3). My friend said the duck spring rolls were a bit sweet, but I thought they were delicious. The chicken satay was kind of boring and I didn't like the sauce too muchFor the main course I had the wok seared sirloin and my friend had the soy ginger glazed salmon. I absolutely loved the sirloin, cut into little strips which made it easy to eat with the chopsticks. The sauce was very flavorful. I would order it again. I tried the salmon and it was kind of bland.For dessert it seemed everybody around us was getting the sorbet, but of course we opted for the more indulgent banana bread pudding. Definitely the highlight of the meal! Came with a tempura banana on top. I'm a big fan of banana flavored things so perhaps I am a little biased (but it was also the waiter's recommendation, so who knows).I would definitely go back for the $24.07 lunch. I'm a big eater but the meal filled me up. Oh, the decor is pretty nice inside, although very dark.",0,0,0,Brian L.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,32,0
5,8/14/2008,"Tao is one of my favorite New York CIty restaurants to visit at night. It goes beyond the 40 foot tall Budha statue that is the focal piece of this converted movie theater hotspot. Beyond the sparkling pond filled with koi. It's the bustling nightlife of professionals filling the place to drink it up in stylish clothes at the bar while great music keeps the crowds amped. I've been here with coworkers mostly, family and friends. Out of towners think it's an absolute hoot. Whenever I bring visitors we get to meet some sort of celebrity, yet they and we are always very relaxed about it. Personally, I enjoy the seafood crockpot-It's this perfect amalgam of what is best in Asian fusion here. As a dessert connoisseur I'm proud to say that any one you get here will leave you satisfied.

I didn't feel like it was really anything spectacular and it really seemed like we were eating slightly fancier Chinese food. Not really worth the price. We ordered a dessert sampler in secret for the birthday girl and it came with candles and everything. Six scoops of ice cream, chocolate lava cake, the giant fortune cookie with vanilla and chocolate mousse (+ fortunes for all), fried dessert dumplings, some fried apple thing, and a box of Buddha chocolates.

I didn't mind that much as I was busy sucking down delicious Tao-hitos (their version of the Mohito...which is actually pretty good). After 50 minutes of waiting we eventually complained to the host, Princeton, and we were sat immediately.The food was, in one word, amazing. I had the wasabi-crusted Filet Mignon which was very tasty. And it came with a side of tempura-battered onion rings, so my inner fat kid was very pleased. My roommate had the raw tuna and my sister had the sea bass. Honestly, I'm am not a fan of seafood, but they're dishes were delicious, especially the sea bass. And my mother had the coconut curry, which she very much enjoyed.After a delicious dinner, we were all more than pleased with the experience.

Well, it is because I have friends and relatives from out of town who INSIST on going to Tao because they somehow think that it is the ""hippest"" place on earth (closely followed by Planet Hollywood, I am sure). If you have the option to do so, AVOID THIS PLACE. If you love looking at overly excited women with unfortunate dresses and frosted hair, Tao is the place for you.  The food is horrendous anyhow, so it won't matter.  Also, I just don't believe them when they call their beef ""Kobe.""  Has anyone investigated them???  Their Kobe beef has the texture of the regular supermarket beef...

4,7/22/2008,"Tao is a great place to go if you have money and connections and want to impress a date or some friends. I took my girlfriend and a number of friends there for her birthday and they were very excited to go.  Few things to know:1. If you think you are going to go there for authentic asian foods think again, this is FUSION food. Which means its a mixture of all food types but generally focusing on Asian, specifically Chinese, Thai and Japanese. 2. If you don't like crowds, this is not the place for you. This place is packed every night and especially on weekends elbow to elbow with many tables. Some people see this as a negative, I personally see it as a positive since it affirms that the place is seriously jumping. 3. The wait might be longer than you would like to get seated or even served, what do you expect this place has many tables and is utterly jumping. That is the price you will pay for going to one of the hottest places at this time in New York City. Other than those things, this place has excellent food, phenomenal appetizers and excellent entrees. The atmosphere is really cool and dare I say it, hip. Its a trendy place to be right now so people should try to get in while its still hot.  There is a 40 foot statue of Buddha in the main room and a small pond. The wait staff are friendly and willing to accommodate your needs, but you have to ask don't expect them to read your mind. This isn't your local diner its a really hot place in a super busy side of the park. Another awesome to this place is that since its so popular you have a really good chance of bumping into famous persons also looking for a good night. When we went Beyonce was having a party there with many friends.

3,7/14/2008,"Tao, what a wonderful hidden little gem. Going through two heavy wooden doors, will take you into by a dimly lit hostess table to take reservations (I would recommend calling ahead to make reservations as this place can get really crowded for lunch and dinner). Just beyond the hostess' table is the loung area with a full bar and about 15 small tables with cushioned benches to sit on. In the back, there are another 30-40 tables for all sizes of groups. At the far end is a large buddha that stretches to the ceiling (about 30 ft high), and a small pond with koi fish swimming. The walls are simple, brick and cement, with large Chinese scrolls laid across the whole ceiling. The decor is just majestic, and very pleasing to the senses. Upstairs, there is a U-shaped balcony with about another 20-30 tables, and a sushi bar. And just above the 2nd floor, is a private staircase to the VIP room on the 3rd floor for 20-person parties.I came here for lunch a couple times. Today, I went for the pre-fixe meal which is a 3-course meal for $24.07. My three choices were the Satay of Chicken with Peanut Sauce, Shanghai Scallion Beef, and Zen Parfait. The Satay of Chicken came on three skewers and a small side of slightly spicy peanut sauce. The chicken was very tender and tasty and was perfect with the spicy peanut sauce. A definite recommendation for you thai peanut sauce fans. My appetizer was followed by my lunch entree, the Shanghai Scallion Beef presented in an elevated ceramic bowl, which was strips of beef and mixed vegetables in dark oyster sauce, and a bowl of rice. The beef was tender and well-marinated, vegetables fresh and crisp and the oyster sauce had a slight spicy kick which complemented the beef and mixed vegetables so well. For dessert, I got the Zen Parfait, which is layers of creamy and crunchy chocolate Godiva liqueur and chocolate sorbet, topped with whipped cream. The dish was just delicious, slightly on the rich side, but ended my meal with many smiles and a full stomach.Service was spectacular, with our glasses of water always refilled promptly, the waitress always dropping by to make sure everything was alright.During the night, this restaurant turns into a lounge area for drinks. During the weekends, this place can get very busy during the nights. Sometimes, Tao may throw private parties with lines of limos waiting to drop their clients off.In all, this place serves very expensive food, so for those on a budget, I'd highly recommend to come on a weekday for lunch, to try their pre-fix menu, which is surprisingly good.",1,0,0,Jason P.,"Forest Hills, NY",545,1119,3574

I made the reservation exactly a month in advance, but since 1/2 my party showed up late, we still had to wait for about an hour. The food was good. GOOD...not great. The service was a bit spotty. Anthony Michael Hall was at the next table with 2 cougar-esque strippers, being very loud and rude to everyone around them. You may have gathered that experience wasn't the best.This week, I've been to Tao TWICE. I don't know how I managed/agreed/decided to do this. The first time was just for a quick drink; I work a block and a half away and my co-worker and I stopped in around 6:10pm on a Wednesday evening. You wouldn't have been able to tell that it wasn't 9pm on Saturday night. Just as loud and crowded. We grabbed 2 martinis ($15 each), shuffled to the middle of the lounge area, drank and left.Last night, my friends and I were hungry and wandering the streets of the Upper East Side. I jokingly said ""let's go to Tao!"" (they'd never been there). They told me we'd never be able to get in...Friday night, 10:30pm. Accepting the challenge, I walked in, marched up to the host stand and said ""Can we get a table for 3 within the next 10 minutes please?"" - somehow it worked.I'm not going to elaborate on food. It's typical Pan-Asian stuff and everyone knows it. We also all know the prices are super high for the ""atmosphere"" and the name. I WILL point out that our entrees took waaaaaaay too long to come out. I'm talking 30 minutes after the appetizers. I was almost falling asleep at the table at this point. Then, they forgot my veggie side-dish once everything else had come out. An-noy-ing.Silver lining: Manager DID offer us free dessert because they knew how bad they screwed up. Highlight of the meal?

3,3/27/2008,"From all the spectacular remarks made by various compatriots that have dined at this establishment, I opted to venture to this locale to experience all the high praised remarks.  Sadly, upon dining at this over the top dcor establishment, I was left with an unsatisfied feeling of both emptiness and appreciation.  The restaurant, although features great dcor aspired by an Asian theme, lacks substance due to the overly pretentious crowd for which it serves.The dcor:  There are few objections that the interior designer of this establishment has an ego the size of Texas.  The dramatically over the top decoratives ranging from the seating in the bar area to the 10 foot Buddha statue playing the centerpiece of the restaurant boasts a daunting yet impressive setting for a dining experience.  The restaurant is set up such that most tables are narrowly tucked together (to produce maximum surplus value) to produce a feeling of community.  Sadly, this single feat has aides in the production of vocal decibels that completely overwhelm the dining experience.  Although the features of the restaurant are remarkably attractive (ie: The Buddha Statue, Rock Shaped Walls, Posh Dim Lighting, etc...), the persistent shouting to patrons at your table takes away from the attractiveness of the setting.The food:- Thai Crab Cakes: The miniature tapas inspired dish boasts invigorating flavors.  The mild spice from the seasoning plays host to a scrumptious piece of crab meat within the appetizer that leaves a diner wishing for larger portions.  What captivates most about this dish is that the initial spice accompanied by the sweet accents of the Mango Salsa actually plays as an intro to the buttery inner components of the dish.  Diners will find that the crab cake is worth savoring rather than that simply consuming as with most finger foods- Crisp Shrimp & Lobster Dumplings: The shumai inspired tapa did not produce the commanding flavors as with it's Crab Cake counterpart.  For starters, the dish boasted the salt content to a level that was also inedible.  When attempting to decipher such a dish, diners will find that the application of such abundant amounts of sodium chloride is used solely to mask the quality of the ingredients used in the application.  Fans of shellfish will find that beyond the burdening of the salt, the ingredients within the dish are tertiary to that of their main course inspirations.- Satay Chilean Sea Bass:  Suggestions for boosting revenues at this establishment would work well if this dish became a main course.  The fatty texture of the Sea Bass I perfectly harnessed by the micro green garnishes and the oyster sauce roasted asparagus.  When combined, diners will find that the slightly bitter tastes of the phermonal dense asparagus gives the Sea Bass more flavor.  The dish was well prepared where the fish was left with the majority of the fatty issue intact while having a well cooked texture.Overall expectations of this restaurant were well satisfied solely in the food department.  Sadly, the over burdensome vocals of this establishment takes away from the dining experience.  The food of course left little to be disappointed (with the exception of the Dumplings) as each dish boasted invigorating flavors that's genuine to the Asian Fusion inspired application.Sole recommendations would be to dine at this restaurant during an off peak hour to enjoy the true ambiance of the restaurant.",2,1,1,C M.,"New York, NY",266,454,791

I have to say in terms of decor/ambiance... this is a stunning restaurant.  How can you not be stunned at a HUGE Buddha floating on a pond???  One wall is exposed brick - 3 stories - and the other wall is cushioned in raw silk.  The proprietors intended to make the restaurant an experience for the eyes.  Dark wood tables and chairs, Chinese writing on huge paper screens hanging from the ceiling, coi in the pond, stone and wood statutes watching from the perimeter, and strangely... they continued the immersion to the bathroom doors, which were labeled ""yin"" and ""yang"".   I waited with a group of confused women in the hall, wondering which was the ladies rest room because we didn't want to walk-in on a man going pee.  The ""yin"" is the ladies room, btw.  Seriously,  they should give some sort of clue.The food can be served family style or as individual entrees.Memorable entree was the fried snapper.  Decadent dessert was the incredibly large fortune cookie - seriously, it's LARGE.  AND it came w/ 4 naughty fortunes!  The remaining drinks, entrees and desserts were okay.  I find I can only criticize them, so I won't bother to explain.  Suffice it to say that they lived up to the mediocrity of Midtown restaurants - meaning, if you're looking for authentically good Asian food, go to an authentic Asian restaurant.",2,1,1,lynn n.,"Oklahoma City, OK",60,152,54
5,1/28/2008,I have nothing but good things to say about Tao.  A great dining experience in every aspect.  The vibe is cool with a huge buddah next to a little pond in the middle of the restaurant.  The food was wonderful (a word I save for special occasions because it makes me sound old).  We had a good sized group and ate mostly appetizers.  They were all really good.  I had peking duck for dinner and it was cooked perfectly.  My favorite part of the night (Other than the 6 lychee martini's that I downed like punch) was the sax player that walks around and plays in tune to the music.  I repeat it's a very cool vibe.,2,0,2,Melody D.,"Point Loma, San Diego, CA",1583,296,926
5,1/24/2008,"I love Tao. It's trendy, maybe a bit overpriced, but so so worth it. I bring all my guests here when they visit NYC because it's truly a New York experience. The place is gorgeous and beautifully decorated. When you walk in there's a full bar and a great waiting area to chat with a group of friends and the restaurant itself has two floors with a large Buddha as the main visual. I love all of their dumplings (and yes I have tried all of them) and while obviously the Asian food is not authentic by any means, their main dishes are still very well prepared. Definitely a fan of their chilean sea bass. I can't speak for the sushi since i've never ordered sushi here. But the service is perfect and the cocktails are unique. Reservations are much easier to make now and you're guaranteed to have a good time.

5,1/23/2008,"This review is long overdue. I come off as a food snob to my sister so when I visited her in NYC she told me she made reservations at Tao. I said cool. But she continued to tell me about the accolades it has received and that Tom Cruise hung out their a couple of times. I think Tom Cruise is a douche so I just told her I am excited to go and their is no need to sell me on it further.It has a relaxing Zen-Buddhist decor mixed with a NYC bustle. The service is fantastic. Young and friendly but patient and knowledgeable.  I insist that you get the sea bass as it will melt in your mouth.

Oh, the food was delectable as well.The bar/lounge area is very dark; you need to adjust your eyes to the lighting. However, once you adjust your eyes, you'll be treated to a pleasant, yet uncomplicated, decor. Step forth into the dining area, and you are treated to a full frontal attack of all your senses; the beautiful decor, the ambiance of mingling peoples, the smell of great food being served. Nice.Dinnertime invites a loud roar from you should you want your guest(s) to hear your thoughts. But, have a drink (or not), drop your inhibitions, and shout amongst the company.

I'm a fairly seasoned drinker, and I was almost on my ass after a Chocolatini followed by a Taotini.

They had some weird pinball machines in the bathroom stalls, u couldn't use them but they were a nice decoration. Drinks are good, but it's filled with wannabe trendsters and hipsters, it gets old real quick.

4,7/30/2007,soooo...this is definitely a place to see and be seen...for a reasonably affordable price. it was kind of funny...when we sat down i mentioned to my buddy that this place looked like something off of sex in the city...sure enough...it had been featured there.for all of the hubub and pretension around this place...the food really isn't bad. i was expecting something much less impressive. the food was fantastic...for appetizers my favorites were the tuna tartar and sea bass satay...i'd skip the lobster won tons. for dinner...if you feel like splurging the kobe ribeye is fantastic...though i have to admit i've had better quality kobe elsewhere for similar prices. the crispy snapper dish was incredible as well. the service here is EXCELLENT...in fact its so prompt its almost disconcerting. if you are planning on a romantic evening you may need to make an effort to slow it down. not that they pile up plates (ie dinner served too shortly after appetizers) or anything. its just the service is really really fast. our appetizers were on the table less than 5 minutes after we ordered them. our dinner was on the table 2 minutes after our appetizers were gone. i'm not complaining mind you. just saying that your meal can move a long pretty quickly. this place makes money by crankin people through.,1,0,2,ben h.,"Austin, TX",15,130,0

I made the girls get the BIG GIANT fortune cookie with the yummy chocolate heaven inside! The best part is the watermelon martini. I think each of us had five! The only complaint I have is the waiter actually said "" is that all you are going to order..you should all be ordering more"". He actually seemed angry. WHAT THE @!@#@#!@?

You're on the company expense account, it's damn convenient to the meeting you just had in your midtown East office, and you want to impress your out-of-town associates from Ohio. 3. You've got hold of a time machine, which magically transports you back to its early 90s glamorous heyday.4. Sexy lighting makes ANYTHING look good, including you, your guests, and the very tired, mediocre food.5. Prix fixe lunch is a steal. Obviously not for the food.

4,4/16/2006,"Lively and trendy restaurant with hip music and very tall ceilings.  Definitely a ""scene"" and people watching spot.   That said, food was quite good especially the sea bass and steak.  The coconut ice cream that accompanied the warm chocolate cake is the best I have ever had.",0,0,0,Ross W.,"Los Angeles, CA",485,98,10
5,4/7/2006,"I've been to Tao about 8 times in the past 2 years.. with vendors, with friends, and with family. Everyone (including myself) enjoyed the experience. At first the place can intimidate - the high ceilings, dimly lite bar area, and huge statue at the end... but once you are seated... the night just gets better. The seating is tightly packed but that just adds to the fun. The service is great. The food is awesome. The noise can get a bit annoying... but who cares if you are having fun. You have to make reservation! but they are good at honoring it and seating you promptly. I have not seen that many tourists but its very eye catching so I can see how this place is probably in all the tour guides and books. And... yes... its pricey... but its Manhattan and worth it 100%Overall!! You have to go. Enjoy it. Liv it. Love it. Experience it.",2,0,3,Hector L.,"Redmond, WA",42,82,30
3,3/31/2006,"Cavernous cavern of a restaurant in a part of town where you'd expect something much...well...smaller. But it makes sense that they can pay the rent on such a huge and overdecorated place when you see your bill. The food is good. There's usually a quasi celebrity or two scattered around the place. Reservations are appropriately difficult to get so you feel sort of special when you get seated. The one thing I can't forget, though, is the strange little smirk on the 50 foot tall (sort of buff) buddha statue. It's like he knows something you don't....which I guess is the whole point.",0,0,0,Jennifer B.,"San Francisco, CA",11,60,0
5,3/16/2006,"Yes, its loud. Yes, its crowded. And yes, even pricey. But its the perfect place to go if you want to go out and have fun, but you are not in the mood for a louder club. Tao is the palce where you can have the best of both worlds. If you want to show up without a reservation, just walk directly to the bar at the top. Grab some drinks while you find your way into the chairs in the bar and then have dinner right there (pekin duck for two, mmmmmmhh!!!).",1,0,0,Luis C.,"Hallandale, FL",8,25,0
4,3/9/2006,"I love Tao but at the same time I hate Tao... but then again I do come here a handful of times every year.WHY I LOVE TAO The food is actually quite good.  The sushi bar is fresh (they do enough volume) and the Giant Fortune Cookie with White/Dark Chocolate thick Mousse accompanied by juicy fresh fruit is amazing!  I don't think that you have ever seen a fortune cookie this size. It's huge!!WHY I HATE TAO I Love and I mean Love Green Beans!!! They are sooo good!! But I am allergic to Shellfish AND THEY SQUEEZE SHRIMP JUICE IN WITH THE GREEN BEANS HERE!!! BEWARE VEGETARIANS!!!! I was devastated to learn that I couldn't eat one of my favorite dishes.  IF YOU HAVE ANY FOOD ALLERGIES MAKE SURE YOU TELL YOUR WAITER. TAO'S MENU IS NOT SELF EXPLANATORY. HIDDEN INGREDIENTS  If you can eat anything then consider yourself lucky and enjoy the food.  Some things are better than others but the Waiter can help you make a good selection. Either way when you leave and get home you will still smell like food. CROWD Honestly Tao does tend to draw a touristy crow but at the same time there are quite a few people that come here regularly for business gatherings or group events.  Great place for use of the company expense account.My fist experience at this restaurant was at a New Years Eve party.  I met a very sexy Irish guy... hmmm can't remember his name but yum!  He tasted better than the food! What a great way to ring in the New Year!ATMOSPHEREModern, spacious and open.Romance Factor:  9Hobnob Potential:  8Destination Rating:  7  THE DOWNSTAIRS BAR can get a little crowded.  But if you're lucky you'll have someone adorable to be pushed up next to.UPSTAIRS BARMy personal favorite of the two.  Try their unfiltered sake!  WOA!!FUN FACT / DECORATING TIPThe giant candles on the back wall are not the candles that are actually burning.  The inside of the candle has been hollowed out and  smaller candles (possibly tea lights) are placed inside - thus giving the appearance of a huge candle burning.  Tea lights are much less expensive that giant glowing candles.",5,2,6,Megan C.,"New York, NY",4019,835,1062
4,2/8/2006,"Don't let the bitchy locals scare you off.  Tao is the real deal.  Perfect lighting, attractive decor, tasty asian fusion witha touch of Indian, California, and French influences. This place AND its clientele are eye candy.  The bar is SUPER crowded, tunes pumped way too loud, so don't expect to carry on any sort of intimate conversation.  That's OK, though. Bar Staff somehow keeps it all sorted out, great cocktails.  The food is top-notch.  Great seafood, wagyu (kobe) beef, and nice contemporary twist on appeteasers.  Strong wine list, not as pricey as you'd think. Just because the place was used as a backdrop in SEX AND THE CITY and the movie HITCH does NOT make it a lousy bourgeois hang. Definately try TAO.",0,1,0,Joe S.,"Chicago, IL",11,112,1

3,1/29/2006,"Still packed after being open for years, Tao has proven the test of time, no longer a hot spot but more so a great place for visting tourists, out of towners and business travelers the place has a great ambience and excellent food which keeps the place a humming.  If your midtown check it out, chill at the bar or if dining try the Kobe Beef, its cooked on a hot stone and comes with wasabi dipping sauce.",1,0,0,Frank K.,"San Francisco, CA",19,70,1

GET A LIFE!Please, this bridge and tunnel, over-accessorized, short-skirts, bad suits,  and all around loud bar crowd thinks too much of themselves.  Sure the food is good,  atmosphere is dim and relaxing and the massive Buddah is really cool but this place became name drop central and tourist destination #5.  The yuck-o crowd totally ruins any zen moment you may try to have as you bite into their amazing Kobe beef -which you cook yourself over a stone.  Unless its so crowded that they have no more stones and offer you a boiling bowl of water to cook your beef.Can you tell that I really want to like the restaurant?  The food is good (pricey) and the atmosphere is gorgeous.  Sorry three stars for the played out factor and the crap people who hang out there.",1,10,0,Krissy M.,"San Francisco, CA",56,274,2
5,1/8/2006,"No, no, no, it's definitely not all about the ambiance.  And I totally disagree about this being a tourist spot.  The food and service were both excellent.  Their shrimps are out of this world.  Their desserts are also out of this world.  Try the molten chocolate cake.  Expensive but SO WORTH IT.",0,0,0,Li M.,"New York, NY",71,568,0

5,11/29/2005,"For ANYONE who has written a poor review of this restaurant...... stick to Red Lobster because you have NO IDEA what a fine restaurant is. My wife and i recently ate there on a friday night. A night where if ANYTHING could go wrong, it would. From the time we stepped up to the hostess station to the time we paid our check, everything was perfect. If ANYONE is picky about quality and service, its me. I am a TRUE restaurant snob. I can genarally find fault in ANY establishment. Considering the size of this place among many small, MORE expensive places in New York i would say they set the standard. The quality of the food and the manner in which the kitchen times its service in combination with the wait staff was remarkable. On this night the house was FULL and their timing in ALL aspects was PERFECT. I also find it amusing that some of those reviewing say the menu is over-priced....again i say stick to Red Lobster. I found the prices based on quality, service and atmosphere to be BElOW average for New York city. I have paid the same or MORE in much smaller markets for WAY less of an overall dining experience. I made it a point to relay this to the MOD that night. To anyone related to TAO reading this review i say EXTREMELY well done and i would recommend you to ANYONE who would appreciate a wonderful experience. A++",1,0,0,Joseph G.,"Little Neck, NY",2,182,0
