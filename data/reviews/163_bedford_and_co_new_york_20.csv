2.0,4/29/2019,Came for Sunday brunch. Slow to be waited on (even though it wasn't actually that busy?). Food was edible but subpar. Only positives are the environment and modern American restaurant vibe.,0,0,0,Michele L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,0
4.0,4/27/2019,"Not kidding y'all but I think I found one of the best burger places everrrr!! I got the Bedford Burger, it was so bomb. Like The bomb dot com! The patty was so very juicy, the pork belly was a yummy addition to the amazing burger! The fries that came with the burger was also so very delicious! BUT~ the service was not great. We were made to wait for forever for pretty much everything. For food (which was worth it), asking for the bill, waiting for change. Like it was waiting, waiting and just when you thought the waiting is done, they surprise you with more waiting. Maybe the fanny pack I was wearing turned them away. But tbh, I thought I was rocking it. Who knows.But after all, the food was really really delicious. Y'all should come!!",2,0,1,William N.,"Westwood, Los Angeles, CA",175,34,10
4.0,4/22/2019,"Had a party of 8 for brunch on a Sunday at 1:30pm. The food is good and the price aligns with it. Cool ambiance, good for groups, was simple enough to setup a reservation through their website. Kitchen was very accommodating for some minor substitutions/edits to the order to account for some dietary restrictions of the party. Overall, would definitely go back with a group, for 1-2 people though may just try the bar area next time. I'm a fan.",0,0,0,Luis S.,"Manhattan, NY",87,172,2

5.0,4/20/2019,"We went here for brunch on a random Sunday and we loved it! I had bought a pulsd deal for 90 minutes of unlimited bubbles and 2 entrees.  We both got the sausage griddle sandwich, which was delicious! It was the right balance of sweet and savory. Instead of buns, they use pancakes.  It comes with chicken sausage, cheddar cheese and runny eggs. The perfect combination. They definitely don't play around with their boozy brunch.  We finished one bottle of prosecco and they just so casually replaced it with another since we were still under the 90 minutes.  You also get three different fruit juices- mango, guava, and passion fruit-  to mix it with and to make your own bellinis.  Before our meal was over, we knew we were going back.",0,0,0,Y G.,"Queens, NY",2,11,27
5.0,4/19/2019,"Best Brunch Ever!!!!!!! I always order salmon benedict. It was so delicious and the salmon was mega fresh. The Bottomless Bubbles obviously made it a toast afternoon. Honestly what makes this place superior to other brunch spots is the service...I've been three times so this review is overdue. Yancis is the manager and she really makes you feel like you are family and I'm her home. She's initially why I returned, plus the bubbles. We've had Shai as our waiter twice and he's so professional, warm, friendly and on point! Even when he's crazy busy he pops by to check that you have all you need. I recommend Bedford & Co ALLLL the time! Can't wait to go back....",0,0,0,Jolyn B.,"Manhattan, NY",218,84,123

5.0,4/14/2019,"This was the first time I came here for brunch. It was an awesome spot for brunch. I highly recommend getting their deal on the Pulsd app. They give you a big bottle of champagne with 3 different juices for you to add on. You get guava, passion fruit and mango. My favorite was the mango and guava. But the service was great. The waitress was very nice and answered all of our questions and was very attentive. Their Bedford burger one of the most amazing burgers I've had in a long time. It comes with pork belly and it is all so flavorful and delicious. The chicken and waffles are cooked to perfection. The waffles are nice and crispy and have a great vanilla taste. The chicken was also nice and crispy but also juicy when you bite into it. I highly recommend coming here for brunch.",0,0,0,Gus R.,"Mamaroneck, NY",78,187,332
4.0,4/14/2019,"Food was ok, vibe was very Industrial Williamsburg, kind of Millennial chic..  Service was very random, even though we ordered the bottomless brunch, the waiter wouldnt serve me til my friend showed up,  and a few other slip-ups as well.    i am giving an extra star due to Yancis, who is one of the managers and single -handedly made up for the the 3 or 4 errors they had in service. i would go back  again if my made my reservation thru her, and was assured she would be there, otherwise, there are way to many brunch options in NYC",0,0,0,Neil F.,"Manhattan, NY",3,38,0
2.0,4/8/2019,"I think bottomless drink boozy brunch is code for ""we hope you get drunk enough to not notice that our food kinda sucks.""  First off -  midtown east tourist trap.  It can attract all the Grand Central johnny come latelies to their mediocre brunch.  Second - much too dark.  I guess they don't want you to see what you are eating?  Third - two bathrooms for the entire damn place?  K.  Fourth - service left much to be desired.  I think we got the right entrees, but he just seemed very confused.  He was nice, but I'm guessing it was because it was too damn loud?  And yes, I am too old. Deal with it.The bubbles though, 90-minutes of sparkling wine with craft juices.  It's a good concept, just not well executed.  You want us to make mimosas and can't even give us ORANGE FREAKING JUICE?  Mango, peach and something else.  Not orange.  No cranberry or pomegranate? Come on.  No one wants a mango mimosa.  Peach maybe, but bellinis aren't my thing. May as well bring out the apple cider vinegar like the guy who ruined brunch on the internet that one time.And my food? It wasn't memorable.  Some chicken sausage breakfast sandwich.  It was pedestrian, yet another item on the menu that had a good concept that wasn't executed.  I can pretty much gather I won't be here again.  After all, I live on the west side, and I'm rarely ever on the east side.  I wouldn't be back anyway.",1,2,0,Taryn C.,"New York, NY",280,766,51

3.0,3/25/2019,"Food was very nice, service was spot on. Only 3 stars as this is not really a great brunch venue. (Which is why the 9 of us were there!!).

1.0,3/15/2019,"I am not a big reviewer but I was so disappointed by this place I felt I needed to document it. I was there for brunch with a bachelorette party. We sat in the back room which was nice and private. However, the restaurant had said they would decorate the table with confetti for the occasion--they did not. Once someone mentioned it, they gave us some free dessert. Unfortunately, the dessert was on par with the rest of the food: Bad. I ordered steak and eggs, medium rare. The steak came out very rare and purple, and I asked for them to toss it back on the grill for another minute. The waiter returned with my plate and loudly announced ""Medium well!"" and then hurried away. Obviously, not what I asked for, steak was now way overcooked and honestly not worth eating. Other people in my party experienced similar problems with their own meals. Our server also came back twice to confirm everyone's orders (only 8 people!) and still messed it up. The people who ordered bottomless didn't receive their drinks until a good 20 minutes after ordering, after reminding the server. I'm not sure if these problems were due to an inexperienced waiter, a bad kitchen staff, or both. Nearly every person in the group was disappointed by the quality of their food. The breakfast potatoes were very good, everything else was bad (avocado toast, steak and eggs, burgers, breakfast sandwich). Bottom line: I would not come back here again. The service was poor, the food was not good, the plates were expensive. There are a million better brunch places in the city.",0,0,0,Elena M.,"Morristown, NJ",0,3,0
5.0,3/9/2019,"Brunch was so bomb!My friend invited me to brunch here and I'm so happy she did! I probably would've never learned about Bedford & Co. had it not been for her.

5.0,2/17/2019,"It's been too long since I've done bottomless brunch in NYC and this spot did not disappoint. I loved the ambiance and vibe of the place with old school r&b playing in the background (not too loud), dim lighting and good vibes. The deal is they provide you the Prosecco bottle and juices until your 90 mins is up. I love that they didn't pre-make them and the juices were guava, passion fruit and mango. I'm not a huge fan of orange juice so this was perfect. Our waiter explained everything to us and was super attentive. The food itself was pretty good. I ordered the steak and eggs and although some complained about the steak portion it was perfectly fine for me. It's a great go to spot in the city for brunch. I will note for certain dishes (steak & eggs) they consider it premium so that dish was a tad more expensive than others.",3,0,0,Adrienne W.,"Philadelphia, PA",84,64,142
4.0,2/14/2019,"This was a last minute brunch decision for me & the besties but it was a great choice! Brunch menu is small but it has the brunch basics!

3.0,1/24/2019,"This is a beautiful restaurant and bar that's great to go to with a client or a date you're really feeling. The lighting is very dim and the vibe is romantic. It doesn't seem like it from the outside, but there is a lot of space, with two huge rooms full of tables in addition to the stools by the bar. The host was a very friendly guy who greeted everyone warmly. They do serve coffee, almond milk, and tea, which I really appreciated when I went in the evening. They had no problem with me not drinking, though service was a little slow to take orders that night.in terms of food, I got the octopus, artichokes, and shishito peppers small dishes. Everything was delicious and so well cooked, but the portions that you're getting for the prices for kind of a joke. I have no problem paying for food that is worth it, but I wish they gave a little bit more. I do recommend these small dishes if you're hungry and want something healthy to snack on.Overall, beautiful and artful decor, solid but sparse customer service, and lovely food, but portions were disappointing. I'd love to return for brunch one day and try some more dishes.",5,1,3,Darya S.,"Manhattan, NY",978,2060,1393
1.0,1/20/2019,This place is only getting a star because the food was pretty good. The service here was horrendous. We were sitting for about 15 minutes before a server came over. We got an email the night before saying that THEY WERE OUT OF CHAMPAGNE FOR THEIR BOTTOMLESS BRUNCH! How has a restaurant been around and they don't know how much champagne they should have?!?!? We got the deal off of pulsd so we had to come or else it was going to waste. The manager reprimanded the server in front of us which was completely unacceptable.

5.0,1/20/2019,"I originally picked this place due to the great reviews about the bottomless brunch. It's hard to find a place that has both great food and unlimited mimosas in New York City. Time wasn't on our side so we missed brunch but decided to make reservations for dinner. It was an amazing experience. The ambiance, the service, the drinks, the food was incredible! Perfect for a date or catching up with friends. We ate talked laughed drank while RnB and Neo soul played in the background .

It comes with guava, peach and mango and you can keep it coming! I had the burger with fries and my friend had the steak. Both were very well made, flavorful and well seasoned. I like this place because it's unassuming and chill. It didn't get busy until around lunch time but the crowd felt like a mix of tourists staying in the hotel and a few locals.

4.0,1/6/2019,"Food: The food was great! This is my second time coming to Bedford and Co. and it did not disappoint. My first time was during NYC restaurant week. This review is based on my second time here during   the bottomless brunch with the pulsd voucher and was definitely satisfied! I had the eggs my way and also had a taste of the steak and eggs. The steak was perfect and great quality of meat, just wished the portion was a bit bigger. The burger was probably the best bang for your buck, and the fact that it included a thick slab of bacon was a huge plus. Overall the food was absolutely delicious!Drinks: The pulsd deal included bottomless champagne with three mixers. The champagne was great by itself but the mixers were a plus. The mixers included a mango orange, cranberry and peach. All three mixers were so yummy!Service: The waitress did an amazing job at taking care of our large party. She made sure our glasses were never empty nor our tables. She was very attentive especially when our group was seating a bit outside of the main dining room. Vibe: Classy and elegant vibe but not too stuffy. Love the entrance lobby and the fur accents.

3.0,12/26/2018,"We made reservations for Christmas Day Brunch at 10:15 am. On Christmas Eve, we had to confirm our reservations.  My sister showed up a little early (luckily) and we were still about 10 minutes away; she was told there was no brunch menu and that she should order food for the whole table because the kitchen was closing at 10:15. She did order 3 breakfast entrees and the food was decent. However, the place was dreary, no decorations for the holidays. There was no brunch for Christmas Day and the staff kept reminding us they were closing the kitchen soon because they expected to be very busy later.  Not sure why they accepted reservations for a party of four at the same time they expected to close the kitchen.  Not sure why they expected to be busy later; can't imagine why anyone would be having xmas dinner in such a dark and dreary atmosphere.  The brightly lit photo I have seen of this establishment is of the bar area, and it does not reflect the actual sad and drab dining room where you actually have to eat.  Very disappointed.",1,1,1,Brigitte M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,6,1
4.0,12/18/2018,"It's a good weekday lunch option for the area. Definitely feels more like Bedford Ave than midtown Manhattan, which is a good thing for sure.

3.0,12/9/2018,We made reservations for a family brunch at Bedford & Co and it was pretty tasty! First I loved the open table booking it makes getting an open spot easy!The interior feels dark and romantic. Even though we had our son with us we would definitely go back for a date night. We were seated right on time in a cozy table for 4. The brunch menu offers something for everyone! I had the avocado toast and mimosa.The table shared a cinnamon bun and it was big enough for 4 and tasted phenomenal. My avocado toast arrived with one piece of toast and a side salad. I was a little disappointed that there was only one piece because the food indent inexpensive. It also was a little bland in taste. It wasn't bad it just wasn't great.However everyone else at the table loved their food. The hubby had chicken and waffles and devoured every bite.

2.0,11/25/2018,"I was here for a brunch and had a poor experience since most of the brunch options include eggs which I have a slight allergy to.  I asked the waitress if, because of my allergy, I could order something off of the regular lunch (not brunch) menu, and she immediately responded with a ""no"".  I opted for a dish on the brunch menu (California bowl) and requested the eggs on the side.  After taking my order the waitress asked if I any allergies, which I can shared with her.  Once the entree came out, the portion was tiny (small enough to fit in the palm of my hand).  I realize that NYC portions can be smaller due to a higher quality, however, this was not the case. The quality of the food was simply average and the portions of the dishes for the others at my table were more reasonable. Also, once the entrees came, there was only a single time (if that at all) where someone came to refill our waters.  Overall, this is not a restaurant I would choose to return to.",1,1,1,B Z.,"New York, NY",0,33,0

5.0,11/19/2018,"I came here for a birthday day brunch, which we made reservations for. Because the bottomless brunch is 2 hours long from the time you are seated, they make sure your whole party is there. Once we got our group together, we were seated immediately and started off with the mimosas, which you mix yourself. Tip: there's a coupon for bottomless brunch Pulsd $39 for 2. Totally worth it, so check if the deal is still available before you go.Our party got a few things - chicken and waffles, Bedford burger, and sausage griddle sandwich. I personally got the steak and eggs. Steak was perfect and had wonderful flavor. So did the eggs, the greens, and potatoes. As a heads up, the amount of steak that comes with your plate isn't the normal 6-8 oz, it is way less then that, but the server was sure to clear that up before we ordered. As for the rest of the group who got other parts of the meal, they were also very pleased. I have to commend the service team here. They were quick to respond and took good care of us.

4.0,11/12/2018,"We finally got to do Sunday Brunch here yesterday and overall, despite the fact that service took really long (like waited for almost 30 mins to be attended to after being seated, I really had to ask if someone can help us), the 4 stars is really attributed to the food and the ambiance.Loved the fact that they're pretty generous and actually give you the bottle of Prosecco at the table with fresh orange juice, mango, and guava to go with it. The food was delicious! Hubby ordered the Cheeseburger and he made me try it, really good! The fries was also perfect! And as for me, I went with the Chicken & Waffles combo. Divine! The chicken was fried to perfection and the syrup was the perfect balance of spicy and sweet so it definitely won the sweet & savory combo. We were given a second bottle and was pleased that it was finally chilled this time. Made up for better drinks. Shah attended to us after I requested if anyone can help us. He was then attentive to us and was good. Thanks, Shah!This place has really good potential. Hopefully they can iron out the kinks of service.

The staff is super friendly and accommodating, which I really appreciated. What I loved about the brunch was the fact that they give you the champagne to pour at your discretion along with 3 different juices. I was in heaven!!

There were no issues coming in unannounced/without reservations and were promptly seated and attended to.Bedford's & Co's lunch menu is primarily devoted to a 3-course prix fix offering ($29 - app, entree, cookie to go - though, like restaurant week, there are some offerings that have supplemental costs - e.g., the octopus app), though they do have some al a carte offerings. We both opted for the prix fix.I started with the heirloom tomato appetizer with shaved cheese (mozzarella or perhaps sheep's milk?), and capers - which was light, lovely, and had some nice zest with the plentiful basil.For my main, I had the grilled kale salad with shaved pecorino, lemon, and pine nuts, and added some grilled chicken as well. The salad was nicely dressed with a lemon dressing and was much heartier than it looked. While I would have hoped the added grilled chicken would add up to more than just 4 pieces, the chicken itself was nicely prepared and tender.The cookie to go was a chocolate-marshmallow variety - not bad, but nothing special.All in all, a solid, prix menu lunch spot with some tasty healthy options if trying to 'be good'.",2,1,2,Steve L.,"New York, NY",157,309,1204

Everything was cooked perfectly, I got the basics, an egg over easy, bacon and toast. The toast was more like bread, not really toasted at all, the two times I had breakfast it came like that so if you like actual toast then maybe remember to ask for it a little crispier. The orange juice was so good, probably the best OJ I've ever had, we ordered some refills of it and my coworker wanted to try it as well, however the waitress was pretty aloof and took care of other tables forgetting about us entirely until we asked for the check and then she brought us the OJ, it would have been nice to sit and enjoy it instead of having to chug it on our way out the door.

5.0,9/9/2018,"I visited Bedford & Co for brunch today with my friend and I have nothing negative to say.  I purchased a voucher from Pulsd which allowed us to partake in the unlimited bubbles for 90 mins as well as an entree for each of us. Even without that great deal I would of loved the brunch service that B&C provides. First and foremost the fact that they open a fresh bottle of champagne and leave it at your table speaks volumes to their commitment to your brunch experience. There is no hunting and flagging down your waiter/tress for a refill. You pour your own troubles! They provide 3 different juices. I read that is was a passion fruit mint, and strawberry option somewhere else but I'm assuming that's seasonal or it just changes depending. Today we had the option of mango, pear and grapefruit. They ran out of mango, which was my favorite so our waitress brought us orange juice. I admit it was lovely not having the typical orange juice mimosa for the majority of our time. How boring is that?! Anyway, they are not stingy with bringing you more bottles once you are finish with one. However, we paced ourselves and I'm sure my liver thanks me! If you are not a drinker I still encourage you to purchase the unlimited because for $34 you have bottomless drinks and an entree as opposed to paying $35 for one bottle or single drinks which add up. Now on to the food!  They do not have a vast menu with many options but what they do have they have perfected. I cleaned my plate. I had the Frittata and my friend had the Sausage Griddle and I can say I was impressed with her dish as well. Flavorful and properly cooked! I didn't need to add salt or pepper and trust I've had to do so on many occasions elsewhere. I may have came hungry but my satisfaction had nothing to do with an empty stomach. I would surely return to have either two of those dishes again.. minus her sunny side up egg (I don't like runny yolk!)The service provided by Ember was also pretty great. She wasn't on us constantly but she was around when we needed her. She was pleasant and patient. A nice sense of humor and professionalism. The hosts possessed the same professionalism and charisma. The ambiance was enjoyable. When you walk in you see the partial span of the restaurant and the complete bar which is a nice size. To the right is a nice and comfy waiting area. You can also see into the kitchen which I always enjoy seeing. Decor is trendy and comfortable. The venue is dimly lit so can be romantic for a date but give a grown and sexy vibe for your ladies night/ group outings. If you are looking for a party brunch this is NOT it! They do have music playing in the background but the chatter from those around you will probably drown it out as was my experience today. You can surely go here and enjoy your company without talking over the bass. You may however compete with another large group if there is one. After all it's an unlimited brunch spot with amazing food! Tip: Ask you waiter/tress to bring multiple juice mixes per person or double up on your favorite because they are tiny glasses like 2 oz worth.",1,1,0,Katerra B.,"Freeport, NY",5,33,30

I do think my $15 cosmo was on the exorbitant side given its small size and the cheaper price of some of the other specialty cocktails on the menu, but it's NYC - it was very tasty and I had two, and I felt them.

5.0,7/23/2018,"Mic drop.   I'm having trouble coming up with words for how much I loved my dinner here. By far the best meal I've had in ages, including a ""famous chef branded"" restaurant closer to home.   Order anything you want - I had 3 starters, 1 main and 2 different drinks and *everything hit*.  Everything. Hit. That's such a rarity. Before you read further, go through and read my review history for context - that's just a good practice, right ?  I'm in it for the food, and totally don't care about ambience if the food doesn't hit.  Bedford has it all - amazing food, amazing ambience, amazing service. This restaurant is in the ground floor of a boutique hotel. I tend not to eat in hotel restaurants but I checked out their menu (hanging on the wall next to me on a leather strap) and found many great sounding pasta dishes.  Now that Bella Luna is closed (so sad) and Portalli's is (hopefully?) recovering from the flood I decided NYC is a great place to get Italian.  The hotel itself has me totally vibing, so eating downstairs in the hotel restaurant was a go. Right from the start, excellent ambience.  Dark, mood lighting, old school hip hop playing.  Ordered up a house cocktail that was exceptional - I believe it was Scotch with fig jam.  Yes, fig jam.  It was very refreshing and nice to be able to get a fruit drink that didn't end in ""crush"".  Get the octopus.  It's right inline with Samos'.  GET THE RIGATONI.  House-cured pancetta.  It bears repeating - GET THE GODDAMNED RIGATONI.  You don't consume the rigatoni, it consumes you.  It was so exceptional I couldn't even place the cheese they garnished it with.  Surprise, it was parmesan ... just the most exceptional parmesan that has ever existed.   As soon as I tasted it I knew I didn't want this ride to end, so time to strike up more conversation with ... The bartender, Tommy, is outstanding in every way.  Appreciative of the fine art of food and drink, he's wise beyond his years in his recommendations.  Bonus !  He's also the curator of their house cocktails.  Ask him about the history of the Diplomatic Immunity - it's quite clever; not just a double entendre.  Quite worthy of raising a glass or three.   My lawyer advises me I stopped at three drinks.  Anyhow, back to the food ... Tommy  recommended I try the potatoes.  Potatoes, right ?  Topped with cheese. Turns out Tommy is a pretty smart guy.   The potatoes were cooked just perfectly and the cheese ... Oh my, the cheese. What a cheese.   Get the potatoes, either before or after your main plate. Even the beets are great.  Beets are a bit of an unsung hero in the culinary world and they bring them to their deserved glory. This is the kind of restaurant where the more I type, the less effective the review.  It's a mic drop for sure.  If you're ever in the big city you have to give it a shot.   It's not aiming for cheap, it's aiming for great quality.  If you come here on a per diem be prepared to spend out of pocket, but it's exceptionally well worth it.  I eat out quite a bit at home and on the road, and am exceedingly happy I ate here despite the cost.  By comparison, I spent close to twice as much for a meal at ""famous dude's steakhouse"" and left disappointed.  Reading some of the other Yelp reviews leaves me bewildered, which is why I suggest going through my history and deciding if your preferences and tastes parallel mine or not. Matt B. it's a restaurant with a bar and fine food.  Why do you require that it fit within some industry categorization like ""wine bar"" or ""sports bar"" ?  God forbid, seriously does the world need more sports bars ?  A couple quick administrative notes: It's called Bedford & Co and is colocated with the Renwick Hotel.  The live menu isn't what's in the hotel rooms - they now have less pasta now, more meat dishes.  The kitchen closes at 10 sharp, so order before then.  Of course they let you continue with your meal, but order all your goodies before 10. Sorry I don't have any pics, I was too busy gorging.  There are plenty of pics in other people's reviews though. Let me say this too - after having an exceptional meal I'm reminded of what a food desert we live in despite our affluence location.  I'm further reminded of how fortunate we were to have Bella Luna around for so long, and Portalli's.  Portallis, I hope you reopen.  If you need volunteer help, reach out to me here - I'm completely serious and have already done volunteer help for EC shops.  The food crazed population of HoCo needs you back in our lives. Bottom line: Bedford & Co collocated with the Renwick Hotel is a mic drop.",2,1,1,First L.,"Columbia, MD",3,47,13

We had other options of places in mind but got annoyed they didn't take reservations- so my friend luckily suggested this place that does take reservations. They reminded us through Yelp and email and call about our Saturday morning reservation, so I got really nervous when my train from queens got canceled and I was going to be a half hour late. Luckily they were SO flexible and said not a problem, and recommended to my friend who came on time to not sit until I got there so we could have the full 90 minutes of bottomless. We did the $29 entree+bottomless drinks which is a great deal considering it's in the heart of midtown/right near grand central. Our waitress was very sweet and accommodating. She brought over a champagne bottle along with 3 mixers (guava, pear, and mango) for us to mix and match ourselves- I've never seen this before! When we needed a refill, our waitress was on it. For my entree, I got the chicken and waffles which were deliciously crispy- I got the sauce (syrup mixture) on the side so I could control how much went on.

They also have a special of the day which is served family style and is $45 a person. My boyfriend and I weren't interested in the daily special so we decided to just order our own meals.

I'm so glad  my boyfriend decided on the side as it was sooooo good; one of my favorite parts of the meal! I would definitely recommend the broccolini to anyone there. My boyfriend received two decent sized pieces of chicken that were perfect; not dry at all! The burger came with a nice helping of fries as well. This place is good for a date night or get together as it places some music but nothing too loud that you can't  hold a conversation.

4.0,5/17/2018,"Bedford & Co is somewhat of a hidden gem. You can easily walk pass it without knowing it's there, right under The Renwick Hotel. Once you enter you are in a small lounge area where some of the hotel guests seemed to be having drinks. Then there is a long bar where things start to get interesting. There is a great cocktail menu and wine list as well as happy hour specials. Sliders and oysters are delicious bargains. Only thing at the bar is the music level. You can't really have a conversation unless you raise your voice which few bar patrons were utilizing their dance club voices. Pass the long bar and the main dining room opens up with the open-kitchen being the main feature of the room. Dining room is divided into two sections/levels. Lower section on the right is right next to the kitchen but both sections feature the same sound levels from the bar area. It's great if you are going for a clubby vibe but not so good to have a chat with friends.On to the menu: most of the dishes are cooked in Chef John DeLucie's wood-burning open grill, tribute to the Argentinian cuisine. Besides the main menu there is also a three-course family style option for the whole table at $45/pp. Also the pre-theater, three-course prix-fixe for $35/pp.We started our meal with the Portuguese Octopus, Wood-charred beets and the sea scallops. All very good but beets were the best and scallops were sadly overpowered in a very spicy broth. Mains included Spiro's Spaghetti, Pork Chop, Duck Breast, Leg of Lamb and Chicken under-a-brick. Again all very good but the chicken felt somewhat undercooked and lacked the usual crispy skin of a bricked chicken.We skipped the dessert in place of digestives. Nice selection of brandy, Armagnac and cognac options. Overall food certainly worth a second trip but loud sound level and rough-around-the-edges service will be the decisive factor.Enjoy!",1,0,1,Sebastian S.,"New York, NY",88,103,248

Surprisingly, the place was pretty crowded, but we were able to grab a table.This review is a bit of an odd one for me because I feel like this place did a lot of things right, but the meat entrees just did not impress.We started off with an order of the burrata. The burrata was good--definitely one of those dishes that stands out on its own, and this was no exception. Though I wish it had some more crisps with it.For my main course, I went with the lamb leg. Though it was cooked perfectly and the puree it was served with was fantastic, I just felt that the meat was not nearly as flavorful as I was expecting--it really did not carry much flavor at all.My friend's dish--the duck--also again was cooked perfectly and melted in your mouth, but still lacked some serious flavor.I don't know if this kitchen doesn't believe in salt or seasoning, but it definitely did not come across in our entrees.We ordered a side of Brussels sprouts as well, and they were also very good.Overall, this place definitely has a nice energy to it and our waitress was super friendly and attentive. I felt like some of the pricing was a little heavy-handed--but that's expected from a hotel restaurant.

The team spring into action and had everything ready to go and set up within minutes. To make things stickier, there was a blizzard that kept all beer from being delivered, so we were working with wine-only for our event.We had a separate space set up with an open floor in minutes, and wine and food followed in a blink.

The sliders and fries were a hit- and several people mentioned how great the event turned out and I attribute all the work to this team.We cut the group off after our team hit a certain amount, and completing our bill and closing things out (Even while I was on a train home) was easy as pie.A hat's off to everyone on staff - this was an incredible group who did whatever it took to make their customers happy.  I whole-heartedly recommend the food, the service, the people and the ambiance - five stars!",4,1,1,Heather H.,"Jersey City, NJ",440,341,1

Space is large with a bar and various seating areas. It has a nice size private area where the after-brunch party was held.Pre fixe brunch menu included avocado toast, Greek yogurt and a main course. Everyone at my table chose fried chicken over waffle while one person tried the smoked salmon scramble. Not sure if orange juice, soda and coffee was included but we got plenty of those flowing. The toast was good with lots of avocado. The yogurt was not bad. While the waffle was quite good and the chicken was very tender, the chicken skin was not crunchy at all. Service was attentive.

2.0,2/12/2018,"Came here recently for brunch during NYC Dining week with a friend. My rating reflects my experience: pretty meh food, nice decor, and fairly annoying service from the hostess. Re the hostess: we made reservations for 11am, and it was mildly comical just how strict they insisted on sticking to that. Because of our schedule that day, we called ahead to see if we could either move our reservation up, or later, and the response was that they were overbooked that day, and we would have to keep our existing time. On top of this, she also threw in that if we didn't show up exactly then, they would have to give up our table (interesting to toss that in after I just demonstrated I am responsible enough to call ahead and confirm a reservation). When we arrived about 15 minutes early, the place. was. practically. empty. And yet, after waiting around at the hostess stand for a few minutes while nobody came by, we finally walked further into the restaurant, found a staff member who then flagged down the AWOL hostess, at which point she came and let us know that they would not seat us until 11am EXACTLY. And so, we waited in the lobby area and made a point to wait until she got us. At 11:10.I'm not going to knock a place purely based on the performance of one employee, and our server was very nice and fairly attentive. That being said, it was annoying that for a place that when we sat down, wasn't in the weeds or anything close, they were horrible at timing bringing out our food. We would get the next course when it was clear we weren't done with the previous course, which is annoying AF. The food itself was fine, but nothing stand out, and the decor was nice. We got the fried chicken & waffles (interestingly, bone-in, which I didn't expect), the eggs in purgatory (bit like shakshuka), the California bowl, & the bread pudding (a weirdly icy cinnamon ice cream). I really just didn't get the service and when your food doesn't do much to make up for it, well, two stars.",2,0,0,Peggy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",50,295,397

In a place that charges $2.00 for ice they always place a napkin under the drink.Finally, we overheard manager and staff complaining about a poor review.... fix the problem then.

It paired really well with the grilled bread and I would eat this every day if I could get away with it.)Entrees:- Slow roasted pork (This was more like pulled pork that was fried on one side to form a super crispy crust. It had the right amount of seasoning and the charred cabbage and mustard seeds balanced out the heaviness of the meat.)- Seafood stew (Light and savory broth that almost tasted like Thai curry without being spicy. Nothing was over cooked.)Dessert (ended up ordering the same thing again):- Coconut panna cotta (I honestly feel like panna cotta is pure fatty goodness, but this tasted light on its own and the thin slices of pineapple almost made this dessert taste healthy.)Overall, I was really happy with the meal and polished off plate after plate.

We both got the chicken and waffles which I was not a fan of. The waffle was great, but I found the chicken to be blah. The breading was thick and didn't have much flavor.

The kale salad with mushrooms and cheese was absolutely scrumptious and hearty. The chicken and waffles had wayyy too much breading. Waffles were soggy. Not much syrup overall so ask for extra. Since the bread pudding ran out, they offered a brownie which came out very odd. Served lukewarm. Big salt flakes on top. Candied walnuts. Vanilla ice cream scoop. Cherries (?) in a sauce on top. It seemed like they threw together whatever they could find. If that is part of their regular menu, I do not recommend the brownie. The ambiance is cool, but a little too loud when it is crowded.

3.0,1/26/2018,"Despite hearing mixed things about Chef John Delucie's skills, I decided to purchase his memoir from the bargain book section. I enjoyed the autobiography and decided that I wanted to sample some of his cuisine firsthand.  Many of his places, such as The Waverly Inn, had a reputation for being more about their scene than their culinary delights, so I was not sure what to expect when my friend and I visited his most recent venture, Bedford & Co.  The restaurant was located on the ground floor of the Renwick Hotel and possessed a masculine, old-school Manhattan vibe that made me feel as if I was back in the Mad Men era.  There was a small lounge area at the front of the long bar, and a large dining room lay just beyond that.  We were taken to a small, yet spacious, table in the back corner of the space, providing us with a complete view of the packed room.  We were both drawn to the same cocktail - the Zelda, a spicy and tart blend of Cimarron Blanco tequila, Cointreau, grapefruit, lime, and jalapeño.  Well, we both must have terrific taste, because we enjoyed the drink so much that we later wound up ordering a second round.  Despite our easy beverage selection, we spent a long time debating on our food strategy.  Finally, we decided to share two starters and get our own entrees.  Our first appetizer was the Wood-Charred Pennsylvania Beets, which were definitely too smoky for our liking.  The magenta beets had a slight crisp and a blackened hue on their exteriors.  The over-baked flavor was not pleasant, but the accompanying labneh yogurt and dill lightened it up a bit.  Seeds were also sprinkled over the plate for texture.  My companion and I also split the Burrata, which was served with a hazelnut crisp, coal-charred figs, and a light grape glaze.  The cheese was moist, creamy, and perfect.  The nutty crunch and sweet sauce were ideal companions, but the fig slices were way too small to provide an impact.For my main course, I selected the Market Fish, which happened to be Artic Char that evening.  It was served with chanterelles, a ginger mushroom broth, and crispy seeds and grains, giving it an Asian-flare.  The portion was not overly large, but the aromatic seasoning and rich broth further elevated the perfectly-prepared fish.  I also sampled my friend's Chicken Under a Brick, which was cooked rather well, but could have used some additional, basic seasoning.  However, I did enjoy the seasonal sides of maitake mushrooms, celery root puree, and chestnuts.  The poultry portion was also much more substantial than my seafood plate.Bedford & Co. was not flawless, but lived up to my anticipations and gave me some insight into John Delucie's culinary style.  Plus, the service was terrific, making it worthy of a 3.5-star rating.",4,0,0,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

I also had slightly mixed feelings about the food. We ordered the scallop appetizer and it was good but not exceptional and there were 3 pieces, which didn't make it easy to share. As for the main, that's where the meal shined for me. Get the Berkshire pork chop. I've never been much of a fan of pork chop but I decided to try it on a whim, and I definitely don't regret it. It had amazing and expected flavor combinations and ended up being, undoubtedly, the best pork chop I've ever had. For dessert, we got the brownie with ice cream. It says good, but once again not amazing. The brownie felt a little dry to me, but I'm a sucker for sweets so we still finished everything.Overall it was a good experience, I feel like I would incorporate the Berkshire pork chop into many future date nights but will probably opt to get drinks and appetizers elsewhere.",2,1,1,Bing G.,"Queens, NY",345,196,11

2.0,12/23/2017,"Had a reservation for 6 at 8pm on a Friday night. The first red flag for us should have been that the restaurant was less than half full at this time on a Friday night, days before Christmas. While all other NYC restaurants had long waits and no available reservations, you could just walk into Bedford & Co.It must have been amateur hour, as our waitress was awful with customer service. There is a $125 steak and $75 fish on the menu. These items must have been about to expire or the waitress could not hear over the loud music, but the waitress suggested these items, no joke, at least 15 times. It was incredibly annoyingsaying no thank you for the 10th time.Our appetizers arrived before any of our drinks or water arrived.. we ordered the artichokes for $15. The 1 cut in half artichoke, while delicious, was the size of a silver dollar. Certainly not worth $15!!The waitress was rude thorough out our visit, probably because we did not order her fish or steak. We all ordered a second round of cocktails and it took forever for them to arrive.We had a food and beverage credit form the hotel to use here. When we asked for the bill we also gave the voucher to the waitress. She returned with a bill without applying the discount. She said it was so we knew what to tip her.. Trust me, at this point, I know exactly what to tip. She then returned with the discounted bill and kept circling our table until I signed the bill.So rude and unprofessional here! I asked to speak with a manager who certainly did not care and at the conclusion of our conversation, with no solution provided, this manager had the nerve to say come by again.Bedford &Co, when you have to close your doors for the final time, please understand it's not the food (for the most part), rather it's the people working for you who are terrible and give you a bad reputation.",1,1,0,Amanda W.,"Hollywood, FL",0,3,1

3.0,12/17/2017,"Pretty much everyone comes here for the bottomless brunch, not the food. Read reviews and tried this through pulsd which saves you like $13...not a lot but hey, that goes to part of the tip so everyone is happy. We got the frittata and the steak and eggs, both of which were probably the saddest little foods items I've ever eaten in a restaurant, especially at those prices. The steak and eggs included 5 small cut up pieces of steak, 4 tiny fingerling potatoes, 2 medium size eggs, and literally 7 leaves of lettuce. The frittata looked like a shrunken microwaved egg dish, the most unimpressive frittata I've ever seen.The food tasted decent and the steak wasn't too fatty, but we both finished our meal and hopped on our phones to find somewhere to go get more food (mind you we are size 2 women). We took advantage of the bottomless mimosa, the prosecco and juices were a nice experience and pretty much the saving grace of this brunch. The nice thing about the prosecco is that they pop the bottle in front of you and leave it tableside which means they don't cheap out on the alcohol and there's no risk of filling up on watered down sugar drinks (no bucket but the prosecco is served cold; you run through it within the hour so it's not a problem).The food came out relatively quick (we ordered right when we sat down given we had already been waiting a while to be seated) and the server was nice and attentive when we could find her and flag her down (which was tough, as she didn't come to check on us otherwise), but it was a pain to flag her down for basics like ketchup and salt and pepper which should've come with the food or at least offered. The host station was a bit of a mess as we ended up having to wait 15-20 min past our reservation time to get seated despite many empty tables, and there were 5 parties behind us, all with the same reservation time, even more irritated at the slow service.A star for easy-to-get- last minute reservations, a star for the bottomless prosecco, and a star for ambience / ability to accommodate large parties. Overall, however, not worth $29, even for bottomless. I won't be returning and don't recommend getting the pulsd deal. Interestingly, they ring up the deal as $33 on the bill (which it really should be at most), not the $45 cost of the deal, so it seems like either pulsd is upcharging or the restaurant is pocketing a little on the side...whatever, skip this unless you really need to find boozy brunch in this area.",0,0,0,Bek B.,"New York, NY",2,21,3

We ordered the salmon benedict, steak and eggs, chicken and waffles and the salmon scramble. Overall the food was delicious but the potion sizes were just ok. Most of the dishes came with home fries except for the chicken and waffles.With brunch we did a bottomless mimosa special that comes as a 'do it yourself' mimosa which I thought was different. It comes with a large pitcher of prosecco that gets refilled as it's finishes and on the side you get 3 different fruit juice concentrates (mango, passionfruit and blood orange). The flavors were great. I believe you get 1.5 hours of unlimited drinking which is enough for most. The service was nice and friendly and the place was packed on a Saturday afternoon.I would describe the ambience of the restaurant as cosy, with dim soft lighting and comfy seating.

So you're telling me, this restaurant can't simply move one table setting to another table?  She then told me she didn't want to ""COME AT ME"" tonight.  Very classy.  Needless to say I think the training of the host staff leaves a lot to be desired.  I've worked in restaurants before, and I've been a host before, and that is not how you handle this situation.  You're supposed to accommodate a guest, whenever possible. The manager and our waitress were very nice and accommodating, food and drinks were good.  But having the situation with the host in the beginning of the night, left a bad taste in our mouths for the rest of the evening and we won't be returning.",4,0,0,Casey C.,"New York, NY",0,3,0

The ambiance is dark, and has a nice casual elegant appeal, probably because it is part of the Renwick Hotel. Our server both times was very attentive and approached us as soon as we sat down. The coffee isn't the greatest, but for breakfast, the food was above average. We got the rye buttermilk pancakes, avocado toast, and an egg plate, which was served with bacon, toast and home fries. The pancakes were pretty good, but I did not taste anything unusual about the batter. But, they were light and fluffy and served with fresh berries.  The avocado toast was a little disappointing. The toast was very burnt and while the avocado mash was very ripe, it was a little over salted. Lastly, the eggs were good, but the best part were the potatoes. They were salty and fried perfectly. Overall, I would definitely come back here because there are not too many nice places to sit back and enjoy breakfast in the area that isn't a dinner or bagel shop, no one rushes you out and you can have a good meal.",0,0,0,Carmella C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,34,51

4.0,9/17/2017,"My favorite thing about Bedford hands down is the feeling you get when you walk in--it's like you just walked into a 70's era bachelor pad styled for a husky, bearded man. I mean that in the best way possible. I think it's great. But anyway the food is great too, I'll get to that. Everything here is surprisingly top-notch. I highly recommend the burrata, the pork belly, the octopus and the sun shrimp appetizers. I know--that's like everything on the menu. Get all of them, get some of them, just try it--they really won't disappoint you. Also loved the avocado toast because it was covered in massive heaps of salty avocado, but let's face it--it's 2017, avocado toast is easier to get in NYC than water, so save that space in your tummy for better stuff. I got the Chicken under a Brick for my entree, as per the server's recommendation. The chicken was moist, and the star of the show was definitely the crispy layer of skin. It was a tad bit salty, but the dish is worth the extra sips of water. Some of my dinner companions got the pasta and I must say--they looked fantastic. The pasta looked very fresh, and the portion was hefty. Great dinner, heightened with animal felted rugs and dim, woodsy textures--what's not to enjoy?",1,3,2,Josephine Z.,"Queens, NY",787,445,182

My waffle, which came out 5 minutes after my boyfriend got his, was extremely undercooked and when I sent it back, the bartender/waitress/hostess came back and told me it wasn't undercooked, that that's the way Bedford makes it. However my boyfriend's waffle was cooked thoroughly and he said it was actually quite good. When we mentioned that to her, she asked him if he had already eaten it. It had already been about 15 minutes since he received his and the portions are very small, so he was already done with his at that point. She then told us he should have sent his back. Why in the world would we send a perfectly cooked waffle, that we ordered, back?! I'm not sure this woman should be working in customer service at all, and the cooks need to be more consistent.

We have a guest in a wheelchair and the two hostesses I spoke to on the phone and met in person were super friendly and helpful. We really felt welcomed and they went out of their way to help us feel comfortable with our accommodation request. They have a service elevator that can help wheelchairs/strollers from street level to lobby and to restaurant level. The elevator is well-lit, easy to operate, clean, and comfortable (no fancy decor but does the job). Remember to enter from Renwick Hotel. May need to get hotel front desk or restaurant hostess to access elevator.

3.0,3/22/2017,"Had a pre-Stella (most disappointing blizzard in a hot minute) feast here last week with two friends. We shared a variety of appetizers: The fresh Burratta with pomegranate seeds, speck, and a pistachio crust. Delicious (which I can say about most cheese) but the pomegranate seeds added a nice citrus burst as well as the pistachio chips that tasted like a cheese like twill. The hand-cut beef tartare - some of the best and freshest I've had in a hot minute. The bite of the horseradish makes it stand out from your average run of the mill raw beef dish. And lastly six east coast oysters that I can't really rave about or justify why they cost $21. But my friend wanted them. To be frank, I would be just fine with a $1 oyster from somewhere else because I personally can't tell the damn difference.For my entree I went with the Colorado Lamb Leg served with a quince and cognac glaze and a side of roasted brussels sprouts with walnuts. I loved the cognac glaze and it added a great amount of a subtle sweet dimension. But the lamb that I ordered Medium was very rare. I also don't order Lamb leg that often but this was borderline something that I wasn't sure if I could even make myself eat so I swapped a piece of lamb for a piece of my friend's Hanger steak that she begged for it to be borderline bleeding and freshly slaughtered. Hers was definitely more palatable. Chewy as all flank steak is but definitely cooked to a temperature I felt more comfortable with. Also, the bearnaise sauce it was accompanied with was phenomenal. My third friend ordered the squid ink spaccatelli with chilli, basil, and nduja sausage. Spaccatelli is like a very long and thick elbow noodle. It was good but not something I'd dig in for seconds or thirds to sample. Favorite portion of the evening was probably desert and the wine but even that was still just alright. The Cotes Du Rhone was great. The carrot cake was good but slightly dry. Their warm brownie with ice cream - good but not jaw dropping. For being such a pricey restaurant I wasn't completely blown away with their food but I was satiated respite not feeling too hot and having a stomach ache later in the evening. Come for the ambiance, order a drink and an app, get the fries, those were actually pretty great.

5.0,2/15/2017,"I was debating between 4 and 5 stars here but I think my one nitpick is not worth taking the star away.I was there for Valentine's dinner last night.  I had booked about a week ago without reading reviews and then, before we went, I decided to read them.  Needless to say, I was worried after reading all the negative comments on the service and regretted booking this restaurant.Happy to say that those worries were not warranted and the service was great.  Sort of glad I didn't read the reviews before booking, honestly.I don't doubt that the bad reviews on service actually happened, but my experience wasn't consistent with them.  I saw comments about there not being enough staff...there was a ton of staff last night.  Maybe it was because it was Valentine's day?  And my server and everyone else were super friendly, unlike what I read in other reviews.  Very nice vibe in the place.  One example - there is a little display that shows the different parts of a cow that me and my wife were discussing....our server and a chef noticed us staring and took a second to explain a little about the cow.  I thought that was a nice touch.  The service was also prompt and attentive...they brought out food and drinks at a good pace for us.The food was very good.  We had steak and lobster entrees.  The vegetables that came with the lobster were actually better than the lobster.  The foie gras appetizer was awesome.  These were all part of the valentine's day prix fixe menu.My only nitpick - the tables were a little too close to each other.  The separation was so small that I almost thought we were at a 4 seater with two other people when we got to our table.  BUT...once you are seated, it feels as if you are alone with your date so it wasn't bad.  I'm being picky.  The place has a decent level of music so it's not like you are listening to other people's conversations.Highly recommend.  Hopefully the improved service is a permanent upgrade rather than me getting lucky, but I'll definitely be back.  We were very pleased.",1,0,1,Ken P.,"Fort Lee, NJ",0,7,0

I've never encountered waitstaff at any of his establishments that didn't behave like they were doing you a huge favor by bringing you your food. It's a huge turnoff and really ruins the experience.

2.0,12/27/2016,"I was happy to find Bedford was open for a pre-fixe dinner on Christmas as my mom and brother were in town and we wanted to go out to eat. The pre fixe was $65 and had a great range of offerings, so we were excited.We had a reservation and were seated immediately, and the restaurant was quite busy as was the bar. We ordered cocktails to start - two moscow mules and an espresso martini. The moscow mules arrived and we were told the espresso martini (for my mom) would be out shortly. FIFTEEN minutes later and still no martini, even though we were the table closest to the bar and had asked our waiter twice what was going on. Finally after another 5-10 minutes my mom's martini arrived and we were able to cheers and then order our dinner. The mule was delicious, but we were now a bit put off by the wait for my mom's drink and unapologetic waiter.My brother also picked out a bottle of wine from their list - a 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon - and when the bottle arrived, it was a 2013. Instead of telling us they did not have our selection, the waiter tried to pass off the bottle as what we had ordered, until my brother asked to see the bottle. A sneaky move like this when we are paying $185 for a bottle of wine (a Christmas treat for us) is just unacceptable. Had we been told upfront our selection was not available, fine - but dishonesty is not.The food was seriously delicious and almost made the service forgivable. I recommend the beef tartare appetizer, chicken under a brick entree, and fire roasted potato side dish. The pork chop, NY strip, and burrata deserve honorable mentions. I headed to the restroom after dinner and almost collided with a server who was joking around with another server by the waiter station. She essentially jumped backwards without looking and I had to dodge her - she then continued laughing with her coworker and did not apologize for almost body slamming me. Dessert was the rye brownie which was okay (the vanilla gelato topping was better than the brownie), and when we were leaving, the hostess was nowhere to be found and after waiting five minutes we dove into the coat room ourselves to retrieve our belongings. She returned as we were doing this and laughed, saying ""We're not very good with coat check, ha ha"". Super, thanks.If there is an option for delivery/takeout for this restaurant - I recommend it.

They have a good happy hour so it was crowded but it was a good group of people. The bar tender was nice as well. I did notice that the staff was a bit stressed out. I liked the 70s decor though. The Classic Rock music blasting was an odd choice though. We were seated on the upper level which was fine, the seats were very comfortable. The waitress came right away to take our drink orders. We asked her to come back, she seems a bit flighty. We ordered a bottle of Pinot. A blond woman who seemed to be the manager comes by with two glasses of wine after a bit of a wait. We thought it was weird but we were busy deciding what to order. The waitress comes back apologizing every other sentence. she seemed very nervous and hyper. We placed our order and waited quite a while for our apps. When they finally arrived I asked about our bottle. She had put it in as two glasses. She said she would take it off the bill. We are waiting for our dinner and she comes over and asks if we want dessert. I said ""We haven't even had our dinner yet."" The other diners were also saying the service was bad. The food was good. I wish there was more choice but I liked the Hangar Steak I got. When we got the bill I was shocked that there is a $30 charge for two glasses of wine. The waitress said the manager told her she couldn't take it off and to not give her a tip. I thought that was ridiculous and called her over. She starts arguing with me that we drank the wine. I said we ordered a bottle and thought it came from it. She just kept saying we got extra glasses and I was pissed. She said she'd ask her manager but she just yelled at the waitress.

2.0,11/28/2016,"I'm not sure why I had really high hopes for this place but I did. The interior looked very nice, they had an open kitchen design, walking in they have a full bar and a nice waiting area. I booked a reservation the day before because it was super close to work. I came here with a friend to catch up so we ordered the oysters to start with. We had them served chilled but they also have the option to wood fire them. They only have one option of oysters to choose from which seems a little weird not to have both east and west coast but that was fine because the oysters seemed like regular oysters, just very over priced. I ordered the squid ink spaccatelli and my friend ordered their rib eye steak which was a special of the night. The squid ink had nduja, chili, and basil sauce. I was scared the chili's was going to make it spicy but it didn't. The squid ink didn't blow me away at all. It was a very run of the mill dish. My friends steak dish however when she asked for medium rare it came out basically burnt on all the edges and a little bloody in the center. Usually when this happens it is because the steak wasn't prepared at room temperature which seems very offsetting. I ordered the moscow mule which I really enjoyed.

4.0,9/24/2016,"This is in The Renwick Hotel. 40th Street between Lexington and Park Avenue. A lot closer to Lexington Avenue. Space- Not as big as I thought it would be. It's a pretty small space. When you walk in, the host stand is right in front and there's a nice lounge section onto the right side. They have a nice elongated bar. What I thought was a really nice touch was that beginning of the bar, close to the host stand, that bar section is for the handicap. Very thoughtful and smart. Drinks- I had their Negroni $16 I liked how their Negroni had Hendricks in it already instead of another less valued gin. Food-Ordered there grilled octopus. Recommended by the bartender, but it's also my favorite appetizer. A little salty, but still delicious. Also has the broccolini. It was very bitter and smokey. I like the smokey, but wayyy too bitter. Service- sat at the bar. Bartender was exceptional. Very attentive and informative about the menu. Crowd- everyone here seems to be in their mid 20s-40s range. Good spot to eat solo, with a friend, or on a date.Honestly- I think anyone would have a better time at the bar than an actual table. Depending what your kind of fun is. This is just from my judgment. I barely spoke to the bartender, but just from the scope of things. He was so attentive and seemed fun.

Years ago, it used to be Domenico's and then Fagiolini.The restaurant is attached to a hotel, and attracts a big crowd - mix of business people, hotel guests and neighborhood crowd.I can only review the bar and I must say that the bartender was very unfriendly, and the bar menu had nothing on it for sharing with groups - extremely limited menu. No bowls of complimentary nuts or chips. $15 glasses of chardonnay. This is a nice place in a nice neighborhood, but  it's not the Plaza or Palace or Waldorf - they need to bring it down a notch and make it more happy hour friendly, instead of trying to be so shi shi.",0,0,0,Anne B.,"New York, NY",70,15,0

The order also came out without any attention to detail - we had requested no toast/gluten and they looked annoyed when they brought out our plates with toast and we requested it removed. The eggs were just okay and when we asked for the check, another woman came by to chat us up. Very inconsistent overall.",3,0,0,Shradha A.,"Chicago, IL",703,2223,207

I met a bunch of friends here for dinner and they have a nice seating area up front where you can wait on a group without feeling awkward and in the way. The decor throughout is comfortable and cozy, like if you had a cool friend with a library room in his mansion. First off, service is spot on, attentive and knowledgable without being overbearing. The staff and chef took extra care to make sure anything I ordered did not have any sneaky meat in it as I am strict vegetarian.  I do however, love cheese and there is burrata on the menu, eat this if nothing else. Burrata speaks for itself. The beets were also delicious and were generously portioned, enough for the table to share. I had the gnudi as my main and though this looked smaller then the other mains, it was deceptively filling while being creamy and delicate. Topping all this off was cheesecake in a jar, a specialty that should not be missed. I walked away completely satisfied and happy.

3.0,6/5/2016,"I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars on this place.  I went once for a light dinner and once for brunch.  Both times were above average food and below average service.  The ambiance is super cool.  When we arrived for a light dinner after some small bites for happy hour, we asked if we could sit at the bar.  There were a few stools open.  We sat down and waited a good 5 minutes before anyone even came over and it's not a huge bar.  Once he did come over, he was very friendly though.  We got some drinks and asked what he liked for dinner.  He recommended the octopus but since we had octopus for happy hour, we took a pass.  The steak tartar was very good though.  It had horseradish in it, which you would think would overpower the dish, but it actually just added a kick without killing it.  I'd definitely get that again.  The peas and carrots was surprisingly good.  We were looking for somewhere to go the following day for brunch with friends and I overheard the bartender saying that they had brunch on Saturdays.  I asked about that and he said they always had brunch on Sundays but they were starting Saturdays that following morning.  Score!  He even gave us a menu so I snapped a pic for the group of people I was joining the following day and they all said it looked great and we should try it.Fast forward to the next morning at 11...five of us met for brunch.  For starters, the menu that I was shown the day before was not the menu that they had.  It wasn't like one or two things were different but the entire menu.  That was a let down as one of the reasons we wanted to go was to get the bagel and lox.  I asked if we could still get that and they said no, which is fine but we were explicitly told only 14 hours before that they would be the menu.  Oh well.  So  three of us ordered mimosas and two ordered the bloody mary.  When I tell you it was 20 minutes before the bloodies came, that is not an exaggeration.  I actually looked at the clock.  Two people finished their mimosas before the bloodies even came.  I could see the guy going back and forth between the back and bar and granted, I don't know what he was doing but there were other people just standing there and no one even started making the drinks.  I was just so confused as to what was going on and no one came over to say sorry for the wait, or explaining some of the stuff to make the drinks was in the back or any reason that two drinks would take 20 minutes.  Then he finally starts making them and I can see and in the middle he leaves again.  I digress; once those arrived we promptly all ordered another round cause we thought it would take 20 minutes again but after that it was actually fine.  I will say the bloody was very, very good.  I highly recommend ordering it.  It didn't taste like V8 or something.  It really had a depth of flavor.  We got some oysters, which were tasty.  We also tried the avocado toast with eggs and it was solid.  Someone got the trout Caesar and he really enjoyed it.  I split the burger with my husband and it is a super awesome burger.  Again, service was lackluster but food is above average.  I'd go back.",1,0,0,Samantha H.,"Chicago, IL",216,561,204

1.0,5/1/2016,Was not impressed. Came with friends on a Thursday night. The interior is dark and clubby but cozy. Staff was friendly. The starters and entrees were tiny. For starters we had:-octopus - you can't really mess up octo but it came out pretty burned drenched in sauce to mask the fact that it was burnt. I can understand a bit charred but this was ashy. In today's health conscious world people do not want burnt food which can cause cancer. It's just plain unacceptable to serve burnt food. That just means you half assed it. -tartar - nothing special. A bit on the dry side. Have definitely had better -fluke crudo - missed some acidity and umami to it. -squid ink pasta  - nothing special and on the salty side -lamb shoulder - very misleading. The entree looked more like an appetizer than an entree. It was tender but the size was tiny. Dessert was a Banana whisky something but it was basically Banana ice cream that tasted weird.

4.0,4/16/2016,"John Delucie of Waverly Inn brings Bedford & Co to the Renwick Hotel. I read an article that described the decor as ""industic""- industrial yet rustic. Is there such thing as modern rustic?The chef was inspired by the wood cooking and design of Buenos Aires. The lunch menu at first glance seems quite heavy: mac and cheese, hanger steak, spaghetti. However, there are many wood-grilled seafood and salad options. I know you're probably avoiding carbs, but the wild mushroom toast is worth cheating for. The fresh-grilled veggies are all delicious, and everything is simple and nicely executed. I had a lovely salad with juicy rotisserie chicken topped with poached egg- it was the special of the day and delicious. The price point is pretty high so this should be reserved for a nice sit-down fancy lunch. Staff and chef are all lovely.

Well, what I received was essentially an appetizer portion.  It wasn't just small.  It was barely child sized.  Though this dish was actually delicious, needless to say I was left quite hungry.  To be fair, the rest of my table did receive normal sized portions.  But after eating what my friends would share with me, and getting dessert, I had to stop for pizza on my way home.",1,0,0,Marina M.,"Manhattan, NY",2,41,2
