2.0,4/12/2019,This restaurant is definitely for the tourists of the world. It's very loud the food is just OK but not great. We also had absolutely awful rude service. If you enjoy paying $16 for a small glass of wine and have the waiter  act as if you're a pain in the neck this might be your place.,0,0,0,Bonnie B.,"Manhattan, NY",3,33,0
4.0,3/23/2019,Nice little neighborhood spot with great French onion soup and cheese puffs. Wine list is solid too. Great place to get away from the Midtowny/Times Square vibe that infuses most of the other restaurants down this way.

4.0,2/10/2019,"Great food at a great location. Not too far from Times Square, this place has a prix-fixe menu between 5-7pm. Far from being a touristic spot, this French restaurant with reasonable prices is highly recommended. Seating is comfortable and you can actually have a conversation in this place.

4.0,2/9/2019,"This restaurant caught my eye from outside, went to check the menu before I walked in and it already looked great. The decor inside was fantastic which gave you a French Bistro feel. Our waiter was very nice and the service was great. I started with their Manhattan cocktail which was very good. We had calamari and salmon tartare for appetizers, both great. For my entrée I had the truffle Mac n' Cheese which was succulent. Overall great restaurant.",0,0,0,Leon K.,"Laval, Canada",0,6,0
2.0,2/8/2019,"It was SO mediocre. The cheese fondue tasted like it was diluted with cream, it did not taste like solely cheese/ wine/ liquor as it supposed to be. I have eaten ALOT of fondue in my life and made it many times, this was not traditional fondue. The menu also mentions nothing about added cream, but there was something off. The mussels had a nicely flavored sauce, and my beet salad wasn't bad, that was the meals saving grace. Although the mussels had a tasty broth, the French fries that came with were quite flavorless and soggy. Luckily, I had the stale breadbasket to soak up the sauce. Another person in the party ordered a cheeseburger, it was delivered so rare that it was almost raw. I love a rare burger, this was raw meat. Sent it back, came back raw again. Sent it back second time, came back totally well done, charred to a crisp. On top of all that, our waiter seemed to have a bad attitude the entire time, despite us truly doing nothing to upset him. When we asked for the check as we needed to make a show, he said, ""yeah, everyone is trying to make a show right now"".",0,0,0,Heather D.,"New York, NY",64,16,0

My friend and I enjoyed the $32 prix fixe brunch menu including one mimosa, app and main. We shared all plates and they were great - gougeres (melt in your mouth), fresh mesclun salad, tasty burger on brioche bun and eggs florentine (up charge for florentine rather than benedict).

3.0,1/1/2019,"New Year's Day. Brought friends here based on nice brunch experiences. The restaurant was fairly empty, but the music (pop/rhythmic background noise) was far too loud for the place.  Service was slow and inattentive. Appetizers and cocktails were decent. For my main course, I ordered the filet mignon flambé. It arrived, not flambéed with a little dish of cold sauce (""cognac peppercorn sauce"")  to pour over my 39 dollar steak. I sent it back and when it arrived again it was piping hot but the sauce tasted not at all of cognac and quite a lot of store bought beef base. Edible but disappointing for the price and ambiance. We skipped dessert and won't be back.",0,0,0,Thomas L C.,"San Francisco, CA",198,8,4
3.0,12/30/2018,"Place was close to the theater for our dinner. What started good kind of went south for awhile until we noticed that our waiter had about a dozen tables to himself. So, the food took over 45 mins to come out after ordering. Paella could have used more salt and seasoning. Fettuccine came without the chicken and my son waited until they cooked it up separately. Hubby loved his beef, but I thought it needed some salt after a taste. His ""Pinot noir"" tasted more like a Chianti and they took it back. I only had a salad and you can't mess that up too much. So, while the service was slow, the bussers kept quite busy, the management failed in scheduling more wait staff for a busy, Saturday night. Especially during the Holidays where NYC is bustling with visitors. Shame on you! And to our waiter, we understand that it wasn't technically your fault for such delays.

Waited forever for food and it came out Luke warm, staff was unapologetic - they kept telling us it would be ""out in a moment"" my absolute pet peeve. Beouf Bourgingon was overseasoned and cold in the centre - it had probably over-reduced and reheated too fast.

On Sunday I did not have a good experience and thought it was an accident but then this week I realized it's the new normal. The restaurant was not busy and service was slow and I was often looking for the waiter. Well on both visits the Brussels sprouts were gross and cooked improperly and not at all caramelized ! I tried to avert this on my second visit and asked the waiter to make sure the Brussels sprouts were well caramelized, but he looked at me like I had four heads. Needless to say they came out limp looking and it was like they'd thrown them in the microwave. Their fries were soggy and not even that hot. I could go on, but I'm done with this place.

The complimentary bread was warm and paired perfectly with butter. Now, here comes the complaining. The branzino portion was tiny for the cost. When we entered the restaurant, we were ignored by the staff. It wasn't a busy Tuesday evening. The hostess was staring right at us, but she was on the phone with what seemed like a personal call. Once we were finally seated, it took awhile for the server to acknowledge our presence and take our order. Maybe because we were seated outside? In any case, once we got our food, we realized that we needed ketchup for our fries. We asked another server walking by. Never got the ketchup. Another guy walked by, so we hailed him down for some ketchup and refills on our water. He comes back with said ketchup and only refills one of our glasses. Had to stop him to ask him to refill my partner's empty glass as well. Everyone seemed apathetic, which is a shame because this place could be so great.",2,0,0,Elle K.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,207,593

After a 2 perciccso's my hamburger was received raw, I sent it back, took forever as they made a whole new one, that's nice, but kinda ruins eating together. My partner chicken burger is spicy as advertised, but just did not live up to a chicken anything. My hamburger had a flavorless , just not good taste. So I label it one of the expense hamburgers in NYC that you should steer clear of.

For dinner we had the beef bourbuignon ( short ribs ) which was tasteless; mushroom risotto with truffles-  a bit on the salty side and filet mignon sandwich ( on the set dinner menu ) - which surprisingly was very good. We also ordered 2 glasses of wine. The restaurant added gratuity on the bill automatically.

1.0,4/21/2018,"Overpriced but great food, until they change their ""matchstick"" fries to soggy fries that you can get at any run down diner.One particular waiter ruins this restaurant by providing his unwelcomed advice: ""Why do you want bread if you're having the burger? You won't have appetite for the burger."" and later neglecting the table by not filling water or bringing ketchup after having tried to signal for someone to come multiple times.I used to be a regular here until I was blatanly ignored while trying to be seated and, once seated, not given menus for 15 minutes while others who arrived after where seated and given menus.One time they had NO BREAD and served sandwich bread. They said they had run out and it was the only thing they had and that all bakeries were closed at that time. Not paying their prices for the cheapest bread available. The blonde waitress is great, ask for her if you decide to go.The hostess is equally as unwelcoming by asking for a justification as to why they should remove their undeserved AUTOMATIC tip.Go to their 70th and Lexington location instead where you will be welcomed with a smile, provided excellent service and exquisite food.",1,1,1,José D.,"Manhattan, NY",280,11,2
1.0,4/20/2018,"If you want to pay for dinner in order to not be seated, not given menus, have the waiter tell you you shouldn't eat bread because you ordered a burger, and have an imposed 18% gratuity on your check when you're a party of two, then this place is for you. As a frequent Cognac customer, I wanted to avoid writing a public review; however, after having been ignored after emailing the management and telling them personally about my experience, I felt it was necessary to write it on a public platform.Pro: The food is excellent (5/5) and location is unbeatable. Con: The wait staff is horrible (1/5). My boyfriend and I usually order two filet mignon burgers. I once asked a waiter for bread after having ordered a burger to which he replied ""what?? You're having a burger. You shouldn't eat bread"". I gave it another chance. Another time my boyfriend and I (party of two) had had an 18% gratuity imposed on our bill after having come numerous times. We asked for it to be taken off to which they agreed. Despite this experience, I gave Cognac a third chance. My boyfriend and I decided to have dinner here and stood at the podium waiting to be seated for 10 minutes. The hostess completely ignored us and we ended up having to ask to be seated at a certain table. The waiter that had previously imposed the gratuity saw us and deliberately ignored us - he sat a party that was standing behind us. The hostess said yes, but never gave us menus (she continued to seat other parties and serving them water, bread, and menus) while ignoring us. We ended up sitting at the table we requested and waited another 10 minutes for someone to give us menus, water, and bread. Eventually we got fed up and left. This place should not be in business - their attitude indicates they don't value customers and just want to strip them of their money while taking advantage.

The cheese was good, kind of difficult to get through. We also ordered the gougeres, which were fine - definitely one of the profit leaders, but warm cheese puffs were too tempting to resist. We shared the filet mignon burger (really tasty, super soft texture but part of me dies grinding up filet for burger) and the chicken paillard (boring, but edible.)

I got the beef bourguignon which had a really bad flavoring to it.

In the evening it's a bit more relaxed, we were conversing over a couple of tables, general chit chat, where are you from, etc. I met a chef from Milan from the Four Seasons Hotel chain and he said his Flambé Steak was very good, I took that as a stamp of approval to give it a try at some point, his friend was from Spain, but is now living in NYC, and showing him the town. The host started us all in conversation, and he had a I'm hosting a party welcoming going on.The food was very good, although I had soup and salad, these simple things can get messed up. The salad was more healthy greens, and the soup was a perfectly made onion. For desert I had the souffle, it was the best desert I had during my trip, everything else was so so.I did come back for lunch, had a tasty cheeseburger, although the food runner switched them up, as my friend got the rarer one, however mine still was pink. So maybe if you're doing the same burgers and like them done differently, choose a different cheese or none, but do something different. Again, not tragic, they didn't ruin it which is most important. We had the same server as I did before, he's very good and definitely a pro at his job. The hostess that was on during the day could use a few lessons from the host in the evening. Certainly, no time to being entertaining, but being even a little friendly would be a consolation.They do give a discount to those staying at the Manhattan Club, you will need your room key to verify, it 20%.

I know a bit cliche but it has never failed. It's always a bit different from other places. This place had a very aromatic one which had a bit more herbs and less garlic.

The worst was the complimentary bread (the crusts honestly tasted burned) and the duck salad, which came with 3 slices of duck and a whole lot of overdressed, overly sour greens with some candied walnuts sprinkled sparingly throughout. The escargots offered as an appetizer were very good and quite filling, My boyfriend had steak frites, which was very standard fare, nothing fantastic. Our dessert was actually decent; I loved the presentation and the flavor pairings for the chocolate cake, which was rich and neatly countered with a couple of orange slices and a very palate cleansing coconut ice cream.

Today at lunch, I entered the restaurant with my colleagues and waited while the hostess chatted on the phone and addressed a worker who was there to fix something. No acknowledgement of any of us. Finally, a nice waiter from within the room noticed and set us up outside. Enter our server Bladimir. Overall, he was not bad, but seemed in a rush. I think he interpreted his ""hurried"" approach as competence, but it came off as rude and off-putting. The food - a salmon burger, beef burger, salad, and onion soup were all fine, but not outstanding. The wine was good. Finally, as an employee of a certain corporation, I get a significant discount at this restaurant. I added my business card to the check folio and he whisked it away without even asking ""is this all set?"" (Or some other cordial waiter-speak.) I had to go inside and ask him to run it again and apply the discount. I'd rather have a server pay more attention to the diners, than to the process of getting orders in and out of the kitchen. Because I was with good friends, I got passed all of these things and feel grateful that a) I can afford to eat out, and b) I have friends to share it with.

We stopped in for dinner and a few drinks before the Broadway play  Blackbird, with Jeff Daniels (the restaurant was visible from our hotel room).

We ordered the fondue, cheese puffs, and shared the prix fix deal. The cheese puffs were scrumptious, crisp and light filled with flavor. The fondue wine flavor was stronger than expected, but delicious and who doesn't love a basket of fresh French bread. The prix fix meal came with salad, entree and dessert. The entree we chose was croquet Monsieur, ham and cheese baked into a light crispy bread. A few ladies from Milwaukee were sitting on the inside of the restaurant while we were outside dining and waved to us. The waiter was nice enough to open the doors  so we could speak. How sweet. They even shared their bottle of Champagne with us and we returned the favor. My friend and I shared a glass of cognac which the waiter suggested, being I am mostly a craft beer/ pub kinda gal.

The lobster bisque was very good. It tasted quite smooth and buttery and had a lovely blend of flavors. The mushrooms were a nice addition. My husband had the cassoulet which was very good indeed. The flavors were separate and blended. I had the special which was paella. Again, the flavor of the mussels, chorizo, chicken and peas stood alone and were not overwhelmed by the saffron rice. Everything was delicious and I was pleased that the chicken was juicy and not dry. We shared a floating islands dessert which took me right back to my childhood but was better than my mother's rendition of the same. It was a light and fluffy meringue floating in creme anglaise and was an absolute delight. My husband, who is not a dessert guy at all dove right in and helped me to polish it off, as he kept enthusing about what an excellent dessert it was. I was pleased that it wasn't too sweet. We then had one of their wonderful flights of cognac and had one of the best cognacs we'd ever had. Another pleasant aspect to this brasserie is the fact that, unlike so many NYC restaurants, you can actually hear the person across from you!

1.0,3/10/2016,"Since it's only a block away from our home, my partner and I have dined here many times, usually with perfectly adequate results: nothing spectacular, but tasty enough, and always with a warm welcome from the evening manager and staff. Today, I made the mistake of popping in for a quick lunch. It's not only an entirely different crew, but an entirely different atmosphere. I was seated at a lovely open window table, and waited for a server, some water, some bread...and waited...and waited...and waited. When my server finally came, there were no preliminaries: no offer of a drink, no query as to my water preference, nothing. ""You look like you're ready,"" was the server's introductory greeting. Damn right, I'm ready, after all this time, I thought to myself; but being a gentleman, instead I was polite, smiled, and ordered: a chicken burger with Gruyere, and I asked if I could have spinach instead of French fries.Let's pause for a moment.I eat out often -- almost every day, in fact. And I have never, ever, been denied the request to substitute a side of fries with a burger (or even moules or steak frites) with either a salad or green vegetable which is the equivalent price to the fries if ordered a la carte. (In other words, if a different side is understandably more expensive than the fries, I don't ask to substitute.) It's not an unreasonable request, and it doesn't harm the ""integrity"" or composition of the burger or steak dish. More to the point, I've done it many times AT Brasserie Cognac, with the burger, moules, and steak. So, when I requested it today at lunch, I was taken aback when my server hesitated, and then said, ""Well, I can give you a SIDE of spinach."" I was annoyed at first, but then figured, what the hell: If the burger arrives with fries AND the spinach, I'll nibble on a frite or deux as a special treat, and pay for an additional side. The burger did NOT arrive with frites, only the spinach, so I thought, Ah, they've accommodated my not-unreasonable request. Unfortunately, they also ignored my request for Gruyere. Chalking this all up to an unfortunate but not disastrous experience, after I finished my burger sans frites and Gruyere, but avec spinach, I asked for the check. And I was livid to see that I had been charged for the additional side of that blasted spinach. Taking my check to the manager, I explained what had transpired, and that I had often substituted spinach or salad for fries at Brasserie Cognac. ""Oh, no,"" she replied, ""we NEVER do that."" Ok. It's one thing to screw up my order. It's one thing to screw me over on the check. But when you basically call me a LIAR, that's when things get messy. It's ridiculous enough that Cognac has a ""we don't substitute fries for vegetables"" policy at all -- the far superior Times two star-rated bistro two blocks away, Benôit, does -- happily. So does the far superior, legendary UWS bistro, Cafe Luxembourg -- happily. In fact, in all 20 years of my living and eating in Manhattan, so does every single restaurant at which  I've lunched or dined -- happily. And specifically, Brasserie Cognac has done so for me, multiple times -- happily. So while the ""policy"" itself is ludicrous, to call a repeat customer a liar is inexcusable. I suppose the manager on duty this afternoon is correct in one sense: ""Oh, no: we NEVER do that""?

4.0,8/10/2015,"I rarely eat French cuisine.. my favorite European food usually consists of Italian and Spanish, with some Mediterranean flavors as well. Occasional German/Austrian. But I checked out the Restaurant Week menu for Brasserie Cognac and it sounded very appealing..so my friend and I set up a lunch date. (The RW menu is the same for both lunch and dinner).Stepping through the front door, you get a feeling of a warm, and rustic interior. Host and wait staff are all inviting with smiling faces and some with awesome accents when they speak..lol There was seating outside, but my friend and I preferred the cool a/c inside on such a warm afternoon. There were floor-to-ceiling windows on either side of the entrance, so there was lots of natural light. Otherwise, the dining area would probably be a lot more dim. We were seated at a table right by one of the windows. - = Food = - For food, my friend and I pretty much got the same things, except for dessert. We both had the escargots for apps, and both had the hangar steak cooked medium rare for entrees, and for desserts, she had Peach Melba w/ vanilla ice cream and whipped cream and I had the Coconut Creme Caramel. The escargot was cleaned well and very tasty. They were cooked with garlic butter, which made the snails rich and fragrant. The hangar steak was delicious! The medium rare was SPOT ON, and the flavor was amazing! My steak was actually medium rare, bordering rare but no complaints there! The side of potatoes were yummy too! I usually don't care for potatoes, but these were very good! The desserts, we had mixed reviews. My friend's Peach Melba, it was so obvious that the peaches were from a can.. I expected better from a pricey French restaurant, even if it's only Restaurant Week. However, the vanilla ice cream, encased with whipped cream was delicious and a perfect ending to the meal. My coconut creme caramel was very underwhelming. Not much coconut flavor. But no big deal, the apps and entrees definitely delivered! All in all, a very good meal and dining experience! Food was delicious, service was attentive and our water glasses were refilled promptly, and the interior and ambiance was warm and comfortable. I will definitely be back to try some other dishes off the menu! I recommend Brasserie Cognac to anyone who wants to try a traditional French dining experience.

For me it was not about the .25 cents at all, it was the audacity of the staff to not accommodate my inquiry about the price difference or me asking for a large cup as I had purchased a large macchiato and wanted the extra room for more milk. They proceeded to attempt to embarrass me in front of the other patrons in the cafe.The icing on the cake and the biggest reason for my review is that the coffee was actually TERRIBLE the staffs terrible manners and the terrible coffee was so dissapointeing as I had chosen to go there in stead of Starbucks(in the same block) to support a local business.I regret this decision as going to this local business was an abusive experience as well as the product they are selling is sub par to any coffee in midtown I have had (I have worked in the neighborhood for years and this was the most bitter and gritty)",0,1,0,Arlin C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,6,1

The service, however, was abysmal. With three waiters working 4 tables of guests, you wouldn't think that providing napkins, cutlery, and coffee would be such an effort, but it seemed to be beyond the staff. Our breakfast arrived in this order (and this many different trips): The eggs, napkins, cutlery, bread basket, toast, cutlery (after a third desperate plea), and, after a little hiatus in attention, the orange juice. A woman wandering around seemed to be a manager of some kind, but she wasn't doing much that I could see. I kept wishing Gordon Ramsay would show up. I won't be back.

We ducked into Cognac to get out of the weather and relax.Cognac looks like a typical French Brasserie with a very small bar, and nicely decorated dining room. It is reminiscent of Paris. Dimly lit, the walls are decorated with black and white photos in the style of of Henri Cartier-Bresson. Some of them may be reprints of his work. The service at the bar is good and we were seated after having enough time for a cocktail.The menu is a standard Brasserie menu with some minor twists, and the wine list runs from modest to fancy. We went the modest route and ordered a simple Bordeaux Superieur - 2010 Greysac - for $55, a fair price.We started with Gougeres. A favorite snack of ours, which were just fine and simple. Maybe too simple, a little fresh thyme or some black pepper would have made them better. They were not bad, just plain.I had the filet mignon burger. The burger was cooked as I ordered it, and very good. The caramelized shallot puree was an excellent touch. The fries were crisp, not greasy.My wife ordered the chicken paillard  which was well executed, and topped with a fresh watercress salad.

Overpriced, nothing special, but the location is super-convenient.But today, Brasserie Cognac got permanently deleted from my list (shared with my assistant) of go-to restaurants. I work at home and live steps away. As such, for over three years Brasserie Cognac has been a fixture of my business lunch and breakfast schedule. But it's very much also a place where I meet clients for coffee in the late afternoon (when you could shoot a cannon through the empty dining room).Today, at 3 PM, I was told ""no coffee unless you order lunch"" by the (new) waiter. When I explained I'm a regular who does coffee here a couple of times a week and that it was by no stretch of the imagination lunchtime, he ""reported"" me to the manager, who reinforced the abrupt ""no coffee"" policy. When I politely told her (a bit incredulous to not be recognized, given rule #1 of running a restaurant is ""know your customers"") that I regularly and for years have taken late afternoon coffee here, she kept cutting me off and accused me of trying to start an argument. She did allow me to stay just this once - as a special favor.Whatever. No coffee, no recognition, all that attitude? Buh-bye Brasserie Cognac for coffee (and breakfast, and lunch).Oh - and can totally validate that other review about being locked out of the restaurant despite having a confirmed early morning breakfast reservation.

3.0,2/25/2014,Came here for NYC restaurant week with my boyfriend because I had this weird craving from duck confit out of nowhere. This is the only restaurant that has duck confit on restaurant week menu and serves the restaurant week options on Sunday. It makes picking restaurants much more easier.Appetizers: Cheese Puffs and Snails-- Cheeeeeese puffs are amazingly gooooooood!!! I love the pesto sauce in the snail dish. It was a great with bread.Entree: we both got duck confit. I was a little bit disappointed because it didn't remind me of the duck confit I had in France. The duck was too loose and lost the mouthfeel I was looking for in confit.Desserts: floating island and sorbet. My boyfriend loved the sorbet but I enjoyed the nice texture of the meringue island.,1,0,1,Lavi W.,"Plainsboro Township, NJ",37,193,6

Service was excellent all around, friendly. Evo was a great waiter with excellent suggestions on both food and wine. Outstanding wine list, in particular the wines by the glass!  We, of course had the wonderful cheese puffs, fondue (yummy, too big for two people to split). Do wish it came with more than just bread cubes to dip. Husband got the crab and avacado app. which he said was nice and refreshing. Entrees were the roast chcken, juicy great crispy skin, lamb, terrific and cooked perfectly med. rare, and really good mussles with terrific crunchy/salty frites. Besides steak, Evo recommended the lamb or scallops for me. He suggested lamb when he found out my daughter and I wanted the fondue. All portions were of good size and all came with sides and delicious sauces. To the people who complain about price, the flambe filet (looked fun prepared tableside, but had steak the night before) costs $35 (most expensive entree)  and comes with veggies, a starch and peppercorn sauce. That's a full meal. Compare it to Palm, where the smallest filet is $44 with no sauce or side and no show.Great coffee and excellent after dinner drink menu (recommended cognac was perfect and $10) The atmostphere is lovely, also, causual elegant chic.Sit in the back area, but by the window would be great people watching.

4.0,1/17/2014,"Definitely a great location for a pre-theater bite. Came here with my family and the food, overall, was good, but not exceptional. The most memorable dish was the endive and blue cheese salad (and I say this enthusiastically because it really was quite delicious). I'm personally a fan of smaller portions, but if 'bang for your buck' means quantity for you, then look elsewhere. While the scallops were flavorful, this dish could be considered on the 'lighter side' as it featured all of three whole scallops. Other dishes seemed to be heartier.  We were, however, pleasantly surprised by the dessert. I would make a late night return trip just to order the vanilla napoleon.

But the bill came to $300, which was ridiculous. And the surprising fact was that the service charge was included??? Seriously for 4 adults?Giving it 3 stars simply because the food was decent.

It was my winter ""Warm me up"" lunch quite a few times.  It includes mushrooms and is poured table side.  the croque monsieur (madam mot available) is good but not greatest. Literally, cheese on top a ham and cheese sandwich. I say this because its not even melted inside typically and the flavor is just not there. A little disappointed in that dish but there are others to tide you over. Lobster salad is light and refreshing dish, great for the summer. The tuna tarte is massive for an appetizer and includes a heaping of hunger in every bite...not subtle. Tomato tarte is perfect-light and flaky. Halibut dish is so good that you will clean your plate. Spinach avocado salad is fantastic of you add shrimp or grilled chicken. The chicken will be sorta shredded making it so much easier to eat.

2.0,1/14/2013,"My boyfriend and I visited this restaurant for my birthday. While we enjoyed our overall experience, there were a few issues that prevented me from giving this restaurant the full five stars. We went around 4:00 pm and there was absolutely no crowd so we were seated quickly. The inside of the restaurant was designed to look very elegant, but at the end of the day there was no forgetting you were in a bar. While the restaurant serves French food and has an upscale appearance, they play an odd hodgepodge of music that really ruins the ambiance. It feels odd to be looking at high end French cuisine while listening to Katy Perry and the Village People. The server who seated us was also a bit standoffish and dismissive. He asked if we wanted wine or beer more than once despite us explaining we did not want any. He also asked if I was ready to order, but when I said yes, he said he would give me a few more minutes and walked off as if he had not listened at all. Right after we ordered our food he disappeared and was replaced by another waiter. We did not see him again until we were leaving and realized he was still there working. While their ambiance and our initial service was very disappointing, their food was pretty delicious. We ordered an appetizer consisting of asparagus spears layered with a goat cheese cream on top of a small square of of puff pastry. There was also what they called a ""green sauce"" drizzled on the plate that tasted a little bland on its own, but really popped when eaten with the rest of the dish. As a garnish, they used a Parmesan tuile and it was also delicious when paired with everything else. The asparagus was a vibrant green color and perfectly cooked, and the goat cheese cream was light and not overwhelming.  For our entrees, my boyfriend ordered their Duck ""Parmentier"", a shepherd's pie using duck leg confit, and I ordered their sea scallops. The description of my boyfriend's dish sounded really delicious, but when I tried his it tasted much less complex than I expected, almost very one note, but was still delicious. My sea scallops came with chanterelle mushrooms, pumpkin purée, and an amaretto reduction. They were absolutely delicious. Every flavor complimented each other, however I only received three scallops. I feel that for almost thirty dollars they could have easily added at least one more scallop and a small salad of greens to give me a little more substance to my dinner. I also tasted some grit which leads me to believe they did not wash their mushrooms well enough before cooking them.After dinner we also ordered desserts. My boyfriend ordered the vanilla Napoleon and I ordered the floating cloud. Both were very good, but again I noticed the restaurant being a little cheap. My boyfriend's Napoleon tasted like they had put alcohol in the pastry cream, but we could not discern the flavor of the alcohol at all, just that it was present. My dish consisted of a poached meringue cloud floating on top of vanilla creme anglaise, but I did not see any vanilla bean in the anglaise. For the prices they charge I would expect my creme anglaise to be speckled with vanilla bean. Overall the food was delicious, but in my opinion did not warrant the prices charged. The service could have been much better and the ambiance does not suit a fancy dinner out. We spent over 100 dollars on two bottles of sparkling water, our appetizer, two entrees, and two desserts. We could have just as easily gone to a more fancy French restaurant and spent fifty dollars each on a prix fixe menu and received more courses of better quality food.

3.0,11/7/2012,"Cheese puffs: A little underwhelmed, to be honest. Not to say that they were bad, but they didn't seem too unique - Red Lobster has their cheddar bay biscuits, and these didn't seem too far off (and the cheddar bay biscuits come with your meal!). And I think they shortchanged us one. Probably better for my waistline anyway.Frisee aux Lardons salad: The salad was large - could almost be a lunch entrée for most people. The toast on top was definitely a high point - warm, crispy, seemingly deep fried in butter and served right after. My taste buds loved the toast, but if I had any more of it I'd be sweating butter for weeks. However, my praise for the salad ends there. The frisee was cut rather large, and wasn't very well mixed with the bacon bits. The poached egg on top should run into the salad with a very soft poke of the fork - ours was nearly hard boiled. Not a good start to the meal, I'd say.Steak Frites: Nicely flavored Au Poivre sauce on a properly rare steak - props for that. The fries were generic, but good - sometimes being able to do the standards well is what makes you stand out more than doing interesting things poorly. The small green salad was a nice touch as well.Pheasant: I don't see it on the online menu, but we were able to order pheasant in a cognac sauce. A bit tough, but I guess that's too be expected of pheasant. The sauce wasn't particularly memorable, and was even slightly bitter at times. The highlight of the dish was the vegetable side, which had beans and celery wrapped in cabbage, steamed, and presented in the shape of a patty. I think I could eat this every day - healthy steamed veggies, but just enough flavoring/seasoning/salt to give it some character, and just heavy enough to be filling.Citrus and cream dessert: Again, not on the online menu (looked in all of them, I swear!). Solid choice after the appetizers and entrees. Slices of peeled orange and grapefruit atop a wafer that's sitting on cream (like boston cream, but thicker), with another wafer on the bottom. Light, lightly sweet, a great end to the meal.In terms of food, I feel like the meal got better and better from appetizers to entrees to dinner. The restaurant itself seemed a bit confused though. Dim yellow lighting with dark wood paneling suggests a classy venue, the Halloween party going on in the back of the restaurant (complete with DJ and costume wearing staff) suggests otherwise. That said, I much prefer a happy and fun restaurant staff as opposed to a stern and dour one.Given the inconsistency in the food along with the location, I think I have to give this place three stars - there are many restaurants in this neighborhood, many with similar menus and pricing. Cognac is competent, but not a standout.",0,0,0,Eric C.,"Manhattan, NY",46,32,0

Both DH and The Son had spinach and avocado salads - very fresh and tasty.

I don't mind paying 20% tips for good food and food service, but I don't like to be forced to do that. They didn't mention this policy anywhere in the restaurant or in the menu. Was it because most of the customers were tourists, and they were worried that those tourists didn't pay enough tips? They also charged me $1 more for the dish that I ordered. We didn't argue for this small amount of money, because the brunch didn't cost much anyway. However, I did pay for a lesson -- this is not an honest restaurant.",3,0,0,Tina Y.,"New York, NY",0,196,0

2.0,7/13/2012,"You know, I wanted to give this a 2.5 star rating, but for the prices it charges, it really doesn't deserve more than 2 stars. It started off very well. I called to let them know we'd be late, and they handled it very courteously.  We could choose our own tables and the server promised to make our lunch experience smooth and quick.Cutting to the chase:The foie gras terrine was really bland and left me with such a Meh feeling. To be fair, the toast it came out on had this awesome crunchy texture at the bottom, but the foie gras topping ruined it. I had a few bites, and it was honestly very off-putting. My lunch companion didn't think it was the WORST he had ever tasted, but that isn't saying much. I asked the server to take it away (uneaten, but for a few bites), and he was like... ""What's wrong with it?""""Nothing,"" I said, ""I just didn't care for it.""""What do you mean, was there something wrong with it?""""Nope, I just didn't like it.""He kind of glared at me, as though I just insulted his favorite grandma's cooking, and took it away.He later brings out the entree (I had ordered a beef bourguignon), and he comes back to the table asking ""Is everything ok with THIS dish?"" (Apparently, he was still insulted about the appetizers.)  I assured him that the entree was fine, and it was. The dish itself didn't have this hearty, meaty, flavor, but the meat was tender, and if the sauce was a tad bit too acidic/sour, it was at least edible.Mr. server redeemed himself when he brought the check stating that he removed the appetizer. It wasn't necessary, and I certainly didn't complain about there being a problem with the food, so I did appreciate the gesture. Given the unexpected extra $12, I decided to order a dessert to go (the millefeuille). Unfortunately, I left it in my office fridge over the weekend, and by the time I got to it, it was soggy, which was by no means the fault of the restaurant. Overall, I think this experience deserves just two stars. The food was OK, but for the same price, there are SO many better options around. It's good that the servers take pride in their food, but I didn't like feeling almost attacked (verbally) for the fact that I didn't like something. I can't tell if this is more of a tourist trap, or if I've just caught them on a bad day. Either way, I will not be returning.",2,0,0,Nicole L.,"Philadelphia, PA",263,513,33

3.0,4/4/2012,"Brasserie Cognac is inconsistent at best and a disgrace to French bistros everywhere at worst. My first visit here was a pleasant surprise -- the baguette was authentic, crispy, and divine, and my salad (Signature Chicken Salad) was ridiculously good! The orange juice is fresh-squeezed and heavenly. When I returned for my second visit, I could not decide between re-ordering the salad or trying something new. But since it was a rainy, cold night, I opted for the onion soup and the Mussels Mariniere. These are two quintessential staples of French bistros. You cannot mess them up. Yet on this particular night, Brasserie Cognac did. Royally. As a Russian immigrant, I can basically be expected to eat everything put in front of me (and anything you leave behind on your plate as well)... yet on this night, I left practically all my onion soup in the bowl. It was completely tasteless. I do admit, however, to consuming every last bit of baked gruyere -- but then again, Brassiere Cognac isn't responsible for the quality of the cheese, just baking it :) As for the Mussels Mariniere, they were juicy and plump, I'll give you that. But the broth was completely off -- the key tastes should be white wine and shallots, not cream and more cream. Yet I could already tell by the opaque broth that they had overdone it on the cream. And... there was no toasted bread to dip into the broth -- not that I would have wanted to anyway. The one thing they did get right on that night was the fries -- thin, perfectly salted, satisfying.

Sometimes you just want a nice big juicy steak, and even though this left me satisfied, It didn't overwhelm me with taste, which is what I was looking for and have found at other places. The onion soup was not really good. Probably the worst I've had, but I've only had it a handful of times. the fries that came with the steak were good and crisp though. The Calamari, was crunchy too, and not soggy which is great, but so greasy. It gave me a stomach ache. This place looked like it had a nice wine selection, but not a cocktail menu. The bread was good, but came in little slices. When I came here before the bread was a lot better, like they actually cut up baguette, but this last time it was some sort of peasant roll or something.

Their staff is often rushed, but still friendly - the space in the bakery is pretty small, probably only three stools, so it's really best to grab your food and coffee to go.Every other day I'm there for a vanilla latte, their coffee is very decently priced and of good quality.

The waiter came over completely apologetic before I could even say or complain about anything. Then the manager came over to apologize profusely about the delayed dessert, and that dessert would be on the house. If that wasn't enough, when our dessert finally came out the chef had also sent out a complimentary plate of cookies for being responsible for the delay. The customer service was amazing!

3.0,7/22/2010,"The 3-1/2 overall star rating is spot-on for Cognac. The food is quite tasty for affordable French brasserie fare. I particularly enjoyed the tuna tarte, which is like a crispy pizza covered in rare tuna. The kick of ginger hidden beneath the tuna adds a really interesting (in a good way) twist to this appetizer. My steak frites was also good, but in my experience, this dish is close to impossible to mess up. The only thing keeping me from giving this place 4 stars is the uneven service. It was unbelievably slow. And our waiter seemed to have a bit of an attitude. We had to ask about the wine we'd ordered three different times. And it took an extraordinarily long time to get our appetizer after it had already taken a long time to get our bread. I'm also pretty sure we didn't have any silverware to start.The redemption came when upon the third prompt for wine, the waiter became sheepish and seemed legitimately sorry, and really stepped up his game after that. Then I realized that he had probably been distracted by the insane table he was waiting on next to us, which featured aggressive parents trying to show off their kid's french skills, to no avail, while scolding the little dog they'd brought with them and sat in a chair at the table.The next morning, I returned to enjoy some pastries to take to the park.

4.0,7/21/2010,"This French restaurant has a mix of good ambiance, friendly service, rightly proportioned delicious meals and the buzz that makes a dinner outing worth its while. Here is a quick take on the dishes that we had: Cognac Rotisserie Chicken Flame roasted chicken with mashed potatoes, Haricot Vert (a.k.a. French beans) and tarragon sauce (TS). TS is made with tarragon, basil and sour cream. The preparation was delicious though I had to add a little salt/fresh pepper to spice up the mild European Flavor. But the blend of mashed potatoes, the tarragon sauce and the chicken is just perfect to taste and the size of their preparations are just right. Rack of LambAgain a preparation I would recommend, the mix of lamb with the eggplant caviar and rosemary red potatoes leaves a warm feeling inside your stomach. And the desert that we tried was the Floating Island: Poached Meringue (dessert made from whipped egg whites and sugar) with caramel and vanilla creme Anglais (a light pouring custard used as a dessert cream or sauce. It is a mix of sugar, egg yolks and hot milk, often flavoured with vanilla). The consistency of the Meringue was just perfect and the play with mixing the creme Anglais left that satisfying flavor on the tongue.

I had my own cocktails, too, you see.The French language conversations were all aflutter in the background. Mara G. heard snippets of the basic 4th grade French lesson that I tried to teach her years ago. ""Tu connais Louise Guerin?"" ""Enchantee de faire votre conaissance."" blah blah blah.

The interior of the restaurant is wonderful...wood, banquette seating along the wall with square tables in the middle of the room. All tables had white tablecloths and cloth napkins. The menu has a wonderful variety of entres. We selected Blanchette de Veau, a beet salad with goat cheese, a green salad and a grilled octopus salad with baby arugula. All the dishes were just the right size...no monster-supersized dinner plates. The grilled octopus with arugula was amazing! Tender chunks of melt in your mouth octopus with, baby arugula in a light vinaigrette. Lovely with the glass of Veuve Clicquot Champagne. The Blanchette de Veau was presented in a delicate, flavorful and satisfying cream sauce. The chunks of veal tender enough to shred with a fork and the vegetables cooked to perfection. Accompanied with a glass of Pinot Noir or Cote du Rhone would make anyone very happy. All the dishes were fresh and beautifully presented. For dessert we decided to share a raspberry macaron. The macaron was crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside. The big surprise was the filling of fresh whole raspberries with litchi between the macarons! Wow what a flavor combination! I could've eaten a dozen of these gorgeous cookies. A raspberry puree was layed down under the Macaron and just added another burst of flavor. Well done indeed!! Next time I will order the heavenly scented mussels which came to the table in a castiron pot! By the way, the basket of bread which comes in the begining of meal is TRUE boulangerie goodness.

On a day that finally felt like spring, Cognac's outdoor seating area was bustling. We opted for an interior seat, which gave me a chance to examine the inner sanctum. Apparently the restaurant was first assembled in Paris and then shipped to NYC. I didn't feel confined or cramped at all as there seems to be adequate spacing for diners to stretch without bumping elbows.There is a prix fixe menu valid from 11:30am until 7pm. Prix = 24.95 and this includes appetizer, entree and coffee/tea.With an executive chef  a descendant of Victor Huge, would this meal be les miserable?Au contraire, the appetizers of foie gras terrine and gougeres were promptly delivered and downright delicious. The gougeres, described on the menu as 'cheese puffs' have little or nothing in common with Chester Cheetah or other mass produced snacks. I'd assess them as mini cheese flavored rolls/biscuits that are infinitely pop-able. Multiple baskets of gougeres may be all I need to find happiness at Monsieur Ballon's.But I had to move on, away from the gougeres and to my rotisserie chicken served with haricot verts and mashed potatoes. While the portion of potatoes and haricot verts was on the skimpy side, the main attraction was the chicken and it did not disappoint. What did disappoint was the total satisfaction of my appetite before I even had a chance to order dessert!Two appetizers, two entrees, one alcoholic beverage and the grand total came to $85.I'd definitely return for the gougeres and to explore the other menu items, such as cassoulet, filet mignon flambe and beef bourguignon .",2,1,1,Tom K.,"Forest Hills, NY",337,820,47

Despite it's a French restaurant, jeans were allowed in. We sat in the back of the restaurant where it wasn't too noisy or packed, but towards the front it was a bit more packed for some reason. The ambiance was nice and cozy with candles at each table. Something about candlelit places just draws me to them. When we were there there's a live band playing. Our server was super friendly and really funny and gave us suggestions. I always like to take pictures of my food and the server asked us where we are from and I told him that I'm from NYC, but like to pretend to be a tourist from time to time (which is true).Any way on to the food. We ordered half a dozen of oysters, which was pretty okay. We had the foie gras terrine, which is my first time trying this dish. And WOW it was really good! Boy what have I been missing out on all this time? Our server told us that special of the day is a paella, which to me was a little odd because last time I checked paella is a Spanish dish, not French. Also they serve sushi at their bar, which was a little bizarre too...in a French restaurant? Any way my friend got the paella out of curiosity also because it has rabbit meat.

So of course, i go the next day to Cognac and buy myself one of each of the flavors of croissants: plain, chocolate and almond.  There is a reason why these sell out by mid day.  They use ingredients imported from France, and according to my french friend, they are as good as it gets in NYC.",0,0,0,Debora S.,"New York, NY",7,10,0

3.0,12/27/2009,"On a particularly cold, windy NYC winter evening, I stumbled upon Brasserie Cognac while searching for dinner.  Glad to out of the cold, I was greeted warmly by the bartender once seated at the bar.  The menu presented standard bistro and brasserie fare.  Given the cold weather, the cassoulet seemed an obvious choice.  Before that, I enjoyed an order of the cheese puffs, which are gruyere-flavored popovers.  The cassoulet, which had both the traditional garlic pork and braised lamb, was deeply satisfying and definitely made the walk back to the hotel a lot easier. Brasserie Cognac was a surprising find in an area of Midtown that is devoid of places to eat. Rating this a 3.5 and will consider bumping this up to a 4 after a 2nd visit.",1,0,0,Bryce B.,"Seattle, WA",786,611,41

Flaky, but crisp, to the point of having buttery shards break off when you touch it (eat this carefully, you WILL get crumbs all over you). Very tender inside, but I recommend you warm it up a bit to soften the chocolate.Best of all, because I got there later in the day (6 pm), the lovely man at the counter threw in an extra croissant for free!

4.0,9/15/2009,(Bar area review only --will update later when I check out the food)I stopped by the bar to taste some cognac.

4.0,1/29/2009,"I am a habitual wanderer and so I go from place to place until I satisfy my cravings or spend all of my money (which ever comes first). I had been walking by this place while it was under construction. The location is great and the build out is ""polished"" to say the least. It has that corporate feel, not in a bad way but as if it is like a lot of other brass, wood and glass bars. I did not have much time on this occasion to sit and try much on the menu but I decided to try the grilled octopus and calamari with a chilled Saki. The appetizer was very good. The presentation was simple but had good eye appeal. The octopus was tender and the ingredients tasted fresh. And, although I am not an expert on Saki this choice went well with my dish, not dominating or conflicting with the flavors. I was in a rush to get to my next tasting so I called it, a brief but ""good night"". An average value for your dollar but definitely well spent on this night. I am going to return to the bar soon for a continuation of my initial tasting of good food and drink at Brasserie Cognac de Monsieur Ballon.",1,0,1,Stephen C.,"New York, NY",127,339,1

A very polite wait staff, a snappy prix fix brunch menu (cheese puffs for an appetizer! wowowow), and a full bar, including absinthe.The decor is done very tastefully and feels like an updated Bowfinger (Paris restaurant).

3.0,10/26/2008,"Ate here when I just couldn't think of another place to go, and a colleague and former NY'er suggested it.Never thought about it before, but after reading Christine J's self-professed fussy French eater-ness, I'd have to agree. My hands-down favorite in NY has always been Les Halles on Park, so everything else is compared to that.I had a pretty light appetite and was eating alone, so I just ordered the Croque-Monsieur which is just a few slices of ham and cheese heaven on toasted bread (think glorified panini) which was adequate, along with a dinner salad that was woefully under-dressed.The service was great, but the food didn't really offer me anything I'd seek out again, especially with so many great places to go in the city. It is conveniently located in Midtown on Broadway, and it's a safe choice if you're looking for something in the area.It was too cold the night I was there to eat outside, but I imagine that's certainly a draw and a perk in the right weather.",6,0,4,Krys G.,"Mission Viejo, CA",241,223,78
3.0,10/14/2008,"This little brasserie is conveniently located on the way from my apartment to the subway, so I've stopped in a couple times to their Boulangerie for a coffee/croissant on my way to work.  The coffee is typically dark and french - espresso fares better than iced coffee, but it's a nice blend.  Croissant was a definite thumbs up - buttery and flaky in all the right places.But the one time I tried the food it left me pretty cold - particularly the chicken salad.  I didn't even finish it.  Also, while I haven't had a chance to sit down and eat there, I'm not really sure what it has to offer that's different from the similarly styled and menued brasseries in the neighborhood.  And if that salad was any indication, I don't think I want to find out.",10,4,7,Sam P.,"New York, NY",1869,875,636

4.0,8/18/2008,"The newest sister restaurant to Maison lives up to its French sibling but does not surpass its quality or atmosphere.  We had a lovely seat outside, but unlike Maison where you are separated from the crowds, here you dine right on the sidewalk as people walk past you, swinging their arms just a little too closely to the bread basket filled with warm goodies. The waiter we had was very French and surprisingly friendly, and very attentive.   He even helped my friend and I plan our French vacation...which we unfortunately are not able to take just yet.  The food is great and they have a nice $25 lunch prix fixe.  I recommend the Mussels and Linguine and the French Onion Soup.  In a part of midtown where new restaurants are needed to keep the business lunch meetings ""fresh"", Cognac fits in very well.",1,0,0,Krista J.,"Brooklyn, NY",749,1181,35
2.0,8/2/2008,"I'm a fussy French eater. I was so excited when I saw this place in production and I was like ""YES! Finally a French place near work!"".Was I in for a shock and a disappointment. Granted, the place looks nice, fabulous in fact. The seats are a little too tight, yes, but that's standard for most high French bistros. Its bright with warm tones. My BF and I (he's never far from me when it comes to food) decided to try it out. We got a bottle of Riesling ($43), which was good. They have a nice wine selection, but be prepared to pay a premium for it. cheapest bottle on the list I recall seeing was around $35. The prices are standard for this sort of thing, anywhere from $18 to $40 for entrees. But what was surprising was the quality of the food. It just didn't speak to me, it didn't say, ""C'est magnifique"" or even close. It was just blah. And for the kind of money we put out, I expected better. Even their dessert, the Millefeuille didn't have the richness I expected. In truth, the experience left me feeling empty. It was okay to an extent, but I felt like the $150 we plunked down wasn't worth it.",5,0,1,Christine J.,"Brooklyn, NY",120,167,56
3.0,7/22/2008,"I've been to this restaurant three times now, and annoyingly, I've had to drop my rating by a star for each visit.The first time I stopped by, I had an excellent drink, my steak frites were perfect, the dessert was wonderful and the coffee was perfect.The second time, the food was still good... but my drink never showed up, despite having asked for it twice.This last time (just this evening), my evening started alright, but when I ordered a martini, the waiter asked if I wanted it ""in a martini glass"" or ""in a regular glass.""  Seeing as how I didn't want an alcoholic sippy cup, I told him to bring me a martini glass.  As I was waiting for my salmon to arrive, another waiter came over and presented me with... a steak in a pot.  For some reason.  I told him that I didn't order it, and he apologized and took it away.  My fish did arrive shortly, and it was great.The same thing happened with dessert--I ordered a creme brulée, but was brought some sort of lemon tart.  Almost as soon as the waiter had set it down, he swooped back in and took it away, apologizing, saying, ""This is wrong... you ordered the (other dessert I didn't order), right?""  I corrected him, and he went back to the computer, looking baffled.  Ultimately I did get the right dessert but it took longer than it should have.At the rate these folks are going, the restaurant is going to be in a shambles in a matter of months.  It's a nice experience overall if you look past the mistakes (or don't have any mistakes made at your table), but there are other French restaurants nearby that are just as good and even a little less pricey.",1,0,0,Ryan E.,"Wilmington, DE",83,115,3

2.0,5/15/2008,"Nice and shiny new restaurant on the corner Broadway. After observing it for a couple of weeks after opening we dove in to check it out. It had been fairly busy for the past few nights we had looked in and French food is always good on my book. The space is fairly large and subdivided by interruptions on its lay out. A center Bar/Table a corner nook and then all the front area which can be opened to the weather if it permits. All decorated in dark wooden tones and white table cloths. The staff was fairly welcoming but not as warm as you would expect from a place that just opened up. Our waiter who looked quite familiar (i guess there comes a time when you can tell a waiter helped you at some other restaurant!) was nice to us, even though he didn't seem completely familiar with the way certain items are prepared (i suppose this is new joint syndrome).  As for the menu, it looked quite easy to follow and most dishes sounded pretty interesting. For starters we ordered a salad and veal on an egg based sauce.  We ordered a steak frites as well as a scallop stuffed fish dish as our main dishes. The veal dish was tasty and perhaps the star of the night. The salad was a bit lacking and hardly had any flavor on its dressing. The stuffed fish had very good texture but somehow it had no flavor whatsoever. I asked the waiter about it being so bland and he (might have not known) said that dish was like that (doubtful). As for the steak frites, the meat cut was OK, but not very flavorful even though it was cooked to term.  We have seen much better at that price point from similar if not lesser restaurants. I suppose Cognac is now checking out how customers react to their dishes and will tighten up their act in time goes by. I see other reviewers have had a good food experience, hopefully that will be the trend, as for me and my girl, it didn't cut it for the image they wish to portray and the prices they are charging. Our general experience was nice, the setup and service. But the food... not quite.",3,1,1,Orlando E.,"New York, NY",29,190,55

On  Saturday.  It looked like a good place for lunch.  The restaurant has floor to ceiling windows in front were opened so we could enjoy the weather and people watching, while still inside the restaurant.My husband had The Steak & Frites and I had the Salade Nicoise.Steak & Frites: $24, the steak was a sirloin that was cooked perfectly with a compound butter dollop on top and a bearnaise sauce on the side.  It was accompanied by fingerling potatoes, a side salad with a traditional vinegrette AND shoe string french fries that were slightly sweet.Appetizer Salade Niciose: $13, fairly traditional with tuna, capers, kalamata olives, green beans & an egg on a bed of field greens.  My husband really enjoyed the steak and the fries.  Plus it was very reasonably priced, especially for New York!  My salad was good although they went a little too heavy with the olive oil, there was a pool at the bottom of the dish.  I also would have liked anchovies with the salad.We would definitely go there again, and have already recommended it to my brother who lives in New York.",2,0,1,Monique L.,"Irvine, CA",147,221,100
