5.0,3/31/2019,"This is the coolest place ever! The staff was amazing. We sat at the bar and Jake was our bartender. So friendly and personable. Totally felt like we could come back & he'd treat us like a close friend. The drinks were off the wall awesome and he decorated them too! He made flowers for my cosmo which was the perfect touch! He recommended the tater tots and the chocolate cake. Best decision ever! If you are looking for a friendly bartender that knows a lot about the history of the area, go see JAKE!!!

5.0,2/13/2019,"Came here as a Valentine date. This was a package that was added from the Observatory tour. This restaurant is very up scale and amazing. The 3 course meal was everything. I had the Crab Cakes as a starter and it was one of the best crab cakes I have ever tasted. The coriander aïoli has a nice soft taste I could eat all night. For entrée, I choose the Scottish Salmon. Not everyone can make a tasty Salmon. The skin was nice a crunchy just the way I like it. The meat part of the salmon was mice and juicy and soft. The sweet potato purée gave the salmon a nice zest. For dessert, it was hard to choose. I picked the Key Lime Pie. I loved the added Lime chip that was added on top of the pie. It gave the pie a different taste with the ice cream and topping that was on Overall, I would visit this restaurant again.

He greeted us with a warm smile and treated us as if we were his regular customers! His personality and willingness to make our celebration dinner special was outstanding. Any questions we had, he answered! If we asked him for his suggestions, he gave them and boy was he right!Not only was Jay wonderful, but the food was spectacular was well! As an appetizer we ordered the Cheese & Charcuterie and Fried Calamari. For dinner, my boyfriend ordered the Sausage Cavatelli and I ordered the NY Strip Steak. Everything was flavorful and fresh!

That being said, our reservation was for 9:45pm and at NO point did we ever feel rushed to order, or to consume our food. The fact that they close at 10 did not stop them from providing stellar service. Bread was warm and fresh. Started with the grilled shrimp and the amount of flavor in that one bite was insane! Steak Frites were delicious and my husband's New York Strip was also excellent. We were celebrating our anniversary and before they brought our bill, they gave us a platter of freshly baked cookies, brownies and biscotti to wish us a happy anniversary.

That was my first plus here. Most places do not seat you without your whole party being present. I ordered the quinoa salad with shrimp. It had chickpeas and feta mixed in it. Really delicious. I would definitely order it again. We shared the cookie platter for dessert. I only tried the macaroon off of it but that was amazing.

I ordered us happy hour wine from the bar while I waited for my friend to arrive and wow...$5 for a glass of wine during happy hour?! You sold me already! I would come back to just grab drinks with a friend later!As for the dinner, the dining area is spacious and everyone very kind and courteous. Or waiter was fantastic at recommendation and was very attentive. We got the octopus and steak tartare to start and both got the scallops for our entree. I loved the octopus and thought it was cooked perfectly and the peppers gave it a great spice factor. My friend though said her steak tartare had a bit too much olives in it for her taste. The scallops though were scrumptious! Cooked perfectly and the accompanying vegetables were still fresh I really enjoyed them and cleaned up my whole plate! For the dessert, my friend ordered the chocolate cake while I got the panna cotta. The chocolate cake was not too sweet but very rich. The panna cotta was exactly what I wanted...creamy, light, but so decadent.

4.0,4/22/2018,"I ordered ""dinner and a view"" which is deceptive be cause it leads you to believe that if you pay $37 for the observatory and $46 for a fixed price dinner, you would be eating in the observatory. I made four reservations for this. We got to the restaurant and was told that you eat dinner in the restaurant and then go to the observatory. I protested to the person who treated us and after admitting this is a common misconception and offered many ""sorries"", we decided to stay. We were seated and decided upon our dinner choices. My wife wanted to order the beef shanks and was promptly told they were out. At this point my anger was extreme. I asked for the manager who turned out to be the man taking our orders. Again after apologies and an attempt to inform me of the semantics of ""with"" vs ""and"" . I blew up. Fast forward, after my display of anger, the manager provided free appetizers and desserts for our trouble as well as an escort to the observatory. When the anger had cleared, I spoke with the manager who admitted the problem happens often but the owners refuse to clarify this deceptive offer.I give it four stars because the food was truly exceptional and management stepped up to rectify a true bait and switch scheme.Be forewarned there is no dining area on the observation deck in spite of the pictures of folks eating dinner with views that appear to be from a dining area on the 86th floor.",6,0,0,Brian N.,"Georgetown, MA",0,9,0
3.0,3/26/2018,"Mixed feelings. The food for the most part was good. My wife's kale salad was great. My daughter's pasta was good. But the service was not close to on par with what we'd expect for the ambiance and price. We were seated in the bar, even though we didn't ask to be. Our server, the bartender, took 15 minutes to take our order as two managers stood by watching and playing on their phones. Other servers stood around too as it wasn't that busy. When our orders came, two out of three were incorrect. Totally the wrong items. So my daughter and I waited for the right dishes while my wife enjoyed her salad. At no point did the server or any of the managers apologize. Maybe we stood out as tourists and they just didn't care. In any case, maybe it's not always this way but the lack of caring is probably systemic. So beware.",1,0,0,Daniel G.,"Palatine, IL",0,23,0

The food and ambience never disappoints.We were a party of 10, but the food came out relatively quickly. They started us off with an amuse bouche, which tasted kinda pedestrian, but they were on the house. Some folks ordered pasta, others chicken or fish. No one was unhappy with their meals. I had the cheese burger which was cooked nicely, (medium) and had this lovely, subtle flavor that I still can't put my finger on. All I know is that it was very good.

The mash potatoes that accompanies the dish it Super velvety and smooth. The Risotto special was awesome and loaded with shrimp. I think they should put this on the regular menu.

2.0,10/19/2016,"I was given tickets to this place and kept putting off going.  But finally decided to give it a try before the expiration date on the tickets. My co-worker and I got there about 45 minutes before our reservation after work on Tuesday evening.  They seated us right away and had no issue with us arriving before schedule.The prefixe menu was slightly different from the regular menu,  but that's to be expected. I had read previous reviews and some said the place was great while others said the place was horrible. I read that someone else had gotten the prefixe and ordered the steak so I was really looking forward to a steak. However, that was not a choice on the menu.  So I settled for the one of the other two beef choices which was short ribs. I also ordered the seafood chowder. My friend ordered chicken milanese and her soup choice was a garden vegetable soup. For dessert she chose the 7 layer blackout and I chose the ice cream trio. We were offered the choice of still,sparkling or tap water. We chose still.Food- Short ribs- although boneless & tender, very small,  one piece with a lot of fat served over a small portion of mashed potato, two carrots and chipolini onions that were undercooked. The whole dish was very bland and lacked salt. Did the chef forget that salt brings out the flavor of dishes? Seafood chowder- it had pieces of salmon,  cubed potaoes, pieces of shrimp and bacon in a creamy broth. Do they call that seafood? And who puts salmon in soup? I guess since two of their dishes on the menu are salmon they use it more ways.  The shrimp were a tad under for my taste.Chicken milanese- Although it was a huge portion it had no flavor at all. Again lacking salt and this type of dish if there was salt available on the table wouldn't do it any justice after being fried. Salad was nice.  But to me not a complete meal.Bread- no bread basket placed on table.  Instead they come around and offer you one piece from a choice of salted baguette, cranberry roll, or sourdough. All of which are hard slightly warmed and hard to cut into. Seven layer cake- just ok nothing spectacular same goes for the ice cream. The three flavors were chocolate, vanilla and malted. I didn't care for the malted.With this meal you had a choice of coffee, tea or soda. Since we chose water my friend had coffee we weren't expecting a check for the water.  I've never been charged for still water. It was $6.53 Service was ok, the server did come check on us once. I did notice he was a bit more friendlier to a group who was ordering from the regular menu. We looked at the regular menu and noticed there were a few things on there that seemed good.  I wouldn't go back.  Their food is bland and there are many other places to eat in the city.I won't tell the person who gifted me the tickets.  He paid $55 per person and I kind of feel bad that it wasn't worth it",1,4,1,Kat R.,"Kew Gardens, Queens, NY",76,312,361

4.0,8/11/2016,"came here for restaurant week around 2pm. the setting and the atmosphere was nice although i was expecting it to be a lot fancier since it was part of the Empire State building. When we got there, it wasn't packed at all. only 3 other table were occupied. We were seated for a good ten minutes chatting, and then my bf was like ""how come they don't serve bread here?"". I don't know if they heard us, but a lady brought over bread 5 minutes later. Hence, you don't receive a basket of bread like other places. you only get to choose one of the three. Jumbo Crab cake and the Roasted Duck salad are a must ! Entree: we tried the sirloin - the sauce that accompanied this was amazing! the fries were completely soggy and salty. Dessert: Chocolate cake was a bit dry service is not that good here. the place is completely empty, and you would think that they would provide excellent customer service. however it is the complete opposite. we left the paid bill on the table and just left. no one even noticed that we left. people can just leave without paying, no one seemed to care.",2,0,1,My R.,"New York, NY",25,173,275

They allow space and time to enjoy the experience without making you feel ignored. It's impossible to find a great and relaxing place in midtown. This place is a haven amidst all the touristy spots.

The Bibb lettuce and salmon salad...and if you want large: the chicken Milanese is a lot but very well made.,1,0,1,Carolina L.,"New York, NY",2,4,1

Mind you, we were sitting in the middle of the room where there would be no excuse for missing our table. So we order drinks. Looking around we realized that everyone was served bread besides us. Now we have been waiting 45 minutes to actually order food. I finally get the waitress's attention, ask for the check and tell her the reason why we are leaving. She apologizes and gives us some LAME excuse about how she thought we were waiting for two extra people. I called and made reservations for two people! And they sat us! Why didn't she just ask if we were waiting for other people? That's when I realized she was probably bullshitting us or maybe she was just very stupid. Either way beware of the wait time here!

It was not at all busy on the night that we went, and it was nearly impossible to track down the waiter to take our orders. And he messed up a side order and two drinks. I've never had such slow service in my life.The bread for the table didn't come until after we ordered which was a long time wait to begin with, and we were starving. But their cranberry bread is delicious. We got to sample the chef's tuna tartar as a complimentary appetizer, and it did not disappoint. I ordered the soup of the day which was great, and for my entree I had the Day Boat Scallops. Scallops were well-seasoned and filling, but they do not give you a lot of cauliflower which was a little disappointing. The four us sampled a little of each others plates and here's what was in the mix among everyone: the State Beef Burger (with the house fries), the tater tots, the crab cake, and the mixed greens salad. The burger was amazing. If I ever returned, I would definitely order that. I've had better crab cakes and salads. However the tater tots were to die for. They're infused with jalapenos, cheese, and bacon, and they came with Russian sauce. Overall, the food was good and the prices are what you would expect for being in the Empire State Building or on 5th Ave, but it was not worth it.

Needless to say I gave them the benefit of the doubt and assumed it was a one off issue. It took me a while to flag down a waiter and once I did it turned out to be the manager.

The Brooklyn Mule cocktail reminded me somewhat of a margarita but, vodka and a twist of a fresh sprig of thyme made this drink really refreshing. The Lobster Mac and Cheese appetizer was amazing. A perfect bite just before our medium well sirloin steak. Although my wife's steak was not exactly to her liking, we were compensated with a FREE dessert which was delicious. Baked on premise, the cannoli and cake with ice cream was a pleasant ending to our meal. Great ambience, seating arrangements are good too.

4.0,2/20/2015,"Ate here for Restaurant Week dinner on a Monday night. Got the warm duck confit salad and it was a bigger portion than expected (always a nice surprise). On the restaurant week menu, it says one of the entrees is swordfish, but when we got there it was replaced with an octopus dish. Regardless, the meal itself was delicious and definitely worth going again. The service was great and waiters were really pleasant to talk to. Getting the check was a bit slow but they gave us some nicely wrapped chocolate when they returned.",0,0,0,Min-Ji K.,"Newark, NJ",2,14,8

5.0,2/13/2015,"Our friend used Yelp to look for a lunch spot and found the State Grille and Bar. We walked over from Macy's on a very rainy Saturday.  It was exactly what we needed.  Staff was attentive and friendly and made us feel very special. ordered the chicken salad, lobster BLT and 2 burgers.  Everything came out hot and we enjoyed every dish, especially the fries.  They told us we were lucky because we came in on the last Saturday that they will be opened for lunch because there is not enough traffic.  That is unfortunate for all who will miss the opportunity to enjoy this fabulous restaurant.  They did give us free dessert which included house made cookies and ice cream which was amazing.  Next time we are in the city we will definitely go back for dinner.",0,0,0,Judy F.,"Boston, MA",0,36,0

Chris our bartender was charming and attentive, Lydia, the hostess was super sweet  & the chef even came over to us for a chat! Started with beet salad & steak tartare! YUM! Tater tots are a must. Cauliflower steak is like nothing I've ever tasted. The branzino was spectacular. This place is a WINNER! Go before the word gets out and you can't get in!!!",0,0,0,Donna L.,"Manhattan, NY",64,21,1
5.0,2/5/2015,"Came in here today for a business lunch. Service: AWESOME. They really know what they are doing here, everyone from the hostess, to the manager, to the waiter, to the water boy was spot on.  This was one of the best services I have had in a long time.  Only thing I would change, is I would make the food come out a bit faster (especially at lunch).  Other than that perfect. We both had the Business Express lunch.  The menu is very clean, great design, great options.  I had the Seafood Soup + Branzino.  The soup was nice and light, good flavor. Needed a bit of spice, but after I spiked it with hot sauce it was good.  The Fish was perfectly cooked and came on top a nice bed of veggies. It felt light and fresh and was delicious. My friend had the Soup as well and the Chicken Chop, Chop. It was a nice chopped salad, but nothing to write home about.  Lastly we were treated with a nice little bite size cookie and cake like thing. Both were very good.  Perfect experience. Great for a business lunch, or a quiet lunch.  They take reservations, which I would recommend because they tend to get a little busy.",0,0,0,Elizabeth J.,"San Francisco, CA",596,659,801

The staff provided EXCELLENT service, our waiter was great and always made sure we were taken care of. The chef gave us delicious snacks prior to dinner and our meals were amazing. My boyfriend had the New York strip- which was on special and raved about it, I had the linguine with broccoli rabe, charred trevison and oyster mushrooms and it was very delicious and not to heavy. Definitely recommend this restaraunt! Amazing dining experience and delicious food!",0,0,0,Ciera L.,"Tucson, AZ",6,153,23

5.0,1/2/2015,"Stately dining. From the atmosphere, to the music, service and (of course), the food - State is authentic NY fine dining, at reasonable prices.We enjoyed A Hearty Salad, Jalapeño Bacon Tater Tots and a Branzino for the entree. Topped it off with French press coffee and a NY Cheesecake on a carrot cake crust.Michael, our waiter, was attentive, friendly and very professional. The chef spoiled us with a few complementary items - beat/soft cheese taster, lobster risotto, and an assortment of delicious cookies.Everything was exceptional.  HIGHLY recommend stopping here before of after a trip to the top of the Empire State Bldg.

The staff from the bartenders to the wait staff were so warm and accommodating.  The hostess, Christina, could not have been nicer.  The room is spacious, nicely lit and I loved the huge Art Deco style painting.Now the food, it was one of the best meals I have had. The serving sizes were perfect and the prices were reasonable for a nice night out. I had the strip steak which was perfectly seasoned and cooked. It came with deliciously addictive fries.  My friend had the chicken and it was amazing. I am not a big chicken fan and I loved it. We shared a broccolli rabe which was also great.  For dessert we have the chocolate cake and it was amazing. Downstairs they have these lovely party rooms. It would be a great place for an elegant dinner party.I hope they do well. So far they are off to a great start.",3,0,1,Gina S.,"Brooklyn, NY",160,151,3
5.0,12/6/2014,Really really good food.  Very comfortable atmosphere.  Great service and a great value for NYC.  The construction isn't doing it any favors but do not let that stop you.  Definitely worth your time.  Will absolutely come back.,1,0,1,Jim F.,"Petoskey, MI",0,1,0
5.0,12/6/2014,Food is as good as the service and the atmosphere.  On weekends it is quieter because the main draw is the weekday crowd at the Empire State Building.   Worthy of special mention: the seafood chowder.  Entrees are the basic meats grilled with interesting sides and there was a seafood special. There also appear to be numerous vegetarian options. The appetizers and salads were unique and varied.  Local ingredients are featured.  The bar back is a glass wall so you can watch the chef in action.  There are beautiful private dinning rooms downstairs.  You will not be disappointed.,1,0,0,Jonathan H.,"Hartford, CT",11,25,10

5.0,11/15/2014,"We found this place via web search while looking for a place to eat before touring the Empire State Building and figured it was a tourist trap. It wasn't. The food is WONDERFUL, the service is excellent, and prices aren't unreasonable at all. The decor and music are marvelous. Definitely the dining high point of our NYC vacation. Steaks were perfectly glazed and cooked, the clam chowder was not only delicious but obviously made fresh daily, and the bacon and cheese tater tots are evil in its purest form.

I took a number of clients (visiting from around the globe) for lunch last week during Adtech, a huge hit for business meetings as well. Specifically, the international folks loved the classy presentation of nostalgic American favorites (burger, tater tots, salmon). Well done!",1,1,1,Mel Y.,"Manhattan, NY",4,14,0
5.0,10/30/2014,"Opened this summer and **no** tourists.  It's a sleek, clubby restaurant.  Ate at the bar.  Fantastic service.  The two bartenders were helpful and met the chef at the end of the night.  He was from L.A.  Started off with really good bread and butter.  We both had the fish with honey crisp apple and shaved root salad.  The skin was crisp and the flesh was moist. The fish went well with the apple puree and the salad.  Cleaned the whole plate, not even the skin was left.  Had mashed potato as an extra side.  Quite smooth and buttery. They also gave us extra butter because I liked my potato swimming in butter.  Might have been overkill, but it was tasty.  Had apple pie and now, I forget the other dessert.  Finished everything.",1,0,0,SM K.,"Signal Hill, CA",0,38,0
5.0,10/22/2014,"Went for dinner opening week and we couldn't have been happier.  Beautiful space (very art deco) and service, open kitchen (which was fun to watch while waiting for my friend to arrive).  We had salmon (perfectly cooked and over brussels sprouts) and squash onion tart (possibly the best crust ever) and desserts that were out of this world (blackout cake, creamsicle cake (??) and cheesecake) -- not too sweet, just perfect.  I'm going back in a couple of weeks to treat mom to lunch since they have different items I need to try!",2,1,1,Teri J.,"Bronx, NY",1,38,5

Very comfortable setting, we could have stayed all afternoon and for dinner but needed to get one guest to the airport. Loved the beet trilogy, lobster salad, caramelized cauliflower, charred brussel sprouts. Wish we had saved room for dessert but the apple pie description warrants a trip back to State.
