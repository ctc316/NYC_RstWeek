4.0,4/30/2019,"SUCH great food and such a creative innovative menu. I wanted to try it all, but I'd have to particularly recommend the hoisin pork arepas, Thai chicken empanadas, and the asparagus tempura roll. My only complaint is while the drinks were creative and delicious, they were a bit weak. It's definitely a little pricey, but worth it for a special occasion.

3.0,4/22/2019,"This review is for weekend brunch. The hostess were amazing in adjusting my reservation at the last minute, my party was less than 2 people I originally reserved for.Service was good given the brunch unlimited food and drinks brunch sitch. He was able to check in with us from time to time to see if we want to order additional items and refill our drinks. Athough, we have to re-order some of the items that did not come out from previous order, its an oversight that my party did not mind.Onto the food. Oh boy, most them comes out 2 mins after ordering them. Yes, they were efficient, but none of the food came out hot. None of the brunch item came out stellar. Everything was just ok. And for the drinks, was just ok too. not too bad but not good either. They refill drinks from a huge pitcher which is sitting from the server's stations, not stirred so you either get mostly juice or alcohol.The concept of unlimited boozy brunch was good bec who doesn't love a brunch in NYC? But I hope they will reconsider some of the reviews and improve on certain situation before I consider going back or referring other patrons.",0,0,0,Jordan C.,"Meatpacking District, Manhattan, NY",95,6,0

3.0,4/8/2019,"I am not sure what type of brunch situation you are looking for but I will share what type of experience Zengo provides.  It's a bottomless food and drink spot and their bottomless duration is 2 hours.  I will say that I have been here before a couple of years ago and I have noticed have been some changes on the menu in terms of portions (like the Korean Fried Chicken).  The first round of food was luke warm but I am assume some is the food is already prepared.  There was a time I requested hot food such as for my dumplings and my server did meet my request.  The bread pudding that was on the menu was cold and I am not use to cold bread pudding.  I will say this is the perfect place for group brunch and I highly encourage recommendations.  My server, Natalie, was the bomb. Right when I thought my glass was getting empty Natalie was on top of it. The reason I gave them a 3 instead of a 5 is because I feel like a lot of the food was luke warm.  I understand this was out of the control of the server but no one wants luke warm food.  I understand when bottomless comes into play of brunch experience sometimes things have to compromised If I could rate my server alone she would of got 5 for her service and for the restaurant it would of been a 3.",4,2,1,Dominek T.,"New York, NY",562,339,583

4.0,3/29/2019,"Beautiful restaurant, a super eclectic range of options for environments. I love the concept of the Latin-Asian fusion, however the dishes are super hit or super miss. The Thai chicken empanadas are probably one of my favorites, but the Japanese chicken meatballs were hard, lukewarm at best, undercooked and salty. Portion sizes are a bit on the light side. Service is not overly attentive or helpful, normally have to flag down waitstaff when here. At the end of the day it's great ambiance, but is overpriced and the food can be hit or miss.

4.0,3/10/2019,"Came here for brunch with my friends and had a meal with some highs and lows. Overall, it's a great deal for bottomless food AND drinks for $49. However, I found that we either really loved the dishes or drinks or really disliked them. The ambiance is great-- it's a beautiful restaurant with a stunning staircase and gorgeous lighting. It's very easy to come here with large groups given how much seating there is. We started off with drinks and ordered every mimosa-- the blood orange, mango, and lychee. The mango and blood orange flavors were NOT good. It either was artificial fruit flavoring or bad champagne. However, the lychee mimosa was a home run (even from someone who doesn't love lychee!).For food, we ordered several dishes: Thai chicken empanadas, Peking duck and egg steam buns, Achiote hoisin pork arepas, chicken chilaquiles, kimchi fried rice, and salmon Benedict. The arepas was SO good that we ordered two of them-- definitely the highlight of the meal. The empanadas and chilaquiles were a close second and very flavorful. The steam buns were a little weird-- the duck and scrambled eggs didn't go well together. I had hope for the salmon Benedict but my egg wasn't poached at all and completely cooked through rather than runny. For dessert, we ordered the plantains, Mexican chocolate waffle, and pineapple bread pudding. The plantains were a little disappointing because they weren't crispy at all and had a savory creama on them rather than a sweet one. The chocolate waffle was pretty good but could have used more sauce. The bread pudding was pretty decent but definitely not a typical bread pudding texture wise. Overall, definitely worth coming here if you like Latin-Asian fusion. One big plus is that you have two hours for food and drinks and you don't have to finish all the food if you don't like it.",1,0,1,Megan K.,"San Francisco, CA",710,343,410

1.0,3/3/2019,"What a disappointment! We've had a really great brunch here before, so expectations were high. Unfortunately, the food this time was sub-par. I don't know what's happening in the kitchen or if management has changed, but all of our dishes came out all at once, immediately after ordering them. It was obvious that they had been prepared well in advance, assembled and served. I can easily imagine a lineup of food sitting piled high in a steam table waiting for order tickets to come in. The place was barely a third full at noon on a Sunday...which should have been a telling sign right from the start.Poached eggs were completely cooked through with rock solid yolks. Tasteless ceviche, a handful of tiny shrimp swimming in fruit juice with some melon was spooned into a bowl. Kimchi rice was a mess of old rice and diced up something that was unidentifiable. Almost every dish has the same spicy mayo on it and ends up all tasting the same. Korean fried chicken was sticky sweet, but better. The first order of scrambled egg baos was OK. The second order had undercooked, almost raw buns and the eggs were not right. Chicken chilaquiles had soggy chips, were cold and had shreds of chicken that were tasteless. the fried egg on top was clearly old and, again, had a broken yolk that was cooked to death. They charge a premium for the bottomless brunch ($49/person for two hours of eating and drinking). Unfortunately, they cheaped out on the cocktails too. Who serves a bloody Mary ( or Maria if you prefer tequila) without as much as a stick of celery. Just bloody mix over ice with a stir stick. No lime. No fruit. No celery. Nothing. It's barely drinkable. Again, we used to love this place. They used to take such pride in their food and how it was presented. I will say that the service is still very good. The atmosphere and design of the room is still great. The food, however is a mess and the bill ($175/3 with tip/tax) was way too much for what we got. Hope they can turn it around.",0,0,0,Miles W.,"Westport, CT",0,4,1
4.0,3/2/2019,"Best bottomless brunch of ever had in terms of value and sophisticated atmosphere. This is not a place you would go to to get eggs Benedict, but rather a good lunch food spot with bottomless food and drinks. We sat upstairs which was key, moving forward I would request this when going back. I was blown away by the extensive drink menu, and the menu period, that was included in the bottomless brunch. It was a whole menu to choose from! The food was hit or miss, I went with a table of 10 and we did a first round of food and found the dishes we liked and ordered a second even third round of those. Dessert was good, we had the chocolate waffles. I'd say biggest critique is that the food sometimes wasn't hot, and if it were hot then it would have been so much better! But, that's what you get at a bottomless brunch spot. Service was great and compared to all others I've been do this was the best.

3.0,2/16/2019,"First off, really beautiful restaurant with a great ambiance. It's dimly lit, with high ceilings and a nice mix of tables with candles, booths and bar space. The menu is certainly interesting, and nearly every item will be a fusion of latin american and asian elements, as advertised. How elegantly these elements are intertwined is up for debate though. For example, the thai chicken empanadas are basically chicken empanadas that come with a curry dipping sauce. The thai shrimp lettuce wraps simply have chorizo added to the mix. Nevertheless, I was actually a big fan of the appetizers. My favorite was the hoisin pork arepa! However, shanghai strip steak (our main entree we ordered) was a huge disappointment. The steak itself was well done instead of medium as we requested and it was WAY too salty. Broccolini was too soggy and again too salty. The taro fries were so oiled you couldn't appreciate any taro taste. I would come back, but only for drinks + apps.",0,0,0,Matt H.,"New York, NY",273,264,748

I'm not kidding- look no further, because Zengo does not disappoint. There are few places in NYC where you can not only get unlimited drinks but also unlimited food. When I say I had to contemplate unbuttoning my pants and removing my belt, I am literally not kidding.Ambiance: This place is huge! The ceiling is so beautiful and it's decorations are really nice. I really was into the interior design of Zengo. Lots of booths, tables and a nice long bar. Food: So my government name is Ashley but my street name is brunch queen. With that being said, I know brunches. For me to say this place is so awesome, meanis. I am super picky when it comes to brunch being as that I have been to SO many..I know what works and what doesn't work. Our waiter, lovely girl unfortunately I don't remember her name only because I'm late with this review. She suggest bringing out the most popular plates first. I recommend doing this because you can literally try everything! The food was so awesome. Honestly, I can't say there is one plate that I didn't like. Drinks: They give you a 2 hour limit in which you can order mimosas, bloody Mary's or margaritas. Since I have a drinking issue and haven't learned from my past mistakes, I obviously was rotating between all 3. No regrets thought! The ONLY con I have is that they are pretty slow with refilling. Granted it was a 1 PM on a Saturday, but I was only with one person. I thought it would be a little faster. Other than that the drinks are definitely strong and have an AWESOME punch. I really enjoyed the lychee mimosa. Their margaritas are also super yummy too! Our bill came up to around $107 for two people. Not bad!!!!Overall, I would give this place a 4/5. The service was slow and sometimes the food was a lil cool, but other than that nothing crazy. This is the go to place for birthday brunches.

The only con is that you can't pack up what you don't finish - so it seems a tad wasteful (but also understandable because then everyone would always over-order). The food is great! I would recommend the angry zengo sushi roll, crispy potatoes, shrimp ceviche and thai chicken empanadas! I love that if you find a dish you love, you can just keep reordering it! The dessert is also amazing - the chocolate waffles are delicious! Definitely come and eat to get your moneys worth!",1,0,0,Vivian C.,"New York, NY",210,93,16
1.0,2/9/2019,"My worst dinning experience in NYC. Are you suppose to put not edible stuff (that looks like actual food) in a plate and not telling the customers? Well, they did. We ordered the Ceviche plate which was served in a scallop shell and foam underneath. The foam was completely integrated in the plate. So we mixed it in with the ceviche and we ate it. We realized that something was wrong, because it was extremely salty and acid. So we asked the server, who told us the foam is not edible. Not even an apology, even when we were telling him that we had a burning in our mouths. The manager came after, she never apologized. What is worst, she told us ""well, I wouldn't eat it but is not going to hurt you"". Everybody can make mistakes, what we were expecting a sincere apology at least or a decent way to compensate. Which never came, it even looked that they were making fun of us. Apart from that, crappy food and super overpriced. We ended up paying 70$ pp for bad service, and awful quality.

1.0,2/1/2019,I been to zengo a couple Years ago and it was amazing . I decided to visit again and the experience was horrible.  Firstly It was super cold in the restaurant. The waitress took forever to take our order. It was literally like 30 minutes. Then when she took our order she got it wrong! She brought out some broccoli dish when I ordered mushrooms. I also asked her for an additional glass of wine which then took another 20 minutes to come out. She also forgot our last order of arepas!!! Horrible experience!!! I then proceeded to use the restroom and my god!!! For an upscale restaurant it was terrible. It was not cleaned and smelled!!! Toilet paper on the floor like a club bathroom. This is zengo!!! I expected better for this place but it wasn't . For a $300 bill it was not worth it!!'never coming back and i wouldn't recommend this place !,0,0,0,Theresa R.,"South Ozone Park, NY",0,9,3
4.0,1/30/2019,"I came here to try out their restaurant week dinner 2019 menu with my girlfriends and I had a really good time. Let me start with how beautiful this restaurant looks, it's a great setting to bring out a date or enjoy the happy hour after a sad day or just bring your friends and have fun. They have three floors, level 1 is the dining room, level 2 is upstairs for drinks and level 0 is ground level to bring your dates. While I was waiting for my friends to arrive, I decided to try their happy hour drinks and had the Traditional Caipirinha with strawberry puree. It was very difficult to get the bartender's attention because he was just one person handling too many people and he tried to go as fast as he can. The drink was delicious but on the sweeter side, I bet it's at least 400 calories but it was delicious.As for the dining experience, our table was lovely but it was parallel to the door and it was freezing outside so every time someone opened the door it was super cold. We had a waiter who was funny and cheerful. I had the short rib empanadas for appetizers which was tasty but not the best I had. I got the hanger steak which was a bit let down because the steak was not perfected to the way I like it. It was chewy and hard. But the sauce that came with it was delicious (reminded me of Thai red curry). Finally the dessert, chocolate and coffee bomb was delicious but I don't think you can go that wrong when chocolate is involved (at least for me).

So their deal is $49 for unlimited brunch drinks (we did lychee and mango mimosas followed by way too many margaritas).

1.0,1/27/2019,"Came here on a quiet Saturday night with a group of 13 or so and I did not have a good time. My boyfriend, his friend, and I got the steak. I asked for it to be medium-rare and my boyfriend asked for his to be medium-well. When we got the steaks, his steak had more pink than mine did! Trust me, it wasn't a lot of pink, but even in the dark lighting, you could tell. Sadly, I've noticed that almost every restaurant in NYC does not know how to cook a steak that isnt well-done. This is an epidemic, people. I know my steaks will taste better if I made it at home, but when all of your other options suck, I'm going for the steak. Everything was too salty, even the sushi. Yes, they added salt to the sushi. When it came time to pay, anyone could tell you that it would be a shitshow with 13 people. Someone in my party asked for separate checks but the waitress refused because she didn't want to print out 13 different checks. It took us over 30 mins to figure out how much each person was paying and in the end, the waitress ended up swiping 13 credit cards AND we still had a balance! She was better off printing 13 separate checks. Hope she learned from this. I came here in 2012 and wasn't impressed and my opinion did not change.

I have been here 3 times now, and let me tell you that the service has improved a lot, for better. To give you an insight we didn't have a pleasing time last time we came to Zengo. So we decided to give it another chance because nobody is perfect.The restaurant is big and cozy, even when it is crowded you won't feel it. The big windows, natural light, comfortable seats, friendly staff; and great fusion of American and Asian cuisines form part of an excellent culinary experience.Their menu is very wide and different. They have a good list of appetizing options and ingredients that will make you want to try their dishes. The Thai empanadas, and coconut flakes shrimp are very good to start (they come with side sauces that are delicious as well). The steak sandwiches and burgers were done with prime meats and fresh ingredients (you could tell). Everything was delicious and cooked as we liked.The coconut flan and carrot cake are also a nice choice if you feel like having desert. They are sweet, good size, instagramable, just right.For the alcohol drinkers, the menu is extensive, so you will have lots of options to explore and enjoy.Prices are affordable, the food they give you it's plenty for what you pay.

4.0,7/24/2018,"Generally, I'm not a big fan of these giant midtown bar/restaurant establishments, but Zengo makes it work.  The space is split up into 3 separate floors; the main level is mostly for dining, the upper level has a small bar, and the lower level, La Biblioteca (my favorite), is a lounge.We came for a drink on a Thursday night around 9pm, and the place was lively without being too crowded.  We sat at the bar on the upper level and had some wine, and then migrated to La Biblioteca for cocktails.  The entire space is very modern and flashy, but somehow not cheesy.  The lighting is dim which creates a pretty romantic vibe.  Note that the upstairs bar closes out earlier than the lower levels, so if you're looking for a nightcap, you'd be better off at La Biblioteca downstairs.",4,1,3,Juliana T.,"Manhattan, NY",220,265,553

3.0,6/25/2018,"Sometimes I wonder: are my expectations too high? Is my palate faux sophisticated or something? I don't know, but I have to always go with my gut. I feel that the food at Zengo as a whole didn't hit the mark. For $45 a person, you get unlimited food and drink for a 2 hour brunch. Its a sweet deal considering all the food you can get. The guac and chips to start were incredible and really got you ready for the real food. The hoisin pork arepas and the plantains were lovely. Unfortunately, those were the only noteworthy dishes. The lobster chipotle grits were runny, and the duck/scrambled egg steam buns lacked duck. Dessert-like dishes such as the Mexican chocolate waffles and croissant bread pudding (both sound amazing right?) were uninspired. The mimosas were VERY strong though.Zengo is truly a gorgeous space. The ceiling is high and the room is spacious: almost like a Game of Thrones-esqe dining hall (without the murder and betrayal).

3.0,6/11/2018,"Damnnn Daniel.. back at it again with another Yelp review?? Yes, only my name's not Daniel. Anyway, I went to this place for a friends brunch because I'm not cool enough to find a place like this on my own. Which is probably a good thing seeing as how mediocre it was lol. So I'll jump right in. The food here is served family style which really means they're going to bring out plates with super tiny portions bc we are obviously a large group of 2nd graders on a weekend mimosa binge field trip. Fine, I'm down! Then when the plates start coming, everything has what I like to call mystery sauce because it was always food paired with a sauce nobody asked for. Like they brought out plantains with some weird white sauce on it .. so either it's tarter sauce OR .. mystery!! I was like wtf.. when do sweet plantains require sauce lol. It doesn't stop there folks.. every dish from fish to chicken, empanadas to fried chicken, all with sauces no one asked for lol. So of course I'm like bruh.. is it inhumanely possible to ask for some plantains and fried fish without sauce? Took em a while but hey, they brought. Also, the fried chicken is really meh.. actually pretty much all the food was meh. For drinks they have a few options like mimosa, guava mimosa, margaritas and other stuff I don't like but you can swap and change drinks options which is nice. Their rule is you must have finished your drink before you can get another. Sounds fair enough until you drink 3/4ths of your mimosa and want the traditional top off brunch experience and they dead you which results in waiting forever and a day to get a refill. Our server was nice though seemed utterly overwhelmed with the life and death experience of ordering food. He was accompanied by help from a guy with a suit jacket. Beware.. this robocop was the beverage regulator for the day. He legit told one of us he couldn't have another drink and should take it easy.. mind you this was after 1 margarita . And if you remember, he was following the 1 at a time drink rule. Good to know: I was slick enough to order mimosas with no juice which is just preseco.. be like me the smartcoholicThey only take like 5-6 cards per group so if you have a large party, be sure to have cash for some.

4.0,5/29/2018,"This spot has a DOPE $45 bottomless brunch, if you're more of a fan of the food than the alcohol (which apparently my cousin and I were, since we ordered 9 plates of food but only 3 drinks). Be warned - guacamole and coffee are NOT included in the bottomless option.First off, this spot is actually enormous but I'd advise just reserving a table because it saves all of the anxiety of worrying you won't find a spot, especially because it starts filling up after around 1. We came at 11:30 on Saturday, right when it opened, and at least 10 tables filled up in the first hour we were there.Second, man oh man do the alcoholic drinks SLAP. The mimosas are nothing to write home about (both the guava and lychee were sort of strangely watery in flavor) but the sake sangria is very tasty and VERY STRONG. So if you order one, expect to potentially be knocked on your ass if you're not much of a drinker. Third, the service is alright. They don't really come by for anything than to refill your drinks or take other food orders, but that's okay - it's not really the point of bottomless brunch. But it's not hard to get a waiter's attention so I'm not complaining.Now, the food. Everything is served in a manageable portion - it was just the two of us and we both got plenty off each plate. We ordered: angry zengo roll (not particularly stunning sushi), hoisin pork arepas (very flavorful), Korean fried chicken (so simple yet... so good???), lobster chipotle grits (interesting and very well-seasoned), thai chicken empanadas (a little mealy, but good), pork belly and poblano hash (disappointing but presentation was excellent), citrus cured salmon benedict (pretty citrusy, and the ricecake was delicious), and the croissant bread pudding (delicious!!! order this for sure). They also gave us a complimentary order of a lobster roll (not on the menu but I liked it despite how simple it was). I left feeling very full and though some of the dishes were misses, most of them were hits! All in all, a pretty good bottomless brunch experience.",6,4,3,Kristen L.,"Brooklyn, NY",38,289,87
1.0,5/28/2018,"DO NOT GO HERE!! I am not one to complain and yet I feel the need to rate this place a one star - honestly no star if I could. Zengo is by far the worst restaurant experience I have ever endured in my entire life. I can honestly say I would rather eat at my dining hall in college that I paid $10 to get into that eat here for the $50+ I spent. We came here for our 2pm reservation. The hostess walked us half way and then pointed to a large table. When we sat down, we started ordering our food and began talking amongst ourselves. Out of no where, the hostess comes back and rudely tells us we are in the wrong seat - if she walked us to our table, maybe we wouldn't be in the wrong seat. Whatever, no big deal - we go sit in our seats and wait for our food. We were scared they ordered the food for the wrong table but since they brought out 2 appetizers to the 2nd table we got seated at we figured they knew, right? Nope, were we wrong. At 2:40pm, we ask about our food and the new waitress says ""You didn't order with me so how was I suppose to know?"" If she didn't have our order yet, why didn't she come over to take it? Annoying but okay fine she was busy - she then takes our new order. By 3:20pm, our food finally comes out. You would think if we waited 1 hour and 20 minutes for our food, it would be pretty bomb, right? NOPE - food what somehow overcooked, yet cold...For an all you can eat place, I left not full and not satisfied whatsoever. I had to pick something else up on the way home. I am so disgusted with the behavior of the staff and the quality of the food. I completely understand if the food takes a little longer because they are understaffed but for it to be overcooked and then cold?! Seriously, don't waste your time or money coming here.

There are some good things and there are some excellent things.I would definitely try the arepas, the pork and beef sliders, the fish chicharron, the pork tonkatsu and probably some others I am forgetting.I was a bit disappointed in the ceviche, the pork belly hash and the lobster grits. The ceviche was severely lacking in shrimp and had a very one dimensional flavor, the pork belly hash was just whole potatoes with a small amount of pork belly and and some green sauce, and the lobster grits were just grits flavored with lobster broth. I think I found one dime sized piece of lobster in the whole thing. The drinks were very good though with the exception of the Bloody Mary. All of the mimosas and sangrias were excellent. I think the restaurant knows their bloody Mary's are not very good because I saw multiple being taken back(just like mine) and no questions were asked. The dessert small plates were also excellent. The bread pudding and the  chocolate waffle were great.Overall this place is definitely an AMAZING deal and is way better than most places that serve brunch.

So although some people were early by 2 it was sad for the people who came later and had to pay 45 for less than 2 hours.

After a long awkward silence, I said ""Um, we're just gunna be 2""...like HELLO acknowledge that you even see me. That's when the hostess goes ""we're closed"". Oh, I get it now, you're closed for pre-dinner prep. you could've told me that when I walked in, ya know...like a hostess would do. So we left. Ended up going to Hendricks only a few blocks down.

One of our party didn't have his ID which we figured didn't matter because we were with our kids and didn't want alcohol. (We only wanted the unlimited food option) So after some confusion and her realizing his ID didn't matter we got our menus and were ready to order. We figured we'd get a few things to start and as the meal progressed, order more. She went on to state that there were a lot of people waiting and the kitchen was busy so we should order everything right away.

However, I went yesterday for brunch with 4 other friends and it was a mess. Our reservation was for 2:00pm but we didn't get seated until after 10-15 minutes. Understandable because the restaurant was packed. Once seated it took a while for our waiter to get to us and we didn't even get water until 20 minutes after. The waiter didn't let us put in specific orders on the basis that it would get confusing and that it was easier to bring out the more popular items - we agreed. They did well in terms of refilling our mimosas - def. recommend the guava and lychee ones. Now here is where they lost me, the food took FOREVER to come. I should not be paying $42 for an ""unlimited food"" brunch to end up leaving hungry. As per the waiter, the kitchen was backed up and although he apologized several times, the service still left much to be desired. Most of all, we didn't even get all the plates he said they would bring nor the ones we requested. At one point, he just kept bringing plates of the same thing (which we hadn't even ordered in the first place) and it honestly felt like we were getting the leftover plates that other groups didn't want. From the few things we tried I def. recommend the korean chicken (delicious!), the fish chicharron, the empanadas, and the sliders (to die for!). The sushi was ok and I would skip the dumplings. We met a group of the girls in the bathroom who said their table was full of food so that tells me they're now geared towards big groups more than anything.

The dishes came out during the right times so we didn't have a table too crowded with food. Service was great. Attentive and quick. Would come back again and maybe try their bottomless brunch!,1,0,0,Nhu H.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,46,0

It was a birthday celebration of my friend so I was kind of hoping it better be good.So lets start talking about the place first. So we walk in into this huge 3 level restaurant which is a rare sight in New York City. The place is brimming with people still doesn't seem to be crowded. The vibe, the music , decor ,everything was great.Lets get to the food and cocktails now. We ordered the Zengo margarita which was really refreshing and slightly different from regular margarita must try if you are at Zengo.Food we ordered a lot of food and everything tasted great. And most of my group was vegetarian so I was surprised to see so many options to order from. They have a separate vegan,vegetarian and gf menu.The chicken pot stickers, veggie pot stickers were really good, shishito peppers were average, fried rice was amazing, the tofu entree  was amazing don't remember what it's called, we also got the veggie tacos and roll. They also got a complimentary birthday dessert which was the Tres leches it was damn tasty.Overall great experience  at Zengo will visit again.Perfect for a special occasion , date night or just a night out with friends.",0,0,0,Natasha B.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,18,76

2.0,2/3/2018,"So my friends and I reserved a table of 8 for 8:30 pm under Restaurant week.  We got to there early and was going get a drink or go to the lounge.  They were able to seat us for our reservation early.  This was about 7:20.  We were excited to eat, and they were very prompt at the beginning of our service.  Little did we realized everything kind of went down hill after that.  So the rest of our party got here about 8:05, meanwhile we ordered some drinks and appetizers. Drinks were great, as well as the spicy crab guacamole.  We then decide to order our food.  We all opt for the 3-course prefix meal for restaurant week.  We slowly got our first sign of food about 8:56.  It was busy so we didn't think it was horrible wait when we ordered around 8:22. Next part of our meal came out at 9:23... not horrible but then only 6 out of 8 was served their meal.  We waited and waited then spoke up about it.  Somehow we did not get our last two plates for our two friends at the table.  No one came to check, and our server was missing or busy with other tables.  So we waited for a manager to approach us, he did come by but did not speak to any of us.  I wondered why... Our server did apologize but did not tell us what happened. She did mentioned that the chef said all plates were out and completed.  Our two friends waited almost 9:54 to get their plates.  We also just asked them for our desserts and they rushed it out with their plates as well.  Till the end of our meal we were still waiting to speak to someone, but no luck.  I guess because we were a large group and during restaurant week we did not matter to the manager.  We left the restaurant with no explanation or accommodations on their end. So sadly we could not enjoy our food.  I say the short ribs was really good along with the spider roll and kimchi soup.  The mahi mahi was very bland.  The dessert wasn't too crazy, I think the apple pie was hard, and very uneven filling.  The ice cream overpowered both desserts.  Check the pictures as always and my IG Jliueats/ LcrazyaznL",4,0,0,Jeff L.,"Rego Park, NY",1270,143,1785

1.0,1/25/2018,I would not suggest this restaurant to anyone. I was very clear with the server that I have allergies to shellfish & mushrooms.  I went over all  of my options.  All was going well or so I thought. I can eat regular fish so I ordered the hamachi croquetts (it was restaurant week & it was one of the appetizer options).  One bite made me nauseous as they were so terribly fishy!  I have eaten hamachi in sushi & have not had this reaction.  The server replaced it with chicken empanadas. I cut into it & saw the server running towards me. It turns out that the sauce is shellfish based. Who does that !!!!.  My meal was salmon atop bokchoy & mote corn which ended up being a very small cube of salmon atop bok choy STEMS and cold hominy right out of a can.  I was so disappointed in my meal.  I would warn people to stay away.  I looked at their other reviews and they were equa lly as unfavorable.,0,0,0,Nikki B.,"Springfield, MA",0,5,0

Glad we got there at 11:45! Once you are seated, bottomless food and bottomless drinks start coming.

I know this might bother a lot of people but they will randomly bring you out food that you never ordered but won't bring out food that you actually ordered. This may have to do with the fact that when they take your order they don't write anything down and they are pretty busy so they probably just put in random orders. This didn't really bother me though as we were able to try a lot of different things, especially ones we wouldn't typically order and none of us really have Foods we don't eat. A lot of the food also comes out cold/ looking like it's been sitting out for a while but taste is perfectly normal. The chips in the chicken chilaquiles were very soggy but flavor was good. My favorite was the plantains, grits, and Thai chicken empanada. Drinks are pretty good as well and they will keep refilling it (usually not with the same drink you previously had but also not weird combos). They refilled my friends grapefruit mimosa with orange juice based mimosa- it didn't taste bad but like why?The restaurant itself is pretty nice- very spacious and nice decor.

4.0,1/18/2018,"WHAT TO DO WHEN EATING ALONE IN NYC: Well, if you're around 3rd Ave and 40th Street in mid-town East, and medium loud techno-EDM and Latin-Asian fusion is of appeal, then you should head down to Zengo.  Easy enough to find a table on this Thursday evening.  The dishes all sound appealing and reasonable, but rather than ordering too much (and wasting as I am on the road and human-baggie home is not an option ) I restrained and ordered the Miso soup (Mexicano / Mediterraneo twist with chipotle and a tomato base) and Shrimp in lettuce wrap, the latter as good as any lettuce wrap that I can remember from a Chinese restaurant. It's a cold evening and I am looking forward to the hot soup, and while the Chipotle added the right amount of spice-heat, the first serving of soup was temperature tepid, but no worries, the friendly waiter had no problem bringing it back and serving a fresh bowl that is piping hot in temperature as well. This is well balanced by the fresh crisp cool of the lettuce wrap.  I was still a tad hungry but was warned that the ""Main"" and ""Wok"" dishes would be substantial, and aside from waste, from a personal health perspective, I subscribe to the ""eat only when hungry"" dictum. The solution is to ask for a bowl of rice, nicely sticky short grain topped with savory dashi ( but here overpriced at $6 a bowl of plain white rice) that is perfect for draining off the remainder of the shrimp filling (with a chorizo-peanut-cilantro sauce and tamarind chutney).  Well complemented by the Kitachino pale Ale ($12, fair value but for that price I would prefer a Trappist Ale).  I did overindulge with the Pear tart ( well complemented by the blue cheese crumble and almond crumbs surrounding the puff pastry - yoghurt ice cream.  Ate well alone tonight, again!

Firstly, we had a lunch reservation and the hostess wanted to seat us by the drafty entrance which we immediately nixed.  Also the seats at that table had huge rips in several spots and the padding of the seat was exposed.  This didn't give me a good sign of things to come -- it was very tacky and showed a lack of upkeep and attention to detail and ambience. We were then sat at a table in the middle of the restaurant. The table was dirty with bits of food left behind. It was 12:15 or so... I can't imagine how long those bits and pieces of food were there. My menu had a blob of what I believe was soy sauce on it. My glass was streaked with lipstick and the waitress had to immediately replace it while she was pouring our waters.  She even noticed how dirty it was right away! We then ordered appetizers. Arepas, empanadas and tuna tacos with a sushi roll. The sushi roll was not good -- the fish was clearly not fresh.  The empanadas were good. The arepa looked great but was a letdown.  I expected a sweet corn arepa with a very moist, flavorful brisket topping and unfortunately the arepa was cold and tasteless.  The tuna taco was ok.  When the table was cleared we were told just to give the plates and leave the silverware. Yuck. The silverware we had was dirty from the sauce of the empanadas and arepas. Can't you change out  the silverware from course to course?  At these prices it is the least you can do! Then we waited 45 minutes for our entrees. The table next to us that sat after we did received their entrees and were halfway through their meal and we didn't even receive ours. When our food finally did arrive it was underwhelming.  I had the vegetariano sandwich. It was ok. I was expecting avocado on my sandwich as per the menu description and I got a schmear of guacamole with a little goat cheese. The mushroom tempura was more tempura than mushroom. I expected a nice big mushroom cap but this was a thin slice of portabello encased in a thick tempura batter. The fries were ok. They tasted as if they were frozen.  To top it off (so to speak) my bun had been placed on the grill too long and had charred burnt marks that marred the flavor of the brioche bun.  My dining companion ordered her burger rare and the temperature was a big miss -- her burger was beyond well done.  She said she was so hungry but eating the burger was impossible and that it tasted like sand.

Nelly and Tim McGraw combined their melodic genius to create Over and Over, Goku and Vegeta came together to save the world as Gogeta, and Shakira teamed up with Beyonce to bring every young man even closer to their ultimate fantasy. We have another great collab and this time it's to bless out taste buds with a merriment of flavors. Zengo NYC is busy combining Asian and Latin American cuisine to bless us with amazing eats.The restaurant, sitting on the corner of 3rd and 40th in Manhattan, is a restaurant with décor just as beautiful as the plates booming out the kitchen. The high ceilings and intimate lighting give the perfect setting for an intimate date night with your crush. On another note, and what we'll be focusing on in this review, Zengo brightens up during the day time to bring forth a very inviting brunch atmosphere.  Zengo's brunch offers something that isn't normally seen though ought New York City. In fact, it's something that I thought was only native to the streets of Washington D.C. This restaurant not only offers an array of bottomless cocktails for your bruchaholic pleasure (except the margarita, go with the sake sangria if you're looking for your drink to hit because that rita was basura), but also provides a bountiful food option of unlimited tapas for your brunching pleasure. Prepare to be carrying a hefty food baby after downing all of this.Tapas are in my opinion the most ideal way to brunch. With brunch already being such a communal event where Brunch is a community event. The joy and excitement that illuminates you spans to the rest of the table every time you and the squad unite. It 100% makes sense that while a carafe of the bottomless nectar from the gawds is being passed around, multiple plates are also being circulated so that everybody can share in both the love and the food.Zengo offers a magnificent array of tapas for you to indulge in. Ceviche meets sushi, dim sum links with antojitos, and cultures unite on each plate. You'll want to take a bite of the peking duck and scrambled egg steamed buns. The light and fluffy greatness of the bun is stuffed with a succulent duck that comes dressed with gochujang sauce. The surprise flavor winner of all of this however is the pickled pineapple that brings that final pop to the dish.The tapas possibilities continues with fish chicharron, chicken chilaqueles, Korean fried chicken, pork belly poblano hash, and much more. Sometimes when looking at brunch prices we think, ""is it worth it?"". Sitting at a calm $42, the answer is a clear yes at Zengo.Follow me on my food journey!

Not to sound girly but it was very pretty inside - the decor and ambience of the place was really nice. We opted for the ""unlimited small plates & mimosas for $45"" deal and I must say I loved how there were a ton of choices unlike some brunch spots that only have a handful of things. Most of the foods were Asian/Spanish fusion and they had a variety of mimosa flavors that you could switch to. (Try the lychee mimosa - yum!!). Keep in mind, these plates are SMALL and meant to share. They bring out enough for one per person. For example, if you are a table of 6 and you get the Thai Chicken Empanadas, you will literally get 6. So double up if you individually want more.The only thing I would say that got annoying was how slow service could be at times. Our waiter literally disappeared for 25 minutes at a time, where we couldn't make our 2nd or 3rd orders promptly. By the time we ordered for more and got our food, most of us were getting full. An hour after we arrived there were a good amount of people coming in, but it wasn't busy enough where we should've waited that long. On top of that we didn't get all our food.

4.0,9/18/2017,"Bottomless brunch. Come hungry, come sober. Lol. We came on the Sunday of Labor Day weekend (be sure to reserve your table in advance because the place does fill up quickly). We were seated in a corner booth near that back of the huge, open restaurant. The high ceiling really made you feel like you were in an upscale establishment. So for $45.00 a person you get unlimited small plates and unlimited, mimosas, margaritas, sangria, you name it. We were a party of 3 so we'd each order something different then taste each other's. Throughout the brunch we had their Shrimp Ceviche, Angry Zengo Roll, Salted Edamame, Thai Chicken Empanadas, Peking Duck & Scrambled Egg Steam Buns, Angus Beef & Pork Sliders, Bacon Fried Rice, Korean Fried Chicken, Lobster-Chipotle Grits, Citrus Cured Salmon Benedict and the Asian Pear Salad. Man, we were full. Combining all that food with the 4 different mimosas, margaritas, sangrias and 2 types of bloody marys... we were done for the day. Lol. All the food was absolutely incredible. There wasn't really a single entree that stood out from the others, I just absolutely in love with the idea of having all the plates out and being able to share them all. Now, I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 because of the service. It wasn't all that busy, but we certainly felt neglected. You only get 2 hours (timed from when you order the first whatever drink/food) to indulge. After our first round of drinks it felt like maybe 10 whole minutes passed before we could even make eye contact with our waitress even though she was nearby. This wasn't the only time that happened. We're drinkers, so we tryin' to get our fill! Anyway, that was my only gripe. Unlimited good food, good company and good drinks... what more could you want?

They were hot and fresh, golden crisp on the outside with a very light dressing of mojo garlic sauce that did not saturate or soften their crispness, but with their heat, created a mouth-watering aroma over the whole table.

The main floor and second floor is rustic, chic, and romantic with windows and chandeliers everywhere.

We got past this part and i was just thrilled that this woman wasn't going to be our server for this experience. The space looks well decorated and with plenty of natural light coming through their large windows on the main floor. There are three floors but the upstairs was off limits at the time, likely because the restaurant was pretty empty, and I didn't make it downstairs but that was where the bathrooms apparently were located. When we sat down we were served a drink and our server suggested that we allow her to just send dishes out to our table which seemed like a great approach since I'm the type that would try anything in the realm of food. After this point the my experience just felt like I was on a very slow sinking ship. The service was extraordinarily slow for a less than half full restaurant. There were points where I found myself trying to get anyone's attention for service only to be ignored or when someone would finally  acknowledge us for simple requests for food, clean plates or drinks they would never come back with our requests. The food took a long time to come out and the temperature of everything that came out was cold. The quality of the food seemed on par with what you'd find at your local grocery store frozen food section. Although the portions were small I found that nothing on the menu was really worth eating but if you find yourself here for business, to support a birthday etc., I'd say that the arepas, empanadas and chocolate waffles were ok. I tried to make up for the food with drinks (which were only ok and on the sweet side) but, most of the time getting a refill was a challenge and I ended up settling with lychee mimosas.This space has potential and looks nice but everything else from the quality of the food and staff needs work.

All we're so delicious, but warning that the tuna tostada was on the small side. We also got martinis (dirty and lychee) which we're both very strong. Overall our bill was $80 which is pretty great for all that was ordered. Great food, drinks and service so I would definitely recommend- especially for a big birthday group or a first date. Brunch: On sat and sun Zengo offers a bottomless drinks and bottomless plates for only $45! I went with a group of 6 on a Sunday at 12:30pm and it wasn't crowded at all. The waiter was very attentive and brunch drinks were flowing the whole time. Hey have a large selection of drinks which is super rare for a bottomless brunch.

The shrimp ceviche and the sushi rolls left a little to be desired but everything else was delicious. Our absolute favorites were empanadas, salmon Benedict on potato pancake, and a simple sweet and sour chicken dish.Lastly, they have an awesome downstairs that I would suspect gets wild on weekends.

We were sat in a very comfortable alcove booth but then spent the next 15 minutes trying to get a servers attention so that we could get started. This frustrating period aside, the service was actually great and we were frequently asked if we wanted anything else, brought fresh drinks when we were low and reminded that we still had time to order more if we wanted. The menu was also extremely promising - I wanted almost everything on offer, which made the bottomless brunch all the more appealing. What they do well is they cater the portion sizes to your group - so if you're in a group of 8 you only need order one set of sliders and will get one each, while if you're in a group of two (like we were) you will only get 2 - as much as I like the idea of having to make my way through the larger portion size, it would ultimately be at the expense of some of the other items. What let the venue down was the quality of the food. Most of the dishes were disappointing. It was a week ago that we went and I can't think of a dish that I would recommend. Definitely a good spot for big groups, especially if you're celebrating something. The price is also very reasonable at $45 each.

4.0,5/26/2017,"I hate going to east midtown. Loathe. But if it's for two hours of bottomless drinks AND food, then I'll make the journey cross town to the 3.5 star venue that is Zengo.Zengo has been a boozy go to for nearly two years and I recently hosted a belated birthday brunch.  In my experience, the service has been on point for groups but lags a little when you're just a couple or in a group of four.  I believe the key to having a great time is communication.  If you haven't been here, your server explains how the deal works and what is available to you on the menu.  Unfortunately, if you don't like different flavors of already made mimosas or sangria you're out of luck as they don't substitute (but are we surprised by that? no.). As the timer starts, it's important to tell your server what you want to eat each time they come back.  The space is absolutely massive and there are large groups - of bros - scattered everywhere so for them its easiest to bring out everything on the menu, which can be fine except when you already have your favorite foods in mind. I have always made it clear from the beginning I would like to choose my foods and I feel lucky I don't have any allergies or religious restrictions, as the servers tend to forget to advise what you can or cannot eat.  When I visited recently, a server was so swamped she hadn't told us - or my friend, rather - what he could and couldn't eat so he sat there eyeballing each plate carefully.  We made it work but, it should not have been too difficult for them to do.  Otherwise, servers have been on point with re-fills but quick to assume you want the same drink throughout the meal.  On top of this, you need to keep an eye on the clock, as they end the two hour deal right on the button so if you're late you're simply out of luck. As my glasses change from passion to lychee to passion to blood orange mimosas or sake my plates change too.  I always enjoyed the Korean Fried Chicken, Chicken Empanadas, Peking Duck buns and Mexican Chocolate Waffle.  Though none of them taste unique they are all delicious, are good quality and hit the spot. (Although I have to say the sushi isn't too impressive as I remember but the fact that it is an option among Latin food is pretty cool.) There are other options as well like their sliders, spicy fruit salads or lobster grits.  They say food and drinks bring people together and it certainly does! The space itself is massive and has rope-suspended wooden beams, windows soaking the tables with sun, a huge iron chandelier and a tequila lounge tucked away downstairs.  Upstairs is a mystery to me but it looks as though that is where they seat large parties but if you're one to explore a venue just go downstairs.  The bathrooms are there and it's a little trippy when you wash your hands as that is the only way to get a peak into the men's room (you see the bros washing their hands).  It's quiet down there somehow as upstairs is incredibly buzzy with loud conversations and music.  If you sit in the back towards the right - just up two tiny steps - you're just under the speaker which is unfortunate since it can completely halt a conversation.  Though when one person points out that it's way too loud they can be quick enough to save your ear drums the next time someone says, ""Hey, want to go to Zengo?""",1,2,1,Anna F.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",262,241,2187
3.0,5/22/2017,"This is honestly a tough one. In theory, it would be a great spot for brunch that I had just attended for a friend's belated birthday this weekend, but they fell so horribly short. It's one of those experiences where you leave confused and are on this scale between 2 and 5 stars. What do I go with? The healthy medium, I guess. Initially, I guess it was our fault that half of our party was grossly late. I showed up relatively on time at 1pm. Some people didn't arrive though until 1:30 or 2pm. Don't worry though, since they state that brunch is 2 hours long, they'll make sure to snatch the plate you're eating off of from under your nose - it was 3:05pm. I checked. The benefits and plus side of the brunch - you get a large array of drinks and food options to pick from. I'm pretty sure I tried almost everything off of the menu. We went with letting the staff and server pick their best brunch foods off the menu for our larger group. It was a great idea, and I trusted her. Although, we did state from the beginning that one of our friends couldn't eat pork for religious reasons and also there was a severe peanut allergy at the table. She said she would make note of that but she unfortunately did not at all. Most of the dishes we were never even told what they were. It was like they grabbed a dish off of a conveyor belt and threw it down as fast as possible and ran away to refill drinks. The actual food was pretty good. Not $60 worth of food ($40 unlimited fee plus tax/tip). Another trifle, another friend didn't want to really drink, doesn't like fruity cocktails that much because he's a dude and it upsets his stomach, but they didn't say there was an option for just eating the food. He had one margarita and still had to pay the full brunch fee. Drinks were strong, the food was a neat Asian-Mexican Fusion. My personal favorite cocktail I tried was the Blood Orange Mimosa.Favorites of the brunch food items - Thai Chicken Empanadas, the Peking Duck and scrambled egg bao buns (that we were told were made with pork), the Korean Fried Chicken, Fish Chicharron, and the Mexican Chocolate Waffle. Nothing was exactly bad. The sushi they serve isn't remarkable. It kind of reminds me of Kroger's brand sushi. Probably the worst sushi comparison I can probably give for a restaurant. You'll eat it, because it's sushi and it's there but its just meh and covered with spicy mayonnaise. All of it. The lobster grits were the most disappointing. It was soup. Which is not how you make grits. You needed a spoon (which we didn't have) to eat it and there was zero lobster I could taste or see. The Korean fried chicken and some other asian fusion noms made it more worth it. The chicken chilaquiles wasn't bad either. We definitely left full but it was still disappointing. Mostly, on the service. I wish they would have asked if we were done eating, especially for the people that arrived late, instead of snatching away a bunch of plates in a frenzied haze. The music at one point also escalated to a level where you had to scream on the top of your lungs to talk to the person next to you. It was also clubby bro music, which the table in the middle of the room I could tell was loving and chair dancing to. All in all, with that being said, I can't justify the price tag for it. Maybe if it was like a solid five dollars cheaper if they're going to set a timer while I eat.",7,4,5,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",843,1384,11457
4.0,5/18/2017,"This is a GREAT brunch spot in NYC for unlimited food + drinks. It's a great place to have a celebration as they can accommodate large groups and the service is pretty fast even during the busy brunch times (make sure to make a reservation in advance). It's two hours of all you can eat and drink brunch items and there really are lots of different options for all types of diets. Additionally, they have many options for drinks, which is rare for bottomless brunches in the city. For large groups, they bring out platters of everything, one at a time and you honestly can leave VERY full. They were also pretty good at topping off everyone's drinks. You can also ask them to repeat items from the menu if there is something you especially liked. There are a decent amount of items for vegetarians as well and they can make one or two meat dishes vegetarian if you ask. Items also include fruit and dessert so you really get to try lots of different things and it becomes a full course meal. Everything I had was pretty good (loved the salads surprisingly and the corn bread!) The two hours start as soon as the first person in your group is seated (and served) so plan accordingly. The food focuses on more asian fusion but they do some nice twists to traditional breakfast items. If you want a little more sophisticated bottomless brunch option in the city, definitely try Zengo. For what you're getting, the price is worth it.",0,0,0,Ridd M.,"Montclair, NJ",193,83,70

They were pretty good with the reservation and organization, but once we got there, the service was quite disappointing. The servers were rude and, coming from a customer service background myself, I have no tolerance for that. I expect a group of 20 people to be relatively tough to handle, but there's no excuse for rude service. Especially when we had a reservation and they should have been prepared for slight chaos with a large group. The food was average. I ate the Barbecued Organic Salmon. It was a bit dry, but tasted decent. None of my friends complained about their food, and therefore the 3 stars.",0,0,0,Taniya D.,"Iselin, NJ",52,17,13

While they have a nice selection of mimosas as part of their bottomless brunch, our table of 8 found it very difficult to ever find a waiter or waitress to ask for another round and we were seated next to the bar.

4.0,4/25/2017,"Hands down, best bottomless brunch in the city! I hosted my birthday brunch there on a Sunday afternoon with 10 girlfriends. I'll do my best to provide a comprehensive review to encourage you to make your reservation pronto.SERVICE: A few weeks prior, I made a reservation via OpenTable. The restaurant called in advance to confirm, at which point I had to modify the reservation. No problem. They were accommodating. Upon arrival, the hostess was friendly and noted that as soon as our party was seated, our 2-hour window would begin. I waited until the majority of my party arrived to sit down. Immediately, our waitress NATALIE (shout out to her!) started filling our glasses with water and taking our drink orders.  The wait staff was on point clearing empty plates and keeping our drinks flowing.  I never had to ask for a refill, NATALIE was THAT good! Let the party begin!FOOD:  Food is served tapas style, unlimited! Like, you can basically try everything on your menu. Eat your heart out! We let Natalie know of our top preferences (food items we wanted to try immediately) and the rest was totally free reign.  The plates started coming out.  And, they never stopped, it seemed! Every item was DELICIOUS. Top picks included the crispy fish, salmon Benedict, veggie/shrimp pot stickers and veggie fried rice.  They were kind to consider some of my guests' food restrictions (i.e. vegan/vegetarian) and placed the orders accordingly.  The food was good, y'all! My stomach could only hold so much! And, don't let me forget that after you've stuffed your face with all of the entrees, they brought out trays of desserts, including a sweet chocolate waffle with a candle for my birthday! (Thank you!)DRINKS: Delicious! Delicious! Delicious! My drinks of choice were the sake sangria (sneaks up on you and wasn't watered down) and lychee mimosa.  OVERALL EXPERIENCE: Great ambiance, plenty of space for large parties, excellent service, not too noisy, great food and drinks!

This time I came here to meet friends from school but the dinner plan didn't work for me because I got there late and it's time for happy hour downstairs. So I had a few minutes with my friends at a table. Beautiful ambience. If you like a high ceiling restaurant, this is the place.

1.0,4/9/2017,"I am a person that doesn't post reviews. It's a love-hate thing for me. So, if you are in New York and going to spend $200+ on dinner for 4, I suggest you go elsewhere. The service was horrendous. We sat around for 20 minutes hoping someone would acknowledge our presence in a half empty space on a Saturday night. No luck. I finally flagged someone down to ask if there was a server for our table. Turns out he was. It took another 5 minutes for him to find out he was our server. So, we asked for another server. One of us made a mistake and went the wrong way to the bathroom - mistaking the kitchen for the bathroom - and was yelled at for her efforts. Suffice it to say, the staff is not friendly. For the food, it was average a best. We tried several apps - 1/2 were good and the other 1/2 were not good and we couldn't eat them. We went there because they promoted a solid gluten-free offering. Two of the people at our table are celiac. Their meals were on par with the wait staff's capabilities - horrendous!Finally, we wanted to leave. Now, we did have a lot of half eaten food on the table, so I am sure we were sending mixed messages about being done. However, it still took 20 minutes to see our waiter again. And, not once during the meal did he ask how the meal was tasting. Not once. The manager sat up at the bar and chatted up the wait staff. It was pretty frustrating. I waited tables all through college. And, I was trained properly. You greet people with a smile, you ask people sitting there looking concerned if they need help, you offer suggestions on the best things to eat and drink, you check in on the table (not too often, but occasionally), you treat them with respect if they make a mistake and you pay attention enough to see when they are looking like they are ready to go. I'll chalk this one up to lack of engagement and lack of training. Regardless, go elsewhere with your money.",0,0,0,Jackie C.,"Concord, NC",3,3,0

Flavorful and was an added touch to have the bottomless mimosas. I came for a surprise party so we had approx 22 people. A few more people showed up and the manager did not accommodate my friend. This we sat way too close to one another with barely room to breath. 1 waiter for 22 people was not enough and they brought 2 rounds of tapas and it wasn't enough food for the amount of people. As I'm sitting here the waiter hasn't even showed up in 45 min. I don't even blame him I'm sure the manager had him running all over the place. When he was here he handled the group professionally. I haven't decided if I would come back or not, if the service and atmosphere remains the same I prob won't come back.This just in .... because they wouldn't accommodate extra people they just told a 90 year old woman she had to leave.

4.0,3/20/2017,"Well, well, well. After continuously forgetting that I've been here, I finally remembered and decided to slap down a review. THIS IS FOR HAPPY HOUR. I have been to happy hour upstairs once and downstairs twice. Front once and back three times. From the windoooooooooowwwww to the wall. Just kidding about the last two. I'm uncomfortably full from my lunch right now, unrelated to Zengo. I made an omelette. Don't you find that if you don't eat all day, your stomach is shrively and you don't have as much room? Anyway, don't worry about having that problem at Zengo. The happy hour bites are cheap (around $6) but like the size of two grapes. Perhaps don't eat that much if you plan on going and eating the bites. If you're really hungry you either have to fill up your pie hole with a lot of happy hour drink liquid or go to the restaurant for dinner. Good thing about the happy hour food is the number of choices (there's a lot). I cannot comment on the flavor because I have not ordered one myself. On to the happy hour drink liquid. Happy hour deals are between decent and pretty good. Allow me to tell you and you can decide for yourself. $8 gets you a marg or caipirinha (add mango or strawberry fresh fruit puree for $1 extra). Beers are 5. Standard Mexican beers. House wines are $7. I've had both the marg and caip and both are really good. If you have a low alcohol tolerance like me or if you followed my suggestion and didn't eat that much, you'll get plastered quickly. Additionally, there is a bartender that is jacked AF and smokin'. I hope you appreciate how difficult it is to decide between 3 and 4 stars. Why ISN'T there a 3.5??? COME ON YELP. Fine. The ambiance, which I enjoy, It's kinda modernesque will bump it up to 4. Please don't ask me to describe ambiances.

4.0,3/6/2017,"I've been here three times for very different occasions. This weekend: Sunday bottomless (unlimited food and drink) brunch for a birthday party of roughly 20 people. It was awesome. For $42, all the yummy Mexican/Asian fusion your stomach can hold, topped off with unlimited mimosas of every variation, margaritas, and bloody Marys. For this size group they literally ""brought out a sampling of everything on the menu"" which was awesome but also in some ways was a shame. We are big eaters but so much food went to waste. The biggest downfall for me was that they brought out many things to start that filled us up that we didn't care much about and then after we were truly stuffed, they freely brought another 5-7 courses that were probably better than many of the first courses. When I do this again, which I will, I will specifically ask for certain items only to avoid filling up on stuff we don't care about (mediocre sushi, ceviche that I wasn't ready for at 11:45am, tortilla chips) and saving our appetites for the best stuff (arepas, pork belly with poached egg, salmon Benedict, nacho things, katsu, empanadas, etc.)Months ago, my Brandeis University hosted an alumni event here. It was awesome. Same food. Open bar. Incredible event. I would highly recommend hosting a large event here. And many months ago, I came here for drinks and sat in the basement. It was cool for meeting a small group of friends in a lively, fun, dimly lit spot. All in all, this place has a cool, big space with accommodating service.

We had reserved a table for 10 so we just went family style on everything. All their dishes are really meant for family style I feel. We tried so many dishes I lost count but some memorable ones were the chicken chilaquiles, Mexican chocolate waffle and fish chicharron. I think I liked trying everything. The only thing memorable enough that I noted I greatly disliked was their peking duck and scrambled egg steam buns. Their gochujang sauce was overpowering. It was too much sauce. Not worth filling the stomach. Also their Korean fried chicken pieces are huge. Like gigantic drum sticks so that was beast to eat.

She had a bunch of preselected items that came out in rounds and if there was anything we wanted we just had to ask. Half the time when we asked for something off the menu it was already in the works to come out to the table. Our drinks were never empty. She made sure to keep filling our drinks as well as our water. The margaritas and mimosas were delish. The food. I was in taste bud heaven. Everything was delicious. We had almost everything off the brunch menu. And everything came out quick. I was worried about the 2 hour time limit for such a big group but I had to slow myself down halfway through. So kudos to the kitchen and wait staff on that one. My only complaint is that I wish I knew what was coming out in advance to save them the trouble of wasting food. No one touched the tofu. Simple fix and I know to ask in advance next time. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place for a GREAT brunch experience.,0,0,0,Shaza K.,"Paterson, NJ",0,7,0
2.0,1/23/2017,"My friend had her birthday dinner here so we were a big group. They sat us right in front of the entrance although the place was fairly empty so we were freezing. The food took awhile which is reasonable because we each ordered appetizers and entrees. The service was meh. Not too friendly or fast. They were very strict with checking ID's, both at the bar and the table. The atmosphere was good, suitable for large groups with high ceiling and nice decor. The food was mediocre at best. Some of the better ones were the crab guacamole, lettuce wrap, miso cod and steak. The sashimi platter was NOT great. Tasted like something you'd get from your cheap local sushi restaurants, wagyu beef was one of the worst I've tasted. Foie gras pork dumplings were not great either. There are way too many good restaurants around here so probably won't be back :(",1,0,0,Kristina P.,"BEECHHURST, NY",149,136,66

The happy hour flavored margaritas were also not bad for house mags, very tasty! Then we sat down for dinner and ordered the Angry Zengo roll and the Arepas which were also tasty and filling.

Service is uncoordinated, inexperienced and generally not making you fee good. Food is ok but some entrees came at random times and main course (miso black cod) was cold. Some parts of the fish were Below room temperature. Which means it was cooked before and warmed up later. Restaurant was completely empty. We wanted a larger table but the waitress told us it was ""reserved"" and then manager came and said that too. They lied. We were there for a while and nobody showed up.

End to end and always having to ask someone to find our waiter constantly the meal took about 2 hours and 30 minutes. If you care about service, this is not a good local spot.

5.0,12/14/2016,"I planned a birthday brunch at Zengo because I was really impressed with their menu, especially the unlimited food and drinks, and they had great reviews. Making a reservation for my group of 18 was easy, and they were very accommodating when I called to switch the number of people. Although some people arrived late, they did not rush us and had our table ready. The waitress took everyone's order for what their first drink would be, and you were allowed to switch throughout. I do think putting pitchers on the table, as opposed to one glass at a time may be a better option for larger groups, as some people have to constantly wait and then flag down the waitress to get their next drink. I showed the waitress the main things on the menu that we wanted and they brought out multiple of each for everyone. We had the wings, empanadas, lobster grits, waffles, plantains, ceviche, and a bunch of other things. As the brunch went on, we were able to ask for more of a certain dish or request to bring out something different. I loved how quick and efficient service went in regards to food.

If you do end up going here or just come for drinks do not miss the guacamole with the crab!    Ribeye tacos were very nice, too. miso cod was pretty good.My problem may have been I brought a group of 14, on a relatively quiet Saturday night and though the restaurant wasn't busy, and of course we planned in advance, perhaps they just could not handle it. Our first round of drinks at the table took forever to come out, our appetizers took forever to come out, then came with some entrées, and those of us who want to did not have time to order third drinks because the staff was letting us enjoy our meals and not keeping an eye on the table.My father, who had two martinis before meeting us, actually ended up getting sick from it taking so long to get our food.  In my 39 years, I have never seen that happen to him before. He is Mr. iron stomach! LOL!!Though our waiter was responsive and a sweet person, neither he nor the other staff were particularly attentive. later, after speaking with him and the manager, not too much changed, and therefore I believe it to be a systemic issue.  If the room was rearranged a bit, I believe most of their problems would take care of themselves.",1,1,1,Harris B.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",32,74,11

The options included in the unlimited brunch had a lot of variety (margaritas, multiple mimosas, sake sangria, and Bloody Mary). The waiter also automatically put through orders of the entire menu for us so that we did not have to go through the trouble of ordering for the table. However, there were some options that we should have opted out of since no one ended up touching them (including the veggie sushi dish). Some notable dishes include the empanadas, dumplings, edamame, arepas and all desserts, which I highly recommend.Food is probably better during other service times, but the service definitely made the experience much more enjoyable.",0,0,0,Wei P.,"New York, NY",24,63,41

It's tapas style so you can literally have a huge variety of foods and cuisines while you brunch. Also, their drink menus. Most brunch spots offer mimosas but Zengo you can choose from a list of 5-6 different drinks for the two hours you brunch. The only thing missing is music. Zengo is a beautiful restaurant the food is amazing, but it's not a party brunch at all.

Wheras, the New York location seems to only care about serving WEAK drinks in a short 3hr period, getting your money, and sending you on your way.  Their food is equally as yummy, its just their beverage options and service isn't as good as other locations I've had the pleasure of dining at. In short, its going to take you at least six margaritas before feeling tipsy!  And I would never expect to get drunk at bottomless brunch.   Their drinks are some of the weakest in the city.",3,1,0,Ann F.,"New York, NY",224,276,538

The good news is that there is something for everyone. The bad news is that you wonder if this place has an identity crisis, and how on earth they can specialize in so many types of cuisines. There is chicken Adobo (Filipino), sushi (Japanese), empanadas (Latin American), chicken sandwich (American) etc.I decided to go with the bento box opti n for lunch- there were 2 kinds, one with ice cream, the other with papaya salad instead. I had the bento box with the angry sushi roll, papaya salad, and salmon.The angry sushi was good, but it was a little small. They also put a lot of dressing on top of the sushi, perhaps the chef was angry and decided to put a lot of dressing? The papaya salad was not very good, it was a bit soggy and really wasn't that tasty at all. Papaya salad is supposed to be nice and crunch, with delicious sour dressing on it. This one was a limp papaya salad that lacked flavor. The salmon was good, and rice was ok. You also get a small portion of green vegetables, which were ok.Overall, not a bad lunch spot.

We hung out at the bar and waited for more of our party to arrive. Once we had about 10 people, I asked them to seat us. Since we were a large party, the waiter offered to bring us everything from their brunch menu and we all agreed. They brought out sushi and edamame almost immediately. And then we sat and waited for the next round of food for over 30 minutes. I was extremely upset because we had a large group of hungry people and the restaurant puts a time constraint on the brunch. Additionally, we were told that we could not substitute non-alcoholic beverages (orange or tomato juice) for the brunch cocktails and that we would be charged extra. This makes no sense to me because alcohol is more expensive. We had several people at there who do not drink alcohol. It seemed absurd that they could not accommodate such a simple request. We did enjoy most of the food, once they actually started bringing it out. However, it was not everything from their brunch menu as the waiter initially said it would be.

It was suggested we hold onto the menu to use as a fan.Next problem was that our group of 4 was totally ignored.  Eventually we asked for a server and one materialized.  He asked about drink orders but given that we were seeing someone for the first time after sitting for 15 minutes we ordered everything for our meal as well as drinks.We were sitting at the table for an hour before the first bit of food showed up at the table.  One guest ordered just an entree which was now served to him while the rest of us were served our appetizers. We asked for the rest of our food and our entrees showed up but not our sides.  The meal was completely out of sync and taking forever.The waiter saw the unhappiness and offered free drinks.  The drinks went down easily but did not wash away my unhappiness.,3,1,1,Phil C.,"Manhattan, NY",4,37,11

I first learned about Zengo when I was in Washington DC a few years ago and went for their brunch special (all you can eat and drink) and we thought it was fabulous. I live in the area and we've only stopped by a handful of times since then. We had a reservation for 6:30pm and were seated promptly once we arrived. To start, we both had two salads and shared each one. I had the peach and goat cheese salad and my friend had the tomato salad. Both were delicious and fresh but I preferred the tomato salad more. For dinner, I had the salmon and my friend had the crispy beef. The salmon was cooked to perfection and had a nice zesty flavor to it. For dessert, I was a little disappointed they didn't have a chocolate selection on the restaurant week menu so we settled for the peaches and cream and ice cream. For not being a chocolate dessert, the peaches and cream cheesecake was quite good - I was pleasantly surprised.I would say the only negative aspect of my dinner was it was a bit rushed - not by the server but by the bus boys. They came around to our table a few times when we would stop eating to talk and would try to collect our places but we weren't done eating - I felt like I had to hog over my plate to protect it which was kind of annoying.

3.0,8/1/2016,"My sister noticed this place when we went to sinigual not too long ago. It is very pricey and I'll tell you now- you're not eating your money's worth. When you see the menu you're intrigued but once you get your food it's a bit disappointing. You're paying what you're paying, for the ambiance and drinks (if you get any). We ordered the spicy crab guacamole for the table, and it was good. It wasn't spicy though and wasn't really flavorful aside from the crab. Two people got drinks at the table - some spicy watermelon margarita which they didn't mind but wasn't amazing. On their speciality drink menus, they didn't really have anything with vodka in it. It was a lot of tequila or rum or gin drinks. The mocktail was good but not worth $7. We then ordered: Asian pear goat cheese salad -best thing hereYuca fries- eh Bibimbap- interesting, but spicy so ask beforehand to alter it to what you can handle. Taco wontons- not the best, I prefer Gyu kaku's more. Shanghai steak- sounds amazing but tastes average. I wasn't In love with it and I'm a meat person. I also asked for it medium well but I'm pretty sure it was well done. There are some good things and not some good things with Zengo.

1.0,7/24/2016,"My party spent $1,800 there last night and it was the worst experience and the worst customer service I ever received. I will never return! I work two blocks away from this restaurant and I normally come here with coworkers and clients for lunch. I decided to do my birthday dinner there last night. I spoke to their event planner (Irene) more than two weeks ago and I gave her my final head count 2 days before my reservation. She confirmed my reservation by sending me a CONTRACT stating I'll have 20 people at 8pm on Saturday July 23rd. Flash forward to last night, 15 out of 20 people in my party arrived before 8pm. I went up to the host and asked her if we can be seated. She told me she can't seat us until our entire party is here (which made no sense to me because the restaurant was half empty) and she said the reservation is for 16 people and it's at 8:15pm. I proceed to tell her I spoke to Irene and I have a contract and the party is for 20 people at 8pm. Her response is ""I'm not Irene,I'm Liz and it's 8:03 right now and your entire party is not here"". I walked away, found the manager and told him the situation. He said he'll take care of it but he was not apologetic at all. He got the staff to set up our tables but he didn't even walk us over.I worked as a hostess and waitress from the age of 16 to 23. Ive seen the most unreasonable and tough customers and I always remind myself not to be like them. I honestly don't think I was giving the hostess or the manager a hard time. I don't deserve them giving me an attitude when my party probably made up 20% of their revenue that night. The restaurant was pretty empty without our party in there.

1.0,7/22/2016,"I used to love this place but after the last visit, I don't plan to return. My friend and I went for brunch (which we had done several times before) and while the food was great (as usual) the ambiance was abysmal. There were two children running around the restaurant yelling. We complained to our wait staff, and she said that something had already been said to the family and that other people were also annoyed. I said that honestly the family should be asked to leave if they were unwilling to control their kids and while she agreed, she said that was up to the manager. My friend and I then asked to speak to the manager (Sean/Shawn-sp?) and asked if he could tell the family to get the situation under control. I also mentioned it was a liability for them since the kids were running and could potentially fall and hurt themselves. His response was outrageous. He said that they were just kids and that he is sure we acted the same way when we were children. We were both stunned and said that in fact, our families would have dragged us out before allowing us to act that way. We said we frequent the restaurant often and expect better atmosphere than something along the lines of a Chucky Cheese. Anyway, he told us to just deal with it and walked away with an attitude. We couldn't believe what happened, and vowed never to return. Too bad because I loved the service up to that point as well as the food.

We had the yucca fries, braised beef flat bread, tuna tacos and veggie dumplings. The tuna was of the carpaccio nature. Not my favorite but quite tasty. If you like your tuna raw then this dish is for you. My favorite thus far is the braised beef. It was the most tender, melt in your mouth meat I've ever had. The trip was worth it just for the flat bread. It was kissed my the gods. Jesus and Moses blessed it. Then all the saint laid hands on it. And then Mahalia  Jackson sang a song. I'm not exaggerating.

Then two wrong orders were brought to our table, which we would have forgiven, but our food took another 20 mins to come which made us realize either they forgot to put in our order or put in the wrong order. We ended up having a 1.5 hour lunch because we were waiting for the food and service.When our food came, the salmon was cooked well but was salty and the short rib udon was horribly salty...to the point of inedible. We asked for the check and the check included the wrong orders originally brought to our table. To end our lunch,  I asked for the short rib to be taken off the check as it was barely eaten and instead of simply apologizing for the entree, the manager came by to say that the short rib udon is normally a salty dish because of the XO sauce but she will take it off because I must have not known it was salty. Really? XO sauce is NOT that salty folks...I told the manager they must have reduced the XO sauce, which increased the salt level significantly because there is no way that dish could be edible and she gave me a look like I had no idea what I was talking about.

1.0,6/13/2016,"This is a review regarding private events.  I had set up a brunch for around 40 people and it was the most stressful party I have ever had.  I thought at the time the event coordinator (who was not there on a Saturday when I would expect many events are held) made everything seem easy but in the end it doesn't seem like she actually set anything up.The staff had no knowledge of ANYTHING--right down to where my party was supposed to be seated within the restaurant, the table counts, or where anything was going.  I was told we would have a custom printed menu so my guests would not have a menu that had prices on it, this was not done.  Basically anything I asked for was not done.The brunch was supposed to be two hours.  45 minutes into it my guests had been served nothing until they finally brought out edamame and a coleslaw.  We had ONE waiter for 40 people until I complained and then they added another waitress.  Everything was completely disorganized and they did not explain to my guests how ordering is being handled.  I was either stressing and telling the waitstaff what to do during my event or apologizing to my guests for the lack of food and organization.  The manager tried to remedy the situation and the waitstaff were responsive but I still had to tell them what was expected from my talks with the event coordinator.  I almost feel bad writing this review because the manager was helpful when he came into the mix (we had to ask for him) but I did not get to enjoy my event at all. I don't even see why they have an event coordinator at this point, it was basically to collect my contract which I found out later on that she didn't charge us the deposit like the contract stated which made getting the bill more complicated at the end.",2,0,0,Michelle A.,"Manhattan, NY",90,28,3

4.0,6/11/2016,"Wow. BRUNCH is where you should come for Zengo (or a private party- they have plenty of space).  I came here with 5 other ladies at noon on Saturday to experience their 2 hour bottomless brunch, $42. Includes unlimited shared small plates from their menu, and unlimited alcohol. I tried the bloody Maria (bloody Mary, just with tequila), the guava and mandarin orange mimosa which was all very good.  The food is not as bad as they say either and the service, for a crazy boozy brunch, was prompt and polite.  Sure the food came out a bit slowly, and sure we had to ask for clean plates and whatnot but once we asked for things, we got things quickly. Not to mention it was a full house because everyone seems to really enjoy this brunch. For food, we got:- the chicken empanada (basically, we were a group of 6 so they tailor portions so that each person could have it), very good mango curry sauce, I liked this a lot -two types of sushi rolls, I don't remember which ones- spicy tuna and salmon something probably. Good. -an overdressed Asian pear salad, but fine portion so to get our greens in-Edamame, always good-Shrimp/veggie potstickers aka more like wontons, good -The egg and duck steamed buns - this was ok; I was really looking forward to it but there was not a lot of duck -Chicken chilaquiles - probably my least favorite; it was soggy nachos.  With fried egg atop, they should have not doused the whole thing in saucy chicken and hot sauce so that SOME chips were still crunchy. Fried egg atop was good; chicken was ok. -The crispy tofu  - this was delicious!-Korean fried chicken  - WAY huge chicken drums, but at least you get full; these were NOT wings.  The sauce was a bit too sweet...definitely not real KFC.-Tonkatsu port cutlet- was ok; a bit too fried and dry.  The fried egg and rice were good- they did not have to add spicy mayo-plaintains- with black sesame, these were very yummy! Sweet, maduros styleFor dessert, we shared the Mexican chocolate waffle (yummy) and the bread pudding (didn't love it, too sweet dulce de leche taste), and the seasonal fruit salad with whipped cream.I don't think the food is WOWzers but neither was it when I dined here for RW dinner.  However, the space is big and can fit lots of people and it is very fun - a good value.. you definitely get your money's worth.

Food is a little over-priced given the non-wow factor. However, it is a nice space. So I guess it justify that.So why the 2-star? I came here with my co-workers for lunch after a failed attempt to go to a new restaurant down the block. No wait of course. But just you watch...We waited for awhile until we got the waitress finally took our order. We ordered the prix-fixe menu. There's only a few choices in appetizers and entrees in the prix fixe menu. So it really troubled me that they took 20+ minutes to make the empanadas we ordered. And YES the whole table picked the empanadas, AND they are one out of the 3-4 things off from the prix fixe menu. WHY 20 mins? By the time the appetizer got to us, we asked the waitress to just bring the main course. Of course it took another 15 min. My friends' salmons were barely warm while my chicken was smoking hot. I'm guessing the salmon was waiting for my chicken to be ready. But you would expect a restaurant like this would make sure all the dishes are hot.When the entree arrived, wIthout us asking, the waitress said since you are in a rush, I will bring the dessert up. Well first of all, we were not in a rush. (But it because a rush after the unacceptable time you took to serve us the dishes) Mind you the only choices are sorbet or ice cream. So I wonder why the necessity to rush when you are only scooping out the ice cream. And also anyone with common sense won't bring up the ice cream because it's going to melt when we eat our entree. Well, the dessert didn't come until we finished our entree. We thought, great, just in time. But a half-melted ice cream and sorbet were served to us. They were like soup. At that point, we didn't even bother.When the restaurant is only 50% filled, you would think they would be up to speed especially for a lunch crowd. But the whole meal took us 1 hour and 45 minutes.

The negatives: the food, slow service. The cardinal sin here is the food though, of course. We ordered the empanadas and the Arepas to start. We both really enjoyed the Arepas, and I was so bummed that there were only three. The empanadas on the other hand  were gross. The waitress encouraged me to order them, saying how popular they are. They're served atop a curry sauce which did not taste authentic at all. It was like a sweet curry, blegh. We left one on the plate and both tried to get through another. Then for the main course, I got the tuna tartare tostada. This was so disappointing! The ingredients seemed to be good but there was not one drop of sauce or marinade or anything moist to speak of. Painfully under-seasoned and just not finished. My friend also got a sushi roll and ate it without soy sauce, because they didn't give her any. SO, the food was a major letdown!

It was around 5:30 so perfect for happy hour and we were the first ones up there! By the time we left the bar upstairs was PACKED and there were absolutely no open seats.The happy hour is pretty good but only takes place in the bar sections so you can't sit at a table and order things - you have to sit in one of the bars. The restaurant is super posh and trendy - really cool wood beams hanging from the ceiling. It was definitely a good vibe.The tacos are teeny tiny teeny so even though you get 2 per order, you might want to order 2 orders to get the amount of taco that amounts to two regular sized tacos, ha ha.

2.0,4/2/2016,"Debated for some time if I should bump Zengo to 3-stars on the Yelp scale but I think they are a successful enough establishment to remain unaffected by a more a truthful review. The food here ranks somewhere between Costco frozen snacks/appetizers and PF Changs. My advanced apologies for delving further....Had this been a good experience service wise I may be more privy to giving Zengo the benefit of the doubt. After all, the space is expansive and beautiful. It's incredibly hard to come by a restaurant in New York City that comfortably fits a huge group for brunch without cramping or excessive inconvenience to the party's schedule. In addition to that, the alcoholic beverages are quite generous on the former and you aren't wedded to any one off their hefty list of options. To the point of service, these waiters were slaving away, and the inconsistency was likely due to poor planning in the kitchen, or understaffing by management. That unfortunately doesn't excuse to the fact that they didn't serve us nearly a 1/4 of the dishes we ordered from their unlimited menu, and chose to skip the note left on our account to wish our friend a happy birthday.

When we saw things missing we asked, but we didn't realize until re-evaulating the menu later how much had gone awry in the way of ordering. My final statement--while I apologize for the harshness, I think this place can do better. With enormous real estate in a midtown hotspot they should be able to afford to pick up the slack with mediocre dishes and spotty service. If you like Calle Ocho this is right up your alley, if you'd like to save yourself money and frustration try elsewhere.",3,2,0,Nina L.,"New York, NY",565,731,189

The waitress said she would bring us a few plates over to start and quickly brought over four different plates. We thought we would then order our own stuff, but turns out they just kept ordering additional things for us and bringing them out over the course of two hours. It was a little weird since we had wanted to order certain things of our own, but the service was amazing, and we still ended up trying just about everything we wanted to.

My friend warned me, based on her own experience and that of many YELP-ers, that we needed to get there right at the start of happy hour before the place packed obscenely up. We entered a nearly empty restaurant (1 person at the bar and 2 tables seated) so we were relieved to be able to sit easily at the bar. I witnessed tons of staff milling around, kissing and greeting each other, chatting in Spanish about random life stuff. Our bartender was attentive enough and made me a very strong capirinha for my first round, while joining in on the conversations of her coworkers nearby. The mahi-mahi taco and Japanese meatballs we ordered were the ideal small bites from the HH menu. After round number 2, which wasn't as strong as the first (probably a good thing), we were hitting on 7:30, just a half hour before the end of HH. Still tons of staff milling, but no crowds. Was Good Friday to blame? Possibly...although the tipsy people walking-er-waddling up 3rd avenue seemed to tell a different story.

3.0,3/20/2016,"To start, ideally I would like to give 3.5 stars to this place. I went here with my friends on a Saturday night and we had a reservation in advance. But after reaching here, didn't really feel like we needed one. The place was only 60-70% occupied,  which isn't great for a restaurant on a Saturday night.  Personally,  I thought the cocktails were really overpriced for what we were served. It appeared like they made their drinks in a big pitcher and served them in a glass and charged a good 12-14 bucks a drink. Me and my friend ordered the same drink together and I got 4 big pieces of lemon while my friend got none but a couple of seeds instead. We then ordered their signature zengo Margarita,  which was definitely a lot better. The food was great but the portion sizes were small. So you'd have to order a lot of stuff for a full stomach. The chicken meatballs and the Thai chicken empanadas were my favorite. For entree,  I thought the Miso glazed cod and the salmon were very good. However you'd get a lot better fish at Nobu given you're almost paying as much. Lastly the service was very good and the staff was very courteous.

1.0,3/14/2016,"We came on Saturday with a large group and it was surprisingly empty. Overall, Zengo is pretty mediocre. First off the waiter seemed to be exasperated with our presence. People were asking questions and he was responding with a supercilious kind of demeanor. He got friendlier throughout the night. Second, the food is bland, way overpriced, and basic considering the hype of being Latin-Asian fusion with a celebrity chef. The only real ""latin"" influence can be seen on the menu in the form of items like the chicken empanadas, and crab guacamole ( which was also mediocre and had little to no spices in it). Otherwise its just a pan-Asian restaurant. I and the person next to me ordered the Chili Crab Hong Kong Noodles and boy did we make a mistake. 1- They were cold when they arrived. For 20 dollars I expect them to not taste as if they were not microwaved for long enough. 2- They tasted like a Lean Cuisine frozen meal . 3- It Barely had any Crab meat in it 4- We tried to toss up the noodles to spread the (cold) sauce around and discovered that the noodles on the bottom were white i.e. had no sauce on them--They hadn't even bothered to toss the noodles into the sauce during the cooking process.  5- I never send food back but we both sent them back in exchange for the Zengo fried Rice, which was better but also had little to no flavor, and barely any shrimp in it.  We both decided we could have gotten better Fried rice at the local Chinese food takeout restaurant. Honestly I could have gone to several other Asian restaurants in NY such as Thai NY or Spice and gotten much better food with a livelier environment  for HALF the price of Zengo.Definitely won't be returning.",1,2,0,Olivia L.,"New York, NY",179,18,4

Instead, we never ordered entrees, but settled for the appetizers we ordered for the table because the service was so slow.

Once I was on a road trip with my college buddies, we've been driving for about 8 hours north on our way to Canada. We came upon a gas station, an old school type gas station that had a convenience store. Let's just say the man tending to the station may or may not have discovered indoor plumbing yet so decides that washing is optional for a month at least. Anyhow, at this point a few of us were pretty delirious from our long trip, hungover from the night before, and a little on the down side on account for the energy drinks and Doritos we've survived on for the last 8 hours. Well, one of my eagle eyed friends in a moment of clarity spots some sushi pre-wrapped next to the Mountain Dew. Naturally we decided to see who is willing to eat this sushi. Upon further inspection we noticed it was prepared about 3 days ago. Aaaaannnd...I chose the short straw. Needles to say I spent the next week in Canada basically confined to a radius no more than 10 feet from any bathroom...and yet...I would eat that sushi again over what my friend and I ate last evening at Zengo on 40th and 3rd Ave...Sorry",3,5,1,T C.,"Yonkers, NY",256,8,4

Why should the culinary arts be any different? While you should steer away from the sushi which is not Zengo's specialty, you won't be disappointed by the appetizers and main courses.

Ambiance is be described as dimly lit, large restaurant with modern decor, average noise and cozy seating allowing for intimate conversation and/or a fun night out.

Take a date to impress. The Details: A delicious combination of flavors and flare, this borderline clubby restaurant is an absolute treat. The appetizers were fantastic, especially the ceviche- so refreshing. The sweet potato side in an Asian glaze was addicting as were the duck tacos-- both good for sharing. The real star was the Achiote salmon. The flavors are indescribable and sensational. My group loved their meals, the only disappointment  was the sushi -- too much rice and not enough fish. Still a great experience, I would return. Instagram.com/SkinnyGirl…The Damage: They have a $25 lunch pre fix for appetizer, entree, and dessert.

I stuck with the guava mimosas, which were delicious. They also have passion fruit mimosas, pomegranate mimosas, margaritas, sake sangria, and a few other fun choices. Their dishes are a fun mix between Spanish and Asian fusion. We got four appetizers and three entrees to split between the three of us, and they prepare each dish based on how many people are in your party (3 empanadas for 3 people, etc.) which I really enjoyed. I highly recommend the short rib hash and the beef and pork sliders. One of the best parts about Zengo was our waiter. He was so friendly and very attentive.

3.0,11/15/2015,"Last night was my first time dining at Zengo. The food was great, but the service...not so much. I attended with 2 friends, and there was no wait for us to be seated. After putting in our order, it took over an hour for us to get our food. We were appalled that it took so long, since the restaurant was not that packed. When our server finally did come with the food, he had chicken empanadas for us, on the house, because of the long wait we had (Strike 1). At the end of the meal, my friend ordered dessert (a slice of cake). It took at least another 20 minutes for the server to come back, explaining that they were out of cake so he bought chocolate croquettes out for the dessert instead , on the house (Strike 2). If someone orders something that isn't there, it should be common courtesy to ask what they would like the replacement to be (or even if they want a replacement). My friend wasn't pleased with this, because he can't stand chocolate, he pushed it to the side and we proceeded to pay our bill.We were pretty clear to the server on how we wanted the bill to be split and even wrote down the relevant card information on the receipt. A lady, different from our server, came back with our receipts so we could sign. We took care of that and proceeded downstairs to the bar, La Biblioteca. We were told by our waiter that all drinks on the menu were half price on Saturdays for Happy Hour, so we were excited to throw a few back after that long dining experience.My friend ordered a Long Island and the bartender told her $16. She questioned this, because we were told that everything was half-price and $16 didn't sound like a Happy Hour price. He responded to her rather rudely stating that only certain things were half price (which was different from what we were told). (Strike 3).While standing there, getting ready to order drinks, our server from dinner comes up to us and states that the person that handled our checks (which wasn't him) charged my card twice. He stated that he did void the duplicate charge and that he would need my friends card to charge him for his portion. (Strike 4). We were frustrated at this point, to say the least, but since we were there, we decided to sit down and enjoy our drinks. The manager came to us not long after and stated that he was aware that we were not having a pleasant experience and said that our next drinks were on the house. He was very remorseful and I am glad he came up to us, because we probably would have asked to speak to him before we left. There was another waitress there as well who worked to make sure we were comfortable for the rest of the evening.All in all the experience we had was not a good one. The food, however was great and if I were to go back it would be for the food. However all of those little mishaps did make for an unpleasant overall experience.",2,1,0,Jo C.,"East Bronx, NY",2,17,15

You have an option to pick and choose from the menu or just let them bring it all out little by little. We had them bring it all out, and occasionally repeat ordered the ones we liked best. It truly was like a food tasting, and in the end we were so full and had to waive the white flag and beg them to stop bringing any more dishes out.

4.0,10/5/2015,"I've been here a handfull of times for different things (lunch, dinner, tequila tasting) but my most recent visit was for a joint bday brunch for me and my friend, so I'll review that.  First off it was really easy to get a large reservation, and when I had asked about making it bigger they were very accommondating, so definitely good service there. Then brunch itself is a really good deal. It's $39 pp for unlimited food and drinks for two hours.  We were a large party (~20 people) so they split us up between two large tables.  We were next to each other, but separated, so that would really be my only complaint.  They came around and took our drink orders first, and then when it came to food they suggested that they just bring us out food, and anything specific we really wanted to try that they haven't brought out we could just let them know.  They have their system down.  At first they seemed a bit slow to bring out food, and we asked about specific dishes, but it's a lot of food coming, so slow and steady is definitely a good system.  Then they are also pretty good about refilling your drinks.  They come around with pitchers of the different mimosas, but they have to actually make you new bloody marys, marias or margaritas.  They were pretty quick with that too once you ordered a new one.  All the food was really good too.  They kind of bring it out in waves of appetizers, mains and dessert.  They had these salmon benedicts with an egg in a little bread bowl that were really good!  And I loved the chocolate waffles.  By the end of my meal I was definitely full, and definitely feeling all the tequila I drank. I would definitely come back for brunch. I like the ambiance of this place, and the decor and high ceilings.  Whenever I've been it hasn't been crazy crowded or noisy which is nice.  And they were definitely super accommondating with a big a group, so I would highly recommend them if you're looking to have a large group event there.",0,1,0,Rachel W.,"Manhattan, NY",284,202,541

We also ordered the scallops and potatoes, paradilla for two and the shrimp wraps. Everything was pretty good, including their signature margaritas. The ambience is dim and cozy, with big tables spread out the space with booths in the middle. Our server did good, too and it's always refreshing not to have snobby hostesses up front. The low-key bar and lounge downstairs, La Bibliotheca, was also a nice reprieve after dinner or while waiting for friends to come for dinner. It's a first come, first serve basis, which is easier if everybody doesn't come at the same time. A group of 8 of us ended up paying $40+ plus tip.

Last night, a bunch of friends and I went there to celebrate a birthday with a 5pm happy hour. We tried to keep the party downstairs, you know, in good ol' BIBLIOTECCA, but per usual very crowded and a little to dark for a 5pm. We moved the ""party"" to the upstairs bar where the 10 of us could actually see, possibly even converse (welcome to late 20s?). After 1 drink, the servers were running over to tell us how we could not possibly continue standing near the dining tables, that were empty and actually remained empty throughout most of our time here, because they were reserved. Listen, I'd never want to intentionally ruin someone's meal, but if you've been here before you know how massive this place is. The. Entire. Place. Was. Empty.  Rather than suggesting an alternative place to stand, the servers just kept telling us we could not be there. We had spent a decent amt on drinks by now and would have happily sat at one of her preciously reserved tables had she suggested it. It wasn't until a VERY IMPORTANT MAN with an ear piece came over and gave us an alternative spot to lean, that the madness stopped and we were allowed to relax the rest of the night. I like this place, but the staff could be kinder. This isn't the first time I've had questionable service here, it's just the first time my perceptions weren't dulled by delicious tacos.

Zengo gets big fat A in my book. I've been meaning to try Zengo for several years since I heard they had a gluten free menu but for one reason or another, I never made it in until last night and that is a damn shame.

They had a vegetarian/gluten free menu but they ended up not being very accommodating for my requests. They had tacos and tofu so I asked if I could have tofu tacos. Nope. There was a tofu main dish and I asked if I could have it as a small plate since I was trying to sample the food as I had never been there, nope. I ordered 3 things: the vegetarian rolls, the veggie arepas and the tofu... didn't like any of it. My friends enjoyed their meals so that was positive. We all did like the guac. It had crab on it so I picked around it. Also, once we got our orders our waitress disappeared. We didn't see her for 20 minutes and we needed water refills. Since the tofu was spicy I needed a soda but I had to waive down another waitress because my mouth was on fire and I couldn't wait anymore to find her.

4.0,7/28/2015,"Came here for restaurant week lunch and was not disappointed :) First off, the fusion of the two cuisines here is already so unique and sounds good already!! My friend and I started out with margaritas (he got mango and I got strawberry) which I really recommend. Not so much the strawberry because the mango was SO much better! Definitely a margarita place I'd come back to. Apparently they make their own tequila? Anyways, on to the food:I got the calamari salad appetizer, the salmon entree, and the berry salad dessert. Ahh everything was really good! The calamari salad was a bit too sour for my taste but it had a lot of the fried calamari. Salmon was probably the best of the tree. They cook it with this sweet sauce that reminds me of teriyaki and they don't cook the salmon til the inside is dry, leaving the entire salmon naturally sweet and tender. Ugh so good. A bit small though. The berry salad is a sorbet with an assortment of berries. Tbh the sorbet is PRETTY sour and I usually handle that taste pretty well so I had to mix a bunch of berries while eating the sorbet. Id go for the peach dessert of you can't take sour things. All in all, food was good and there's also a waitress who looks like the Tangled princess from Disney! :)",9,5,6,Tiffany E.,Hong Kong,515,345,1029

Place wasn't too packed and we did not order from the restaurant week preset menu (our order ended up being the exact same price if not a little less). I ordered a drink at the bar (cucumber with mezcal, a little spicey), which was good, but I don't think I would order it again. My boyfriend ordered a mexican craft beer which he really liked - wish I could remember the name.As for food, we ordered the tuna tacos and lettuce wraps. My boyfriend really liked the tuna tacos whereas I really preferred the lettuce wraps so it worked out pretty well. Both were reasonably sized for sharing as well. As for mains, I ordered a roll that had a piece of salmon on top which was really fresh, and my boyfriend ordered these noodles with pulled pork and a poached egg on top with cashews, both of these were really tasty.With these four small dishes, we had more than enough food and we ended up spending around $40.

4.0,7/20/2015,"Very cool restaurant. I love fusion restaurants, and Zengo played it off really well. The restaurant itself is expansive and has some jungle vibes going on. When I got there for my 8pm reservation, the restaurant was filled with a mixed crowd of midtown bankers, young professionals out to dinner, and couples.  If you come here, you need to order something from the bar. They even have their own house tequila. I went for the garden patch, which came with cucumber and other vegetables. Unlike what I was expecting, the vegetables came infused in the drink, and weren't floating around. This vodka-based drink was sweeter than I thought it would be, but still hit the spot. My did got a rum-based, and my brother a tequila-based drink--all were winners.Came in here starving, so we picked out an appetizer right away. The appetizer menu was split between Asian, and Latin. Decided on fried tofu with shrimp inside. I feel like tofu is usually reserved for vegetarian dishes, so this was a fun and delicious spin.For the main meal, I got braised beef ribs. They were absolutely delicious. An Asian preparation really brought them to life. This was served upon mashed potatoes. The only drawback was that there were no greens. But the meat was so tender and flavorful, that it wasn't a big deal. My dad got the salmon, and my brother got the steak, and their meals were delicious as well.The desert options were interesting. We split a deconstructed key lime pie, and chocolate croquetas with crushed almond garnish. I think the appetizer options were much better, but the waitress gave me and my brother free desert for our birthday. Also, the service was decidedly sub-par, which hindered the experience.Overall four stars. The food was really good, but my whole family commented that the food could've been hotter. Was warm, but wasn't exactly hot. And the service was mediocre. But overall, very good.",0,1,1,Zach D.,"Manhattan, NY",105,96,35

I would say the best out of all three dishes was the Thai Chicken Empanadas. They were extremely flavorful and delicious. The Peking Duck tacos, however, were very disappointing. The duck meat was cold, and it was hard to swallow because of its unusual toughness. The crab cakes were okay, but it's definitely not memorable.

It was supposed to be my wedding gift (at last) to them. I specifically asked Diana on the phone to arrange for a cake or a dessert at the table with a candle at the end of our meal.

3.0,4/11/2015,"I have mixed feelings on this restaurant. A few friends and I visited on a Friday night and were seated in a great half-circle booth looking out at the restaurant. We were waiting on another friend and let our waitress know, but she came over probably 5-6 times to ask us what we'd like when we made it clear we were not ready to order. The restaurant wasn't that busy so I'm not sure why we were being rushed. It was only 8 pm, so nowhere near closing time.We started with the salted edamame and the lettuce wraps, both of which were ok but not outstanding. Between the four of us, we ordered some sushi (the Angry Zengo, which was a bit spicy) and had a creamy salmon-colored sauce on top that I did not like. One friend got the pork carnitas rice noodles. This dish was pretty good, but it came with a poached eggs on top that all of us thought was an odd addition.The dessert selection was underwhelming. The churros looked pretty good but I ended up with the lychee mousse. It had an unusual but pleasant taste. Probably wouldn't try the dessert again. Our waitress was really helpful in determining how much food to order (small plates, flatbreads, large plates, etc can sometimes make it difficult to figure out how much is a normal amount!). She kept our drink glasses full and gave us a very honest evaluation of some menu items, which we were all impressed by.I was surprised at the size of the place.

I came to Zengo on a Saturday night for a friend's birthday dinner. At first, the party was supposed to be 10 people, but it ended up being 18. Our waitress told us it was no problem and moved us to a bigger table. Once everyone showed up, we got two waiters. One waiter made it clear that the kitchen closed soon so we had to put our orders in quickly, and was very short in answering questions. He also hovered around the table, which made us feel as though we were being rushed. The other waiter was quite friendly. The friendlier waitress took our orders and got the ball rolling. Once our food came, we were EXTREMELY disappointed. Not only did the waitress get some orders wrong, food was brought to our table that we didn't even order. 3/4 of our table ordered the fried rice, which no one enjoyed, and a lot of people's plates were a hit or miss. We quickly came to find out that the kitchen switched to a different kind of rice (without letting us know). Through all of this, I was getting pretty annoyed with the service. At the end of the meal, we asked the kitchen to bring out the cake, for which they told us they were charging a FOUR DOLLAR cake cutting fee per plate just to bring the cake out. We were told that once the cake was brought out, that it would have to be sliced, which got me so upset that I asked to speak to a manager. I wasn't upset about the fee charged, as many restaurants do this. I was upset at us being charged a fee after abhorrent service! (I know this is super long, but bear with me.) This manager, in short, told me that the terrible service was due to MY party rushing his servers (I wonder if that was the reason for the terrible fried rice too), that he was doing us a favor by taking out 4 fried rices from our bill. Yes, he used the word favor. Mind you, we ordered about 8 fried rice dishes for the table, NO ONE finished them, and he only removed half of the them from the bill. Wonderful. He ALSO told us that for parties of ten or more, they usually do pre-fixed menus but again, he did us a FAVOR by allowing our party to dine a la carte (even though pre-fixed was never mentioned to us). It's safe to say that I was APPALLED. Not only by the level of service, but by the absolute disgusting attitude of the manager.

It was good but I didn't really care for the after taste of my drink. My friend ordered the Fresca Smash which was she thought was okay.Appetizers, I ordered the Spicy jumbo shrimp lump crab guacamole which was a hit at our table so it made up for the drinks. We also ordered the Duck confit-daikon tacos, Thai chicken empanadas. The duck had good flavor and it's a make it yourself deconstructed taco when you get it. The chicken emanadas were kind of dry inside. There was a sauce that made them a little better.Main dish, I ordered the Tagalog style churrasco steak. It was good, but not really amazing for the price. It came with sweet potato tostones which I felt didn't really make sense with my steak. I also tried some of my friend's Zengo fried rice. I think I could have made that myself, but it tasted good. Desserts, we ordered the Borrachito and Assorted ice creams, which were strawberry, chocolate and dulce de leche. They were nice enough to write happy birthday one of the dishes, and even gave us the cake free of charge which was really nice of them. The Borrachito made a beautiful presentation and really delicious plus the assorted ice creams made it even more delicious, but eat it fast because the flavors melted into each other and it was weird.I gave it 4 stars because the service was really good.

5.0,3/17/2015,"You know those experiences that you can only describe to someone as ""one that you need to experience for yourself""?  Yeah....this is definitely one of them! My review is based on dining in Zengo and not on La Biblioteca, which is downstairs within the same establishment.  And at the time of our dinner experience (Dec '14), they were serving up a special ""Taste of Cabo"" menu which they also donated proceeds to charity.We had reservations for 7:30pm and arrived around 6:30pm to catch the last of the happy hour.  The bar wasn't packed and neither was the restaurant.  We were able to enjoy a glass of red wine (6$) and the Wild Mushroom Flatbread (5$) off their HH menu.  Both were fantastic and a very nice start to our Zengo experience.SERVICE: The hostess gladly sat us at our table earlier than our reservation time.  I requested a banquette/booth table when I made the reservation on OT and it was granted.  Comfy dinner dining was underway!  Our server greeted us right away, and noticed that we were messing around with our table because it was was wobbly.  She smiled and was quick to fix it.  Her service was flawless from the start and she never missed a beat.  She explained the TK (test kitchen) menu items which were part of the ""Taste of Cabo"" special menu and explained everything with such passion.  Even when the restaurant got packed within the first hour of our dinner, she always came by to ask how things were, made suggestions, and was always smiling and full of energy.DRINKS:Off their TK menu, I ordered the Jalapeno Margarita and friend got the Tamarind-Togarashi Margarita from their regular menu.  Both are solid winners.  We enjoyed them so much that we went back for 2nds (and 3rds).TIRADITOS:As for starters, the Sea Bass Tiradito was suggested to us from the TK menu and we also went with the ""Taste of 2 Tiraditos"" from the regular menu which were Hamachi and Scallop.  Loved the sea bass and the hamachi (yellowtail).  I hope they put that sea bass on their regular.. it was that good. MAIN DISHES:We shared 2 regular menu items: Chinese Braised Beef Shortribs and the Chipotle Miso Glazed Black Cod.  OH LORDY!  Those shortribs are one of the best I've ever had.  Definitely won my heart over the black cod.  I've had my fair share of miso glazed black cod  so I'm a little bit of a snob when it comes to this preparation of this specific fish.  With that said, if you're like me, you may agree that it's not the best you've ever had, but it's still quite tasty.  It's got flavor and the fish is cooked to flaky perfection.  Can we go back to talking about those shortribs though?!  If you love shortribs you have to get this dish!!  You will not be disappointed.   Taste all the components separate.  Tender, juicy meat. Creamy potato puree on top of what they describe as ""dragon sauce"" - which I describe as decadence. Each component separate - delicious!  Take a portion of each on a fork-filling bite.  SENSATIONAL!  DESSERTS:For desserts we shared the Deconstructed Key Lime Pie and the Croquetas de Chocolate.  The croquetas were suggested by our server and I wasn't a huge fan.  The chocolate inside the croquetas was just average.  Next time I'll stick with my guns and try the Borrachito since I do love chocolate cake. LOVE the key lime dessert!  I'm glad they gave 2 key lime custards because after one bite, I was ready to devour the whole thing!You'll leave here smiling.  SOLID 5!",3,1,1,Marthy S.,"New York, NY",746,237,644

Overall, delicious meal in a great spot.",0,0,0,Caitlin Y.,"Richmond Hill, NY",0,18,48
5.0,2/23/2015,"When my friend invited me out for her birthday, I had to admit that I was thinking, ""...why did she pick Midtown East?"" Getting there from my little abode in Inwood is such a pain! Now, I'm eating my words, but happily so.What I envisioned in my head did not match up with what Zengo actually was. I was thinking small, cute, a little romantic. As soon as I walked in, I was absolutely blown away by a three-level behemoth. The wooden piers hanging above, the candles, the bar, my goodness! I quickly drank it all in before being seated. We were greeted by Brian, the manager, who gave us very attentive service in conjunction with our waitress, Simone. His drink and menu suggestions were honest and spot-on. I had an extremely hard time choosing from the menu, but after a bit of mental ""eenie-meenie-miney-mo"", I finally settled upon the Duck Confit Daikon Radish Tacos. I was pleased with my decision. Served on a gorgeous plate, it was separated into sections, so the patron can make their own. The taco shells were actually the rounds of daikon, which I found spectacular! They hold a crunch while cutting back on the carbs. Thumbs up for that! The curried apple slaw on the side was so unique; I never knew that apples, cilantro, and curry could pair so well! I also got a side of yuca fries with a creamy mayonnaise sauce, micro-greens, and spicy ketchup on the side. Yuca fries are sorely underrated, and I was so pleased not only to see them on the menu, but to consume an order that were perfectly made. Sometimes, I find them to be dry, but this order was on the money.As for my tablemates, they all ordered various items, mostly from the vegetarian / gluten-free menu, which had a rather expansive span to it. I got to taste one friend's miso soup, which had a slow burn to it and a rich miso flavor. The red miso truly added a warmth to the soup and was visually appealing. As much as I love a bowl of miso soup from any other Asian restaurant, one must admit: the pale cloudy-looking broth does leave a little to be desired, yes? For dessert, I must give props to Simone: I really wanted the Deconstructed Key Lime Pie. As much as I love said pie, I need to be careful, as I am immunocompromised and need to stay away from raw eggs. I asked her if this dessert had any. She told me she was pretty sure it did, but would ask the kitchen; if it had raw egg, she'd bring me out an order of churros with bittersweet chocolate sauce. About ten minutes later, she came out with churros for me. I was glad she took the time to make sure whether I would be able to have that dessert; on a good note, the churros and the chocolate sauce were amazing! On a side note: My friend's sister got the pie, and I was able to sneak a little of the toasted meringue on her plate. Haha.At the end of the evening, Brian led us down to their tequila library. My friend's got to partake, but I had to leave early to go to another birthday party. (I know, I know, First World Problems, right?) But from what I saw as I toured around this area before I left, I was impressed, and I'm sure my friends had a memorable experiences...well, as long as they didn't sample too many tequilas, it will be memorable. Ha! We already shared two carafes of red sangria amongst us during dinner, and that was making me fuzzy enough! (But in an oh-so-delightful way...)This place was an experience and it's one not to be missed! This was, truly, one of the better restaurant experiences I've had in NYC.

4.0,2/17/2015,"I came here for a spontaneous dinner plan. I fell in love with the romantic and chic ambiance the moment I entered. For drinks, my friend ordered gin while I ordered a sangria. The sangria was delish and a bit strong (aka I'm light weight). However it complemented my meal rather well. I ordered cod while my friend ordered the salmon. The cod was cooked really well. The flavor reached to the innermost parts of the fish. It was very light and went well with the asparagus. According to my friend, the salmon was really good as well. For dessert my friend ordered churros while I ordered the Croquetas de Chocolate. The churros were good and the Croquetas de Chocolate was very interesting but I didn't like it much because it got too chocolatey. The service was mediocre at best.

5.0,2/12/2015,The first time I came here was with my boyfriend on our first date. We ordered everything and decided to come back again on our year anniversary! We started with a ceviche which had a very interesting taste and chunks of fish in it- probably would not get it again but it was pretty good. For dinner I got the steak which was amazing. And dessert we got the chocolate cake soaked in tequila- when I say soaked I mean soaked in tequila. You could taste it in every bite. But seeing as I love tequila I enjoyed it. The drinks: unreal- it's a tequila bar so everything has a kick and you're sure to enjoy any of the specials. Atmosphere: cute and intimate. Low lighting too. Downstairs there is a tequila bar which is popping after work and it's pretty difficult to get a drink quickly because the bartenders are swamped- worth the wait though :),0,0,0,Steph W.,"Dobbs Ferry, NY",68,32,31

My friend and I had the full intention of having a great dinner experience here after he attended a corporate event in the upstairs space that was enjoyable. When we entered the restaurant, the two hostesses at the door were extremely ambivalent about seating us even though they had empty tables. We were seated at a booth within a glance of the hostess and she provided us menus and told us to wait for our server. Managers were standing close to the hostess booth as well and all standing there could see that we were not receiving attention from the single server in the section. After 10-15 minutes of going without a greeting, water, or any kind of recognition that we existed, we packed up and walked out of the restaurant in plain view of the hostess and managers.

3.0,1/7/2015,"I came in as a party of 6 of us on a Wednesday night for the bar downstairs, and after we worked up an appetite, Zengo upstairs had some room for us to sit.  Strangely, every ""6"" person table they had was not intimate enough or too uncomfortably small and we were unable to understand how a place this big doesn't have these proper accommodations.  The restaurant was half full, but the hostess told us the majority of the other tables that we pointed out were reserved and initially gave us a very large awkward one in the center of the dining room that we did not like.  We decided to go with a small booth up front that is made for 4 people, but we didn't mind it however I didn't understand where the hostess was coming from initially?  The manager then came over to us and noticed we were uncomfortable, but at that point we had already moved tables once that we weren't going to do it again and just made the best of it.Getting to the ambiance, the place is more of a modern Latin/fusion type of joint and has a great feel for having some good conversation.  The server we had was very knowledgeable and offered some good recommendations for us with both drinks/food.  The wait staff was attentive throughout our experience as well.Now onto the food, we tried the thai shrimp lettuce wraps which were good.  They had a nice kick to them and came enough for about 3/4 wraps which I thought was a good portion for the price.  For our main, we tried the pan roasted scallops that were cooked very well and was accompanied with some unique sides that I would recommend.  Overall, we spent about $50 a person after a couple of drinks each and splitting the app and entrée (you are paying a good portion for the drinks vs food here) but I thought it was good.  If you are in the area and looking for something different to try, I would say this is a good spot but don't go out of your way for it.Buon appetito.",3,0,3,Marco M.,"Manhattan, NY",447,503,263

He came over and honestly could care less. Said the waitress made a ""careless"" and ""unintentional"" mistake. Didn't care that she blamed others. When I said you obviously don't have a gluten allergy he said actually I do. I was shocked. Shocked that having this allergy and his blatant disregard for mine. THEN he said every few weeks he has his grandmothers Mac and cheese. It's not GF but he doesn't care. It's so good! He said it's my choice not to feel well.

I love the ambiance - it's trendy and upscale and has a bar downstairs for after dinner drinking. My boyfriend was a little apprehensive to come here, because the week prior to us coming here, he had come here with colleagues and had choked on a piece of the duck taco (not the restaurant's fault but his own). It was actually quite a serious affair; he had overturned an entire table and broken many piece of china. But the people here were really helpful and made sure he was completely ok before he left. I am quite thankful for that!This time around there was no drama. We ordered the infused pomegranate and Serrano margarita, which is made with pomegranate and serrano-infused tequila blanco, Cointreau, agave nectar, and fresh lime. It was the perfect combination of fresh, spicy and sweet. Amazing! I also ordered the arepas, which they said they could make vegan and gluten free. One of my favorite arepas - they come as 3 small medallion and are topped with a smooth guacamole, perfectly seasoned and topped with sliced jalapenos. It was really really good! I highly recommend trying it out. My boyfriend ordered the Korean fried chicken, which he was slightly disappointed with. I asked him to order the duck tacos, which he absolutely loves, but refused to due to prior choking incident. He was expecting something crunchy, which this is not. It is a huge portion size - it comes with a potato corn salad, but the flavor profile is not what you expect from a Korean fried chicken.I love this place - it's a great place for a dinner date, after work group dinner, or just for drinks.

3.0,7/29/2014,"Experienced zengo during restaurant week --As far as the food, it was actually great with good choices for the rest. Week menu. For an appetizer I chose the Thai chicken empanadas which was DELICIOUS. Good coconut curry flavor and good portion of two pieces. The entree was okay - I had the hangar steak. It was a bit tough and sweet but the mashed potatoes it came with were really creamy which I liked. For dessert, I tried both the miso mousse and the peaches and cream tres leches. Both were baked well.  A bit sweet if you are a sweet tooth. Drinks were on point. I suggest the white sangria. Decor of the restaurant was amazing with a beautiful inside out chandelier and high ceilings. What sucks is ... When we went to pay the check and split it EVENLY amongst 8 credit cards, who seemed to be the manager, insisted that two was the max and gave immediate attitude saying it would override the system. I've never heard of this esp for an established restaurant and he finally agreed and said it would take ten mins. He was rude and unnecessary.",2,0,1,Danielle T.,"Port Washington, NY",446,405,113
3.0,7/27/2014,"It was restaurant week, but I did not take advantage of the restaurant week menu (although the other 3 in my party did, so I got to taste everything). The CHICHARRON DE CAMARON was the best appetizer. I personally ordered the Zengo Roll to start which was very tasty, but seemed a little small to me. As for the entree, the Korean Fried Chicken was surprisingly AWESOME. It was so tasty, tender, crunchy and had a nice spicy flavorful kick. The entrees that my friends had were all average. We got the Peach Tres Leche's for dessert and it dissolved in my mouth with each bite. Delicious! I left wanting more. I would definitely say this is more of an ideal place for drinks/apps/dessert in a hip ambience, so you may want to skip the entree, unless its the Korean Fried Chicken :-p",0,0,0,Yasmine T.,"Union City, NJ",29,18,17

I've been here for drinks with coworkers in the past and we've always sat upstairs or downstairs, never the main dining room. We wanted to do a quick dinner so figured this would be a decent option since it's next to work. The food and service was soooo slow that an appetizer + two entrees + dessert turned into a two-hour ordeal. It was also pretty packed for 7pm and the only tables that were left require you to be super skinny to navigate. Prices are expensive. I would not have come if it weren't for the Travelzoo deal that is going on (or happy hour specials). Maybe we'll stick to apps only next time.Food wise, the edamame was good. I love cheese bread, so the shrimp buns were pretty good. The tagalong style churrasco steak was pretty good. The included sweet potato was nice and crispy on the edges.

He would not honor it because he said that we had to stand by the bar area. I can see how that would normally make sense but on a day when the whole huge restaurant was quasi empty and the place was below 50 degrees, I would have recommended some flexibility. Two of us asked for our soups first I.E before the appetizers, so as to warm up. We both received them after the appetizers. Nothing was great.

2.0,4/8/2014,"Zengo occupies one of Midtown's best spaces, from the cavernous and dimly lit Tequlia Library to the cast iron windows, unfinished pine and bonsai trees that fill the main dining room. It looks wonderful more than five a decade after opening. Food culture moves faster than any interior design, and what is served in this wonderful space now seems tired. This place opened too late for the height of Asian-Latin American fusion and unfortunately hasn't been able to revive this largely forgotten cuisine category. Let's start with the sushi, with is always a risky proposition at a place without a dedicated sushi chef. These are essentially Japanese-American creations, with the Angry Zengo a spin on a tuna roll, the vegetariano a California roll and the volcano mostly salmon. All three a covered with a thick, heavy Chipotle aioli (read that 'spicy mayo' you get at any Chinese-run neighborhood sushi spot). They are heavy and seem to be using the strong sauce to hide less-than-ideal ingredients.Ceviches also fail to pass muster. The scallop ceviche is actively quite bad, a mix of flavors that manages to recall dish soap more than flavor of Peru or Vietnam. The fluke is merely mediocre.The menu is better away from the sea. Potstickers have a thin, slippery skin and come with a red chile sauce. Duck confit tacos let the moist meat do most of the work. And best of all, a thai chicken empanada takes a pretty authentic green curry and pairs it with some salty Oaxaca cheese.The food might not be notable, but I did recently host an event here for around 150 people, and the staff did a really bang up job with the arrangements. The bartenders, especially those downstairs, really know their tequilas and mescals. This would be a great place for an after work drink or two, maybe even a well selected appetizer on these side.But sorry - there's just no reason to come a fusion restaurant in the year 2014 and order a $34 piece of cod unless it's on the Las Vegas Strip.",0,0,0,Jon S.,"Brooklyn, NY",128,647,1

We started off with a pitcher of their white sangria which tasted like a combination of fruit juices and had barely any alcohol. We did get 3-4 glasses each which was nice but would've been nicer if we got the little extra alcohol we'd asked for. We ordered several appetizers so we could taste a little but if everything.

5.0,3/16/2014,"Epic!  Since I am the worlds only producer of Thai Chicken Pierogis (Asian and Polish) Zengo tempted me with a fusion concept I couldn't resist; Asian and Latin.  Was grateful to be on the road with the boy as well as the bride so the dinner voting bloc swung in my favor. In honor of their outstanding deconstructed  key lime pie, I'll approach the review from a reductionist perspective.  Ambience:  Simple dark wood tones in the seating and overhead structures contrasted with wrought iron window panels and light fixtures provide a setting that is light enough for business, yet dark enough for a romantic dinner.  Serving dishes were suited to the environment as well.Service:  Excellent, attentive and helpful without being overbearing.  Suggestions and recommendations were well thought out.  Food was served with a sense of timing, allowing enough space for conversation but so much as to have to search for topics.Appetizers:  only had the Thai Chicken Empenadas.  A complex filling of chicken and vegetables  minced with fresh cilantro, inside a flaky but substantive crust drizzled with a peanut sauce.  Even the bride who normally does not partake of such things tried a bite (and ten two more)Entrees:  Easy one first, the bride had the Give 'n Take Chicken Salad as it was deemed the safest item on the menu in terms of spice and surprises. The real surprise though is that even this simple concept was unique and delicious.  The walnut and ginger treatments were awesome.  Highly recommend.The Boy had the Tagalog Style Churrasco Steak which came with sweet potato bites. Steak was excellently prepared and flavor fully spiced and exceedingly tender.  All else was good as well, but if u ever come back, this is the dish in my sights.I ordered the Korean Fried Chicken; it was really good but not as over-the-top outstanding as the other two entrees.  Crisp, juicy with subtle spicing in the breaking when I was expecting (and hoping for) a bit more.  The unique tangy pickled chayote slaw that came with his was awesome as was the corn potato salad.  Really enjoyed their pairings.Dessert:  between us three, we sampled the  aforementioned key lime pie and the Borrachito.  If you order only one thing, make it the deconstructed pie; subtle twists and a unique presentation make this a must have.  The Borrachito is recommended for those familiar with Mexican chocolate cakes, looking for their fix and still want to be surprised by additions like the white chocolate cappuccino mouse.  Excellent presentation and almost a shame to start smearing the contents around to catch the syrup, but you got to do what you've got to do.Sake bar upstairs, tequila bar downstairs and excellent dining on the main floor.  Don't miss it.",0,0,0,Bob S.,"Grand Blanc, MI",39,210,36

Also, super convenient to get to, only a few minutes from Grand Central. The service was friendly and efficient. The food... perhaps we ordered the wrong things in sticking to the RW menu; it was mostly tasty but not particularly amazing. The crab guacamole (regular menu) and churrasco steak were the best items we ordered. The crab meat was super fresh and served with un-salted/lightly salted house tortilla chips, so I felt less guilty about eating more of them hehe. The steak was perfectly seasoned and juicy, but the sweet potato tostones it came with were oddly flavorless and lacked a crispy exterior, boooo.RW 2014: Grilled Romaine salad with poached pears was a nice starter and different from the usual. Crispy Tofu was not crispy, and the bok choy/sprout mix at the bottom was completely oversauced - wished they were lighter on that because it would've been a much better dish. Seasonal sorbet at the end was very refreshing. 3 tropical flavors I forget now. But i've never seen a restaurant of this caliber bring out a large plate with just 3 scoops of sorbet, that's it, on the plate - lazy?

The Mushroom Flatbread was AMAZING, and I'm pretty sure I could taste some truffle, which just drives me wild (in the best way). We actually had to order a second serving because it was just so good. I also enjoyed the Carnitas Tacos, though the meat could have been a tad more warm. I would absolutely go back to Zengo's upstairs bar with a business partner or even a date. There is also a tequila bar downstairs that is pretty cool and super romantic. It's totally worth a visit!",0,0,0,Krista J.,"Brooklyn, NY",749,1181,35

The sushi was alright but not mind blowing. Everything else was quite enjoyable. Lastly I must talk about the guac. Crab? Um no. I guess one could argue that the natural saltiness of the crab would be a good substitute for salt but the texture creates a speed bump. When it comes to guac, I am a purist. Avocado, salt, lime, maybe cilantro and maybe purple onion (juice). All complement each other and flow smoothly in your mouth. Clearly they added lump crab so that they can jack up the price.

Once the bill came, we realized that water was not free. We are healthcare workers. We do not make the big money. AT ALL. I think it would be wise for the servers at Zengo to stop trying to swindle every bit of money from the customers.

We had gone on a Tuesday night and it was pretty quiet. There were a good amount of people, but definitely not packed or extremely busy. Also, it was still early.For apps, I highly recommend the jumbo crab guac and the shumai. The ceviche was okay. There was way too much liquid in the ceviche than was necessary. More liquid than actual seafood. The drinks were great and we ordered a lot. Unfortunately, when I ordered my fish dish, they were out of it. I then ordered the special, which was a fish, and again, the server came out and told me they were out. I had to order the salmon, which I really didn't want to, because I'm not a big fan of cooked salmon. But I wanted fish, as the other dishes seemed too heavy. In any case, I wasn't very impressed with it. It was good and I ordered it on the rarer side, but it wasn't great. I was also annoyed at this point.How can a restaurant be out of fish on a Tuesday night? It was early and certainly not busy enough that they could run out of both the special and a regular menu item. Also, Tuesdays is when restaurants generally get fresh seafood orders, so really, there should be no excuse.

Nice chunks of pork shoulder, savory ham, nice bite from the horseradish and the swiss cheese was melted just right and the jalapeno aioli was a touch of fantasticness. The bread was only the slightest bit soggy from the moistness of the meats but it was much appreciated.

They were able to portion each dish for 5 (most dishes usually just come in 3's). My personal favs were tuna wonton taco, pulled pork arepas, yuca fries with steak, short rib flatbread and crab guac. Ok literally half of the things we ordered. The only item we didn't fight over was the duck taco - i was the only person tolerable of any heat (jalapeno pepper) It was tasty but nothing comparable to everything else we ate. Our waitress was extremely attentive. She continuously refilled our water and switched out our plates 3 times (even one last time before desserts - we didn't even use the plates at all since.. we inhaled all the churros in 2 secs).  She didn't mind one bit with me flashing her all the check in deals and claiming all the discounts. The only downside is that it took a while for each round of food to come out. Very suitable for laidback catch up date.. but bad for people starving or having plans for later in the evening. Our bill including tax and tips was only 161 dollars - 10 plates of food portioned for 5 people, 1 drink, 1 tea, 1 dessert . What a steal! We left beyond stuffed and my future mother in law couldn't stop raving about this restaurant to her sisters since we got home. We were told it is a must go to place when her sisters visit! Can't wait to see what the next fusion mix menu is going to be (Singaporean and Salvadorean is ending on June 30th).",0,0,1,Wing C.,"Pasadena, CA",213,1497,10231

It was just five of us, but we threw down. Portions are a bit on the smaller side, so with all that we were just satisfied.

4.0,5/10/2013,"If you do nothing else here, get the cucumber-Serrano margarita. Get four of them. They are delicious and fresh and spicy and magnificent. Doesn't get better than this If you like spicy drinks. The ambiance here is great... Just a nice, modern space. Anyways, food. Volcano roll - I've had sushi at approximately 8 million places. This was hands down some of the best sushi I have ever had, and I have no idea why. Crab guacamole - they give you a healthy portion of crab, but at the end of the day this is a $18 guac. Pass. Pork arepas - if you have never had an arepas before, go for it. If you have, this will not be what you know. It is a mini (and I mean all 4 arepas are about half of a normal one) and the pork here kinda is just pulled and slopped on. It was good but if you know arepas you will be disappointed. Thai shrimp lettuce wraps - excellent. Flavorful and different. Short rib cocas - skip this. The short ribs, like the pork, just feels slapped on and separate from the rest. Zengo fried rice - good fried rice with duck and other assorted goodies. If you like fried rice, you will like this. Pork rice noodles - soft poached egg is a great plus for this. The pork is a minus. The pork is same as the arepas, just kinda thick and slopped on top and doesn't mix into the noodles... Just kinda hangs out on its own. Duck tacos - this is a mixed bag. The duck is excellent. The taco is shaved daikon (think a cousin to a radish). I get the Asian twist here, but a dough shell of some sort would have been better. Overall, I'll give this 4 stars because the ambiance was great, drinks even better, and food was pretty good, but not great.

1.0,2/2/2013,"This was our first trip to this establishment, and likely our last.  The atmosphere is is really nice, there is plenty of room at the tables and you can walk without having other guests to move their chair in.  The service was just okay.  The restaurant wasn't overly busy for a Friday night, as there were quite a few empty tables for the 3  1/2 hours we were there.   Our plan was not to be there that long, but the service was really that slow.   The waiter was pleasant, but it would have been faster to walk up to the bar and get your own drink.  The Zengo Margarita was a watered down cocktail, but then again it was happy hour pricing.  The martini's were good...with the exception of the espresso martini my friend ordered...that went back.  Unlike other restaurants that participate in Restaurant Week, Zengo will only offer the Prix-Fix menu if the entire table orders it.  After several discussions among the five of us, we all decided to give it a go.  So, this is what my date and I had for dinner...For appetizers we had the ESTIRADITO DE CARNE (Carpaccio of beef tenderloin) - This was okay at best.  The beef was over salted and the chef put so much sesame oil (I guess to make it ""infused"") that it distracted from the dish.  We also had the SALMON CEVICHE, which was under seasoned and bland.  Traditional ceviche has a stronger lime flavor.  This tasted like it was removed from the lime juice and rinsed off.  It tasted a lot like the lemon water you get served at the table.  The dish really needed a little salt and maybe a little spice.  For the main course we both had the PEKIN DUCK BIBIMBAP - First, there is a $5 up-charge for this dish. This course was more like an experiment that a bad home cook would have concocted.  The description said ""Crispy Duck Breast"", but the skin wasn't that crispy, and the breast was not rendered enough so there were large globules of fat.  It's not what I was expecting when I ordered it.  When I think of ordering duck I expect something more than four slices on top of rice, noodles, vegetables, greens, and peanuts.  With an up-charge for this menu item  I expected more duck...what a disappointment.For dessert we had the LECHE FRITA (Spanish style fried custard).  This was a flavorless fried square of custard with the texture of tofu.  Two of our party ordered this.  I took one bite and that was enough for me.  First it really looked like a chunk of fried tofu and didn't look appetizing.  Then we tried the VENEZUELAN MOLTEN CHOCOLATE BROWNIE - When you think Molten Chocolate anything you think crispy crust outside that transitions to a  warm gooey inside.  Their rendition of this was a chopped up mess on your plate served with vanilla ice cream.  When it arrived at the table the ice cream had melted so much that it was more like milk on your molten brownie.  Three of our party ordered this dessert and not one finished it.Maybe the mistake was ordering the Prix-fix...who knows?  But in the greater scheme of things,  it's not likely we'll return.  The experience wasn't that good, slow service and mediocre food are not a good combination to keep people coming back for more.",0,0,0,Michael P.,"Plainfield, NJ",2,22,57

The space felt modern and hip, with high ceilings adorned with rough wooden beams. Zengo was able to accommodate our party of ten at a large table with plenty of room for our food and drinks. Many of the items on the menu sounded enticing, but after ordering and receiving our food we quickly realized that the portion sizes were small.

4.0,1/14/2013,"Beautiful restaurant with lots of space - no cozy, cramped table seating. The food was also very good. Every dish we tried really packed a punch of Latin-Asian flavor.As an appetizer, we shared the Oxtail Humitas and Duck Confit Tacos. The oxtail was so tender and melt-in-your-mouth good, although i wasn't a huge fan of eating it along with the humitas that were on top (kind of tasted like corn bread). When you see 'duck confit' on the menu, it's really hard to resist.. and they did not disappoint. I thought this dish was very clever in that the taco 'shell' was not your regular tortilla but daikon sliced thin enough to fold into a taco! It offered a good textural element to the taco, which also came with curried granny smith apple 'slaw' and a sweet and sour sauce. Yummy. As a meal, we shared the Tagalog Churrasco Steak, with a side of Zengo Fried Rice.  Not too familiar with Filipino flavors so I'm not sure if I tasted much more than a sweet bbq-type marinade with a good chimichurri sauce on top. But the steak was cooked perfectly to order. The fried rice was light and actually paired well with the steak. We felt compelled to order it mostly because we wanted a carb and it had the restaurant name attached to it. It was nothing extraordinary but still good.

I already knew I was in for a treat (especially since I was starving myself in preparation for it all week!) But honestly, I could not have been prepared for the amazing experience I had this time around! I had the forethought to make reservations a few weeks ago and am glad I did as it was a Friday and while we didn't have to wait for our table - about 30 minutes after our arrival, the restaurant filled up! After the waiter (who was awesome, btw) gave us a rundown of the menu - we decided on ordering a few appetizers as opposed to two entrees.  Since both of us are currently on the ""Oh crap, we're getting married in 8 months"" diet, we decided this was the best way to indulge sensibly and really get a bang for our cheat day :)We ordered four appetizers: 1. The Guacamole - OMG, order it.  Doesn't matter what else you order - this should be on your table at some point! The lump crab on top was so perfectly juicy and soft and not at all fishy or chewy. The tortilla chips it comes with was crunchy and sans oil - total win for both of us! 2. The Calamari Salad - I am a huge fan of calamari in general, but the Korean/Mexican fusion thing going on with this salad was to die for! You could almost feel the tastes changing but at the same time working together to create an amazing foodie experience! 3. Seafood Scallion Pancake - Honestly, this wasn't my favorite item because I would have preferred the pancake being a tad crispier.  Because of the seafood, the dough seemed moister than I liked - but the actual seafood and flavor really undoes any texture issues I had.  I'd request this again, maybe ask them to crisp it a tad more :)4. Daikon Duck Tacos - I'm not usually a fan of duck, but this was so perfectly flavored and crisped up that I enjoyed it more than I imagined I would! The tastes blended together and the daikon and the creamy sauce they provide to top the duck was simply amazing! We weren't able to finish all this food, despite trying very hard! If we weren't heading to a surprise party I was throwing for him, we might have packed up a doggie bag for late night snacking! Oh, also - I have to say our waiter was phenomenal! During dinner I excused myself to find him and set up a cheesy birthday dessert thing for my fiance and he was completely sweet about it and the presentation was beautiful!

We had a spicy tuna roll, soy chicken dish with pancetta and for dessert, lemongrass panna cotta with passion fruit sorbet and passion fruit caramel (SO GOOD).I forgot what drinks we ordered but I remember them being delish as well. This place did not disappoint. I'll definitely visit again.",0,0,0,Jamie S.,"Miami, FL",372,257,438
4.0,1/2/2013,"I still have dreams about Zengo's Tuna Won Ton Tacos. We ended up ordering two of them just because of how delicious and flavorful it was. Yes, the portion is on the smaller side for what they charge but my friend managed to scored a reservation on Savored which gave us a 30% discount so it was totally worth it. Some of noteworthy items on the menu: Adobo Roasted Chicken, Calamari Salad, Duck Tacos, oh and the Jumbo Crab Guacamole was also so good. Never thought of that combination before but for some reason it works so wonderfully. I also really loved the ambiance/ decor. Very classy and upbeat at the same time. I came at a slow week and service was a bit slow. But overall- it was a great experience- would absolutely go back (especially for the Tuna Tacos).",0,0,0,Pam S.,"Boston, MA",0,3,0
4.0,12/21/2012,"Zengo is super trendy, super flavorful and super SLOW. Due to the snail like service this place is 1 star shy from getting the 5 stars it deserves. Not to say that our waiter was very sweet and respectful, which he was. I also want to comment on how unorganized it was when it came to transferring our bill from the bar to our table (and i'm only being such a detail snob because I have organizational issues so I notice EVERY SINGLE DETAIL!). Anyways, moving on to what really matters: FOOD. Every dish we got was packed with flavor. Then again, every Asian fusion place I've gone too I was never disappointed with. In my book, you can never go wrong with Asian inspired cuisine. It's always so damn good. The portions were small and definitely overpriced for the serving BUT who am I to argue when we knowingly went to a restaurant located in Midtown? Exactly, Ill keep my mouth shut. I'll throw out a few dishes that will make your taste buds jump for joy:- Crunchy calamari salad- Angry Zengo roll (spicy yellowfin tuna / avocado / cucumber / sesame /green onion / wasabi tobikko / chipotle rouille) - Shrimp Vegetable potstickers- Chipotle Miso Glazed Black Cod (daikon radish / asparagus / steamed jasmine rice /kabayaki / lemon togorashi aioli) - **THIS DISH WAS SO GOOD!! The cod was buttery and tender and the jasmine rice was a perfect compliment to the star of the dish. Asparagus added a crunch factor which was definitely needed to make this dish complete (I do want to add that I wasn't particularly crazy about the daikon radish and felt that the dish could do without it).I'm definitely fond of this place but I'd like to see faster service.",0,0,0,Helen B.,"Brooklyn, NY",138,102,21
3.0,12/20/2012,"Went here for a team dinner for work tonight. I was not a huge fan. The tofu empanada was pretty good; the beef dish we got was very good, the salmon was ok (I don't eat a lot of fish, so I'm biased there, I guess), and the chicken was completely bland and flavorless -- the worst chicken I have ever had for that price. As for dessert, we had these mini churros with chocolate, which were quite good and melted in my mouth. We also had some kind of carrot cake type thing, which was okay. (Sorry for my vague descriptions -- we ordered family-style and I showed up an hour late, so I didn't know exactly which dishes we ordered.)So, I wouldn't proactively go back, but I wouldn't resist kicking and screaming if someone really wanted to go there.

The scene was vibrant and alive as a lot of people come here for happy hour.  My date and I were seated on the left-hand-side in the half circle booth style tables. Being a guy, I'm not crazy about these as I felt as thought I didn't have enough room for myself without squishing my date. The food was awesome. I recalled last time that I was there I ordered main dishes instead of getting a number of plates in a tapas style and  I was underwhelmed. Our waitress was very courteous and helpful with everything especially with explaining why my drink contained egg whites (to create more of a froth). the best dish we ordered was the tuna crispy tacos. The Angry Zengo roll was delicious while both my date and I agreed the lettuce wraps could use less peanuts. For Dessert we ordered the Churros. The waitress explained to us that they are made to order which you can tell when you bite into them. They come with a thich chacolate dip, which for some might be too much. I would like to point out that the last time I was here was on a Friday night and I could not have felt more rushed by my waiter.

4.0,11/2/2012,"A friend and I had dinner at Zengo after buying a Living Social coupon. I didn't have high expectations for the place because: 1) We would be eating mostly vegetarian for my friend's sake + 2) Fusion food can often taste like the ugly stepchild of two otherwise delicious cuisines. Happily, Zengo proved my cynicism was misguided.The wonton tacos were crispy and had layers of flavor and texture - from the fresh corn sheered straight off the cob to the perfect dollop of mole sauce - I will order this dish again and again.I never thought guacamole could get any better. But the squidge of citrusy yuzu  definitely adds a nice complement to the buttery guac. We requested the lump crab be served on the side instead of mixed in and what a great idea that was. When mixed in, the crab can fall apart/become stringy and it can be hard to pick up. Ordering it on the side, we received a generous little bowl of lump crab meat, which I happily loaded on each heaping mound of guac. To die for.We ordered the crispy tofu entree. This was probably my least favorite dish because without dipping the tofu in the sauce, there's not much flavor. However, if you dip the tofu in the tasty sauce beneath, you lose the crunch on the tofu. So that left me deciding whether I wanted flavor or crunch. Why can't I have them both?? We each ordered a passion caipirinha with our meal. If you're like me and don't like the biting taste of liquor, this is the perfect drink. At the end of the meal, I realized the flavors, textures, and colors were done so well that I never missed the meat in my meal! Richard Sandoval, you've sold me on your Latin Asian fusion. I will definitely be back.",1,1,0,Cindy T.,"San Francisco, CA",111,101,383
5.0,11/1/2012,"So glad to have an alternative to steak houses in this area. We started with a margarita in the sexy lower level tequila library, on a big leather couch...very cool room. Then upstairs to our dinner...more great design, very comfortable. More margaritas: tried the two w/mezcal on the list...very good...one of us thought her pisco sour should be more sour. Our meal: seafood ceviche--my fave dish of this meal, delicious and generous, good heat and a lot of different seafood in the serving, with plaintain & other chips; wagyu beef, 4 thin tender slices, flavor & heat, another hit. Shrimp potstickers: 5 tasty dumplings w/chile sauce...I wanted one more. Then, a sushi roll, eel, with a nice crunch and heat.A note on the good service: waiter was helpful & honest in assessing whether we were ordering too much. So two of us shared an entree, the roast chicken w/yucca fries, and a side of fresh green beans & sprouts. Nice, plump piece of chicken & I liked the sauce a lot; she thought it a tiny bit salty. We like our yucca fries crispier, but flavor was good. Dessert: plantain cake w/peanut butter ice cream...ahhh.Excellent music here...it's my obsession, and I can't ignore it when it's bad. This is a really fun place, and overall we thought the food was seriously good; but it's not for those seeking a temple of quiet culinary contemplation.

Ambiance was nice...kinda dark but nice modern vibe with some mood lighting going on. The dining crowd was eclectic..there seemed to be a good after-work crowd, some tourists, some people who were decked out for a night out and some casual diners. Great friendly service, not pretentious at all.  The server made some recommendations on what was popular/good and we took most of his advice. The food overall was good, not great.  The thai chicken empanadas were yummy but came out a bit lukewarm.  Loved the concept though.  We also shared the tuna wonton nachos.  Also good but not amazing. For entrees, we shared the miso black cod (it's my fav and i order it EVERYWHERE) and the braised shortribs.  I liked the black cod and it had nice flavor.  The consistency was fine but not as buttery as I prefer (like Nobu-esque buttery).  The shortribs were a bit overcooked and dry..didn't have much moisture and the potato puree it came with was good but made the dish taste more dry.  Passed on dessert so can't speak to that.Oh yeah..I had the asian pear mezcal, which was yummy.

I get after work drinks and dinner with girlfriends here. Sometimes I swing by solo for their tamarind margarita. I've been working in the area for nearly a decade now so that's alot of tamarind margaritas!The service is always consistent. Professional, devoted, knowledgeable, energetic staff who are passionate about the items on the menu.The ambiance remains perfect. Zengo always feel airy and I never feel claustrophobic and crammed around other diners. The quality of the food? Always the same gorgeous plating and explosive symphony of flavors for the palate. The quality never changes whether they're busy or slow--whether it's 2011 or 2013. And the menu is always updated with seasonal items.Right now, they have a Peruvian-Malay test kitchen with new menu items available at limited points of the month.It has been years but I still love Richard Sandoval's restaurants---and of his restaurants, Zengo is still my favorite.The Thai chicken empanadas are my favorite from the appetizers. Love their express lunch options too. The least memorable though are the sushi. The ingredients are fresh. The textures are great. But Asian-Latin fusion places can never do really interesting sushi well. But everything else still blows me away and makes me want to lick the sauce from the plate.For after work drinks, happy hour at Biblioteca bar downstairs is decent. Drinks are weak compared to normal priced drinks. The second floor mezzanine part is also open on certain days for happy hour.  I have never been able to get a seat at the bar in the basement whether it is happy hour or not. so you will likely never find seating either!The menu items rotate every season so it never gets boring. But there are dishes that always remain a menu staple. I still love their shrimp lettuce wrapper and empanadas. Their duck confit tacos are delish but paying $13 for little tacos still make me feel guilty.  I really like their take on fried rice. When I've had alot of drinks, like turns into absolute MUST. Of the current entree, Sandoval's take on skate was fun---normally skate is so delicate that everyone does a lemon caper butter meuniere or season it in a light tomato sauce. Loud spices don't seem like a match for skate but it works at Zengo. Their skate really works. The spices give the dish a kick without it overwhelming the mild delicateness of skate. Their short ribs are amazing but I think it's a recycled dish that used to be served with udon noodles a while back.Zengo's fusion ceviches are always delish, I just want to lick the plate!",1,0,0,Lei P.,"New York, NY",6,106,7

When I arrived there, I was 15 min early for my reservation, they asked if we wanted to sit at the bar and wait, we said we'd prefer to be seated. They gave us a ""hmph"" sound an inconvenient stare even though the place was empty and there were only 2 of us. I had planned to order the arepas for appetizer because I had seen the menu online, but the menu at the restaurant was much different, so i settled for something else I really didn't want (empanadas), but it was ok. My drink was delicious, although I asked the waiter if it was sweet and he said no, but it was actually really sweet. I drank it anyway. Halfway through our meal I realized the waiter had like 8 other tables, so he totally ignored us for the rest of the night, I had to wave my arms for like 30 min for him to notice that I wanted the check. I had planned to order dessert but decided not to because I didn't want to inconvenience the waiter. I had the chicken and coconut rice for dinner. The chicken was dry and lacked flavor, the rice was delicious but sat in my stomach like a brick.

Sounded like a fancy Korilla BBQ to me or something. When I realized one of my friends was having a going away meet up at La biblioteca right downstairs, I decided to make restaurant week restaurants to try Zengo out and I was definitely NOT let down.When you first walk in, you're greeted by a large bustling dining room with two floors. The hosts were extremely sweet and as I sat down at the bar to wait for my friend, the lovely bartender immediately served me. The restaurant is huge but decorated very beautifully. It's a classy place but more trendy than upscale which was perfect for me. There was a very young midtown ""after-work"" crowd huddled by the bar enjoying the fancy cocktails.My friend and I were sat in a very large and comfortable booth and our server seemed a little overwhelmed when he came to us. We had to ask them to bring the restaurant week menus to us twice before we were finally given them.I saw a waiter walk by with something that looked like nachos stuck over guacamole and immediately scanned the a la carte menu for it and found the best ""chips and dip"" order I have ever eaten: spicy crab guacamole. At 18$ it was a little pricier than their other appetizers but it was 100% worth it. The nachos were cooked amazingly and the mixture of guacamole and spicy crab was unreal. I scarfed it down like a monster. For our appetizers, my friend ordered the fluke and I the coconut salmon ceviche. I'm normally not a big fan of coconut, but I am of salmon ceviche. The coconut milky taste actually fit very well with the flavorful salmon slices and the chives that were sprinkled on top was actually delicious.For our entrees, my friend ordered the soba noodles while I the pan roasted skate. Both were absolutely mouth watering. The skate literally melted in my mouth it was fantastic.I hadn't heard much about Zengo to be honest, but after my dinner there I'm thinking that this restaurant is seriously underrated!Oh! and they have an amazing cocktail list ... with really delicious margaritas..

I believe everything here is reasonably priced especially for the service and ambience you receive in return. Expect manhattan prices outside of happy hour times such as $12-$15 cocktails and or appetizers.Drinks are usually made very well especially the magaritas. I believe all of the magaritas created here are yummy, all except the Zengo magarita. Hate to say it but the magarita named after the restaurant is perhaps the worst. I believe the drink has too much cilantro which gives it a horrible after taste. Tamarind-Togarashi Margarita & Piña-Sage Mezcal are the way to go =)The food is served in moderate portion sizes but very filling. I highly recommend the thai chicken empanadas. No YOU MUST ORDER THE THAI CHICKEN EMPANADAS. The sauce spread over the empanadas makes them irrestible. You may not want to share this dish with your date!  The sushi plates served are delish as well. The Volcano for the spicy lovers, Mango Eel is for the more adventurous and the remaining two are more basic choices.Lastly the dessert was lacking. My date and I ordered the Cafe Miel which was disappointing. It is described as having honey, cinnamon and cafe flavors but it just seemed like a poor tiramisu. Not sure what happened with that dessert. Overall, this place has some great qualities and the staff is consistently friendly & accomadating to customers.

3.0,7/30/2012,"RESTAURANT WEEK REVIEWAh I'm on the fence with this restaurant. I loved the decor. Restaurants that has put time in decorating their restaurant are usually ranked pretty high on my list because I appreciate it. It's a personal bias. The restaurant on the outside may not look too big but it's actually pretty massive. There are three floors: the top floor being a soju lounge, the main floor being the dining floor with a bar and then there's the bottom floor that has a more of a lounge feel to it. Each floor has such a great ambiance. My best friend and I arrived to take part in happy hour before eating dinner. We ordered the strawberry margarita off the hh menu. It was alright. Not really the best cocktail but for $8 sure why not? Before we knew it hh ended and we had to wait an additional 25minutes past our reservation to be seated. Once we sat we opted to order from the RW menu. Appetizers - We ordered the fluke and the salmon ceviche. The salmon ceviche was plentiful and very coconutty. It had 2 lotus root chips but I wished there was more. I like my ceviche with some sort of chip accompaniment. I really enjoyed my fluke. The watermelon and chili ponzu was such a great marriage with my fluke. The fluke tasted like a white tuna to me and the watermelon gave it the splash of sweetness with the ponzu giving it the salty aspect. Entrees - We ordered the skate and the chickpea curry. Both of these entrees are not necessarily worth it even on the rw menu. The skate was slightly smaller than an entree portion and on my plate I was presented with one piece of skate. It was floured lightly and extremely salty. If it wasn't for the potatoes, tomatoes and the frisee I would've been pretty upset with the entree. Luckily the starch filled my stomach more so than the skate did. The chickpea curry is definitely not worth it at all. There's no meat to the dish (I guess its the vegetarian option). The curry flavor was atypical. Nothing unique about the flavor. I was very disappointed with this dish. Dessert - The churros and the chai panna cotta. I didn't find the churros to be as exciting as my fellow yelpers claimed them to be. They're just like the ones that people sell in the subway systems. The chocolate dipping sauce gave it a nice touch but not special. The chai panna cotta was different. With the raspberry and honey it was passable. However on its own the panna cotta had a huge flavor of chai and the consistency of a clay mask. It was kind of gross. I had to put some of the chocolate from the churros to make it edible. We ordered two cocktails for our meals - the mango mojito and the tamarind margarita. The mojito was light and cleansing. I liked it. The margarita was slightly savory and tangy. Not bad. My preference is typically sweeter cocktails but  when I saw everyone ordering it I just had to try it. Not bad. Bathrooms - So for such a huge location I'm shocked that they only have 2 bathrooms on located upstairs. The bathrooms are pretty but I would think they would have multiple stalls for a location that can seat so many people.Since I love the decor so much I would probably want to come back to try out their happy hour menu. But other than that I don't know if I would want to try their regular dinner menu items. It's unfortunately because I had been wanting to try one of Richard Sandoval's restaurants for a while. ~happy eatings!",1,0,1,Rosa C.,"New York, NY",397,236,27

Duck confit tacos - i liked these, especially since the tacos were fresh thinly sliced circular shapes of daikon, and the steak, with horseradish flatbread - really yummy!For dessert: Cafe Miele - description said bitter espresso meringue with brownie - but the entire dessert was served in a cup and was the texture of thick flavored cream - wasnt that crazy about it.

3.0,7/21/2012,"Good after-work spot in Midtown with interesting Latin-Asian fusion cuisine. In the city of fusion, it was just a matter of time before somebody melted two already highly muddled cuisines into an even bigger mess. The Latin influence mainly seems to consist of chili in every single dish (at least in the salmon ceviche and the pan-seared fluke), but that's fine by me. The Asian part was apparent only in the use of coconut and lemongrass in the ceviche, neither of which really sprang out as particularly flavorful. The fluke on the other hand was very nice. And the churros in molten (fusion?) chocolate were delicious. The place is big but has a good vibe overall, not too stuffy/ workkplace, so overall not bad.",0,0,0,Vanni P.,"San Jose, CA",138,574,2

They were tasty, though.Ordered several small plates to share, and overall, was unimpressed. The edemame were good and was a huge portion.

In no way resembles tres leches - more like a cheap, store-bought strawberry shortcake. Waste of calories.Lastly, although our server was pleasant, service was spotty (waited over 15 min to put in a drink order, went periods of time without drinks) and they didn't take off a discount on our check at the end (and then gave us someone else's check...).Wasn't the worst meal ever, but wouldn't go again - skip it!",0,0,0,Danielle G.,"New York, NY",0,23,0

You get 4 thick-crusted empanadas for the $13 bucks or so....a friend ordered the spring rolls - two thin, sad looking spring rolls cut in half - that, for $13? Ouch.  We also got the duck confit tacos....now, how do you make fatty duck meat taste dry and flavorless?  That, I suppose, is a talent in itself...the make-your-own tacos required a heavy dipping in the accompanying sauce to give it flavor.  But the worst offender of the night was my 'large plate' of salmon with quinoa.  Ok, I know salmon's not an original choice - but jeez -...is it too much to ask for a bit of flavor with my food, when it costs $25 for a small serving? The plate was large, the serving - not.  My friend ordered the catfish (or was it char) w/ noodles.  Her fish portion was literally twice the size of mine - two fillets.  I ordered mine medium-rare - it was thoroughly cooked, just brushing up to the overcooked line.  And the quinoa - it was even lacking salt! Seriously, I've had better salmon dishes at a quarter of the price!!! I find it extremely irritating to pay over $50 per person for dinner to have what could only roundly be labeled ""meh.""   Our waiter also hovered annoyingly, and we had to wait several minutes for one friend's dish to be brought out - while the rest of our food got cold.  Oh, how could I forget mentioning desert? Churros - 4 small sticks w/ a yummy chocolate sauce in a small glass - when I asked for a spoon to lap up the rest of that sauce (yes, I am that girl), the waiter brought me a comically huge soup soon.  Um, ok...Verdict?

3.0,2/12/2012,"I went to Zengo's with high hopes based on co-workers recommendations and finding the menu very interesting.  I eat a lot of sushi so my visit was to eat more Latin inspired food with an Asian influence and to have a romantic dinner with my husband.  We made reservations through Open Table and we were very happy with the booth they seated us at.  It ws designed for 4 people so we were lucky to get it.   The restaurant was doing a brisk business so we were suprised they didn't seat us at a smaller table.  We started with two highly recommend appetizers, the Thai Empanadas and the pork and chorizo gyoza.  While both were good neither was outstanding nor would I order again on a second visit.  The empanadas were a tad too spicy and the dumplings were on the cold side along.   The texture of the chorizos did not ""marry"" well with the delicate dumpling.We both enjoyed our main courses and I would order them again.  Husband had the Wagyu skirt steak served with the most amazing smashed fried potatoes.  At first they looked like Tostones but they were potatoes with a slight orange flavor.  The steak was melt in your mouth. Thankfully the portion of potatoes was hearty because the portion of steak was on the small size.  I had the pork carnitas rice noodles with a soft egg.  Sounds weird but it worked and I was looking for an Asian Latin fusion and found it with the two flavors.  The coddled/soft boiled egg might be off putting to some but I enjoyed it.  We had a glass of house Pinot Noir and declined dessert as we were stuffed.  Staff was friendly and knowledgable and the decor was sexy and seating comfortable.  Service between appetizer and entree was slow.  Enough time had elapsed where we started to question where our food was.I'd be more inclines to return during happy hour or for lunch because the prices are high and there weren't many  more entrees that peaked my interest.  The entrée selection is small.  If I could I'd probably give Zengo's a truer rating of 2.5 to 2.75 starts and not 3.  It was more than a 2 star experience but less than 3.",1,0,0,Louise F.,"New York, NY",3,129,54

2.0,1/31/2012,"A great thing about restaurant week is that it gives you the chance to experience restaurants at a discounted price.  Often you can discover a real gem.  In the case of Zengo it gave me the opportunity to learn I don't want to go back.I stopped in this afternoon for lunch.  The place was far from filled (many empty tables).  We sat down and ordered from the restaurant week menu.  25 minutes later my wife's salad and my sushi roll (our apps) arrive.  It was another 30 minutes before our entrees arrived.Now maybe I'm crazy but if you don't have a large crowd and people are ordering from the 3 items on your uncomplicated restaurant week menu, you should be able to turn that shit around pretty quickly.Furthermore, I'd like to point out that my wife's lunch was a spicy noodle concoction gone terribly wrong.  The noodles must have been left to sit in their spicy sauce too long because they were WAY over spiced and mushy.Zengo proves the point that just because you have a fancy interior doesn't make you a good restaurant.  Won't be back.",2,1,1,Randy W.,"Suffolk, NY",39,160,0

My sister was there and told me the wait was 20 minutes. I went up to the hostess to tell her we were there. She looked at me + said ""Your friend already checked in already - you have to wait 20 minutes. There are 5 tables in front of you."" She was not the least bit sympathetic to us having to wait after having a reservation at a specific time. My sister and I began discussing if we should go elsewhere + she chimed in ""Would you like me to cancel your reservation?"". I was so appalled - she was not in our conversation nor should she have commented on our conversation at all. I simply asked her why she needed to take this tone with me - typically when restaurants are backed up they apologize or at least are kind to the people waiting. She replied with ""You are bringing forth aggression so I am giving aggression back to you. Your friend gave me aggression as well."" Even if I was bringing forth ""aggression"" (which I wasn't) this is no way to speak to a paying customer at your restaurant. Can't tell you how the food is because didn't get to try it - my sister said it was saucy anyway and ended up going to a great restaurant down the street with great food + great service. I honestly do not think someone like that she would representing any restaurant that wants to do well in New York.

But I will say the food was great, and the waiter was friendly and always checking to see if we wanted to order more food or drinks, but not in a pushy way.If you're looking for a cool spot to hangout after work, I'd probably suggest giving this a go. While the bar on the main floor is small and crowded, downstairs is a nice big bar and open room to just hangout, drink and socialize. There is also an upstairs where they do different drink tastings, unfortunately it was closed for a private party the night I was there, but my friend has been there before and said it was really nice.So there you have it, if you like asian fusion food, this is probably the place for you.

We even showed her the outgoing call to the restaurant that we made a few days earlier to show that we definitely contacted the restaurant. Even if we were lying about having a reservation, her stance should not have been that we were wrong/lying and simply apologize for not having the reservation in the system.

3.0,12/13/2011,"I'm a bit ambivalent about this place. While the food is undeniably good, it's also portioned on the small side. Similarly, the servers and hostess are all fairly friendly, but sometimes there is an inexplicable wait to grab the check or even get your server's attention, period. Case in point: came here to celebrate a friend's birthday 2 weeks ago. We ordered 4 apps for 3 people and there was just enough food for each of us to try (e.g. 1 piece of gyoza, 1 mini taco, 1 tsp of ceviche per person). Felt compelled to order entrees to make it a legit 'meal.' My dining companions had high praise for their skirt steak, though, and my bass was lovely as well, so I'd say the entrees are better value than the apps. When we were about 3/4 of the way through our meal, I went to inform our waitress that we'd be ready for the cake in another 10 minutes or so. Well, the time came and went, and our waitress passed by at least a half dz times while bringing orders to the tables around us, or checking on them to see if they needed their drinks refilled. I tried to catch her eye, unsuccessfully, on 4 of those trips...and nothing. By this time, my dining companions were getting a lil' antsy (they're guys; eating and skedaddling is a way of life for them) and the birthday boy was definitely in danger of catching on.

It's great for a date, dinner with close friends, or even a social gathering. Now to the most important part, the food:1. Ceviche: Excellent (I've only tried the rainbow one, which was on an autumn menu).2. Green papaya salad: It's sweet, salty, and sour and tastes crispy to the palette, I likes.3.  Volcano roll: Good, but I'd rather stick with the more Latin flavors at this particular restaurant bc of its uniqueness.3. Spicy crab guacamole: Mmm, yum. It's a good finger food, while sipping on your mojito, and waiting for more dish.4. Thai chicken empanadas: Great. A must try for the first time, and since I know what it tastes like now, I'll order it sometimes and skip it other times.***5. Charred tuna wonton tacos: This is my fave dish. This is the dish that I craved after I left the first time and ordered again and again. Honestly the 3rd time wasn't up-to-par but I know why, I'm a sauce lover, and they just needed to give me more of that yummy mango salsa sauce to top off the wonderful flavor blend.***6. Lobster gyoza: It was just okay for me, but I'm Asian, I can find yummy dumplings pretty much anywhere. 7. Chocolate souffle: Soooo good, and let me just mention, I'm not usually into chocolate. I like my chocolate flavor subtle. I was already full, but I'm so glad I ordered it.  Btw, I didn't try all the above in one sitting.

The Spicy Crab Guacamole and Wok Fried Rice were salty.  On the other hand, the Lobster Gyoza and Duck Tacos were delicioso.   What topped it all off was a bucket of sparkling sake - YUM.  Overall, it was a good experience.  The vibe is chill and the food was good.  Since my friends and I were often engrossed in storytelling and laughter, the lack of attentive service didn't completely dampen the experience.",0,0,0,Jane J.,"Brooklyn, NY",20,27,1

No entrees on the menu stuck out so we ended up ordering a bunch of apps.We had:peking duck-daikon tacos - the tacos were pretty good. the duck meat was pretty tender, but also a little oily. i ended up eating the meat without the daikon wrap (which served as the taco shell) only because the textures didn't mix well in my mouth.lobster gyoza - by far my favorite dish of the night. they seemed homemade and had an amazing flavor - i recommend this app to everyone.chipotle yellowfin tuna roll - the pieces were rather small, but the tuna was fresh. i wouldn't go to zengo just for sushi...and i've had better rolls from even small sushi joints around midtown.wok fried rice - not spectacular, just like plain, simple fried rice.we also tried the zengo margarita which didn't hit the spot. the traditional marg was okay, but tasted more like lime juice than anything.overall, not a bad place. the food is decent especially for the area. service was good and our waitress was on point, but the table we sat at was right under the A/C so we ended up moving to the bar to finish our drinks.",0,0,0,Alka J.,"Manhattan, NY",22,176,288

Even the purple mash potatoes turned into a smear of dried crusted almost non-exsistant mash potatoes. The braised beef flavor was different and lacking. At 8pm on a Saturday night the place was empty. This should of been a clue to leave.  The server commented it's been this way for a while. She thought it was the out of the way location.

The place looked very old fashion modern, if that makes sense.We get to the place with reservations for 6:45pm. We were seated at a nice table with plenty of back support. Waiter came up to us right away, stated his name and asked us if we wanted water to start with and what kind. We then went on to order drinks. GF order a Sake Sangria and I had a Sapporo. The Sangria was really good. Not to strong but just right to tastes the Sake.As for appetizers we had the Thai Chicken Empanadas chile poblano, oaxaca cheese, mango-curry salsa which was really good. As for entree I had the Wagyu Skirt Steak Churrasco tempura scallion, crispy fingerling tostones, mushroom chimichurri, chipotle egg sauce. It was GOOD! It was cooked medium well just how I like my meat. Nice and juicy and seasoned just right. The GF had two appetizers since she didn't really like that entree selection. The two were Steamed Buns Al Pastor braised pork belly, pickled pineapple, verde sauce, chile fresno. They were very good. Nice fresh flavor to them. She also had Wok Fried Rice duck, shrimp, pork, egg, carrot, scallion. So fresh and flavorful. All the poultry in the dish were cooked just right and cooked like no other fried rice iv had. Def one of my favorite places for rice.We ended the dinner with Warm Chocolate Soufflé grand marnier creme anglaise, fresh whipped cream. It was a great way to end the night.

He forgot the drinks and one of our four delicious tapas. We ordered the wok fried rice (delicious-but just what you'd expect) the steamed buns al pastor are amazing--not too spicy and very soft. The ""guacamole"" has a kick and we easily cleaned the plate. Things are simple but delicious. We tried the ceviche tasting for two as well--and maybe it was just us but the mahi mahi one was gone in a flash.Maybe it was because he thought we were married (were early 20s in new york...not married at all) or because our waiter forgot the ceviche and the drink menu again...but when we ordered another round of drinks and dessert...the manager (who is incredibly personal and soo nice) came out wtih two extra drinks, a round of fabulous 1929 dessert tequila, and four EXTRA desserts. it's a good thing i have a sweet tooth: i've tasted six drinks + the tequila and here are my thoughts: The cucumber martini is excellenet-especially if you like a kick, and the cucumber mojito is a total breath of fresh air-refreshing and light...i'm not positive everything else was even on the menu but if you do meet our manager friend tell him to make you something refreshing--he will not dissapoint.As for my favorite course (dessert): the warm chocolate souffle is precisely what you'd expect--it's nothing different than you'd get elsewhere; but that is the nature and beauty of this dessert. i'm not a flan fan in general so i'm bias on that front--the churro's are also what you'd expect from a churro-but the chocolate sauce was a bit tart for my liking. Aside from the souffle (what i ordered) my two other pics are easily: dulce de leche pudding--usually this stuff is too much for me: this stuff is fabulous. i'm not sure if my other pick was on the menu but it was a fruity tart toppe dwith rasberries and it was delicioso.i'd come back for sure. especially for the drinks...and dessert. but i find myself saying that all too often...",0,0,0,Lauren B.,"New York, NY",2,12,7

3.0,8/1/2011,"They were strict on our reservations, but we just waited at the bar. Their drinks were well made, their mango mojito was our group's favorite. It didn't seem that crowded, but maybe my perspective on the space was distorted because it was such a large place. I loved the look, the comfy seats, and their lighting.  Not dark at all, so I can see what I'm eating and who I'm eating with. Came here for a friend's 21st birthday so it was a good place to go for classy but not fancy.I'm always thinking what's the best I can get for a decent price. As a group of six, we shared three appetizers, then all got small plates, but we let the birthday girl splurge on her entree.To make themselves credible and call themselves fusion, they really need to combine the flavors in a tasteful and respectful manner. Empanadas did just that! We quickly devoured those. With fusion, you tend to get bland or incorrect flavors. I thought my thai lettuce wraps was a great dish (filling too), but I'm not sure where the latin american flavors came in. Maybe the diluted spicy sauce? My friends enjoyed their tuna wonton tacos. I'd skip out on the noodle dishes, not enough flavor. The duck tacos were quite interesting and definitely a dish that attempted to highlight the fusion aspect of their menu. The ginger salmon was well cooked and the quinoa soaked up all the juice from the salmon and i loved it.A solid 3!  I didn't end up paying as much as I thought I would which always puts a smile on my face.

I signed my half of the bill and left a generous tip. When i got home and looked at my credit card statement additional money was charged. After contacting the restaurant (and talking to the manager!) I was told the waiter calculated the bill wrong so they tacked the additional money (that they said i owed them) on to the cc slip. I questioned how a well known new york city restaurant could do this and get away with it and the response was vague. A phone call to inform me of the mix up would have been acceptable and i would have been fine to clear it up (I made the reservation through open table and pointed out that the restaurant had my number). However charging me more than what i signed on my half of the bill is truly unacceptable. The manger said he would email me additional details and has yet to do so 2 weeks later.

4.0,7/18/2011,"2011 SUMMER RESTAURANT WEEK REVIEW So I was very excited when I came across the restaurant Zengo and even more thrilled to find out they were participating in RW. I came here Friday night, we had a reservation for 8:30. I called around 7:30 to see if they could take us earlier but no can do. I was rather shocked because when we got there the place was busy but not overly crowded, they could have squeezed us in earlier for sure, but that's fine. We were seated at a nice round booth meant for 4 but it was just the two of us, how romantic right?! We started off with some cocktails, I had the Sake Sangria (sake / red wine / mango / apple / passion fruit / pineapple $9). It was good, nothing too exciting but a nice twist on your typical sangria. My date had Prickly Pear Caipirinha (cachaça / prickly pear / lime / brown sugar $9) and this was delicious, I wish I had his drink instead. Great flavors that danced around in your mouth. Our waiter, who by the way was a very friendly kid, highly suggested the the cucumber mojito (rum / midori / cucumber / mint $11), I know it sounds like such an odd combo but it was out of this world. Next time I'm out somewhere and they have a drink like that I'll definitely be ordering it! Now onto the meals ... for Appetizers: I had the Shrimp Ceviche: thai sweet shrimp / aji amarillo / citrus /cucumber / avocado / cilantro / red onion It was serviced in a little glass bowl, it wasn't your typical ceviche, it was really just was 4 pieces of shrimp cut up and then served with all the side components, but delicious nonetheless. My friend had Achiote-Hoisin Pork Arepas: corn masa / avocado / crema fresca. The was two little bite size arepas that packed some heat. He said they were delicious!! Entrees: I had the Sweet Ginger Salmon: piloncillo / quinoa salad / sofrito sauce /warm pepper escaveche Anything with quinoa, sign me up! The salmon was cooked perfectly and you could really get a strong taste of the ginger which I really enjoyed. The warm pepper escaveche was a nice sauce accent to both the quinoa and salmon. My friend had the Kobe Beef Steak which I guess they make special for Zengo. He said it was out of this world, so fresh and cooked perfectly. Dessert: Churros: dark chocolate-cinnamon dipping sauce So simple but brilliant. Such a tasty dessert, and the right amount of food. Served warm too so it just melted in your mouth especially after dipping it in the warm chocolate sauce. Lemongrass Panna Cotta: passion fruit sorbet / passion caramel sauce By the sound of it, you may put your nose up at it but it was delicious and refreshing. My friend saw it and pushed it aside but then had a bite and couldn't stop eating it!! The decor of this place is very unique. they had an upper level as well as a lower level, it's a rather big space. Everything is just clean cut, the light fixtures and wall art accent the space perfectly. The service was great and very attentive. I would highly recommend this place for either a date night or going out with a group of friends for a birthday, perfect space for that type of outing!",1,0,1,Lauren L.,"Astoria, NY",414,331,602

I got there about 30 minutes early so my friend and I went downstairs to the tequila library (biblioteca) to get an early start on drinks. I absolutely love the downstairs bar! It's dark, mysterious and sexy - great for intimate/romantic dates, girls night out, or even just after-work drinks with coworkers. We ordered off their happy hour menu ($8 cocktails), which included strawberry margaritas. The drinks were AMAZING - a really good balance between making the drinks taste good but still pouring them strong. They seemed to also have some happy hour bar bites specials that looked really good.  When the rest of the party arrived, we moved to the restaurant.  The restaurant is this really nice open space with high ceilings and a second level of tables overlooking the main area. The ambiance is nice and the décor is stunning when the light pours in through the windows. I ordered the mango mojito which was AWESOME - and I don't use that word lightly. It was the perfect mix of fruit, liquor, and mint. we ordered the crab guacamole to start - it was pretty good but the portion was TINY. I like how they put bottles of water on the table so you don't have to keep asking them to fill your glass. I ordered the chicken the thai chicken arepas and duck daikon tacos for my meal and thought both dishes were EXCELLENT. The arepas were nice and crispy on the outside and the meat was juicy and flavorful on the inside. The duck daikon was delicious as well - I especially liked the bold flavored sauce and the fruitiness of the ""toppings"" which complemented the radish and duck perfectly. My friends also ordered the short ribs, mahi mahi, and a noodle dish and they all enjoyed their choices. our waiter was super nice and took really good care of us. I will definitely be back again!

This was a big hit at the table nonetheless.Entree:Bento Box: Had the salmon crab avocado roll which was done very well. Not too much mayo at all.

4.0,4/14/2011,"This is pretty neat Asian / Latin fusion restaurant. I never had this type of fusion before so i was pretty excited. We arrived at Zengo early so it wasn't that busy although a few patrons started coming in crowds. We started off with one of our servers recommendation, the Thai chicken empanadas and the mushroom cocas. Both were very tasty, the sauce the empanadas were on reminded me of a Thai coconut curry.. the dish came out pretty quick so not sure if it was just microwaved or what, but it still tasted delicious. The mushroom cocas with quail eggs was reallllly gooood!!! It had an intense mushroom flavor and the cheese went well with it too. For entree I had their black garlic scallops and my wife had the black cod. the only reason why i chose the scallops was the black garlic. I've heard about it numerous times on TV but never really had em' so it was a good experience. Their cod was marinated overnite with what i think was a bit of miso paste and some sweet marinade, overall the two dishes was delicious.

Drinks were good though, and the space is neat (and HUGE) although it can get loud on the ground floor level. Overall, I guess I'd suggest that you check it out just for drinks and a snack.

I like to see a happy and packed restaurant, it says a lot about the chef. The food was fantastic. I ordered the thai coconut soup and empanadas, while my dining companion ordered gyoza and a mango/eel roll for apps and entrees. They were served tapas style and were really tasty. My hands down fav were the empanadas. The sauce was seriously rocking. For dessert we feasted on caramel flan with goat cheese and sorbet. I'm getting hungry again just thinking about it! I've never had flan made with goat cheese before (usually it's made with cream cheese) so this was a tasty surprise. Our waitress was really nice and attentive.

The steamed buns were amazing, but definitely wasn't worth the price compared to what you can get at down and dirty places in Flushing. The Peking Duck-Daikon Tacos were really really delish actually! Def my favourite dish of the meal. It had a nice apple curry component along with the crispy-crunh of the Daikon made it unique and definitely worth trying. I'm also a big fan of Peking Duck (Done the chinese way) and this was not disappointing. The Thai Chicken empandas we ordered based on the reviews here on yelp, but it didn't live up to its reputation. I was very very disappointed as was my company. The pork carnitas rice noodles were good too but portions were a bit small. This could be due to the fact that its the first time that I've ever been to a tapas institution, but the portions were a bit tiny... especially for the price. Only 3 small steamed steamed buns, and a small bowl filled 1/2way full with the noodles. We also ordered 2 drinks. I ordered a strawberry margarita. I had asked for it blended but he just delivered it on the rocks, which ended up being too sweet for me so I took my friend's drink in exchange. (He ordered something green / yellow)ATMOSPHERE - it was very modern, the interior design was very cool. Props to whomever was in charge. The top of the ceiling looked like the bottom of a ship boat with just planks of wood and stuff.  but service was MAD S-L-O-W. the dishes came out whenever other people around us ordered the same dish... getting the check was a pain too. But they were pretty fast about seating us, we had a reservation. The place wasn't too crowded either, we went on a Saturday night. It was filled up, but not overly filled. If you came in around that time (9 pm) you could get a table or a place at the bar within a few minutes would be my guess.Extra Notes: the bathrooms upstairs were pretty cool, with mirrors around 3 of the walls so you could check out ur butt / backside, a view that I'm (fortunately??) not able to check out to make sure things behind me are going well on a daily basis. I knocked off a star for the slow service, and 0.5 stars for the subpar taste of the empanadas and portion size. But besides that, it's a nice place to go. I would recommend it as a first date place or somewhere chill where you just wanna hang out with ur girlfriends. When I glanced around, I saw alot of people just sitting around looking on their phones. A very yuppy location.

First, I love that they leave a pitcher of water on your table so you don't have to constantly chase a waitress down.  We started with the salted edamame which was really good, they put a lot of salt on it.  We also ordered the charred tuna wonton tacos.  They were excellent, filled with a lot of tuna, and a little mango sauce, rice, and guacamole on top.  They had some other apps that looked interesting and I'm going to have to go back to try.  For an entree my friend had the salmon.  It was a pretty good size cut and very tasty.  It was cooked a little more than they asked, but it was still excellent.  I had the short rib which came with a little mashed potatoes.  It was probably the best short rib I have ever had.  It was also a very nice sized portion.  No knife needed for this meal, the short rib fell right apart.  It was cooked perfectly, was very tender, and slightly juicy.  I'm craving it again I as a write this.  Maybe one of the best things i've ate.I was very impressed by the restaurant, everything from the food to the decor to the service.  My only gripe is the price considering what you get.  Entrees were between $25-28 and don't include any sides.  If the entrees included a side or two I definitely would've given this place 5 stars.  Instead of sides we just went to Baskin Robbins after and grabbed dessert.",0,0,1,John P.,"Queens, NY",154,594,399
3.0,3/8/2011,"Amazing space, above average appetizers, but a complete bomb with the main course. I don't recall going to a restaurant as large as Zengo in recent memory.  They have bars in the basement, the main floor and the second floor (the second floor bar was closed at the time).  I don't know how to describe the decor other than to say it was tasteful; it's probably awkward to decorate a fusion food joint, but they avoided any cheesy Asian and Latin American ornaments. I should start by saying it wasn't my choice to do fusion food. I'm not sure I've ever enjoyed it and I think this place, despite being decent, was no exception. I liked the appetizers that tended to be predominantly Asian (the duck) and not so much the dishes that tried to be fusiony. I can't remember the exact dishes I had but there were some dishes that wound up being sweet, which I think was the Asian spin but it didn't work for me. My main dish was the braised beef short ribs and it was extremely salty and dry. It seemed like the sauce was over reduced but the meat was not braised long enough. It was not a good combination. If the restaurant can re-work some of its appetizers and work on the execution of its main courses, I would be interested in coming back at some point.  It certainly looks like a great place to entertain people.",0,0,0,Jonathan C.,"New York, NY",12,49,7

I was visiting a friend who knew I liked mojitos so she brought me to Zengo just for drinks - they have a delicious cucumber mojito. Since it opened in NYC, I've gone twice and had great experiences both times: once to take my brother out to dinner for his birthday (he's a big tequila fan) with our significant others, and once for a late dinner with 2 girl friends.The ambiance is cool, has a young, fun, trendy vibe, which was perfect for both the double date as well as the night out with the girls. Cocktails are yummy and unique, and though I'm not a huge fan of tequila, I did sample a few when the guys did flights and really liked a couple of them. All of the food I've tasted has been delicious. The sushi is good, although I wouldn't come here just for that. In my opinion, the highlights of the menu are the starters and small plates. Most are served in threes, but for a small fee you can add an extra to the plate - we did this on the double date night, got 4 of everything and shared all the plates. Save room for dessert if you can - they have churros with a chocolate dipping sauce.The only reasons I give this a 4 instead of 5 are its location (I'm not really a fan of midtown east), and that La Biblioteca (the tequila lounge downstairs) was super crowded both times, so not only were we unable to enjoy the lounge after dinner, but it also made going to the bathroom kind of annoying because the restrooms are downstairs too.",0,0,0,Kristen N.,"New York, NY",51,27,1

Crispy Tofu - simply prepared w/ long green beans, ginger, cilantro & spicy/sweet sesame chile sauce. Super tasty.The icing on the cake was dessert (my fave part of every meal, of course).Mexican Chocolate Tart - with cinnamon whipped cream, cocoa nibs & a spicy ancho chile creme anglaise. Chocolate tart was not too sweet and had the perfect touch of cinnamon and chile. Great flavor combo.Tequila Snow Cones - Tamarind, Hibiscus, Strawberry. The concept is awesome, fun & super-grown-up, but totally felt like a kid again sipping and slurping. My fave was the strawberry, my friend loved the hibiscus.Overall, great service, great food. Nice, casual atmosphere... and at the same time feels classy, upscale & slightly romantic.Zengo is also a perfect prelude to your obvious next stop downstairs to La Biblioteca de Tequila.

4.0,2/4/2011,"I really enjoyed my meal at Zengo. It was 6PM on Friday night and people were starting to come in for dinner and gather around the bar - the restaurant was buzzing with after-work feel-good energy. We started our meal with a Mekhong Pina horchata, a mango mojito and a cucumber mojito (perfect combination of sweet and refreshing), then moved on to the thai chicken empanadas (clearly the star appetizer among Yelpers) and the chipotle yellowfin tuna sushi roll to start. After much debate, we decided on the black garlic mojo scallops, and the wagyu skirt steak churrasco. Both were great. Dessert, however, was not quite so great. Our server convinced us to order a chocolate tart that was a special on the menu that night. It was nothing special - a cold, hard tart filled with chocolate pieces. Nonetheless, as this restaurant is close to the office, I am looking forward to coming back to try the rest the menu.",0,0,0,Nancy Y.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",81,131,241

2.0,1/29/2011,"I'm tempted to give Zengo a better rating, since our group had a great time, but ultimately the food is what truly makes or breaks a place, and the cuisine at Zengo is average at best (probably below average in actuality), particularly for the price.For a nice, yet casual small group dinner, this spot hit the trick; the atmosphere was polished enough (by a certain age, frankly, the last thing you want is to be surrounded by screaming, desperately trendy college kids as you try to eat), but casual enough so that you're under no necessity of getting dressed up, which is nice.However, though the atmosphere recommends it, the food and service are both shaky. Servers had no idea what was going on, and continuously placed wrong dishes in front of everyone, completely forgetting who ordered what.The food was weak as well; both my boyfriend's shrimp dish and my beef dish were one-note, with salt being the dominant flavor over anything else.  To be honest, the $30 dishes Zengo offered were a great deal less delicious than the $5 meals you can get anywhere in Chinatown.In addition, despite reminders that we had a discount voucher and reassurances that it was taken care of, the bill still came back incorrect, and we had to remind them again to have it corrected.I appreciated the relaxed atmosphere and had a good time, but I would not make another trip.",1,1,1,Carolyn C.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,24,0
3.0,1/29/2011,"This place is neat. It has more of a romantic feel to it, very dimly lit and classy! Got a few drinks at the bar while we waited for our table to be ready. They have a variety of flavors to choose from when it comes to margaritas...yum! Strawberry is definitely the best, though. :-)Our waiter was super nice. (It could have been due to the fact that he was my date's old neighbor from childhood), but nonetheless, great waitstaff! Food: We ordered the chicken empanadas for starters. They were alright, but I think they were kind of bland. Not my taste. I ordered the only chicken dish that they have, don't know the name, but you'll know it if you look at the menu, since once again, only chicken dish they have. I was surprised when it was just the chicken, with absolutely no sides. It was tender and moist, nothing too special about it. It looked fancy and nice on the plate though!Dessert: We ordered the snow cone margaritas, which we thought would be a wonderful idea. The flavor is only on the top, and loses all flavor towards the bottom, so it's pure alcohol. I think it had a lot of alcohol in all three little snow cones. Meh, it was alright, but kind of looked cheap and well, it was messy! We also had churros, and the chocolate dip was just okay. I didn't see anything particularly striking about this place, other than the good drinks, that would make me rate it any higher, but I didn't see anything that was so negative that would make me rate it any lower!

2.0,1/18/2011,"I'm going to throw a wrench into the works here and discuss my New Years Eve experience. Probably not applicable to an ordinary night here though.I'm going to start with the negatives, because they have deterred me and my friends from going back to Zengo. We paid $175 a ticket, but it was not VIP. We were on time but had to wait 45 minutes, dressed up, in the cold, to get into the venue for our NYE seating. I've been to two other nice venues on NYE and even then I never had to wait longer than 15 minutes to get inside. Everyone on line was incredibly displeased with the wait.Our waitress was really nice, but she seemed overwhelmed. Our dishes were never coordinated--half the table was served their appetizers at least 20 minutes in advance of the other half. It was also faster to go to the bar for our drinks than to get them from our waitress. The first time I received my steak, it was raw. (Everyone at my table conceded that it couldn't even be considered rare.) Not to mention, we never received our dessert. Oh, and tip wasn't included in our tickets. My friend supplied feedback in person to the manager, but I was told he was completely unapologetic. All in all, things seemed highly disorganized, and frankly, unacceptable for the amount of money we were paying.Now for the positive. The food itself was great. The XO style edamame and tuna wonton tacos were creative and delicious. My skirt steak entree, after it had been sent back, was nice. The open bar, for the most part, was as promised. It was hard to fight the crowds for drinks, but this is no different from other places on holidays in nyc. The music was also nice and I really enjoyed the Bongo player making his way through the restaurant.

4.0,1/12/2011,"4.5 stars.When it is your birthday dinner, everything should be like Disney's magic. Wait! I heard that Disney lost quite a bit of visitors to Harry Potter theme park. Whose magic is stronger?! I don't know, but who can deny the classic magic of Disney's? Either way, I chose Zengo since the picture of the place looks like a fairy tale garden of magic castle - pouring light thru those lovely iron fence windows and weathered birch/oak tables. All reminded me of a lovely forest. Yes, it is a Spanish Asian Fusion restaurant... not sure what Zengo means though. But, our dinner was very satisfying like dirty tasty street food got major clean up kind of way. It is well mixed alright.. in an elegant term, fusion but futuristic. There are a lot of appetizers in tapa size and some large plates which seem more like bigger portioned appetizers than to be entrees. We decided each person to order different tapas and two big large plates. All to share and it was a good plan.We had two wines that cheered our spirit up if you want to know. All from non-traditional category - one was Spanish Monastrell from the Jubilla region which I already knew about and gave out as Xmas gift to people. Not too rich but dark and oaky red. The second one was 2005 petite Syrah from Argentina. Very strong, the aroma only might knock you out which is the reason to love. Everyone indeed loved this one more. Interestingly aged to light and carefree(?). Now the list of goodies that served our bodies. I ranked them in my way. But all were freshly delightful, except for the average gyoza.Edamame xo style with lime - #0** - absolutely genius. Japanese Edamame meets Chinese Xo sauce b/c the odds in reality is quite...never. Maybe the splash of lime married them.Shrimp Ceviche - #7 perfectly fresh dressingBluefin Tuna tradito - #3 - the fried corn is da finishChipotle yellowfin tuna roll - #6, slightly cooked and that worked!Thai chicken empanadas - #5, sauce was the killer Pork-mushroom gyoza - #10, good but average*Charred tuna wonton tacos -#1, The greatest love of all.Peking duck-daikon tacos - #9, interesting..Beef short rib udon noodles - #4, reminded me of korean short ribs rice cake. yum!Braised beef short ribs -#2 - mashed potato w/ ribs. gosh!Chipotle-miso glazed black cod - #8, good but a bit fishy to meWarm Chocolate Souffle - OMG Churros - donut-y rather than doughy with killer chocolate sauceChai Pana Cotta - sutble chai flavor with silky pana cotta. like in love.Is this a review or a menu? Yes we ate a quarter of the menu items  and were full without a doubt. Then we were surprised when the bill came. It was 30% off since we booked through VillageVines. This is what we call Double Happiness.Zengo was superb and unique. The colorful and zingy foods, casual ambience and fast service. But most of all, I saw the new ""It"" food material of the year at Zengo, *Charred tuna wonton tacos. Charred tuna on top of sushi rice wrapped in hard taco. Crunchy goes with semi sweet & sour sushi rice and tataki style smoked tuna! Pssss.. that good!  Why no one thought of that before? I want to eat this everyday...... for a while.....until too much. Though I don't think that this will work with soft taco - will need stronger stuffing - like korean bulkogi. But no matter what, the rice was the key idea. These tacos should be named ""Zen-Go""! That being said, I really recommend Zengo to open a taco vendor with this taco-sushi revolution. What do you think? :O**#0 means special..honorable award sort of way.P.S. I outed a half star since there were times that empty plates were piled up but not cleared up since servers didn't pay attention to farther side of the table and also too many extra plates were served with no reason.",34,29,29,Sarah W.,"Brooklyn, NY",417,221,81

4.0,1/5/2011,"Happy Birthday, Ian s.! Mexican Asian Fusion was the name of the game for his birthday party with 14 people last night. After some delicious drinks poured by friendly and knowledgeable bartenders, we were seated at a long table with plenty of space to stretch out in overly comfortable chairs. There was great looking wrought iron work throughout the space with fun lighting and a comfy yet borderline sexy feel to the large and open space. I should have gone upstairs to check out the lounge, but didn't. Well, just another reason to return again. The menu was definitely different. They truly blended Asian and Mexican flavors and did so extremely well. I was totally surprised with every bite of something new how interesting and delicious it all was. The table shared appetizers so we were able to try a little of everything. Thai chicken empanadas were five stars, the filling was incredible and the outside crispy and fried up to perfection. The duck tacos were really interesting, instead of tortillas, it was a round slice of watercress, and the pulled duck was blended with green papaya relish. Mmmm. The steamed pork buns were awesome too, I could have eaten a million of them. The pork dumplings were tasty, but pretty standard for steamed dumplings like you would get in any Chinese restaurant. Entrees were the skirt steak with this amazing sauce and sea bass with rice and plantains. The food was fresh and tasty. Just how I like it. The prickly pear cocktail was smokey and tart, good choice for someone who wants rum but not in a fruity themed drink such as the mango margarita. The regular margarita was good too, nothing to complain about there. Our waitress was patient, attentive, friendly, knowledgeable about the menu and cognizant of people's allergies. She even made my bf a separate plate of empanadas that didn't have the sauce with shrimp in it so he could try them too. We really appreciated that. Dessert was churros...WOW. I didn't even know I liked churros. The cinnamon sugar, the fluffy and light inside, delicately crispy outside...I want those again and again. This would have been a five star review, if they hadn't blown off the Elite Yelpers before they opened. Very uncool. I can't get over it. Great space, very cool looking and great food.

Did I mention it was a Friday night at 8pm?We decided to check out the mezzanine level and saw a table paying their check and getting ready to leave so we sat at the bar and as the bartender is getting ready to take our order we mentioned that we were waiting for the table. The women at the table get up to leave and this women comes over and sits down, waving at her fiends to come sit and they've got their drinks in hand so my friends and I automatically think they were waiting before us. The bartender was on her way to tell the server we were waiting for the table when all this happened... Who wouldn't think the table was lost? Well.... Our bartender kicks out the women from the table, cleans it off and seats us!! Even with just 3 of us! From that point on the service just got better, our waitress who resembled Jennifer garner was attentive but not over bearing. She was well educated on the menu and the drinks. We ordered a bunch of appetizers and small plates and shared and she told us how many servings came for each app before we even asked and her suggestions on which ones we should get extra of were totally on point. The drinks were really well made, especially the tamarind margarita. The charred tuna wonton tacos were good, nothing spectacular but the wage beef roll with truffled ponzu sauce was AMAZING!!I had a living social deal and when I told my waitress she didn't give us the stink eye like a lot of places do, nor did she try and add mandatory tip which I've experienced quite a bit when using deals.Overall it was a memorable experience and I would definitely go again and probably try an entree.

The tequilas on the menu are actually very tasty and the bartenders and waiters can steer you to a good option for your group. Considering the price of an individual cocktail, getting a bottle of tequila for an evening of ""make your own margaritas"" is not a bad option.  Also, the lockers downstairs take away any risks associated with ordering an extra bottle.

I love the high ceilings!Food and drinks are definitely pricey here but they don't skimp on the alcohol. As for the food, the skirt steak with the chimichurri sauce was delicious. The fried calamari was lightly breaded drizzled with a tamarind sauce. It was very tasty. For dessert, the churros were aaaaaamazing! The churros were warm and soft with a small cup of melted dark chocolate for dipping. Oh heaven! Had a very fun and enjoyable evening but this place is a bit too pricey. The portions definitely did not partner up well with the prices. The churros were fantabulous but at $8 for 4pcs (about 5 inches long a piece), it's $$$.",3,0,2,Elaine M.,"Brooklyn, NY",93,326,35

4.0,10/13/2010,"Im honestly halfway between 3 and 4 stars on this one. I feel my generousity on star power comes from the fact that I am toasted and still vigilant enough to type a review.I started out at the bar - not the one downstairs which is La Biblioteca, but the one on street level. The bartender made some fantastic drinks. Go him. After much conversation, a cig and debate, we decided to grab a table. Mind you this is after we met 3 guys outside who asked us our opinion whether or not to go in, to which i responded ""it got some great reviews"". The guy said in response ""whats the worst that could happen?"" and they grabbed a table. After another round of drinks at the bar, we decided to go grab a table.We started out with the chicken empanadas, which our server posed a question about shrimp paste or something. My dining buddy said ""sure"" but neither of us knew what he said to begin with. They came out hot, crispy, cheesy and pretty yummy. Definitely recommend.I has the skirt steak entree (medium) with yucca. My steak was about average enjoyability. My initial impression was that it was too salty, but the sauce it was served with dampened that down a bit to tolerable. The yucca was as yucca is expected to be - moderately crispy on the outside and super dense starchy on the inside and mostly tasteless.My dining buddy opted for the filet mignon (rare) and all i heard the whole meal was that it was beastly and overwhelmingly spicy.I will say the saving grace of this experience were the strong drinks the bartender severed up, but the food i was not thoroughly impressed, and neither was the service. Everything was about par. I also noticed he poured our water from an old Cabo Wabo bottle, like an alky like myself wouldnt notice. cmon.Id also like to note that the bathrooms had mirrors from each of the four walls up to the ceiling.

As usual, because of the large size, they had us make the reservation for 6:00pm... super early. In the end, there was no need since the restaurant stayed mostly empty on a Saturday night during the course of our three hour meal there. Now, I kind of know why. In any other city, this could be a four star place, but this is N Y effing C. They need to come correct, especially at those prices. Blow by Blow below...1: Lack of atmosphere. The room is really cavernous, think Buddhakan, but minus any discernible music or conversation or lighting. It was really dark.2: Drinks were interesting and overall delicious.3: The appetizers once again interesting and very delicious. It may be worth while just to order a bunch of these and share. This seemed to be where the strength of the menu is. I recommend the calamari salad!4: SMALL portions. I mean 4 scallops for $24/plate.... ummmm. It's not so much the size as the value that offends. Compare to Asia de Cuba where at least you leave bursting at the seams. The short ribs were really good. Yum, but I did feel like everyone was pushing food around in order to make it last. Just too small.5: Desserts were yums. Everyone loved the goat cheesecake and the chocolate tart with cinnamon gelato. 6: Service was good.Overall, I like for my dinner party guests to feel like they have gotten an experience after the meal and to not feel ripped off.

They have an extensive tequila menu, and our server seemed very knowledgeable. She was able to make a recommendation, much like a sommelier, which was pretty impressive. We started off with the crispy calamari salad. Try not to compare it to Asia de Cuba's calamari salad, because this is a completely different dish. The calamari were crispy but tender on the inside, the greens were fresh and the dressing perfectly complemented the fried seafood. The tuna wonton tacos were delicious - the wonton wrappers fried into taco shells were creative. The duck confit-daikon tacos were good. They were thinly sliced daikon instead of tortillas, tender duck confit and the same dressing we had on our calamari salad. As with the calamari, the dressing really tempered the natural fattiness of the duck. We also had the braised short ribs udon. That was my favorite, Or maybe the tuna tacos were my favorite? It's a toss-up. The udon noodles were perfectly cooked, the short ribs were shredded and then fried. The hoisin broth was rich and had a kick. But let me back up for a second. Shredded short ribs. Deep fried. It made the dish. For dessert, the lemon yuzu cake was a nice, light end to our surprisingly satisfying meal.Yeah, Zengo is kind of a chain (there's one in DC and another in Denver), and it's owned by the same people who own Maya and Pampano.

The Chile salmon was interesting but the salmon was very well cooked and light.  Side of string beans, bak choy and edamame was great.  My favorite dish was the skirt steak - it had great garlic and spicy flavor and was super tender.",3,3,1,Kimberly L.,"San Francisco, CA",816,852,812

The decor, on the other hand, is extraordinary (though she could certainly have cared less), and that seems to have soaked up the majority of their bank loan. One extra star above ""Meh"" for being the sort of place you can wow a date with if he/she hasn't already been here--and those are both hard things to accomplish in New York.

1.0,7/18/2010,"What a joke... Over an hour and served us nada...I don't give many 1 star review, but this place was begging for one. Came here on a Monday night during RW. The place looks fancy, high ceiling in the main dining area, with a catwalk to more dining area on the 2nd floor, and nice comfortable booths beneath that. Pretty much dining for all occasions. The decor is modern and fancy, with (faux?) leather tables, leather chairs, to combine for a overall darker color palette. We did joke about the beams of wood hanging right above us. They serve nothing more than for design but almost gave a sense of danger if the  ropes that hold them up ever fail...So me, Jeff C., and one other guy from his group decided to get everything from the RW menu and split it up tapas style. There's only 8 items and we didn't want to get the salad for the appetizer so we had two cerviches and 1 empanadas. The cerviches was watery, with way too much fruits to accompany the small bits of fish. The empanadas was alright. Nice curry flavor to give it a different spin.Then everything went down hill.10 minutes after appetizer - We are just talking...20 minutes after appetizer - Noticed the table next to ours got some food.30 minutes after appetizer - hungry....45 - 50 minutes after appetizer - Jeff C. threatens to trashes this place, online, no, not literally.60 minutes - They are apologizing and said that the food will be out shortly.70 minutes - We just gave up and asked for our bill.Not long after that, their beverages service director came by and profusely apologized, explained that they are training some new staff in the kitchen tonight, and comped us for the appetizer.How can any restaurant be stupid enough to train new staff on RW? It might have been something that they cannot control (staff out sick, quit, etc.) but the waitress never even came by to our table once to apologize for the delay during our hour+ wait.  We had to find out after we were totally dissatisfied with the place. Every restaurant can have a bad night. But Zengo failed to a level that I have rarely experienced. They not only lost my business, but plenty of others that I have already told my experience to, and probably plenty more people that read this review.

4.0,7/16/2010,"*** Restaurant Week Review *** Date night at Zengo was a success!! Didn't really start off that way because we made reservations for 8:15 on a Thursday and arrived on time but our table wasn't ready. Urg Zen! No worries, to the bar for some drinks. I ordered the cucumber mojito. I have to say, the cucumber mojito was a great option for you health nuts out there b/c there were like FIVE FREAKIN' cucumbers - which of course meant there was barely any alcohol!! Would not order this again. Fail on the drinks. After about 10-15 mins, we were seated in the main dining area on the first floor. The restaurant is BEAUTIFUL. Dark tables and chairs, cute booths, high ceilings with wood beams suspended by rope/chain, large chandelier in the middle of the room and random deer/raindeer figurines along the back wall that somehow fit perfectly in this place. And downstairs, you'll find a cool lounge area with it's own bar and the music that's a bit hipper and louder. There's an upstairs space as well that' has more of a dining space. So on to the food, for starters ordered the Thai Chicken Empanadas with (chile poblano, oaxaca cheese with mango-curry salsa) Don't sleep on the Mango-curry salsa!! It was DIVINE! For the entree, Chile Barbecued Salmon w/ smoked mushrooms and hominy and achiote(brick-red seeds with a earthy flavor) and ponzu (lemon / soy sauce). The Salmon was smokey, tender and flavorable. For dessert, ordered the Mexican Chocolate Tart which was a perfect little treat. Overall, I was very happy with my experience at Zengo. I thought the food was excellent, great portion sizes so that you're fulfilled and not full, beautiful space and the service was acceptable.

Also very nice to check out upstairs and see all the detail with the rafters and chandeliers and/or whatever. Cool little lounge area as well. Okay.. So the problem is that I got the restaurant week lunch prix fixe and I know that it is usually a step below the norm. I am not going to go as far as saying that the food was bad or anything, but I just thought it was a bit much. Tried to mix too many flavors into one dish. I understand it is fusion, but they do need a bit more of an identity if that makes any sense. The meal was above average especially that it was only 25 bucks a person, but it didn't knock me off my feet..

After searching endlessly for the perfect place to have dinner for my sister's bachellorette party, I finally found ZENGO.   Reservations were for a Saturday night for 15.  The things that made Zengo 5 stars: 1 - I specifically asked if they could put us in a more ""private"" area of the restaurant since all of the guests were bringing gifts - more on the embarrassing side for my sister.  When I arrived, they not only gave us a private table but they put us in the back area with a whole private space!!  It was perfect!  2 - The waiter was the best waiter I've ever had!  At first I was surprised because since we were a party of 15, I thought we'd have atleast 2 waiters, but this 1 was all we needed.  Besides recommending some great dishes, he also had a great personality, took pictures for us and was on point with everything and anything we could have asked for.  He specifically timed the food and cake perfectly so that we still had time to mingle and take lots of pictures!  We never felt rushed and he was never rude. 3 - The food is definitely 5 stars.  With all the guests being foodies, it was definitely nerve wrecking trying to find a restaurant to satisfy their tastebuds.  We each ordered 2-3 small/large plates - That's right - 2-3 EACH and there was 15 of us!  We definitely ended up with a great variety of food and everything was yummy!!!!!  I recommend EVERYTHING!  The night turned out perfect and I would definitely come back here!  Everything was 5 stars from making the reservations, waiter, food, service.  Even the cake fee was sooo much cheaper than any other restaurant in nyc.",0,0,0,Sharon N.,"Westville, NJ",49,4,3

I have not yet been to La Biblioteca but have seen it and it looks beautiful.  ATMOSPHERE: It's a well-designed space, although I don't think they take optimum advantage of the available square footage.  It really is a huge place with three levels and some cool architecture.  The lighting is nice, and though I like the huge candelabra/chandelier in the main dining room, it seems a bit gauche.SERVICE: I've had the same waiter twice - both in the lounge and in the main dining room - and man, was I thrilled!  Upon our return, I was hoping that we'd have the same server, as he'd been an absolute doll.  Not only was he friendly, engaging and attentive, but he also recommended the off-menu jalapeno margarita, gave me a tasting portion of a tropical tequila and presented us with certificates for 1 free tequila flight.  This man single-handedly pretty much stole the show.  Amazing.PRICES: Not exorbitant and not cheap.  For the quality of the food, you get your money's worth.  RECOMMENDED:  If you couldn't tell already...YES!!!  Go!!  Go now!!!",1,1,1,Marya B.,"New York, NY",8,19,0

The manager who was there apologized up and down because they didn't get their liquor license on time, gave us a tour of the restaurant before it opened and gave us a gift card to come back. Talk about customer service. Not pissed off anymore! And... I did come back!The place is decorated beautifully, the food was excellent, the service was impeccable and the mango mojito was to die for. Overall, a wonderful experience. They even give you water on the table in these old bottles - a nice touch, especially if you drink a lot of water. Every one of these dishes were great: XO edamame, chicken enchiladas, duck tacos, thai shrimp lettuce wraps, beef short rib udon noodles, beef tenderloin palomilla and don't miss the churros for dessert!!! Zengo was a dining experience and even though we got off to a bad start, it's fabulous and certainly here to stay.",0,0,0,Jenna W.,"New York, NY",75,137,8
4.0,4/22/2010,"Enjoyed one of the best dinners ever here, as a guest during the Friends & Family preview- just before they officially opened.  Fun, spacious space- with killer foods... that travel across the Pacific, bridging spicy Latin cuisine with flavors of Asia. The XO Edamame was incredible- my friend Yisel and I fought over the last remaining bean.  If you go I insist you try this amazing little starter. Next we sampled the potstickers (ever so lovely, with a delicate wrapper).. The lettuce wraps- which proved fun to assemble at the table.. and the sear tuna salad (beautiful micro greens in a delightful, punky citrus dressing!). The ceviche mixto rocked (though as a fan of Peruvian ceviche I would like to see it way more spicier!)  The highlight of our meal was the SALMON. Tender, succulent, perfectly cooked... with smoky wood plank barbecued properties. Outstanding. Perfect service. Perfect timing of plates. Perfectly inventive dining.Alison the fiery, ever so sexy, bartender rocks! I'm thankful she considers me one of her Friends & Family-- It was a meal to remember!",1,0,2,Phoebe J.,"Kewadin, MI",396,352,391
4.0,4/21/2010,"I found this place through suggestion of my friend and fellow yelper Matteo R. This place sounded intriguing, because I had been looking for a good latin-asian fusion restaurant for some time, and I also had never gone to a Richard Sandoval restaurant before (though I had heard good things). So it was time to try out this new restaurant! I scheduled a reservation for a date night with my boyfriend.It was conveniently located at 3rd ave and 40th street, right on the corner in a large and seemingly unmarked building. We didn't expect it to be in such a large venue, and actually walked by it while looking for it a few times. Once inside I saw how remarkably spacious and decadent it was, with lots of wooden beams and wrought iron workings. It was also interesting to see how they integrated asian art pieces in the room (such as asian bells and ceramic pottery) with the more ""latino"" plant life, such as orchids and cacti.For dinner, we started with four small plates and some drinks. I have a soft spot for bone marrow, and got the fried bone marrow steamed buns, which were amazing and filled with flavor. The crunchy calamari was also a great salad to have as a starter. However, I was not impressed by the thai chicken empanadas (you can see them as one of the pictures) which were topped with bits of mango. To me these were mostly crust and dough, without any strong volume or personality coming from the thai chicken filling. We also got mashed potatoes, which were called ""potato puree with oaxaca cheese"".The drinks were pretty good. I did not get a strong impression from my hibiscus drink, but was very impressed with my hochata.We then got our main large dish, which was the Chili Barbecued Salmon. It was beautifully smoky and different from most BBQ sauces I have had, and the fish was done medium - just right and flaky.Lastly, we had the Mexican Chocolate Tart, with cocoa nibs, a bit of cinnamon, and chile ancho anglaise. Just beautiful.The service was amazing. Our wait staff and host staff were very nice and accommodating, and not just for us. We sat and saw how the entire restaurant was working like a well oiled machine. And we felt very comfortable.Since we had plans after dinner, we did not get a chance to try out La Biblioteca, which is an impressive tequila bar in the downstairs level of the restaurant. We did get to look around at the downstairs lounge (after using their nice bathrooms), which seemed to be filled with very ornate and comfortable looking couches. This place was a good place to go on my date, and I definitely look forward to coming back and sampling that tequila collection.",2,0,1,Ginn C.,"New York, NY",132,25,63
4.0,4/14/2010,"Finally, Zengo is in Manhattan. This was another opening that I was looking forward to specially because of the fame of Richard Sandoval and secondly because it's conveniently located to where I live and work.Last night we went to the lower level of Zengo for their weekly tequila tasting. After the tasting we decided to go upstairs for dinner even though we had our shares of the passed tacos during the tequila tasting.For those of you who are familiar with this location it used to be the English is Italian by Todd English and then Wild Salmon by Jeffrey Chodorow. For various reasons both restaurants closed and I think one of the reasons was because this place is huge! It's a three level, free standing building on the corner of 40th street and Third avenue so I assume lease is astronomical as well as the running cost of such large space.As I said lower level is the La Biblioteca which is a tequila bar, then the main level with the dining room and a upper level with future Sake and Shochu bar. According to our server all three are still waiting for their liquor license so there isn't any alcohol served at this place except the weekly tequila tasting downstairs with a special private party permit. They do offer soft drinks like Lemonade, Strawberry Lemonade, Hibiscus drink, etc made with fresh juices. Each level will have their own specialty menu but main level is where you go to eat Chef Sandoval's tasty creations. Menu is as huge as the space. You can start from ceviche or sushi rolls then go down to noodles and rice to salads then down to the large plates. There are many choices to it's difficult to pick just one or two so they suggest ordering small plates and share which is specially nice if you go with a large group.We ordered two large plates because were already stuffed with tacos at the tasting and skipped the starters. Lamb loin and the Halibut at $27 & $28 with South American seasonings were great, but I thought the sauce that came with the halibut was slightly salty but that could be me because I hardly use any salt, . The surprise of the dinner was the Edamame XO! You have the choice of the normal edamame to start with at $5 but why if you can go with the XO for $7. XO is covered with a secret dressing of dried shrimp, clam sauce, scallops, Serrano ham and chili... it a must!We skipped the dessert just because we had no room left but there were about seven or eight choices at $5 each like flan, sorbet selection, chocolate cake, etc.On the way out we were presented with a 25% discount card for future lunch or dinner so we look forward to going back soon to experience more of the menu...",1,0,1,Sebastian S.,"New York, NY",88,103,248
5.0,4/12/2010,"I am a fan of Richard Sandoval (Maya, Pampano) so I was eager to try this place. (Need to go back after the downstairs tequila ""library"" opens and post another review.)  The food here is Latin-Asian and I think it's done very well.  First: staff is very good, knowledgeable, well-trained and nice! We tried: edamame 'XO', a salty & meaty nibble to start, very good; hot & sour egg drop soup--a fave with delicious broth and foiegras dumpling; thai shrimp lettuce wraps--enjoyed the sweet&heat combo; duck breast/daikon tacos--another fave, loved the little round 'tacos' of crunchy daikon, so fresh & summery; Volcano sushi roll--seared salmon, tasty, & good heat level; Scallops--with corn, sushi rice, garlic soy...loved this one! but I was wishing for more scallops; short ribs--a good example of the Latin-Asian approach, with the huitlacoche plus the asian flavors in the sauce.  Short ribs seem to be everywhere but the preparation makes these stand out for me.Design--the room looks great. Comfortable seating.  Good lighting & music too (often overlooked).  Overall we were impressed and would recommend it.  There seems to be nothing but steak houses in this area.  Check it out.",0,0,0,Frederick L.,"NJ, NJ",17,190,5
4.0,4/9/2010,"Since Zengo was new in town, it's hard to give it a fair rating, as they will most likely pick up pace. I liked the appetizers that I had. A bit on the light side so you can imagine we needed to order an entree. I decided to share the scallops entree, which turned out to be good but there were a total of 4, of which I had 2. Since we had room for dessert, we ordered the goat cheese flan and the churros with dark chocolate sauce. I liked both but didn't think the churros were anything special. Compared to everything else, dessert ended up being the best deal - $5 each. And since Zengo is new and is in the process of approving their liquor license, they gave us complimentary drinks. I had the wonderful horchata. The ambiance was just great. It was quiet that night as it's opening week but know it will be swinging with people very soon. I'd like to go back to experience La Biblioteca, the loungy tequila bar downstairs.",0,0,0,Roya B.,"Long Island City, NY",9,22,0

5.0,4/1/2010,"You know you ate something good, something really good when you find yourself thinking about, and craving the dish days after you had it and planning your next visit already.  Which brings me straight to the chase: achiote-hoisin pork arepas corn masa avocado crema fresca. Now there are too many words in that that I don't know so I glanced straight passed it on the menu but thank God for Eddie! Our super nice server not only answered questions we had about the menu items but also asked what we were in the mood for and made suggestions accordingly. And that's when I had the heavenly bite of the slightly-toasted-and-still-soft corn base topped with perfectly cooked pork finished off with creamy avocado. Out of this world. Drooling now just thinking about it. Again.  Ok, moving on, as it was a soft opening sampler type of meal, we went kind of nuts. Also had, and really liked: thai chicken empanadas, pork-mushroom gyoza, ceviche. All these are ""small plates"" and come in the ideal portion to have a bunch of different ones with drinks. I have to say I was not a big of the volcano sushi roll. Oh, another one not to miss is the edamame with a kick, aka xo style.  Entrees: excellent beef tenderloin though my veggies with it I found a bit too spicy; one friend had another beef dish with reeeaaaaly good fried plantains, and another had the hiramasa - delicious. As the bar wasn't open yet, we were not able to sample some of their 400 tequilas which are promised to the good patrons soon! But, we did have some sort of almond-creme drink which I think I gulped up in just under 5 seconds. So good. And one can't beat the presentation of the water either: it comes in some tequila bottle for the table (you gotta give extra points to places that put a bottle of water on the table for you to pace your water downing to your liking; as attentive as the best servers can be, it is just so much easier to pour your own water when you're ready.)Now for the space itself. Gorgeous. In a cool and hip but elegant and sophisticated kind of way. The spaciousness and windows reminded me of some sort of Renaissance classic hall, the tables on the main floor of a high-end steak house, while the bar, the downstairs tequila lounge and second floor just made me want to go back as they weren't open yet! Awesome place, awesome food - treat yourself, it's so worth it.",3,1,2,Zhanna P.,"London, United Kingdom",15,90,51
