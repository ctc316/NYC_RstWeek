3.0,3/10/2019,"3 stars only because the ambience is very nice and upscale, but the food was rather disappointing. The portions were rather small - which is fine - but at this price point, I'm expecting those small portions to be extremely good. For the most part, we were disappointed. My girlfriend had the roast chicken, I would give it a 3.8/10. The menu said the chicken was to be accompanied by a mushroom ragu - by mushroom ragu they meant there would be 2 small pieces of mushroom sprinkled on the plate. It was just such a disappointment. I got a dry aged beef tenderloin, which was much better than her dish. However - they claimed there were accompanying root vegetables and radicchio. There was nothing of the sort, the plate was so unbelievably barren outside of the small portion of beef itself. Again- I was expecting smaller portions, but for the price, I would expect said portions to be much, much better. Would not recommend",0,0,0,Ben D.,"Churchville, PA",1,25,10
5.0,3/8/2019,"What a wonderful restaurant Giorgio Armani has put together for New York City.The ambience is absolutely incredible it's on the third floor and you have a beautiful loft view of their amazing staircase there women's department on the third floor and the iconic fifth Avenue and 56th St.Armani restaurant is located directly across the street from Trump Tower.There are two elevators one to come in through the store and one to come in through the street when I walked in I was taken aback at how beautiful and modern everything was.Everything is in black or white they're beautiful booths and tables across the window so anywhere you said it's an amazing view.The lounge also provides tables and booths if you care to dine there.The food is Northern Italian it's small portions but you get everything that you pay for it's absolutely delicious and works of art visually.If you are visiting New York you must make a reservation and come and dine at this beautiful restaurant with such delicious Italian food.If you are a New Yorker and have not yet been here you are missing something very special!, so make your reservation.They daily have a pasta dish a fish dish a chicken dish a red meat dish,  they also can accommodate Vegans, Vegetarians and people who are gluten-free.They have gorgeous signature drinks of many kinds and a huge variety of wines both red and white.They are open for lunch and dinner every day except Sunday they're open only for brunch.They can also accommodate events and large parties of I believe up to 130 to 150 people.The captains waiters managers and hostesses are all delightful and incredibly professional.",1,0,1,Sunday P.,"Howard Beach, NY",328,401,3629
1.0,2/28/2019,Talk about bad service. I thought I've seen it all. Apparently not. I arrived at the restaurant and asked the hostess if she can retrieve my belongings that I left the night before. She ignores me and instead helps the person behind me because they had a reservation. The hostess then goes to walk the other person to her table just leaving me to wait without a reason why. I am pretty sure I did spend money last night yet I was treated like a homeless person upon entering. No apology was issued for having me wait. She comes back and just hands me my bag that was under the table the entire time (that took less than 5 seconds). Why couldn't I have gotten my  items first before she sat the other person down? Let's just say my company will not be going back with this kind of service. And I'll make sure to let other people in my company know as well.,0,1,0,S W.,"Manhattan, NY",50,44,0
4.0,2/27/2019,"I loved this place.  The interior is sexy and modern.  There's a long bar right when you enter and the rest is like a showroom.  There are interesting areas of seating for four and then from there it is all tables w/ pairs and more along the back.  Food presentation was amazing and interesting on the palette.  The service however, needed work because there two two employees who made our experience disappointing.  The first employee wasn't the best at describing the dinner courses.  The second one misinformed by saying incorrect dinner pricing for that night.  You're dining at Armani for the inventive dishes and the fact that it's Armani though.  Oh and also a memorable night.",3,0,2,Ceylan T.,"Manhattan, NY",168,274,2130

3.0,2/7/2019,"Dear Georgi Armani, you are known as the world-renowned designer who always delivers finest chic fashion. You can never do wrong with your fabulous experience. However food is not your strength. High expectations is an understatement. Perhaps the name is the only signature the restaurant is benefiting from but not the bland food. Restaurant week is always offering very standard food for pre-fix menu but Armani was a disappointment. Even 3 star restaurants can do better than Armani restaurant. The saying is, ""don't judge until now"". Judging that it is time to change management (including the Chef').",0,0,0,Bob F.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,75,290

4.0,2/6/2019,"I came here for Restaurant Week after deciding it was one of the better options in the list. I had seen good reviews so I was definitely excited for this meal, and the price seemed like a steal!I made my reservation about 2 weeks in advance, and the place was packed at 8pm on a Tuesday so would recommend a reservation if you definitely want to eat here. The ambience is super trendy and upscale, but could also be intimate for a date. The waiters were also super friendly. They were rather slow when it came to taking drink orders and fulfilling them, but it didn't deter the entire experience.They started us off with a small fennel salad on the house which was tasty. My friend and I both started with the burrata appetizer and WOW. It was incredible. So soft. So creamy. So delicious. And on a bed of zucchini. We ate every bite. It was delicious on top of the bread basket they provide you as well. I wish I could go back and re-eat it honestly. For my main, I went with the pasta dish and it was just average. The flavors were good, but the pasta itself was so-so to me, but I have extremely high expectations for pasta so others may be more pleased. For dessert, we had the panna cotta which I really liked, but my friend wasn't a fan of. It's pretty sweet and juicy, but very flavorful.The drink prices were too high in my opinion. I've been to Michelin star restaurants were glasses were cheaper, so I was thrown off by that. Two glasses of wine cost the same amount of the entire Restaurant Week menu which was definitely a downfall. Overall, was a good experience and glad we tried the special menu!",1,0,0,Natalie K.,"New York, NY",106,67,2

4.0,1/27/2019,"We visited the Armani Ristorante during Restaurant Week, so we got 3 courses for $26/person. I believe that, giving that this is an elegant and rather upscale restaurant, this is a bargain. The place is classy and modern, the staff is very polite and well-dressed. I checked the drink menu as well, and they offer many cocktails too, as well as wines and coffees/teas, etc. The only thing that was truly annoying is that we got a table very far from the windows, and in between two other tables that were both occupied, and unfortunately both of the couples talked very loudly, and the entire restaurant was noisy in general as it was almost full- so it made us impossible to have a nice conversation, but we could hear every word from other tables... The waiting time for each course was okay. We got a small basket of 4 tiny slices of bread- it would've been nice to get some flavored butter too and a knife. The breads weren't remarkable at all. The appetizer was Burrata salad for hubby - good but not too much taste there-, and french toast for me - which I loved, it was great but some fresh fruit or a small dollop of yogurt was missed. For the main dish I chose the Egg Royale which was heavenly, full with flavors and the portion size wasn't too small. My husband, on the other hand had the Uova, which was basically a poached egg (horrible job, I'm sorry but the egg white was completely runny) with mushrooms- the mushrooms were excellent and very flavorful. The desert was sorbet and ice cream- both were very good, the ice cream was more remarkable, perfect taste and texture. I'd say that for this price it was totally worth it, it was a good experience, but the food is not always the best (it depends on the certain dishes), and the atmosphere wasn't calming and relaxing. I suggest asking specifically for a table at the windows to have a more relaxed lunch/dinner.",0,0,2,Alexandra D.,"Brooklyn, NY",13,91,416
5.0,1/14/2019,"I love love love this restaurant! Bound to become one of my favorites in the city. Armani combines perfect services with impeccable food in a beautifully decorated restaurant. Walking in you're greeted with a very friendly host and fantastic décor. We were seated right away. Our server was very attentive the entire time. The servers were also trained to notice subtle cues of the cross of forks when finished with a plate and did not come over to ask you how everything was when your mouth was full. Which is a rarity in the states and much appreciated. Everything we ordered was impeccable. I had the octopus which was cooked beautifully. Their coffee was also delicious, random, but very good. Armani overall is a modern and upscale dining experience.I would recommend to anyone who enjoys these types of places.",2,0,1,Marie S.,"New York, NY",297,143,289
4.0,1/11/2019,"We found this restaurant by accident on a cold night after visiting the Rockellefer Center Christmas tree and seeing the holiday windows. It has a great view of 5th Avenue. And has a fun, lounge vibe. Yet, it's not we'll known so it's not over crowded. We had hoped to get an appetizer like soup, but there weren't any on the menu that were traditional. We both had pasta for dinner. They offer traditional dishes like tortelli or bolognese, or you can try some less traditional things. Warning- the portions are tiny. My boyfriend got this Amazing pork tortelli that consisted of like 4 or 6 pieces. Thank god for the bread bowl. If it wasn't so expensive, we would have ordered more.",0,0,0,Kat P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,46,0
4.0,12/6/2018,"Nice restaurant on top of the Armani store on 5th Avenue. Food came out quickly and was savory. We tried the Filet of Dover ($49), which was in a creamy buttery sauce served with mashed potatoes and artichoke. It was one of the delicious signature dishes they offer,  also featured in the Tasting Menu ($120). The other dish we had was the dry aged steak ($52), served with  onions and black truffle on the side. Both plates were well made and delightful on the tongue.  Ambiance was sleek - the were some LED lights strung throughout the restaurant. Seating was confortable with several booth options. Service was prompt and friendly. Overall, a nice restaurant for a delicious meal with a view of some of the 5th Avenue stores.",2,0,2,Emily S.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",91,79,44

No. However the attentive level of care, the perfectly crafted simplicity, and the well executed complementary cocktails make me a fan. Everything from amúse bouche to the tiny complementary biscotti was wonderful. Staff always refilled my water. If A droplet of anything got on the table, it was promptly wiped away. The presentation, the ambience, and especially the service make this such a hit for me. I'd recommend this place to anyone, because it's The embodiment of celebrating a special occasion or event.

5.0,7/28/2018,"I gave 5 and let me tell you if I could give 10 stars for this place than I would. So I booked the reservation for two I.e me and my boyfriend. They called us to confirm the reservation on the day i.e 27th Friday and around 8pm they called again to make sure we are still coming. Once we reach the place the host took us and seated us immediately now this is the best part cuz being in New York City every good and famous Restuarant you go to even with the reservation you at least have to wait 5-10mins sometimes more. This restaurant is the first that took us immediately in and seated us. After we sat the water and we ordered drink  espresso martini for me and Manhattan for my boo, both the drinks were amazing. Another reason why I gave 5 star is because the quantity of the food!! From appetizer to the dessert  quality of course they were top but the quantity was so perfect that after you finish dinner you don't feel too heavy or for the first time in my life I finish everything that came in my plate. Now let's talk of the service: firstly they were professional secondly they were friendly and neat!! This place nailed all the other Restaurants that I have been to.

3.0,7/27/2018,"External elevator was broken so we needed to go inside the Armani store - slight inconvenience since they were unaware of the issue, but we were upstairs relatively quickly after we figured it out. It seems like many of the patrons were regulars at this restaurant or knew the staff, and were probably receiving a more attention due to that. Service for us was ridiculously slow, we needed to flag down a waiter a minimum of four times. Our drinks were great, I got the elde and it was very refreshing. Amuse-bouche- we were asked about any dietary restrictions and I indicated that I was allergic to seafood. My amuse bouche came out as mussels. Thankfully, I didn't take a bite but after specifically asking about restrictions and then not delivering appropriately there was no apology and a vegetarian version was delivered 5 minutes later. Still not sure what went wrong there. Breads/crackers come out with the first course, so if you're hungry order an app. We ordered the gnocchi which they raved about but it was extremely underwhelming. They also have the audacity to charge $29 for this - I would have been upset even if this was a $13 plate. Desserts were great - we got the tiramisu and the profiterole. Still debating whether we thought they were great because we were so disappointed by everything else.",1,0,0,M J.,"Manhattan, NY",0,52,0

The bigger surprise was quality of food! Super delicious! All items were light and well done! I still remember the taste of the soup what I had. The staff people need a little bit more training, but our waiter was nice and polite. Big plus for this restaurant that they had separate utensils for the fish and meet- high class!

After ordering some gnocchi, I found it to be very lackluster. Not tasty or memorable whatsoever. It's like a box of the gnocchi I was served came straight out of the microwave. $30 for a bowl of gnocchi!!

The guest came with his companion and then left in less than 20 mins. I'm a little doubtful about their ""VIP"" program - the restaurant was nearly empty with the exception of at most 4 tables (including ours).Food was okay, nothing spectacular.

4.0,8/1/2017,"This is a peerless NYC restaurant with respect to the following features:(1) .Extremely stylish modern furniture-spacious relaxed setting (perfect for conversation- family, business, romance.(2) Magnificent view of 5th Avenue(3) Excellent appetizers - deserts- pasta dishes-superb chef  (4) Gracious service- true Northern Italian styleSome problems:(1) Signature dishes such as Escalope, foie gras, Osso Bucco suddenly disappear from the Menu. (2) Let us face it -it is not a steakhouse - and NYC is full of perfect steak houses, e.g.     Armani's Lamb chop is 1/2 of size of Keens Steak Houses regular Lamb chop - the quality of Keens is much much better: in both quality as well as portion - Chateaubriand at Keens, Steaks at Old-Homestead are much much larger in portion and higher quality.Also there are little gems in NYC such as Chez Napoleon- that have super tasty food -from appetizers to frog leg, brain, rabbit and super Lamb Permit me to recommend Armani's managers visit Keens, Ruth Christi, and Old Homesead and compare the quality as well as portion of the meat - Italians have always been able to excel in all arts - I am sure Armani can do, As it is - it is a must for visitors as well as NYC resident",1,0,1,Parviz M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,47,1

I am not a big drinker so i didn't partake in the drinking but noticed that the staff was quick to refill our glasses when running low. My friend and I shared the chicken and the lasagnetta.The reason I can't give Armani Ristorante a five star rating is because the food to me wasn't that great. It was good enough and not bad but for the price, it was very underwhelming. The staff was pleasant, the ambience worked but the food was just okay.

The tiny plates include bar nuts & olives, prosciutto wrapped melon, salad like thingy and even a mushroom gnocchi.

There is a wide array of wines and champagnes offering delightful pairings with each course. For appetizer try the misticanza salad. As delightful as the name implies it is wonderful combination of veggies including Brussels sprouts, artichokes, pearlized onions, and romanesco in a mysterious and delicious sauce. Also for appetizer, the polipo (grilled octopus) is to die for. For main course, I highly recommend the Branzino!  The waiters are gorgeous and extremely attentive.

4.0,12/4/2016,"Summary:  Excellent lunch spot, but tough location across from Trump Tower which is now often closed off.  If you are in a rush, simply tell service. They are great.Atmosphere:  Located in the Armani store, this place can range from smart casual to dressy.  The look is modern and urban though, making it a great spot for a business lunch or post-shopping reprieve.   I found it to be wonderfully quiet, ideal for catching up and having a conversation.  The dining area is quite large, which is a nice treat relative to cramped tables of other spots throughout Midtown.The Food:  The menu can vary quite a bit.  There are some real hits and misses. They offer a really lovely prix fixe and quality is notable in the ingredients (after all, Armani is Armani).Amuse Bouche - I was quite impressed by this delightful tasty bit for lunch. Soup - I think they make it for a healthier set, as I found it to be a bit bland or at least lacking in salt.  Salad - nearly ever salad at my table was fantastic.  It is the better way to go here.Risotto - delicious, would absolutely recommend this.  Gelato & Sorbet - Very lovely, fresh and worth it.  I was not going to partake of dessert, but ended up joining.Coffee - Delightfully done.  There are numerous vegetarian options at this location.  Also, you don't have to order the prix fixe.",4,0,2,May L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",617,466,229

1.0,9/17/2016,"The only thing that saves this restaurant is the fact that there are still some waiters who have yet to jump ship with Armani Ristorante sinking faster than the Titanic.  The descent into mediocrity of what was once one of the top Italian restaurants in New York, is surely a crying shame and every visit has been worse than the last. At a dinner last night the food was truly horrendous. Dishes took an interminable time to arrive, some came out cold and even though the restaurant was close to empty it seemed no one in the kitchen knew when to fire our main courses after the pasta intermezzo had been served.  Dishes one used to dream about for their flavorful excellence are now a mess. Take the fettuccine with langoustine.  You used to have the entire crustacean, now it's glutinous blobs of lobster dotting the plate (signs of an impending recession?). Branzino was dry, overcooked and cold.  Veal likewise would not pass the scrutiny of an attentive chef.  It seems there is no management and now a once well-oiled machine has descended into anything goes.  The price point is up there so one expects much more for the money, from Armani and from any institution that believes in threshold standards of what's acceptable.",2,0,1,Peter R.,"Manhattan, NY",20,24,0

4.0,5/23/2016,"I'm torn between giving it 3 or 4 stars, but giving it 4 after all. The reason being - it is perfect for a certain context, but its a little odd in some ways too. If you ask me, definitely worth a try though.It's Armani, so the decor is definitely worth a mention....a massive staircase (worthy of catwalk standards) leads up to the restaurant, a generous use of white, tasteful use of little lights in the windows. Elegant sums it up....quite in line with the version in Dubai.The food was good, but it felt like they tried a bit too hard (the plating was better than the actual taste of the dishes). The tagliolini with wild mushrooms, and the lasagnette were the better dishes (thin slices of eggplant...akin to an eggplant parm in a way). The wine list was actually good....Italian heavy, but a wide range of price and types.The service was very pleasant....while I was going through the wine list, a sommelier quietly materialized at my elbow, and his suggestions seemed to be coming from a genuine love for wine, rather than the snobbishness you see at some places.I can't really explain the odd part, but the restaurant seems a little out of place. It's a very trendy, chic place above the bustling 5th avenue with all its tourists. It feels like you are in a little bubble of opulence.PS: if you are going here for dinner, go when its still light outside - It is interesting seeing the insides and outsides of the restaurant change colors as it gets dark...a pretty sight.",0,1,0,Sargam M.,"Manhattan, NY",81,163,0

1.0,4/3/2016,"I had a dinner at the restaurant on Christmas eve with my girlfriend. I should have gone to one of other restaurants in the city. I found the restaurant on opentable.com. In the restaurant description, it was clearly stating that the Christmas Eve Prix Fixe is $85/person. Then I made a reservation over the phone for the two of us.Christmas eve came, I showed up a little early and we were served our food. Food was ok. When we finished the meal, our server brought the check, and I found out the prix fixe was actually priced at $140/person. Surprised, I explained to our server that it was advertised as $85 on opentable.com, but the server said there's nothing he can do, and that I should talk to the manager. I did not do so because, you know, it was a Christmas eve night after all. I didn't wanna ruin the atmosphere.I believe if it was advertised differently something should be done for the customer who came with such a false belief. I ordered without even looking at the menu, because I knew exactly what I was going to order. Never thought the price would be different than advertised. The difference is $110 before tax.So a few day later I contacted Scott McCalmont, a manager, and he said he would forward the issue to the general manager to resolve the matter. That was Jan 9, about 3 months ago, and no response so far. So I think more than enough time has passed for me to conclude that the restaurant has decided not to hold responsible for the mistake they made.This is why I am giving the restaurant one star and even that is more it deserves for what they did.

I didn't really want to eat Hawaiin food so I booked a table for Armani Ristorante.No, you will not be eating next to clothes. If you were to spill some alcohol on the clothes, you will be paying a lot. The restaurant is separated from the store. You need to take an elevator from the ground floor to access the restaurant. Upon entering, you will realize that this restaurant is beautiful. Modern looking large couches around tables, a beautiful bar, floor to ceiling windows. The alcohol menu was not very wallet friendly. It was almost impossible to find a bottle of wine for under $100. I ended up having an Armani cocktail- grey goose, prosseco and pear puree, it was $16 but totally worth it. The bread basket was one of my favorite parts of the meals. I ate at least 4 different types of bread, yum. #noregretsOur waiter was very Italian and was able to accommodate some of my friend's food allergies. She was not able to eat either desert option on the restaurant week menu, so he offered her a bunch of other options at no extra cost. For my starter, I had the beef carpaccio. For my main, I had the fish- it was literally a piece of fish and nothing else. Good thing I ate lots of bread before hand.

The prices of two dishes more than  fair, but they were over charging for ""Armani Sparkling Water,"" which was $ 11/ bottle. This type of labeling a price seems very dishonest.

Worst Valentines Day experience ever. Yes, my boyfriend is not a millionaire, he is a college student, and so am I. But, he had been to the Armani Restaurant before and wanted to share it with me. From the second we got there we were made uncomfortable, and felt like second-class citizens, even though we were still footing the bill. We were not seated in the main dining area. We were put at an awkward side table behind the bar and close to the bathrooms, even though he made the reservation well in advance (they require you secure the reservation with an Amex as well). I ordered the pasta with scallops. It was the size of a portion I would feed a bird. I was left starving. My boyfriend ordered the arugula salad which basically consisted of one leaf, and some dressing, at the price of $25. Not worth it one bit.

The only reason I am even giving two stars is for ambiance, it is absolutely BEAUTIFUL inside! As soon as we entered I was very excited to be there because everything was chic, modern, and plain out gorgeous!! As soon as our mocking, arrogant, pretentious waiter arrived, my attitude quickly changed. Our waiter was not helpful what-so-ever when we had questions about the menu, and looked annoyed for even having to deal with us. Anytime he left our table, we would see him whispering to other waiters, and then the group of waiters would turn around and stare at us until we felt very uncomfortable. I did not feel that this restaurant was of the caliber where the wait staff should even remotely act like they are gods come to earth. You will most likely not find the best of your meal experiences here. Everything we ordered, appetizer, dinner and dessert was ridiculously miniscule. I ordered the ravioli and literally was given three ravioli as my entrée, it tasted OK...not too bad, but not really outstanding either. As an appetizer, we got the duck risotto. If you could get passed the fact that this plate actually looked like vomit, the taste was pretty good, just did not look anything like risotto. It was watery, gray, and randomly lumpy...gross. The dessert, some type of sugar cookie mousse, was half the size of my palm. I'm not one of those people who buys into the propaganda that high price and small plates equals quality.

The food is extremely expensive for what it is, though it is tasty.  Came here on a Saturday night around 830... The restaurant was pretty dead. However they could have easily accommodated 12 people as I came for a friends birthday party. Other patrons seemed to be or in general people trying to hard. Still, if you'd expect to decor is very chic and modern. I mean.. Heaps  of  Designer clothing are just mere inches away. First came out the breadbasket, which was pretty good Unlike what some people say here. I thought each Item was fresh but it was nothing too spectacular or culinary... We got an assortment of dried bread sticks, Olive bread, rosemary bread, and cheese crackers.  We also ordered two bottles of wine for the table... a Crisp Pinot Grigio (Normally not a fan), and chilly Riesling. They did not do the whole service thing where you taste the wine before they pour... Though I don't expect impeccable service here.  They also were out of Basically their entire stock of rose. They were also out of what I wanted to order for dinner... The fame Ravioli with truffle, butter, eggs. So the guy asked me to get the seafood taglioni instead which was a signature pasta. It had a spinach base, mushroom, langoustine (hence the $38 price tag?), and truffle. The truffle was the Biggest disappointment... As they were really dry and not flavorful. However the pasta had a really good consistency, nice sauce and the Langoustine was cooked perfectly. Others at the table got the house risotto, various other pasta dishes, cod, duck.. Portions were all on the smaller to medium side but things were artfully plated. Many of us got our own desserts... I had my favorite Italian dessert the panna cotta with dried fruit, Which was good on flavor, and creamy not flan like at all.  They brought out a nice candle that said happy birthday for my friend. I guess the worst part of the night... Was that there was a really bad policy about splitting the check. They only accepted six cards maximum, which is really inconvenient when splitting among 11 people. Fortunately I had cash (I always do in group settings ) - I know there are fees associated with cards but 6 is a random number and I think the need a new POS system. Would  I recommend?

However we found the sliced bread to actually be a bit stale. My friend and I each ordered a main course only, but we were disappointed. The ricotta ravioli was quite delicious, and topped with truffles, which explains the price of the main. However the truffles were not flavorful at all and there were only three ""pieces"" of ravioli. The bigger disappointment, though, was the lasagnetta. It looked nice when it was served and actually resembled ratatouille. However, it was only a few layers of noodles with smoked cheese, and grilled eggplant and zucchini. The eggplant and zucchini were not finely sliced, and actually did not taste very good. I found this dish to be very heavy and not very delicately seasoned.We left without trying any dessert, because we were so upset. I would not return to the restaurant, though I have to admit that I have very little to complain about regarding the service and the venue.

We had the 5 course Tasting Menu.  The tuna and salmon roe crudo were of high quality ingredients but lacking a citrus flavor that would make the dish better and not so bland.  I was looking forward to their truffle risotto, but was also sadly disappointed that it was also bland. One of the better dishes was the seared scallop from the chef.  Actually cooked perfectly with great flavor.  We were excited to try the veal cheek, but it was so salty that it over powered the entire dish. The veal was tender but the saltiness took away any enjoyment.  The best course was sadly the dessert.  It's hard to mess up dessert.  They took about 10 mins to swipe our card for our bill and resulted in manually swiping our credit cards.

She did not want to be there. We arrived a half hour early to our reservation since it was raining and decided to get a drink at the bar, she was annoyed with that. Then we asked for a table with the comfy couch seats, now she's really annoyed. There wasn't a full house or a wait so it shouldn't have been of any inconvenience to request one of the many open tables with couch seating (and for this ""high end"" of a restaurant I'm sure it's not uncommon to ask even on a busy night).  She comes over to seat us from the bar and directs us to where? A table with no couch seats. We ponder whether we should just let it go and sit there or say something. We decide to kindly say something. (We're not pretentious people who think the world revolves around us, we just want to sit next to each other as we're still fresh in the relationship.) A different person comes over to transfer us to our requested table (I guess she had enough, maybe she should consider another job). The waiter then comes to our table and immediately informs us that the kitchen is closing in 10 minutes. WHAT? It's 10:00 and our reservation was at 9:30? what? Regardless of our confusion we don't fuss and figure out what to order. By the third time the waiter came over he hadn't introduced himself so I kindly ask him his name, Preston. Then our dinner arrives 10 minutes after we order. Ok. That doesn't even happen at Applebee's. None of this would happen at Applebee's actually. All of this is unacceptable, even for an Applebee's. Anyway, we felt very rushed as different people kept coming over asking if we were finished when clearly we weren't. Also, there are other tables still in the restaurant so it's not like we're keeping anyone there or inconsiderably staying late as the last ones there. Trust me, I'm very observant and respectful of all this since I have experience in both the kitchen and front of the house ends of a restaurant. After we're finished with dinner, Preston brings over dessert menus. How? By slamming them on the table and walking away without saying anything. I say ""thank you"" as he's walking away and he replies with a lame, ""yeah yeah"". Seriously?I don't know what we did to deserve the uttermost rudeness from this staff, but we are extremely disappointed and will never be back, nor will we ever recommend this place to anyone with class.",10,2,1,Lisa P.,"New York, NY",2,23,6

2.0,8/7/2013,"We just wanted to grab a quick drink after work, someplace close to the office. I suggested Armani just for that convenience.We arrived and asked to be seated at the bar, which was full. So they seated us right next to the bar at a table that requires waitress service. Normally this is fine, but for some reason there was only one waitress working for the 12-15 tables in this area. She took forever just to get to us and bring a drink menu. I almost felt bad for her because I can see that other tables were waiting on her too. We finally ordered two drinks and waited.It took a while, as you can imagine, for the drinks to arrive. They were very strong, which was a good thing, but I was not impressed with the taste of mine. My friend said hers tasted funny so I tried a sip. I know this will sound weird, but it tasted like suntan lotion smelled.  Maybe we just came here on a bad day but I was not impressed. The drinks are a little pricey since the place has the name Armani and although we didn't eat, we saw the food prices were high too.  Not sure if I would come back here again with so many options in NYC.",0,2,0,Erik H.,"Brooklyn, NY",56,252,6

Of course, in traditional Armani style, the presentation was worthy of the fashion designer himself.Service was pretty decent and our waitress was very friendly. Like I said the restaurant needs to work on minor things. For example, it was unnecessary for the four tables dining in the restaurant to be squished into one tiny corner of the restaurant.  The service also slowed down a bit for dessert which put a bit of a damper on our perfect meal.Would come back here again, but may want to try lunch to see if the experience is different.",0,0,0,David O.,"San Francisco, CA",147,138,6

3.0,4/3/2013,"To be completely honest, this place was picked for its ambience more than anything. I won't say that I was disappointed but I was not impressed either. I was expecting something classy and intimate where people could sit down and enjoy a good meal over small chats across the table. Some attempts when into creating this sense of intimacy since the larger tables were set up like mini-booth. However, if you look at the over all setting, it may tell a different story. All the tables were loosely scattered across the room/hall making it extremely noisy as there was little obstruction/absortant of sound. Visually, it's great that we got to enjoy the wonderful night view of the Big Apple, but with buildings so close to each other, it was rather difficult not to notice the business presentation which was taking place in the office across the street (I could literally see the presentation notes!). The bar was also a tad too ""flashy"" to the point of distraction.In all honestly, this is a great lounge and an ""mediocre"" restaurant. It would be absolutely amazing to have this for a function or cocktail party or even a dinner for all you club-goers.

On Christmas day they called to confirm and  the manager offered to swap out anything that I was allergic to. Arriving for dinner we were greeted by friendly staff who escorted us to our table. One of the cleanest restaurants I have ever seen. Our server Lilia gave us excellent service. I spoke to her in both Russian and English. The food was outstanding, We started with Foie gras terrine, toasted house baked brioche and champagne grape compote. Everything in the bread basket was delicious. The ravioli di porcini were off the charts (they included black winter truffles). They had run out of lamb tenderloin by the time we got there, but they replaced it with a fantastic steak. My date had the zupetta which was also outstanding, and when she tried my steak she said it was one of the best she's ever had. They swapped out my desert for something I wasn't allergic to. All in all it was a very good experience. The bar looked very cool, I wish we had gotten there early so we could have had a few drinks there before sitting for dinner. They followed up with me the next day to ensure that I had a good experience. If you're looking for super fast service from a fluent English speaker at a cheap price try the McDonald's drive thru.

For an entree I had the Pumpkin Gnocchi, which was out of this world delicious.  My friend and I ordered the same thing so I can only speak to this dish but we both agree it was amazing!  The wine we ordered was fresh and crisp and after dinner they brought out a little tray of complimentary cookies.

I hadn't heard much about this place but always knew that there was an ""elusive"" restaurant above the Armani flagship store on 5th Ave. Being a fashion AND food lover, I knew that this is where I wanted to have my graduation celebration lunch.You can enter either through the store or from the side entrance directly into an elevator on the third floor. At first glance, the restaurant is absolutely beautiful -- modern, chic, and decorated in the signature Armani typography and white and black tones. The hosts, servers, and staff in general were dressed very sharply and in general very pleasant to look at. We were sat very quickly (even though we arrived 30 min early for our reservation) at a cool table right by the floor to ceiling windows with a great view of 5th ave and some funky futuristic looking chairs.Now, to the most important part of any review .. the food! My family and I (4 guests in total) all opted for the 34$ Lunch Pre-Fixe which is a great deal for the food and the service. Our waiter was constantly at our table, constantly available for us for bread and for water refills. He was also very compliant and amicable dealing with my requests for photographs for my graduation lunch. I got the seafood salad to start which was very crisp, fresh and delicious but the true star of my meal was my veal appetizer. The veal was cooked perfectly and atop of a delicious puree. The asparagus soup my mom got was creamy and the perfect texture but the best part of our entire meal was my dad's fillet. The fish was cooked to perfection and every bite felt like it melted in my mouth. For desert, the only options on the lunch pre-fixe was assorted sorbets and ice creams or any coffee. We all opted to get the sorbets and ice creams and my three flavors of sorbets (mango, coconut, and some sort of berry that I cannot recollect) were great but nothing to write home about.A great celebratory lunch for a celebratory event.",4,0,2,Nancy S.,"Manhattan, NY",224,153,2

From the doorman to the wait staff, the service was impeccable and the decor was clean and chic.But the most important part - the food. Just fantastic.

The eggplant was rolled around ricotta cheese and five rolls were served upright on the plate. The seasoning and the crisp on the eggplant just made me want to eat more, but I let my lunch mates have some too. Octopus is always a test of a good restaurant, I believe, and here it was perfectly prepared - delicate and not chewy at all.My entree was the tagliatelle with mushrooms. The pasta was clearly freshly made and, again, just so tasty. The portions were a decent size - not too small and not too much (I'd rather have less of a good thing than a lot of mediocre!).

Armani Ristorante is an excellent alternative.  The Armani Bar located on the 3rd floor and their Restaurant is the first Italian restaurant by Armani (that's what our bartender Yulia told us) most of them are Armani Cafe, around the world.  Very innovative dining experience overlooking the classy 5th Ave.We opted for a couple of cocktails at the bar before continuing our shopping at nearby Gucci, & before our lunch B-day celebration of Hubby's 50th Birthday at ""Jean Georges""My first cocktail is the Armani martini, peach puree base but a little bitter, I love my second one which is ""Mojito Imperial"" Yulia makes the best!Hubby has 2 of Amaretto base cocktail, we ordered ""wild boar meatballs"" appetizer, wow! Excellent, love it, first time for me to taste a wild boar meat. I feel so good and a little bit light headed leaving the restaurant, nice shopping mood :)I would definitely go back and try having lunch or dinner at the restaurant. Yulia the bartender said it's the best Italian Restaurant in NY (do u think she's just being bias?!?!?) I love it so far......",0,0,0,Audrey C.,"Manassas, VA",7,45,72
5.0,5/26/2011,"Armani Ristorante on 5th Ave is a great place to stop for lunch during a long shopping trip. It was recommended to us by a friend, and since we love Italian we decided to try it out. The location is exceptionally incredible. It is located on the 3ed floor of the Armani store and the views of 5th ave are breathtaking. The staff is all very class well mannered and attentive to all your needs. They even recommended an absolutely perfect wine to go with our meal. For our appetizer we had the prosciutto and melon. I usually like this with cantaloupe but here they prepare it with honey dew which was different, but also very good. For our entre, we had the duck 2 ways, and it couldn't have been any better. It was crispy where it was supposed to be and juicy where it was supposed to be. We didn't have any desert but were still perfectly satisfied. The best part is, we could just go downstairs and continue our shopping after lunch, without even having to leave the building!I would MOST definitely recommend this place to anybody that likes Italian food and has a love for all things couture",1,0,0,BunnyRanchCami P.,"Carson City, NV",36,42,4

Surprisingly good; in part because I wasn't expecting much (An Armani restaurant? Really?) but mostly because it really was nice. $30 for prix-fix lunch menu was a score. Cauliflower soup - yum - Veal carbonara main was a winner. My wife had a $45 fillet that was perfect.  Good price for the quality in New York, plus a good place for a business meeting (you can talk!) highly attentive wait staff.

I'm actually a concierge at a hotel and I've been recommending a lot of my guest here for Italian cusine. I've only recieved excellent feedbacks from my guest as well.This restaurant gave me a very interesting vibe which I really liked. The design is very modern, they have a few very comfy looking booth and a corner window table that you should definitely request for when you visit. The corner window gives you a view of 5th ave and 56th street. I went right after Christmas which I thought the view was fabulous.The manager took very good care of my supervisor and I. We went at around 5:00pm. When we first walked in, it was still bright out. As the sky starts getting darker the whole entire ambiance starts to change.

3.0,1/13/2011,"Shopping with my family on 5th ave, we didn't know what restaurants were close by. My sister (being our guide) said she wanted to try Armani Ristorante so we decided to give it a try. We looked through the menu and the $30 3 course menu decided to be the best choice. Carpaccio, veal loin, and 3 scoops of gelato plus coffee to top it off. The carpaccio was different from all of the ones I've had in the past. The beef wasn't raw, but it had more of an air dried quality, such as proscuitto. It wasn't the best carpaccio I had, but it was different and thats what intrigued me. After the first course I was pumped up about this place, but when the second course came (veal) I felt like I was being served Mcdonald's sausages. I thought to myself, is this a trick, am I being filmed for one of those Mcdonald's commercials that could pass fast food off as fancy...well I WILL NOT BE TRICKED.  My FAVORITE part of the meal came from the 3 scoops of gelato: coffee, chocolate and caramel. The chocolate and caramel were alright but the coffee was to die for. I actually wanted to just order 3 scoops of coffee but there wasn't a choice. At least I had the chance to taste the coffee gelato. I would return but only for the coffee gelato. I wonder everyday where they get it from. =[",2,4,1,Sean W.,"Hillsborough, CA",45,208,118

2.0,10/22/2010,"Come for the atmosphere -- NOT for the food. Overpriced for what it is -- thoroughly mediocre. They have some ambitious menu items, including a Venison carpaccio. The Venison was a nice flavor but, carpaccio, this was not. The slices were too thick to call it carpaccio, and it had also been clearly much more cooked than carpaccio should be. Further the dish was drenched in a vinaigrette-like sauce which, despite matching the accents of the berries (curants?) very well, rather overpowered the dish. The pear salad was neatly constructed, but very much not to my taste... too much flavor CRAMMED into a small space and they did not quite gel. The special Dover sole was well cooked, but a bit tough, and they should have provided my date a proper knife for the Brocollini, because a fish knife doesn't do much on it. That being said, the dish was nothing special. My Roast duck 2 ways was again, middle of the road. the sliced breast was the highlight of the meal, tender, juicy and the skin was immensely flavorful, if a bit salty  (wholly forgivable) the dish dropped because much of the meat in the leg was quite dry. I take that back about the highlight -- the real highlight was the amuse bouche of some kind of squash soup. That was warm and spicy and did the good job of having me more favorably disposed to the restaurant.  This would probably be a 1 star review if not for that and the attentive service.

4.0,8/10/2010,"In honor of our birthdays-and their birthday party-Shelley, Robin and I decided to treat ourselves to a nice meal on Saturday night.  Our original reservation was for Alto, but due to time constraints, we chose to take an earlier seating at Armani Ristorante 5th Avenue.Hugging the prime corner of 5th Avenue and 56th Street, Armani Ristorante takes full advantage of the vivacious urban art - constantly taking shape in the form of traffic and a what seems to be a never-ending crowd of people - just beyond its picturesque floor-to-ceiling windows.  The handsome restaurant encompasses quite a vast amount of space - so much so, that the dining room almost appeared empty, as occupied tables were dispersed.  The bar area, on the other hand, was at a rowdy capacity.  ""What's going on at the bar?"" I asked the hostess as she led me to a table located way too close to the alcohol-induced chaos.  She explained that there was an Armani employee party and that I need not worry, as ""they'll be sitting down to dinner very soon.""  With the obvious acoustic issues, I asked to be moved further from the madness.  The hostess could not have been more accommodating.  As she was leading me to the new table, an employee who would soon be my server approached, ""What seems to be the problem?""  After I explained that I would be dining with friends whom I had not seen in a while - thus the reason I wanted to be seated in a quieter area - he raised his left eyebrow, pursed his lips, and exclaimed, ""It's a p a r t y...of course it's going to be loud.""  I looked him square in the eye and told him to screw off that ""a loud party is not my problem, but it will be if I have to sit close enough to have a Cosmo spilled on my white summer dress.""True to form, Shelley and Robin were running approximately 15-minutes late.  Since the hostess was kind enough to seat my incomplete party, their tardiness gave me enough solo time to take a couple of deep breaths and peruse the wine/cocktail list.  ""I'd like a glass of the pink prosecco, please,"" I responded after Mr. McSnobby (our server) asked what I'd like to drink.  ""We're out of the pink prosecco,"" he said, ""but instead, may I suggest the Veuve Cliquot Rose?""  Please, and spend at least 10-more dollars?  Psssh, all of that crap tastes the exact same, anyways.  In the end, I settled for a flute of non-pink prosecco (which happened to be the cheapest glass on the wine list). Half-way through my Italian bubbly, my dinner guests and a basket filled with a gorgeous assortment of homemade breads and crisps arrived, simultaneously.  Between sips of wine, bites of bread, and bouts of gossip, we managed to peruse the dinner menu.  When our server returned to fill our water glasses, we alerted him that we were ready to place our entree orders.  ""I was curious,"" Robin asked, ""can I order the gnocchi with a different sauce?  I don't eat shellfish.""  Despite the fact that the dining room was near empty, we were informed that the kitchen did not make any substitutions/alterations.  Interesting.Within moments after ordering our entrees, each of us received an amuse bouche of chilled tomato gazpacho.  A stark-white soup bowl was amply filled with a chilled, chunky ""soup"" of freshly pureed tomato, delicately seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic.  A mound of creamy ricotta cheese, two garden-fresh basil leaves, and a drizzle of basil-infused olive oil crowned the gazpacho.  This proved to be a deliciously refreshing, perfectly-portioned palette cleanser.Roughly ten-minutes after our gazpacho bowls were nearly licked clean, and only 1/16 of the contents remained in our second bread basket, our entrees made their debut.  I chose the evening's pasta special; a tangled mound of homemade spinach tagliolini noodles and a plethora of bite-sized chunks of sweet lobster meat were tossed in a creamy sauce that was spiked with, what I recall being, sherry.  I can honestly say that this was one of the better pasta dishes that I've had in recent memory: the noodles were perfectly cooked, twirling seamlessly around my fork; the generous amount of lobster meat was ocean-fresh and firm, but not chewy; and the indulgent sauce had the perfect balance of sweet and savory.Conclusion: aside from near-deafening acoustics in some areas of the dining room coupled with our server's pompous, holier-than-thou attitude, I did enjoy my overall experience at Armani.  From the restaurant's lovely space overlooking the glitz of 5th Avenue - to the excellent food - I will definitely return to Armani in the future.",1,0,0,Lindsay F.,"New York, NY",376,277,184

All European, of course.At 8:30, we were seated for dinner.  The tuna tartar, pasta, and gelato were excellent.  I was rather surprised.  But I guess, why wouldn't someone who has sophisticated taste in fabrics and design have excellent taste in gourmet cuisine?  Unfortunately, my date was a lover of French red wine, so we did not try Armani's reserve of Italian reds.  Will have to that next time.I would highly recommend going here with either girlfriends or a date.  You will enjoy each other's company very much.",4,2,1,Marie B.,"New York, NY",175,220,7
