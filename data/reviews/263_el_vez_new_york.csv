4.0,4/26/2019,I LOVE el vez. It is sooo good. The guacamole and margs are incredible. The braised short rib enchiladas are awesome but my go to oddly enough is the chicken burrito. The habenaro salsa is also excellent. The only thing is that servers tend to not be very attentive which does ruin the experience a bit. But the food is awesome.,0,0,1,James F.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",10,52,168
4.0,4/26/2019,"Love the cauliflower tacos! So good. Although sometimes they taste a little more... fried. But they're delicious, and the margaritas and sangria is good too! Service is always good, but we tend to go late afternoon before it gets busy.",0,0,0,Lizzie S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,4,0
4.0,4/13/2019,"Still work and live in the area, still love El Vez, and the items I originally mentioned are still delicious! I would also add tacos al carbon to the list. They took me longer to find - they are essentially fajitas... so good. They come as ""for 2"" and it's definitely more than enough for 2.

5.0,3/13/2019,My husband and I enjoy dining here monthly as the food and ambiance are excellent. Everything on the menu is tasty and the service is great as the staff is always friendly. We usually order the Tacos AL Carbon for 2 and ask for steak and shrimp. It comes with all the fixings to make your own soft tacos. There is a big bar scene for those that want to stop in after work for drinks and apps also a perfect spot for a date night as there is a movie theater right next door. You have the option to dine inside (in one of there 3 rooms) or outside. Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys Mexican food favorites like us!,0,0,0,Jen J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0

3.0,2/7/2019,"I must say our service was amazing.  She suggested amazing drinks and gave us recommendations on our taste and was quick and friendly.  The food was under whelming.  It was pretty expensive for sub par Mexican food.  The quesadilla was nothing to write home about and the steak tacos and pulled pork were just average.  Maybe if this was an $8 hole in the wall I would have given it a better rating, but unfortunately for a bill of $135 I left craving Chipotle",0,0,2,Amanda K.,"Kenilworth, NJ",158,275,48
1.0,2/2/2019,"One star for the gorgeous look of the restaurant. Very spacious. Unfortunately, the food and service was way below average. I got the mahi mahi tacos and it literally was 2 fish sticks rolled in flour tortillas for $17. Very bland. The margarita was typical for $14. No one at our table was satisfied with our food. Afterwards, I got a a call from my friend asking if I had got overcharged too. And turns out, the waitress had added an extra tip for herself. So yeah, don't think we will be coming back here again.",0,0,0,Vivian S.,"Manhattan, NY",1,10,2
5.0,1/31/2019,"Say hi to Raphael the manager who is a really nice guy. Margaritas are potent and quite tasty. The classic guac is well prepared, flecked with cotija, and has the chunky, smoothness that I like. Crab and shrimp cocktail was very fresh. Try the tuna tostadas which were very good.  All the enchiladas were spiced perfectly. The star of the evening: Cauliflower tacos.

5.0,1/29/2019,"My friend suggested this place and I was hesitant for Mexican at first. Upon arriving we were immediately sat (made a reservation). Vivianna was such a pleasure and the management was great as well! There was always someone checking on our table making sure our drinks were filled and our food needs were met. The quesadillas were super authentic as well as the tacos! The guac was delicious and the drinks were great as well! I will definitely be back here for a taco tuesday. My only suggestion would maybe be they add an option on the menu for a ""trio"" where you can order salsa, queso, and guac because I wanted to order all three but felt that was a bit excessive.",1,0,1,Alexis M.,"New York, NY",261,177,375

2.0,1/13/2019,"TL;DR: Hard pass. Long waits, subpar food (with terrible value for the money), mediocre service that doesn't understand how to handle customer issues. 2 stars for the decent margaritas and the ambience and decor. It's very rare for me to give a restaurant a sub-three star rating. Usually, I can find some redeeming quality, like quality food despite off-seasoning, and usually courteous service that's quick to fix their mistake... and I value a restaurant that does that. I think a good restaurant is that which recognizes that the perspective of the customer, and a quality experience at the restaurant is paramount to everything else. It's unfortunate then, that I had to experience the disaster of a restaurant that is known as El Vez. I came here with a birthday dinner reservation of eight people a little earlier than peak dinner times (around 6pm). Credit where credit is due, El Vez has really decor, with a sculpture composed of used wine bottles, tables and seating that is quite comfortable. The margaritas we ordered weren't anything spectacular, but not bad either.I think I knew something was off when I noticed that my friends ceviche came with an almost outrageously small portion size. I've been to many restaurants, but we're talking maybe four bite-sized bites of ceviche. Keep in mind that this is $13 ceviche. Where their sourcing strategy failed here to allow the fish to cost this much to give them the need to charge as much as they did, I honestly don't know, but this was laughably small in proportion and did not feel worth the value at all.Next, for my main course, I ordered, at the waiter's suggestion, a lamb taco entree. Now, for $16 dollars, I expected at least, please at least, some form of aesthetic that aligns with the ambience of the restaurant. No, no, it was simply two small white flour burritos placed next to a low-effort placed pickles. Okay, off to a bad start, okay. But if the taste is great, maybe it'll be worth it. No, the sauce is minimal, perhaps to highlight the taste of the lamb. But no, the lamb, which doesn't feel particularly fresh, is chewy as hell. It's a struggle to cut the ""taco"" with the knife and fork, and I confirmed with the rest of the table that it indeed was not up to par. I said okay, and I moved on to the second taco, hoping at least this one would have slightly better lamb. Nope, same issue. I alerted my waiter, asking him to try it and see if he concurred, that it indeed was chewy. He said that he wouldn't try it (of course, that's reasonable), and he would tell the kitchen. He took my food, and I never saw a remade dish again. The manager did come by our table.But he had the audacity to tell me, with a condescending, unapologetic, unwilling to go out of his way to rectify the situation tone, that it was braised lamb, and apparently, my lamb being chewy is characteristic of the food. I'm sorry, but let's use Occam's razor here... perhaps the simplest reason is that the lamb just isn't cooked properly? I've had amazingly tender braised lamb shanks before, and it is not supposed to be chewy. You'd think that a manager would go out of his way to comp the meal or figure out how to fix the problem, but he didn't offer to do that, instead just saying that I could order something else on the menu. I didn't see him again for the rest of our time there. Perhaps it's because we looked like a young crowd that they felt that we weren't worth the effort or the time or the care that the rest of their guests receive. Fair enough. But heed my advice -- this isn't worth your time or your money.",1,1,0,Saish D.,"Princeton, NJ",5,6,1
3.0,1/10/2019,The food here is normally really great and I usually get lunch at their burrito bar...but after today I may not go back.  I found a long piece of hair on top of my burrito bowl and I know it wasn't actually in the food because it looked like it just fell on top of the bowl once it was assembled.  I def would recommend that the restaurant encourage the people working the bar to wear hair nets for hygiene purposes.,0,0,0,Sharon M.,"Palisades Park, NJ",1,2,0
2.0,1/7/2019,"One star for decor and another for appetizers, but service, entrees, and price value fell short at dinner tonight. Nacho mama - This is where it's at. It comes out on a pizza tray and has the whole shebang. Don't skip this, especially if you're sharing. It's a fun kind of nachos to try. Rey Mysterio guacamole - all I wanted for my birthday was pomegranate guacamole, and that is what I got, damnit! This was so delicious and fresh, but a very small portion. Mahi mahi tacos - skip! It's so disappointing! My friend only had a quarter of the whole dish and didn't touch the rest! I tried it, thinking he must be too picky, but I spit out the bite I took! It's so overly saucy, and the actual fish is so fried. Tuna carnitas tacos - I've never had tuna that's been cooked in a slow cooker, and I hope I never will again. It tasted like pork and lost all flavor. Not the type of tuna I had in mind when ordering. It's also definitely not worth the price. It's just some tuna and vegetables, people. Nothing special to make it worth almost $20.The place is huge - rent here must be like 20K - so it's great to hang out with a big group. The interior is fun to take in. But service was not into servicing us, and the meals were incredibly lame, especially when considering the price. I'm not abt that El Vez life, homie. I'd come here just for appetizers and to hang, maybe check out the photo booth, then bounce.",5,3,1,Darya S.,"Manhattan, NY",978,2060,1393
4.0,1/7/2019,"TLDR; try anything with skirt steak.As someone who has only ever experienced Mexican food in the southwest (except for one very misguided experience in France), I approached my group reservation at El Vez with a fair amount of trepidation. Skepticism. Confusion, even (why are we all going out to get Mexican food in Manhattan when it seems pretty well documented that Manhattan is not the place to go for Mexican?)I must admit that El Vez proved me wrong. We started with margaritas and the Nacho Mama, which was a delicious, melty mess of crisp tortilla chips and gooey cheese. I also split an order of the Tacos Al Carbon for 2, which for me was the highlight of the meal. We tried the grilled shrimp and grilled skirt steak combo. The shrimp were cooked well and didn't have a lot of seasoning, but the skirt steak really shined. It was beautifully tender and marinated in what I would consider to be traditional seasonings, then seared to perfection.",0,0,0,Veronica P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",59,17,11
5.0,1/6/2019,"Phenomenal food and service. Cocktails were not the best, but definitely overlooked by the delicious food and hefty portions and fair price. My husband and I ordered the nachos because that's what he was in the mood for and then we ordered the tacos carbon with a mix of skirt steak and shrimp. The proteins had a delicious grill flavor to it. Perfectly seasoned, the presentation was beautiful with a nice selection of sides to complement you tacos or just eat it without the tortilla. Simply the best.",1,0,0,Fey B.,"Miami Beach, FL",353,7,4
5.0,1/4/2019,The food here is AMAZING! We had a large party of 11 people and had a very attentive wait staff that got us drinks and food in a timely manner.

2.0,1/1/2019,"Oh boy. I used to love this place; it was my go to for some great enchiladas verdes. Warning: low rating is based on that (favorite) dish of mine. The service, space, drinks, and some of the other dishes are good. I was just so sad they neutered the great enchilada verdes. This dish used to have a thin, flavorful, slightly spiced tomatillo sauce. So good that I'd mop it up with the side of rice and beans or load it onto tortilla chips. Now this dish isn't on the menu. We asked for it and they agreed to prepare it. The verde sauce is now a green cream sauce with no flavor except cream. It tastes like a green korma sauce, with no spices. For some reason, El Vez got scared of spice and flavor. Maybe they are trying to cater to kids, for whom that taste is overwhelming? I don't know, but I'm not returning to find out.",0,0,0,Asavari G.,"New York, NY",7,62,2
3.0,12/29/2018,"I've come here before during restaurant week, and I loved their food. I decided to come back yet again, and honestly so was quiet disappointed. To start off we ordered the queso fundido, which is the best appetizer you could order, and I highly suggest. We also ordered chips and salsa, and from the photo I posted you could see how dry the salsa was. What happened to all the juice?????  We ordered a pitched of their sparkling white sangria, and it tasted more like sparking water rather then sangria. Did dinner my sister and I ordered the steak tacos. They served each taco with one soft tortilla, which got so soggy that it completely broke. From my photos, the steak tacos looks so sad and blain. Our friend ordered a cheese quesadilla without jalapeños and she got jalapeños. We didn't order dessert because we were kinda ready to just leave. Given the location, it's a great place to have lunch. But i don't think I would be back for a third time.",5,1,1,Kaitlin D.,"Jackson Heights, NY",175,119,524
4.0,12/27/2018,"For Mexican food in this Tribeca/FiDi area, this is always my go to!There are a lot of offices around here, so if you are going in a big group, I do suggest making a reservation -- otherwise, you should be fine when it comes to seating.Every time I come here, I always get an appetizer, entree, and side -- everything is too good to resist! Typically I order the Nacho Mama ($18) because it's so delicious and it has a ton of ingredients on there. Then, I order the Steak Tacos ($18) -- they are literally just steak chunks, tomatoes, and cilantro on a tortilla and honestly, that's all you need. And as a side, I order the grilled corn OFF the cob - trust me, if you haven't tried it, you NEED to!!I honestly haven't tried the other tacos because I'm obsessed with the steak tacos (so much steak!) that I always feel I'm getting my money's worth when I order them. Drinks! Either of the pitchers of sangria are amazing -- also if you're looking for non-alcoholic drinks, I would recommend the pineapple ginger drink -- so refreshing, and lots of ginger! And if you're looking for a great time, definitely the margaritas!Cailin's Recommendations- Nacho Mama ($18): melted queso mixto, black beans, salsa ranchera, sour cream, pickled red onion, and jalapeño - Steak Tacos ($18): grilled skirt steak, cherry tomato pico de gallo & salsa taquera- Corn OFF the Cob ($7): grilled corn, lime, chipotle & queso fresco- Blanca sangria ($13/glass | $48/pitcher): prosecco, giffard pamplemousse, grapefruit, mint, kiwi, strawberry- Pineapple Ginger Punch ($6)",0,0,0,Cailin C.,"Elmhurst, NY",23,87,106
4.0,12/27/2018,"The GUAC! So, I'm officially addicted to their guac and chips... the best to ever hit my tongue. A note: If you want any sort of spice be sure to ask for it on the side... they DO NOT add spice/heat to their guacamole.  I organized a large lunch here in their private dining room.  The servers were great and we all enjoyed the food and drinks. It all tasted wonderful. People complained to me that the portions were small though, there was not enough food to share from our ""family style"" menu for the amount of people we had. Rice and beans came out in these tiny bowls... We literally were only able to have a few fork full portions to each plate.  If I consider having an event here again I would have to ask about modifying the amount of food sent out because it was pretty underwhelming. The venue is very pleasing to the eye and a cool spot to grab a drink.  All in all I am happy to have dined here.",0,0,0,Mimi M.,"New York, NY",8,100,4
4.0,12/26/2018,"El Vez is one of my go to Mexican restaurants. I'm a big fan because it doesn't break the bank, but hits the spot.. especially if you order the right thing. What I recommend:Appetizer: the best appetizer is the Nacho Mama $18. I don't always order it because I try to eat minimal dairy and my girlfriend eats 0 dairy, so I would end up eating the whole thing by myself. But it rocks. Some of the best nachos in the city. Order it.Classic Guacamole $18 - another solid choice. The guacamole is fresh and doesn't disappoint. Tuna Tostada $16 - small portion for the price, but decent choice if you are trying to be healthy. Baja Crab & Shrimp Cocktail Ceviche $18 - probably the least desirable out of the bunch but it's fine. I really like ceviche though. I wouldn't order this as a first choice. Dinner:Two choices here as far as I'm concerned:Option 1Order the Tacos Al Carbon for 2 ($44-63). This is a good filling meal, but I stopped ordering it because it's so salty (if you don't mind, then you'll like it).Option 2Order tacos. 3 tacos come out, and they are pretty well stuffed for the price. If I'm really hungry I'll get 3 orders of tacos for 2 people.. but 2 should do the trick in most situations. The best tacos are:Crispy Mahi Mahi Tacos $17 - there are only 2 Mahi Mahi tacos, but they are bigger than the others. These are delicious, get them if you want to go fried.Steak Tacos $18 - the steak tacos are the bomb, I almost always order these.Shrimp Tacos $17 - these are also really good, I think they modified the recipe to be more spicy, and they are banging. Chicken Tacos $16 - the unsung heros of the taco menu. Never want to order these because they are just boring chicken, but every time I'm happy when I get them. Recommended.Baha Fish Tacos $16 - I don't like these. Last time I didn't even finish them. Just not to my taste. YMMV.Service varies from ""very good"" to ""rushing you out the door"".Atmosphere ranges from ""great I got a nice booth"" to ""I know everything about the people next to me because I didn't get a booth and we're seated so close to each other our elbows are touching"".Overall a solid spot for dinner on a Friday or Saturday night before going to the movies.",0,0,0,Chris B.,"New York, NY",110,61,237

Along with what everyone else here pretty much has said, the service isn't great at all. While the waiters are definitely nice and friendly, it's just so slow. We had already finished our guac by the time any of our drinks came out, and even then, we had to put in our drink orders at the same time as the entrees which was pretty late. We got a couple different margaritas and they were pretty decent.Now for the food - the guac is pretty good. It isn't the best I've had in the city, but it isn't the worst. The portion is pretty decent for 2-3 people, but no more than that. For my entree, I've gotten different kinds of tacos and I've found that the chicken taco is my favorite.

We had a reservation for 8 people, so we were seated right away. Pretty sure if we didn't have a reservation we'd still be seated right away because the restaurant was empty. It took almost 30 minutes to get our drinks and then another 40 minutes to get our food. Our server did not check in with us unless someone called him over.

5.0,9/25/2018,"Not being from NYC, we did not realize there were 2 El Vez's right next to each other, one for take out with limited seating to dine in and a larger regular full service dine in restaurant.  Soooo, like sheep, we stood in the long line that was actually the Burrito Bar take out line. The bar is a Chipotle style set up but the selection is way better.  You can order bowls or burrito's, I opted for the steak burrito, it was one of the best burritos I have ever had. The beef was high quality, flavorful and tender. Granted, this is NOT your tradition burrito so if that is what you are looking for, go somewhere else.  The burritto was giant size so if you are not a big eater like me, it is big enough to share.We were able to nab a table outside and even though the line was long, it moved pretty fast and was well worth the wait.  After we realized there were 2 restaurants, I checked out the regular dining side menu and while they offer more options, the prices are much higher, so if you are on a budget, the Burrito Bar is the place to go.

My friends got chicken quesadillas ($15) and I preferred these over the fish tacos. The salsa that came with the quesadillas was also very good.

Also had some chicken quesadillas, which were full of cheesy goodness. Prices were about $18-19 each, I believe. Service was pretty good despite being a busy place.

Aside from the guac issue, El Vez delivers fresh and authentic Mexican food.  Their shrimp tacos are a no-brainer overtime we come they are fresh and tasty without the typical over-seasoning you find elsewhere.  The atmosphere in the TriBeCa restaurant is a bit more hip and upscale than the one in Philly, but for some reason I miss the photo booth and wish they had one here:).",0,0,0,Elisa D.,"Mendham, NJ",0,6,0

4.0,8/15/2018,"As a native Houstonian and avid Tex-Mex fan, I am often skeptical when trying new Mexican restaurants. Given the family with which El Vez is affiliated (Starr), I figured it was a safe bet. Luckily my intuition was correct as I very much enjoyed my Saturday night dinner. To start, the restaurant is very spacious, especially by New York standards. The cocktail menu was very manage-ably extensive and delicious. My friend and I started with the Tito Santana guacamole. For $17, we kind of expected the guacamole to be made table side as it is in Philadelphia; however, it was delivered straight from the kitchen. Despite not being made in front of us, the guacamole was delicious and I do not in any way regret ordering. I was craving enchiladas and the short rib enchiladas definitely quenched my thirst. My friend ordered the red snapper which she loved and described as ""five star"", ""perfectly cooked"", and ""drool"". While a bit off the beaten path for a Saturday night dinner (I imagine this place being more of a weeknight scene given it's location), I very much enjoyed my experience and was happy to check another Starr restaurant off the list.",2,0,0,David Joseph H.,"New York, NY",180,32,19

4.0,7/16/2018,"El Vez is a straight-forward Mexican restaurant whose menu covers all the staples someone not on the hunt for ""authentic"" Mexican food would be looking for; enchiladas, tacos, burritos, guacamole, nachos, etc. It is certainly on the expensive side, but you ultimately leave pleased with your experience.  If you want ""authentic"" Mexican food, or think this is going to compare to your favorite spot near the border. you're going in with the wrong expectations; it is Battery Park City, not Port Isabel. El Vez is located across the FDR, near Brookfield Place, making accessibility via subway difficult.  The space strikes me as incredibly large; probably too large for what is needed.  I've only visited twice for brunch so far, but I have never seen the place come close to capacity.  I suspect the rent expenses are passed along to the diner in the menu prices, as I'll discuss below.  Regardless, it is nice that it is a restaurant where you feel like you have room; you step off of a busy Manhattan street and into what could feel like a suburban Mexican restaurant.  There is a huge bar area and two separate dining rooms, with outdoor seating running what appears to be approximately three storefronts worth of space.  I have a feeling that El Vez would be well skilled at handling/entertaining a large group, either at the bar or for dinner.  The decor (in the dining room anyway) has a fun DIY vibe to it.On both of my visits, I made reservations, but those were wholly unnecessary.  The staff is attentive and checks on your table regularly.  I've had no issue with the service with either of my visits.  The red and white sangrias are refreshing for a midday drink, with the red erring on the sweeter side, oddly enough.  This may change subject to who is making the sangria, but from my experience, the white was the less sweet (and preferred) of the two.    The food, as noted by many other reviews, was quite pricey for what it was.  However, the Nacho Mama alone was enough to convince me to come back for another visit.  If you've left and haven't ordered it, you've made a mistake.  They're styled in such a way that nearly each chip has a perfect balance of ingredients on it, where you get a perfect ratio of cheese, beans, onions, and jalapenos on nearly every bite (bonus: the jalapenos are fresh, so you don't get the over-powering pickled jalapenos taste familiar to cheap nachos). However, combined with an order of guacamole, you're already looking at a $34 bill before tax and tip. As I glanced around the empty and cavernous space, I couldn't help but think that I was subsidizing their unused space.  (Note about the guacamole: they serve the guacamole in a traditional stone mortar, lined with an unsecured banana leaf. I'm not sure why this is. The leaf just moves around and ultimately makes it more difficult to eat all the guacamole. This has no impact on the taste, which is very good, but just a functional observation.) The tacos can only muster an ""alright"" from my experience.  The Tacos de Machaca, the closest I've had to a proper breakfast taco from a full service restaurant in NYC (King David's Tacos, in the area during week day mornings, have excellent, Austin-style breakfast tacos), met expectations, with just enough oiliness, spice, and pop of avocado to keep me coming back for more.  The crispy Mahi Mahi tacos were ultimately a let down, largely due to the tortillas.  The filling tasted fresh, and the fried fish was cooked well, but the tortillas tasted obviously store bought.  Now normally, I wouldn't have a huge issue with a restaurant cutting costs with store bought tortillas, but they're charging me $16 for two.  When you bite into the Mahi taco, the first flavor you get is the plastic bag preservative you experience when you're desperately scarfing down Mission Tortillas in the middle of the night, not an $8 per Mahi taco experience.  Additionally, there was a little knot tied around the taco, making it somewhat more difficult to eat.  If I could change one thing about El Vez food, I would beg them to make some in-house tortillas to stand above the rest.  Ultimately, if you're coming here looking for an authentic Mexican experience, with free chips and salsa and plates of food as big as your head, you're going to end up disappointed.  If you're looking for reliable, ""mainstream"" Mexican food and good service in a larger space, El Vez is the spot for you.",0,0,0,Alexander B.,"New York, NY",160,57,118

First of all, the atmosphere here is spot on. The restaurant is spacious and lively and was the perfect spot to grab an after-work bite. We opted for the guacamole, split the chicken enchiladas and each got a side (me the plantains and my friend the tortilla soup). The guacamole was on the expensive side, but the portion was great for two people and it was very yummy. It was worth the money spent in my book. The plantains were fabulous, and even though the portion for a side was big, I could've eaten a full plate of them they were that good. The only dish I was somewhat let down by were the chicken enchiladas. Don't' get me wrong, they were good, but I think they fell a little flat compared to our other dishes, especially since they were on the pricer side for only two of them.

The interior decor totally caught my attention. My favorite were the top shelf tequila bottles lit up around the restaurant. We were a party of 6 and started off with Nachos and queso fundido con hongos. Both hit the spot and totally filled my expectations. For my drink I had to taste the spicy cucumber margarita. Very well balanced. Not to sweet, sour or spicy. Right on point! Of course for dinner I wanted to try everything they had but my BF insisted on the tacos al carbon which lemme tell you left me full! This dish is presented on a huge mocajete with rajás and of course your choice of protein. We had the trio combo that came with chicken, steak and shrimp.

She introduced me to this place, and we used to go here pretty often. Today, I was craving for some good guac and tacos and googled this spot. Little did I know that this was the SAME business as the one in Philly. I was so excited, because I'm very familiar with the menu. I started off with chips and guacamole and worked my way down. The waiter that I had was absolutely amazing (can't remember his name), but he's originally from Virginia. He was very friendly and told me his top favorite margaritas. I was sold! I started off with the burnt Grapefruit margarita which was really refreshing with mint leaves inside. I then wanted to try something a little spicy, because I enjoy a good spicy margarita. He introduced me to the ""Red Bell Pepper Margarita"" and it was absolutely amazing!! You can taste not only the tequila, but the flavor of the pepper. Now since I know that there is an El Vez around here, it's safe to say that I'll be coming here pretty often. Like the good ole' days. There is NO HAPPY HOUR so I'm just letting people know right now don't expect it. However it is worth the food and cocktails. The drinks range from $15-$16 so expect for it to be somewhat pricy.

Having been to both the Philadelphia location as well as this one, I can say that both venues regardless of location offer an authentic mexican feel but the NYC location is bigger. I am pretty sure that the menus do vary from location to location.If you are looking to order margaritas to kick off your meal, it is well worth it to order the pitcher for $48- you get about 5-6 margaritas out of it and they are strong margaritas (definitely don't taste like margarita mix). I am a huge fan of their tray of nachos (specifically the Macho Nachos) which easily feeds 4-6 people. My boyfriend and I always order it on our date nights and I have to say that the nachos alone can be considered a meal!For dinner, we normally split the steak and chicken tacos for two. When it comes out, it may look somewhat small but as you begin to eat, you will quickly start feeling full. I also enjoy getting the enchiladas which is a great portion size.

The chicken breast was probably the best, and sort of like fajitas with soft tacos and onions and peppers. The plantains were good. He blood orange margaritas were also very tasty and refreshing, really nothing to complain about. I have no idea how strong they were, they didn't taste strong but that doesn't mean much. I also don't know if they made them differently for our group event with limited drink choices. The dessert sampler was pretty good. The flan had a lot of seasoning, maybe nutmeg. The churros were fine, nice and crispy but not particularly special. The coffee was fairly strong and good, although not especially complex. I liked our servers a lot, although we were left without plates or silverware for dessert to the point where it felt like a reality show about eating soft flan and gooey bread pudding and such with our hands and without dropping it all over tables and laps.

The meat was juicy and the lamb was cooked well but I was too full at that point and couldn't finish it.

It was odd hour to visit - just between lunch and happy hour on a Friday - so I wasn't surprised by how quiet it was. Our server asked for drinks while up-selling us chips and salsa. Salsa came before our alcohol though. I hate that. 2.5 stars for chips and salsa ($6). Chips were standard corn and not particularly fresh. Salsa was completely underwhelming; diced too thin, not enough spice, artificial acidity. Tasted like store-bought salsa with a few fresh tomatoes. Egh! 2.5 stars for Baja Shrimp and Crab Ceviche ($16). It was tossed in a viscous, tangy, unnecessary sauce. I was looking forward to pieces of crab and shrimp in lime, fresh onion, cilantro, and salt. Got slimy chunks of crab meat in a red sauce. Not ceviche. No spice. Also, sweet? The included chips were notably dense and fresh, though!2 stars for Mahi Mahi tacos ($16). Two thick pieces of heavily breaded fish in two flour tortillas with very light sauce and a disappointing amount of flavor. Neither flavor nor serving-size were worth the price. Grilled fish tacos ($17): a solid 3-Star dish. Three soft corn tortillas filled with hearty hunks of tender fish with a nice little char. Not particularly interesting, but at least well-seasoned. The Baja Slaw was crispy and zesty, but there wasn't enough of it to make the taco(s) exciting. 3 stars for excellent agave menu and happy service.

Out of all the restaurants I have experienced during restaurant week, this is definitely the most bang for your buck. And after my experience I am inclined to come back, even not during restaurant week. Don't expect super authentic Mexican food here, but the twists that they put on their dishes make them pretty damn tasty.Atmosphere: If you're looking for a nice, intimate and quiet place to dine, 100% do not go here. It's loud, packed, and loud (so loud I need to mention it twice, err three times). Made reservations for 7:30 dinner on a Thursday night and the place was pretty packed.Food: Restaurant week, as previously stated, has four courses available to you. Each course had about 3-4 items you could select. I'll run through what I chose:1) Guacamole: Fresh, and they give you a good 1/2 cup to a cup full! They also provide you with chips and salsa too. The cotija cheese was an added touch to the guac, and I could taste hints of lime. Only gripe is that it was a little too smooth- I could've appreciated a few more smaller chunks of avocado in the mix. Nonetheless, pretty solid guac.2) Queso fundido con carne: A square cast iron, not too deep, filled with a layer of stringy cheese (don't expect the queso that is prominent in places like Texas, where it's more nacho cheesy) and a dollop of chorizo an dfour (yes, four!) small flour tortillas. This stuff is filling. I ate like a corner of it before I realized I had two more dishes I needed to save my appetite for. The tortillas were nice and warm and soft, and the cheese was good, albeit with the chorizo a little on the oily side. 3) Beef short rib enchilada: Delectable! The short rib was soft, tender, and plentiful, and the sauce that draped the enchilada was a nice smokey flavor. I enjoyed the watermelon radishes and onions and they provided a nice crunch texture to the otherwise soft enchilada. I could only eat once enchilada, but I enjoyed it very much.4) Chocolate bread pudding: Good, but nothing too memorable. Probably my least favorite of the dishes.

Last night was my friend's birthday and I read a review that someone coordinated a birthday surprise here. I called ahead and asked for a reservation ""for five, for my friend's birthday!"" When we arrived I told the host and the person pouring our waters that it was her birthday. Our waiter didn't come for fifteen minutes, and he only took our drink orders. We waited for ages for our pitcher of margarita, then waited for ages for our chips and guac, then double that time for our food. Nobody checked on us, nobody updated us on when everything's coming, nobody even came to see if we needed more drinks! The restaurant was not busy either. We saw plenty of waiters slowly wiping down tables near us and our own waiter having an extensive conversation with another table while we waited and tried to flag him down. Oh! And no birthday love.. Is it wrong to assume that a restaurant will do something celebratory when you make a reservation and clearly communicate the BIRTHDAY thing?? Finally after they'd given us the check and we were doing our best not to let this ruin our night (all of us were frustrated), one waiter brought out a tiny teacup full of this mango ice cream and sang happy birthday slowly in English. W sang along but it had to have been the lamest birthday moment of my friend's life. And I'm almost positive they heard me complaining and did that super last minute. I'm a vegan and there were zero dinner options without meat or cheese. They definitely shouldn't pride themselves in being healthy... I'm also pretty positive the guacamole has dairy in it because that's all I ate and I got very sick when I got home.

The food, however, is going to be a pass from me. I have a few reasons for this...(1) It always smells like a bathroom in here (like a mix of public lavatory and bathroom cleaner) which is VERY unappetizing. Restaurants should not smell like this. This needs to stop.(2) Those eating here are usually tourists or people who work nearby. I've only ever come here because other coworkers love its convenient location. No one I know has ever raved about the food.(3) The food is okay, but not spectacular. Dos Toros in Hudson Eats offers fresher food that smells good (and not like a bathroom...

Luckily, El Vez doesn't require that the entire party be present to be seated, so we were promptly led to a table and given menus.While we had no problem ordering drinks initially, the waitress never came back to check on us and our friends ended up taking longer than expected. While I tried to get the attention of waiters and waitresses as they walked by, everyone was too busy attending to their own tables and we waited 30 to 45 minutes until our friends arrived and then were able to order. If our friends did not end up coming, I'm not convinced the waitress would have ever come back to check on us.I ordered the hibiscus margarita, which was not that flavorful and a bit strong, steak tacos, which were small but delicious, and a white sangria, which was sweet and refreshing.Overall, I like the food and drinks here but don't think the high prices (at least for the food) are warranted. If this place weren't so conveniently located, I probably wouldn't visit again.Would recommend trying the El Vez Burrito Bar for lunch instead if you're ever in Battery Park, as it is priced similarly to Dos Toros and Chipotle nearby, but is superior in taste in my opinion with choices like Korean bulgogi and toppings like pineapple salsa.Note that the burrito bar is completely separate from the El Vez in this review (if you order from the burrito bar, you're not allowed to sit in the main restaurant--only the small tables within the burrito bar itself).",0,0,0,Amanda W.,"London, United Kingdom",242,96,259

We were seated pretty quickly (for a Saturday during brunch hours) at the back of the restaurant. Between the two of us, we ordered their classic guacamole ($16), nacho mama ($16), as well as their steak and eggs ($19), to share. Their guacamole was extremely fresh and paired well with the chips. The Nacho Mama was my favorite part of the meal! Loaded nachos with black beans, salsa ranchera, sour cream, pickled red onions, with a nice melted layer of jack cheese. It was so big the two of us had to take most of it to go. Their steak and eggs weren't anything too special, though the steak was marinated well and cooked to my liking. Will I be back? Maybe, if I'm really craving those loaded nachos.",0,0,0,Minna C.,"New York, NY",511,200,570
4.0,11/16/2017,"Ordered take-out from this hip and trendy Mexican restaurant with a coworker who wanted to try it.  This is the kind of restaurant that will be jam-packed with the local business suit types for Happy Hour. A big restaurant with an almost Disney World-like, Mexican-themed decor, and dark lighting for young professionals to socialize and network in.I had a serious craving for fully loaded nachos, so I ordered something called the Macho Nacho ($18), which is like the Nacho Mama ($16) - melted jack cheese, black beans, salsa ranchera, sour cream, pickled red onion & jalapeño - except they also add chorizo. I don't think I ever paid so much for nachos in my life! However, I must admit they were also the best nachos I've had so far. Since I took the food to go, they smartly packaged it in a pizza box. When I got back to the office and opened it, I found all of the nachos and toppings carefully and evenly distributed - like a pizza. They nicely assembled all of the ingredients so the toppings covered most, if not all, of the nacho chips. To my delight, every chip I picked up was crispy, which is usually an impossible feat when wet toppings are plopped on a mound of nachos. All of the ingredients were fresh and tasty. They were not stingy with the chorizo, which had a dry, kind of crumbly texture, and really worked as a topping. But I think what really makes the dish special are the pickled red onions. It's such a simple ingredient, but it lends more flavor to the dish than the chopped raw onions you typically find on nacho dishes. I didn't even miss the guacamole, which I usually MUST HAVE with my nachos! It took me a while to finish the whole thing. It's sold as an appetizer and meant to be shared by a few people. Given that logic, the taste, and experience, I felt the cost of the dish was justified. I'd definitely order it again when I'm in the mood for nachos, and it's given me a desire to try their other dishes.",7,2,5,Wendy F.,"Brooklyn, NY",115,88,1354

The server said there was not a lot yet when the tacos came out, there was a ton of them. My friend doesn't like onions at all. She won't even eat it or touch it. She figured if there's a little, she won't mind taking them out. But what she took out was a huge pile of them! So she asked for rice and beans to have as a side and then they put onions on top! She asked if they could take the onions off and the server rolled his eyes! I was so appalled. But my friend never said anything. We just kept eating and drinking. Then the manager, Matt came to our table and apologized for the onions. We didn't even have to say anything about it! He just came to our table and he offered to pay for the meal and on top gave her another meal to eat!He was very polite and nice and he took over our service to make sure we had a phenomenal time. I don't get this kind of service a lot in places. And visiting from California, I am completely appreciative of his work and action to help better our experience. If Matt wasn't already the manager I'd tell this place to give him a raise because he deserves it. I recommend this place 100% because the service and the food was DELICIOUS.

We were standing in line for that place when a very nice young lady pointed out that El Vez restaurant at which you could sit down, was right next-door. Since we had the time we took advantage of it and went into the El Vez restaurant and enjoyed a relaxing lunch.  I must state upfront that the place is pretty pricey for Mexican food. $16 for guacamole and chips, $16 for two chicken enchiladas and $17 for three little fish tacos...ad in a couple ice teas, tax and tip =$75 lunch. Pricey even by NYC standards. Admittedly ALL the food tasted very good...but I'm from LA where very good Mexican is widely available. Generally I don't even bother trying Mexican when I travel away from home. But El Vez Burrito had 4 Yelp stars and we were physically close when hunger kicked in...so that's how we ended up here. Service was friendly but no refills on water or ice tea...so WTF? Seems that the restaurant takes advantage of the surrounding wealthy financial advisors that can fork over those kinds of prices for lunch and are not used to good service.

Look I usually dont complain about too much liquor but if I only wanted tequila I wouldve ordered a straight tequila. I order a cocktail to taste BALANCE. All I tasted hear was tequila and ice. Alex had same issue with hers.  We split an order of chips and guac. The chips were just standars tortilla chips but at least they werent stale. The guac was awful. It tasted like refried beans. Had cojito cheese on top which makes no sense and was not made tableside. I got no lime hints, no cliantro, no jalapeno or onion and honestly not even avocado. Just mushy,flavorless scoop of 15.00 guacamole that even Chipotle wouldnt serve.  For a main I got lamb tacos except they werent tacos they were fajitas. I know I dont get it either. If you take meat and onions and wrap up tight in a flour tortilla thats a flipping fajita! The meat was kinda greasy and honestly I had indigestion all night.

And to think Centrico closed a while ago (the only good Mexican place in the hood) and I was excited when this place was opening BUT.. my disappointment started long before writing this review because I was really rooting for this place and hoping that the issues were flukes due to them being recently opened! Not the case.. after the few years they've been opened they can't seem to get it together.. the only thing that sustains they business is the over prices drinks BECAUSE everything else is a COMPLETE FAIL! First - their food is pretty basic - and by basic I mean go to chipotle instead! The service is terrible - not attentive, employees are like zombies and move slower than molasses. You can't place orders over the phone only through an app which makes sense since they are incredibly impersonal! Skip this place THEY SUCK!",0,0,0,Claudia F.,"New York, NY",9,23,7

We started with the chips and guacamole which is always a safe starter. It was very good, although the $16 price tag was perhaps a little high. As mains, we got the black bean tlayuda which was good but I would definitely suggest sharing this with 4 people as opposed to 2 as it was quite heavy. Additionally we got the brussel sprout tacos which I highly recommend! Very tasty. Also, be sure to get the Mexican corn on the cob as a side - you really can never go wrong!

2.0,5/3/2017,"I was craving Mexican food so I came here with friends after a movie. We ordered margaritas,  guacamole and tacos! The margaritas were $13 each. It was a decent size and a good amount for the price. The guacamole was bland and very small for the $16 price tag. Now the tacos..  I had the Baja tacos which were a breaded fish with a pineapple salsa and sauce on it. The fish was nice and tender but there was not enough salsa or sauce on it which made the taco very dry. The waitress brought me more salsa and sauce which helped a little. The taco dish didn't come with anything else..  just 3 tacos. They had some sides available to order so we chose Mexican corn and shared it. The corn was bland and not worth ordering. I left El Vez still feeling hungry although We had paid over $40/pp. Other people in the group felt that way too(not everyone). I won't be back here again. The food is not that good. If you like food more on the bland side then El Vez will work for you. If you're looking for a robust Mexican flavor..  you're  gonna have to go elsewhere. The decor on the other hand was amazing.. very nice atmosphere. The service was good..  the waitress tried her best to keep our water glasses full.

Showed up, party of 8 with no reservations and the lady told us that the tables right behind her would be the only tables for us to eat at because all the other tables were booked. But we didn't mind. We sat ourselves then started looking at the menu. We were sure if any of the plates came with rice or beans and honestly expected much more from the menu. My little cousin is allergic to most of the ingredients used in Mexican food/dishes so we got him a burger from the shop down the street. Our server was already making a face and didn't even seem like he wanted to help us once he saw my cousins food. Soon after, almost ready to order, the manager comes and says ""I'm sorry but we don't allow outside food at our restaurant"". Now I'm sure she could have gave us an option of sitting outside or something but no. The server was right behind her waiting to pick up our menus and there we go. Practically getting kicked out. Now I understand some places don't allow outside food but there's also a way to come about it. He's allergic so that's why we got him that but she didn't give us time to explain ourselves.

1.0,9/13/2016,"Yup, El Vez has officially become a crying shame. As I mentioned in a previous review, I really liked El Vez in Philly, but after my most recent visit, I'd recommend against anyone coming here. Even though the Amada across the street has its flaws, I'd go there first before ever coming back here. Sorry, Stephen.A group of 4 of us came to grab some bites and drinks, and the dining room was just about empty, as was the bar area. We went to the hostess, and she made us wait about 10 minutes for a table, even though again, there were plenty of tables. When we asked about the wait, she snapped at us and told us to move to the side. Unbelievable. We almost left because of it, but the other hostess realized that we were visibly angry, and tried to calm us down by seating us. When we did get seated, it was in the back area, far away from any human contact. We had to wave down the server multiple times. As he took our order, he got just about everything wrong. I ordered a Tecate, but he came with a Corona. Sent it back, then another server came out with the Tecate and tried to serve it to the one other table, who had not ordered any drinks at all. Finally, the server who took our order came out and got me the Tecate, but by the time it reached the table, it was warm. How does that even happen? I finally gave up, and just took a few sips of the beer and then just left it there. He offered to take it off the bill, but when we got the check, the Tecate was still on there. Oof.As for food, we got the nachos, and a couple orders of tacos as well. In addition, I ordered chips and salsa for the table, and they didn't come until after we had finished our meal. He gave us the chips and salsa on the house, which was appreciated, but just a rookie mistake. I don't know if he was new or inexperienced, but poor service has been a recurring theme in my visits to El Vez, so that ain't great. Also, in general, the prices here aren't good for the portion and we paid about $60 for 3 small plates, so yeah, that's another reason to avoid this place. It stinks because this place is so close to work, and the space is really nice, but I'm done overlooking the massive flaws.As you can see, I rarely ever give 1-star reviews, but this place certainly deserves it.",51,37,41,Eric J.,"New York, NY",490,923,1792

For my friend who ordered chicken quesadillas, she was completely fine with the portion size. However, I felt that I was paying too much for too little. My dish was around $17-19.

5.0,8/29/2016,Stumbled upon this place with some friends after trying to escape the thunderstorm during a hot summer day. Only had the Margaritas. WOW! They have an amazing selection of tequilas and interesting combinations of ingredients to make their Margaritas. I had the Lavender Jalapeño and the Cucumber Mint. Both were excellent!

4.0,8/24/2016,"Pretty decent food! I've also been to the location in Philadelphia, and the menus are slightly different. This location has a wide variety of tacos, enchiladas, sides, etc. Their guac is famous, but for $16 I'm not sure it's worth it. This time I tried the cauliflower tacos. The cauliflower is cooked in a tempura batter, and then some cheddar cheese is melted on top. There are capers and a hot sauce as well, though I substituted salsa for the hot sauce. It was delicious. Definitely not a healthy option, but the ingredients tasted fresh and went well together. My one complaint is that their menu is a little bit inflexible. I noticed that the tacos each come with very particular toppings, instead of all having basic items like cheese, lettuce, salsa, or avocado that could be added to any of them. You can only do ""make-your-own"" tacos if you order the serving for two people. This could be changed! Anyways, El Vez has great food and I would recommend!",2,0,0,Elizabeth D.,"New York, NY",230,75,88

The guacamole included an unripe half avocado that took up room in the 16 dollar dish. It was so firm and sour you couldn't even cut or mash up the avocado. The avocados they used also had no flavor = gross guacamole. Definitely they aren't using haas avocados. The tacos were so disgusting, I barely ate one of the three.

He knew the menu very well and was able to make some good drink and food recommendations. During our meal, we shared a pitcher of margaritas. The margaritas are very well made and delicious, and a good value for the number of drinks that you get from a pitcher. We started our meal with chips and salsa. We were a little disappointed that the chips didn't seem to be house made and there was only one variety of salsa offered, which was a little bland and lacking in heat. Our entrees were absolutely fabulous. I had the shrimp tacos which were very spicy and delicious, some of the I've ever had. My mom had the steak tacos which were also outstanding.

I will say, my reason for enjoying this place is mostly due to the company I had eating here. ( I think you always tend to enjoy places more based on the company you keep)Our first order was two pitchers of margaritas. You can never go wrong with margaritas on the rocks, but while I enjoyed them, I will say our server poured them weirdly... every glass had an unequal amount. For instance one had a splash of margarita while another was almost full. Strange but not too bad.Next we had a round of appetizers. The Baja shrimp and crab appetizer was delicious as well as the classic guacamole. Honestly, the apertivos were the best part of the menu and hit the spot.As we enjoyed our appetizers, our server took our dinner order. He suggested the soft shell crab tacos and one of my colleagues had the fore sight to order a corn on the cob that was sprinkled with spices and cotija cheese.This was a really amazing taco and even better with the corn. As a fan of soft shell crab I was really pleased with the flavor profile of the batter mixed with the slaw and lime in a soft shell taco.So after reading this, if you're wondering if I'd come here again...

4.0,6/12/2016,"We found this place on Yelp while looking for a restaurant between the 9/11 Memorial and our subway stop. It's good -- some dishes were even very good -- but, sadly, not as fabulous as the Park Guell-inspired decor might have you believe.It's clear the owners have put a lot of time and effort into the restaurant's design, and between the mosaic-tile booths, chunky farmhouse-style tables, and liquor-bottle art on the walls, it has a ton of ambience. They've also put some serious thought into a menu that pays homage to some typical Mexican recipes with more modern twists.We came as a party of 4 and shared several plates. The queso fundido was interesting -- very earthy from the mushrooms, with a slight sweetness to the cheese. It might have been even more enjoyable with a crunchy chip rather than soft flour tortillas, but that's a small quibble. The quesadillas with zucchini blossoms, corn, queso, and guacamole were very good, though I'd have loved a bit more heat. We also tried cauliflower tacos -- the coolest dish of the bunch -- and mahi mahi tacos, which were beautifully seasoned and perfectly crisp. The biggest disappointment for me was the snapper ceviche. The portion was so tiny it was practically a kiddie appetizer, and it was seriously lacking in flavor. I'd recommend skipping this dish and loading up on some of the others.Service was quick, and our server spoke Spanish, which was terrific for the two non-English-speakers at our table. All dishes were timed perfectly, so there was no waiting around for one person's food to arrive before everyone else could eat. Prices were typically high for this area, but overall, it was an enjoyable experience, and with just a bit more heat and flavor to a couple of the dishes, it could have been outstanding.",1,0,0,Robin C.,"Albany, NY",13,55,12

We had a room reserved in the back of the restaurant for about 30-40 people. The room only had one table set for 6. The rest of our party had to stand. This wasn't the end of the world, as everyone was mingling anyhow, but I did expect a little more seating for that amount of people. That aside, we had unlimited blood orange frozen margaritas, classic margaritas on the rocks and sangria. The blood orange margarita was AMAZING. Definitely a must have if you are coming here. I wasn't too crazy about the sangria, but the margarita was my choice of poison for the entire night. The food was delicious. We had the nachos (seriously amazing) as well as tacos and quesadillas.

It comes serve to you in a large pizza tray with toppings on each and every chip. If you love spicy food you can also request to make the nachos spicier and they will give you extra jalapeños. We also got the black bean tlayuda which I also highly recommend. It was essentially a flatbread tostada and tasted amazing. We also got the enchiladas which were mediocre. I probably would not order that again due to the bland taste. The drinks here are a bit expensive but they have a large selection of really good margaritas.I usually go here during happy hour because the vibe is really fun. This seems to be the to go spot for people who work in that area. It seems to get super packed around 4 to 5 PM. The restaurant is also located in a really nice area right by the water.

We always order the same things and never get old!It is a bit quiet usually but I think that is due to the location..

2.0,4/2/2016,"it depends on the day (2/15/16)First up come HUNGRY!!!The nachos were amazing and huge! Full of flavor in each bite. It can feed 3 people...seriously... and you may not want to eat it all because you will have to get to the main dishes. (which are also awesome)I had the tuna tacos - DEEELISH. I am a big fan. They do not look that huge, but they will fill you up. I also had the corn as a side?!??!? You will love life... I loved My server, the food... everything was on point.  The server was patient, informative and attentive. 5 out of 5...  ********************************************I came back a month later - VERY exited for nachos and tacos.  The server came by to get drinks orders, food orders then to give us the check. We had to stop him during the meal to ask for more drinks and sauce (which he said did not come with tacos - lies - he forgot but said my sister in law was wrong and had her decide which of the optional sauces she wanted). Other than that - dude was GHOST. During the night - a kid set fire to a napkin at the table next to us. That has nothing to do with the meal, HOWEVERUUUHH, when the minority child slowly burned his wet napkin on the candle while his father watched, it stank the place up... Other tables were visibly annoyed. Our server never knew because he never stopped by ever, then the manager walked by the table, stopped, STARED AT THE KID and walked away. The stench was taking over the entire restaurant so I - the other minority - (the manager, my BF and fam are white) turned to the entire table and asked them to stop slowly burning paper... They acted shocked, concerned then stopped the burning...  Later, I asked the red-bearded wearin, hipster livin, curly mustache having manager about it and he said that he did not know where the smell came from. He was SOOO wondering where that smell came from. Crazy! It was a kid, so you would think a parent would stop the burning, right!?!?!? (if you did not know where it was coming from, how did you know it was a kid, ya douche?)IF THE REST OF MY FREGGIN TABLE DID NOT SEE THE MANAGER STARE AT THE KID, THEN HIDE HIS BALLS IN HIS BODY BEFORE WALKING AWAY, I would have believed him. But no - he stared, considered about approaching a Hispanic table then walked away A manager who would rather walk away vs care for the entire restaurant?bullshit No - I will no go back because of that ONE person. It takes a LOT for me not to return to a place (I am actually going to redo a dislike post after this because I went back and the pizza WAS DEELISH). But I will not go back because a manager cannot step forward to ensure the comfort and freggin SAFETY OF A PACKED RESTAURANT  AT 7 PM ON A SATURDAYUH!I am rarely this annoyed in life. But that was some shit because the place was full and there were OTHER children there. If the place set on fire and people got crushed and hurt, he would be to blame. More than 3 people saw him look at the fuggin kid. He stopped all of 3 feet away from the flame and tilted his head to get a better look.   UN...REAL that I -  a patron  - had to ask someone to put out a FIRE AT A TABLE. boooouuuhhh (first and last time I cuss on a yelp review... I think because kids were there, it bothered me more than usual)Crappy/greedy service and poor management NO",3,1,0,Dawn C.,"Jersey City, NJ",53,135,67

3.0,3/20/2016,"This is an okay place to grab dinner in Battery Park if you happen to find yourself in the area, but in terms of the flavors of the food and the quality of the service, nothing too memorable comes to mind. The biggest plus side is that the restaurant, including both its bar area and the main dining area, is very spacious. On a Sunday night, the restaurant was less than half full. This would be the perfect spot for a big group happy hour or dinner. The next big plus is that the menu is very vegetarian-friendly.My friend and I shared the nachos appetizer. The dish was spread out like a 12-inch pizza, a portion that was unbelievably generous for an appetizer. To be honest, I was very full after nibbling through my half of this dish and likely would have felt better without eating anything else after. Alas, I had already ordered a mahi mahi taco for my main. Ironically, the main dish looked more like an appetizer than the appetizer itself. The mahi mahi was pretty lightly flavored, so I found the other ingredients in the taco to overpower what little flavor it had. Perhaps, the meat options would be a better choice.",2,0,0,Cindy G.,"New York, NY",916,401,423

4.0,2/6/2016,"Props to El Vez -- you were way tastier than I'd anticipated. Came for the first time for Restaurant Week and really enjoyed myself.El Vez is the epitome of dressed-up Mexican; the space is huge, well-decorated, and hoppin with the post-work Wall Street crowd. And their Restaurant a Week menu is a serious bang for your buck. Most establishments serve 3 courses for Restaurant Week, but El Vez serves 4 (appetizer, appetizer/entree, entree, dessert). My friend and I ordered the guacamole, tuna tostaditos, tortilla soup, queso fundido, 2 orders of shrimp tacos, flan, and tres leches. The tuna tostaditos were delicious but the guacamole was a bit too smooth for our liking. I'm more of a chunky guac person. But it was still flavorful and there was no shortage of tortillas. It also came with tomatillo which is always delicious. I didn't try the tortilla soup but I heard it was great. My queso fundido was also really yummy but a bit too greasy. There was literal grease running down my mouth and hands; sexy, I know.The shrimp tacos were pretty good, but not show-stopping. They are served in a soft corn tortilla shell and I think swapping that for a hard shell would've added some needed texture and punch. To be fair, I may have to come back and try these on an emptier tummy -- we were pretty full by this point so it was hard to stomach anything! Dessert was stupid delicious. The  tres leches was clearly the winner. Perfectly soaked, sweet, and milky, I could eat that cake every day.Top everything off with some margaritas (order the blood orange!) and I was a happy lady. The service was also wonderful. Our waiter was very attentive and the manager even came over to check if tables were enjoying themselves.Overall, El Vez is a great place for sexy Mexican food and I'll certainly be back!",2,2,1,Shannon G.,"Brooklyn, NY",213,311,69

And, oh yeah, its on the WEST SIDE. Guac -- The shaved cheese on top and cucumber give it a unique, strong flavor, although not a huge serving for the price. Nachos -- Looked like a pizza when brought to the table. Flat but spread out over a large area. Not bad, but then again, nachos never really are.Enchiladas -- Pretty mediocre. Two not so large enchiladas but covered with plenty of sauce. The sauce was great, but this was not particularly filling without other apps. It also spelled the detriment of the corn tortillas, which tasted over-drenched and soggy. Accompanying beans and rice were very basic. Probably more food though than the tacos though. The individual taco dinners here are pretty tiny -- you get 3, but its not going to fill most people up. The Tacos for Two looked like far more food and had a frankly more cool presentation. If I returned, I would buddy up and get this.

There was plenty of melted cheese, beans and chorizo on top of the nachos. The nachos had a good crisp to it, only the very middle was slightly soggy. As for the oxtail enchilada, it was okay. I've officially determined that I am not a fan of enchiladas. They, for the most part, are over-sauced with very soggy corn tortillas, which was what this enchilada was. The oxtail however was very plentiful and moist but overall it was too much mole. It also came with rice and beans which I was not a fan of which isn't a good sign because I love rice and beans. The rice was too mushy.Overall, the food was fine with adequate quality. It was just more of a casual dinner with average food.

I had to hunt down the wait staff to get lemon for my water, and the wait staff generally was overworked (more wait staff was needed) and therefore underattentive. For these prices (the restaurant is not cheap!) I expected better food and better service. I ordered the mole trio ($23), and found it was actually not super flavorful. I could not force myself to finish this. Our table also ordered the pomegranate guacamole, which was fine, but honestly, I make better guacamole at home. I don't usually like paying $15 for merely acceptable guacamole. The drinks were similarly absurdly priced ($13 for a frozen margarita). Friends of mine ordered enchiladas, but the size of the entrees were simply unimpressive.In summary, the food was not terrible, but small portions given the price; the quality of the food was simply fine, but unexceptional.Anyway, for better food, I highly recommend Rosa Mexicano nearby.

5.0,12/6/2015,"How does El Vez not have higher ratings? We stumbled upon El Vez on a Sunday night when we were in FiDi. We've been to the El Vez in Philly and we are very familiar with Starr Restaurants. This location is humongous (next office party, anyone?). It can easily seat over 150 people. The decor is super cool, reminiscent of a combination of lucha libre and Day of the Dead. The service is awesome- super efficient and warm. We ordered a bowl of pomegranate guacamole to start, and I had the crispy mahi mahi tacos while the boyfriend ordered steak tacos. First off, the pomegranate guacamole was mind-blowing. The sweetness of the pomegranate added the perfect amount of tang to guacamole, while the toasted almonds added a bit of crunch and savoriness. The requeson cheese added a whole new level of creaminess. I highly highly recommend this seasonal guac. My mahi mahi tacos were a complete delight as well. Flour tortillas (I'll take these over corn tortillas any day), perfectly crisp mahi mahi, savory cabbage slaw, creamy guac, and a light drizzle of lime. Paradise in my mouth. Bonus points that the tacos were not messy to eat. Instead of an open face triplet of tacos that you wrap yourself, these tacos came in a pair and were pre-wrapped a la soft shell taquito. So simple to eat. Love it. The boyfriend's steak tacos, which were presented in the aforementioned open face triplet style, were quite yummy but still paled in comparison to the mahi mahi tacos. Seriously, just go and order the mahi mahi tacos and the pomegranate guac and your mouth will thank you. The only downside is that the portions aren't super generous and we definitely weren't full from the 3 items we ordered.  There's a decently sized bar, so it's great for a girls' night out, a date night, or a birthday party.  If I didn't live so far from FiDi, I would be a frequent El Vez customer.

We order chips and salsa for the table, my wife and best friend both ordered the mahi mahi tacos while I ordered the beef burrito and Mexican corn. The chips and salsa were good but nothing special. The beef burrito was lacking beef and was overpowered by the taste of cinnamon. Both my best friend and wife complained about their tacos being dry. My best friend says hers was just barely edible while my wife's was completely inedible. My wife sent hers back and was offered a free shot comps of the manager but they didn't take her tacos off the tab.

If you come here during peak hours Thursday-Saturday, expect a decently long wait. While you're waiting, grab a drink at the bar, which is typically filled to the brim with 20-something finance guys. I had a margarita, which was nothing to run home about. This restaurant isn't bad by any means, but the food I've had aside from the nachos was just sub-par. Particularly, the fish tacos and chicken enchiladas were skimpy portions and lacked flavor. They do however offer cauliflower tacos, which was a good vegetarian option.

It seemed to be a decent portion of lobster for the price and was flavorful. It came with many sides which was filling (since lobster is not).  Steak dish here is dissapointing.  My friend ordered it and it was a flat iron steak- i think this restaurant should offer a skirt steak.  That has a lot more flavor potential.  My other friend ordered was was advertised as the ""whole fish"".. which was nothing but a skimpy filet.  Everything was tasty but again, not worth it.My reason for 2 stars? We ordered sangria, white, and it was 12 dollars for half a wine glass full of ice and liquid.  3 generous sips? gone.  It did not even taste good.. Total waste of money.  We also ordered guacamole which seemed to be nothing more than smashed avocados and cilantro.  Guac needs tomatos, onions, garlic, salt, pepper, jalapano ETC ETC.  Lame. And not worth the price. Bill came out to 200 dollars and it was kind of scary how unsatisfied we all were.  (we were full, just not thrilled about it)  I definitely do recommend the mama nachho with the chorizo, but that's it.  Not even sure if I'd bother trying a margharita after the dissapointing sangria.",0,0,0,Gabrielle A.,"New York, NY",1,41,1
4.0,10/9/2015,"After living in San Diego for four years, I am very positive that El Vez is not aiming to serve authentic Mexican cuisine. However, I really enjoyed their take on the food, which is all around good despite being a bit pricey.I have come here with my mom on two occaisions. The first was late on a Friday night, we had to wait around 30 min for a table, but we were able to sit at the bar and drink while we waited so it was all good. The second time it was us and my mom's boyfriend - we arrived around 8:30 on a Thursday night and were seated right away. Both times we entered it was crowded, but by the time we finished our meal on Thursday it was relatively emptyI really like the margaritas at this restaurant. They are very well made, just strong enough and have some great flavors to them. As always the blood orange is great, but the cucumber mint is also a good option if you are looking for something refreshing and not as sweet.The food is good, although the portions are relatively small on some dishes. From my experience, if you order an entree dish, the portion size is completely fine. However, if you are ordering an appetizer as your entree, expect the dish to be a lot smaller than you would expect. Both times I came, I ordered an appetizer as an entree - the tuna tostadas and the zuchini blossom and corn quesadilla. The tuna tostadas were far better(the quesadilla was a lot of cheese and a bit greasy), but also a much smaller dish. For me, this was fine since I was also eating chips and guac, but it is a little disappointing since the apps are the same or a slightly lower price than the entrees. We have ordered guacamole both times we came, its good but it has cucumber in it, so it tastes a little different than you would expect. Both times my mom ordered the cauliflower tacos because she liked them so much - they are not truly Mexican by any means but are a great vegetarian alternative and taste great. My mom's boyfriend ordered tortilla soup and chicken enchiladas. He really liked that the tortilla soup had avocado in the actual soup(not just as a topping), and he ate the all his enchiladas and was full, which was a good sign since that was what he was most worried about. Overall, this place is pricey, but it has a good ambience, good drinks, and tasty food if you know the right things to order.

The decor was unique and it was quite spacey inside, we did had to wait for a table at the bar even though we could see empty tables inside--perhaps they didn't have enough wait staff inside, our waiter was absent most of our night. The food was pretty good, from hamachi ceviche, guacamole, frozen blood orange margarita, to entrees of whole fish with side of cheese corn, watermelon and pickled cucumber salad and churros chocolate dessert. The lobster entree was slightly over cooked, but still pretty tasty. The mahimahi (battered and fried) taco however, was probably the wrist of the night, too much sauce and the mahimahi taste was lost in thick batter.

1.0,10/3/2015,"Below is my detailed reason why I give El Vez 1 star. Further down is my review of the food. One time when I came here for brunch, I noticed that there is a large depiction of a person hanging from a noose painted on the wall of the women's restaurant. Though the figure is shadowy, I was disturbed and complained to management. The manager told me that he didn't even know about it (understandable since it is in the women's restroom), and told me that something would be done about it immediately. This was over 4 months ago. I went there 2 days ago and it is still there! I complained to management again and was told that nothing can be done about it because that decision is up to corporate. Excuses were then made by management comparing the noose painting in the women's restroom to a risqué painting of a Hispanic woman in the men's restroom. Though I do find the painting in the men's restroom tasteless, that does not compare to a large painting of a person hanging from a noose. My point is, though I enjoyed my times at this restaurant, I will not be returning to an establishment that supports noose hanging paintings and thinks that such paintings are appropriate to have in their restaurant. Shame on El Vez!Review of food: I have been to El Vez a few times now, and I have enjoyed the food, drinks, and energy of this place.

We knew they were different but we would go with the one that was better than the other. With a toss of the dice, we gambled on the Queso Fundido...and we lost.The Fundido with chorizo was greasy, and the longer it sat, the greasier it got. It sat because it was way too salty..we just couldn't eat it. After the appetizer, we ordered the Tacos Al Pastor and Oxtail Enchiladas...both were ugh. The Tacos were filled with pork belly (which I would have avoided at all costs)... basically inedible. When I pointed this out to the server, she said that it would have pork belly even though it not listed as such on the menu (she even pulled out the menu and there's nothing on that item saying pork belly...the Carnitas Tacos have pork belly which is the reason why I didn't order it!). Would have appreciated some sympathy and humor (after all, she's not responsible for kitchen messes). Instead I got huffy-pouty attitude.  Didn't need this as a customer (and I know attitude...I live in Philly but am a southern born chick who also waited tables in my college years).

Our waiter asked us three times within 3 minutes if we were ready to order, when the tables around us were empty. Whenever we told him we needed a bit more time to skim the menu, he turned swiftly away without saying a word.We ordered the Frozen Blood Orange Margarita. HUZZAH, this was so good. Texture-wise, it was perfect. Smooth, cold and refreshing without any ice chunks. It was tart and came in a great heavy cup (pet peeve, when bars place good drinks in cheap glasses). Highly recommend this drink. The tequila was present, but the blood orange flavoring offset it and made it so fruity to drink. I'm not often impressed by drinks, but this has been my favorite drink in my past recollection. My friend ordered the Sparking White Sangria, which was average.Tried the Crab Tostadas and they were SMALLLL. Our waiter told us that they were appetizers, but that was even overstating it. They were three little rinky-dinky amuse bouches if I could've said so myself. The tostadas were about 2 inches in diameter. While they were good (lumps of crab meat on top of a fried taco shell), they were also $14. For $14, I could've got some bangin' authentic Mexican food for two. Friend got the shrimp tacos, and while more worth it than the tostadas, they were still petite. The shrimp was plump and the avocado fresh, but it wasn't anything mindblowing.After feeling unsatisfied, we ordered the Nacho Mama, and this dish came out in a pizza pan! I love how spread out the nachos were, as distribution of ingredients is another important thing to me, so I didn't have to carefully portion and push toppings off overloaded nachos (Why I hate getting burritos at most incompetent places - I'm not eating a burrito; I'm eating a savory Mexican parfait. I should not be eating through a thick layer of sour cream to be followed by a mountain of beans.) These were huge, and worth it! I wished for some meat halfway through, so maybe try the chorizo version? The jalapenos added a good kick to the nachos. Also, the nachos themselves are fried crispily and stay that way (at least for our time!) +++ for no sogginess! Definitely favorite food item of the meal.Because we were in a rush, we had to flag down several waitstaff before successfully getting our bill.

Got the Crispy Mahi Mahi Tacos. The description sounded great: red cabbage, avocado, chipotle pepper remoulade.

To be fair, the flavors were great. However...that was it. These skinny burrito-like things that would not be a filling meal for anyone. Definitely not $16 worth!

When we walked in, I fell in love with the vibe and decor and wanted to love this place SO bad! Really fun fixtures, decorations, a beautiful bar. Definitely has some old school meets new school Mexican vibes in here, I really did feel that this place did a great job decorating and transporting the customer to another country. I was completely in awe of the OUTSTANDING interior design job done here. Our waitress was incredibly nice and answered all of my stupid, uncultured questions which makes her a winner in my book. We started with the chips and guac which also comes with a tiny cup of salsa, pretty standard, not bad at all. Choosing an entree was a huge source of anxiety and double checking for me, I finally settled on the corn, cheese, and zucchini flower quesadilla with a side of plantains. Ugh, disappointment. First of all, what appeared to be two abnormally large tacos appeared on a plate. Looked nothing like a quesadilla which is normally cut up into slices. I really tried to like this dish, but it wasn't good. After finishing one of the taco-quesadillas, I didn't even attempt the other. WHYYYYYY did you have to make the quesadillas on a corn tortilla! In addition, the yucky corn tortilla was saturated in oil, such a bad mix that I felt nauseous halfway through the first quesadilla. Really upsetting for me AND for my stomach. One of my friends also ordered a quesadilla and said that the heavy oil and corn tortilla was throwing her off and made her feel sick as well.

4.0,8/15/2015,"My friend and I went to el vez on Wednesday for restaurant week. The location is really nice, a pretty view of the freedom tower and very close to the water. The restaurant week menu was worth every penny! Typically for restaurant week one receives an appetizer, entree and dessert for $38 however at el vez we received two appetizers, an entree and a dessert for $38! Who can beat that?! The food was definitely worth the money and the portions were perfect! For our first appetizer I ordered the kale salad and my friend ordered the guacamole. We split each of our orders with each other since they were so big! I wish I ordered the guacamole too! For our second appetizer I had the tortilla soup which I loved! It was very different. It had a little kick to it but it wasn't too spicy. The cilantro, cheese and tortilla chips were a great mix! Yum yum! I also had the queso fundido - pure deliciousness! I'm a mushroom and cheese lover so the both of them together were amazing! For the main course I ordered chicken - similar to chicken fajitas but I could barely finish it with all the food I had! I saved it for lunch the next day. My friend ordered shrimp tacos and she also doggie bagged it. Lastly for dessert I ordered the flan and she ordered the chocolate bread pudding. I liked the bread pudding better than my flan. The bread pudding was huge and had a scoop of ice cream on top!Overall my experience here was great! I'd give this place a perfect 5 if I didn't have to keep reminding the waiter for more water but otherwise the service was good.

2.0,8/15/2015,"I took my team from the office here on Wednesday after our other plans fell through at the last minute. There were 10 of us and we wanted to have appetizers and drinks around 6pm. While the bar was packed, the dining room was empty. I asked for a table and they told us they wouldn't seat us unless we order entrees, not appetizers. It was ridiculous because the entrees are the same price as the appetizers! I tried to talk to the manager because there was no where for us to stand in the bar. He lied and told us they tables were all reserved, after I already knew from the hostess that it wasn't the case. We were only going to stay until 7:30 and they could have easily accommodated us. We ended up staying only because there was no where else near by.  Stuck near the kitchen entrance and bathroom area which was very uncomfortable because we kept getting bumped by trays. The drink service was bad, they kept forgetting to make our drinks. I was really disappointed and won't be back to this place again.

Your initial reaction - food must be good.And so it is...We started with the ""Classic Guacamole"" with onion, jalapeño & cheese. I'm not big on guacamole but I was impressed with the offering. Along with the thin tortilla chips - a nice fresh start. Main selections included Crab Enchiladas with various ingredients this dish had a nice spicy kick to it. A nice tasteful side bowl of beans and rice accompanied this selection.   Also freshly enjoyed - Tuna Tostadas.Now the issues - While very good we found the portions on all selections to be expensively small. The guacamole came with a ridiculously tiny salsa cup offering - why bother? The Tuna Tostadas consisted of three (3) small almost bite size Tostadas - of note the waitress did warn us about this particular selection. The Crab Enchiladas - miniature.The dining area fills up quickly and the tables for two are beside each other so privacy is compromised. The food comes quickly and service - while pleasant - attempts to move you along to make room for others. Therefore comfort is compromised as well.

Please note the plates are of small portion; but if you order your main plate with guacamole to start and a healthy first drink, you can be sated.  Upon my most recent visit on a summer Sunday afternoon, I was greeted by friendly hostesses, a not-too busy environment, and a welcoming openness in the dining area.  I love Micheladas, and El Vez didn't disappoint! he michelada was perfect.  However, I must say the guacamole was not on point as it was in May.  Perhaps they rushed.  What they surely demonstrated was complete mastery of the Grilled Fish Taco.  Blackened swordfish with chipotle mayo slaw on a very tasty corn tortilla.  I savored every bite.  The service was impeccable.  As a part time hospitality employee I take note of this immediately.  They are friendly, efficient, and a well-oiled machine.  Outdoor seating available, super close to the lovely esplanade walk in Battery Park, and indoor ambience was roomy and festive but certainly not gaudy.  Go here!",0,0,0,Heather D.,"Brooklyn, NY",436,14,0

I loved the ambiance of the place.  The decor was well coordinated and unique without being distracting.  There was a nice patio to sit on, but we sat inside with the threat of rain. My only complaint is the wait time for the food.  In a nearly empty restaurant, it was almost an hour to receive the guacamole and another hour to receive our mains, some of which came out cold.  The servers were friendly and accommodating, however, the kitchen should not have taken two hours to feed us when we were hungry and had places to be.",2,0,0,Olivia P.,"Richmond, VA",87,191,122

If it really is, he needs to come in and make some changes ASAP.Here's an example. You can reasonably expect a Margarita in a restaurant to be more than tequila and some mix. It should have an orange liqueur blended in (Cointreau or at least Triple Sec). But they don't do that at El Vez. Incredibly they claim not to even stock these spirits. So much for high quality.And it's never actually clear who is serving you or who's in charge.

5.0,6/22/2015,"Fell into here by pure fluke, since Blue Smoke next door had a 45 minute wait for a two-person table.In a lot of Mexican restaurants, I always make the mistake of ordering appetizers and then a main. The appetizers are always awesome, and then the main tends to be a let down, so I always tell myself, ""Next time we do Mexican, just get more apps for mains.""I once again failed to do that, however thankfully this was one of the few occasions where the mains were on par with the apps.The nachos here are superb, and cleverly laid out. Instead of a big pile of chips with the toppings just centralized over the middle (leaving a big chunk of chips completely bare and largely flavorless underneath), these nachos come out on what is basically a pizza tray. Every single chip was coated in some of the toppings. We got the basic Nacho mama and it was divine. I could have eaten it thrice. In fact, next time I am in the area and I don't just wanna grab something handy from Black Seed or Quinn's in Brookfield place across the street, this is the place I'll be coming. Sorry Blue Smoke.I got the skirt steak for a main, the Mrs got the enchiladas. Both were superb, and I am saying this as someone who wasn't particularly hungry at the time.Didn't do dessert this time, but will do next time.By the way, given that they have multiple portraits of Elvis Presley on the walls in this place, I assume ""El Vez"" is a punny play on his name?",1,0,0,Rob C.,"Franklin Square, NY",16,148,8

For an appetizer we ordered the queso fundido con carne, which was nothing more than a pressed tortilla with cheese on it for $12, bad call in ordering that. The nachos and salsa that they came out with were pretty good so we should've just stuck with that until our entree's came out. The waitress was nice, however it just seemed a little busy. They kept pouring water in our glasses, however the water that they give you doesn't come with ice. We were sitting outside and it was a sunny 85 degree day, we had asked 3-4 times for ice and we just weren't given any (another excuse for us to keep drinking the cold margaritas i guess). For our entree, I split the taco combination with my friend and we ended up picking the steak and shrimp tacos, that ran about $39 split between two people.

3.0,6/3/2015,"IN SHORT: A young branch of Stephen Starr's flagship Philadelphia cantina serves adulterated versions of south-of-the-border classics for the sake of glamorizing the menu.THE STORY: There is a lot going on at El Vez. From the accordions and guitars mounted on the walls, to the menu that doesn't seem to discriminate against any ingredient, the restaurant feels rich and unrestrained, a themed party that is simultaneously upscale and raucous.Yet at 9 PM on a Saturday night, when I enjoyed my first visit to El Vez, I was taken aback by the hospitality of the front of house and the servers, who seem to mellow out what could easily be a friskier restaurant. Located in the northwest corner of Battery Park City, just steps away from the Goldman Alley, El Vez seems to have cautiously adapted to its neighbors, ever so slightly tempering its spirit to make a dinner enjoyable as just a dinner, and not as a pregame.Sure, some of the food reads as a disaster in the making, a potent combination of hot, name brand ingredients thrown together by the likes of a 5-year old with access to a luxurious pantry. I was convinced by my date to not order guacamole, and from the stories of the hellish landscape that is avocado served with goat cheese, chili flakes, pistachios, mango, red pepper, and jicama, I'm glad I didn't. Instead we enjoyed the Queso Fundido con Hongos, with truffled wild mushrooms (see what they did there?), huitlacoche, and squash blossoms served alongside soft flour tortillas.This and the Nacho Mama with melted jack cheese, black beans, salsa ranchera, sour cream, pickled red onions, jalapeno, and chorizo if you make it a ""Macho,"" seem to grace every other table to start. Rightly, the guacamole is nowhere to be found.Among its main dishes, the Enchiladas are some of El Vez's best options. The Pollo Rotisado is particularly good, with roasted chicken that seems to melt inside its tortilla blanket covered with a thick mojo de ajo sauce that tastes of chipotle peppers, lime, and garlic. Tacos are average fare, although the many options make the menu more intriguing. Like most of the tacos offered, the Grilled Fish Tacos come in three soft flour tortillas topped with a strangely shaped piece of rectangular white fish, cabbage slaw, and guacamole. If the Crispy Mahi Mahi Tacos sound better to anyone for the same price, be warned that you'll only enjoy 2, topped with red cabbage, avocado, and a chipotle pepper remoulade. Both will satisfy the craving every Californian has for daily fish tacos, but with a limp, watery slaw and a few too many ingredients, they will not break any records.The size of the margaritas might, though, served in the large glasses that you'd want come 6 PM on a Friday night. The tequila and cocktail lists are also appropriately long, consistent with El Vez's attempt to add to serious Mexican cuisine in New York, and yet ending up squarely in the middle of what we expect from it.Ultimately in the scheme of things, El Vez is likely the best stop for Mexican in the neighborhood. Though that's like saying that On the Border is the best spot for Mexican in East Brunswick - it's not saying a lot.",0,0,1,Ali M.,"New York, NY",31,234,245

3.0,5/6/2015,"So, my mom is from Mexico and lived there as well, and grew up in Texas and lived in California as well, so I think I have a pretty good handle on Mexican, Tex-Mex and Cal-Mex. With that being said, I think this place is just ok for the food.  I think the margaritas (including the blood orange one) are pretty good, but they're just a little to sweet & tart for me, but still pretty good.  The ambiance though is excellent and location near the water is nice with the outdoor seating.  And, they had an all-woman Mariachi band which was pretty unique and cool...you don't see that very often.But as far as the food goes, anytime I see nachos ""loaded"" with stuff (ie, beans, sour cream, guacamole, etc.), burritos, flour tortillas, and salmon on the menu, the place is automatically not going to get a high rating in my book.  Those items are definitely not authentic Mexican...most Mexicans have never even tasted Salmon...they eat Huachinango (Red Snapper) or Atun or Bonito or Dorado.  And Tex-Mex Nachos (cause Nachos are not Mexican) are not drowning in 'stuff', they're simple - meaning the chip (handmade, not out of a bag), cheese and a jalapeno slice all baked together, then maybe a small dollop of guacamole (called Cincos) or with a beef cube on top (called Pericos) each chip.  And burritos & flour are both American inventions.  Anyway, my point is that this place isn't authentic, thus my 3-star rating.  However, I will say that the Carnitas (pork) tacos on a corn tortilla were very good and highly recommend those.Overall, I think this is a great place to grab some beers or margaritas, maybe have a few small appetizers (carnitas tacos) and listen to the Mariachi's; but I'd pass on having a full lunch or dinner here as there are more authentic places to go to...ie, Ofrenda, La Esquina, Barrio Chino, etc.",2,0,0,Elton W.,"New York, NY",1010,377,1497

The service here was truly bad and I would never go back.  We came in looking to have a couple cocktails--first we tried to sit by a table by the window, and they told us not to sit there b/c there was a high-traffic door right next to the table--why would they place a large, unusable table in a high-traffic area, you ask? I don't know. The rest of the high-tops were full so we sat at the bar. The bartenders had apparently decided to only serve one half of the bar and we were at the wrong end of it, so we and the couple next to us sat there for about 10-15 minutes before we could finally get the bartenders' attention (they actually walked by us several times and seemed to be actively avoiding eye contact each time).  When one of them finally took our order, my boyfriend ordered the frozen blood orange margarita, and the bartender said, ""Well, we don't have any left so someone would have to make it"" (what does this even mean?) So my boyfriend quite naturally asked ""Well...how long would that take?"" And the response was an EXASPERATED ""Umm...I really have no idea...10 or 15 minutes?""...after this painful back-and-forth (which was was like pulling teeth) he offered to make a non-frozen blood orange margarita (why he didn't offer this right off the bat is a mystery).  The whole interaction was just unpleasant and I really felt like we were somehow ruining his day by trying to actually order something. When we finally got our drinks, the blood orange margarita was good, but the hibiscus margarita was really meh (wayyyy too much lime).  To top it all off, the place was huge and had no character.  Honestly, just go get a margarita at Chipotle if you're in the neighborhood.",0,0,0,Christine K.,"Manhattan, NY",10,15,0

5.0,4/14/2015,The food here was the best Mexican I've had in NYC in awhile.  Where do I even begin.Well you might as well start off with the Blood Orange margarita - just get a pitcher while you're at it. You'll know you'll want more. The guacamole was on point and we were basically fighting each other to get the last bite. If there are many of you keep on the chip train and get some Nacho Mama - these nachos I promise will be the best nachos you have ever eaten in your life. 1000% better than the nachos you used to nuke in the microwave for 30 seconds when you were a teenager. Moving on - tuna tostados. You have to get these. Even if you hate tuna - this will change your mind. These bite size treats tasted amazing. The flavors blended so well with one another we almost ordered another round if it wasn't for the 6 tacos dishes and Carbon for 2 we ordered. I also highly recommend the carbon for 2. We did the skirt steak and are very happy we did. It was delicious and the presentation was beautiful. The corn on the cob was also delicious and savory.  And then try to make room for the churros (because who doesn't love a good churro) and the chocolate bread pudding. 100% will be going back.

I know, I know, goat cheese.. and.. pistachios?! How the heck would those taste good in guac?! Trust me though, that combo is GOLD, as evidenced by the lack of guacamole left in the bowl every time I get it.I also always get the Chicken or Black Bean Enchilada--while it isn't the best enchilada I've ever had in my entire life, I have zero complaints. Pro tip: accompany whatever entrée you're getting with the Grilled Corn on the Cob because that, on the other hand, IS one of the bet dang corn on the cobs I've ever had in my entire life.

5.0,1/25/2015,"As good as you can get when it comes to Mexican in the city.  A bit more corporate feel as it is large and sprawling and attached to the Goldman Sachs building in BPC, but this place is pretty authentic when it comes to taste.  Been a few times now and every time has been solid.Tito Santana Guacamole - mango guac...I love guac, but I don't like sweet in my guac.  We got this at the recommendation of a friend and it was great.  The mango isn't overpowering and the guac even has a hint of heat.  Highly recommend.I have been searching to a good grilled fish taco which is harder to find than you'd think.  Most places fry their fish which adds an extra heaviness to them which isn't to my liking.  El Vez, however, grills them and they are everything you'd want and more.  Top pick.  You also can't go wrong with the Tacos AL Carbon for 2 aka build-your-own soft tacos.  The meat comes in an oversized (and really heavy!) lava bowl.  Great presentation and even better taste.Definitely go for a blood orange marg.  I, myself, do not like tequila but again I was feeling adventurous and tried it at the recommendation of the same mango guac friend (good thing I went with him now that I think about it) and it was fantastic.  Did i look a little funny drinking a blended pinky-orange margarita?

2.0,1/25/2015,We came here for lunch hostess with long curly hair had a real attitude problem. She seemed really angry and annoyed to be working there not a good first impression. The meal itself was nothing special I got chicken tacos for like $16. There was really nobody in there I guess because it was Monday or Tuesday. However the manager was very polite and came over to refill the water and ask how everything was. The rest of the wait staff are a little off I didn't understand why maybe they are new. Probably will not return and don't really recommend this place unless your in this particular area. This city has too many Mexican spots for mediocre food and over priced options.

We started with the queso fundido con carne. It was delicious. I had the oxtail enchiladas.  The oxtail was nicely seasoned and the red sauce was delicious. I was pleasantly surprised by the black beans and rice that came with my food; it was served with pickled onions on top. The flavors complemented each other nicely. My friend ordered the corn on the cob and mahi mahi tacos. She loved the corn. However, she felt that the fish tasted like it was frozen fish or some sort of fish sticks.

4.0,1/19/2015,"I wrote a less-than-stellar review of El Vez last summer. My problem was mostly with the service. I recently dined at El Vez again with friends and now I feel 100% compelled to update my review.This past Saturday (1/17/15) evening, my wife and I took a couple we are friends with (and our 9 month old baby).  We had a reservation- which was smart, because the restaurant was doing pretty good business at the hour we were there (6:30 PM). Everyone enjoyed their drinks and the food was very, very good- especially the desserts. One tip for ordering... in looking around the room, it seemed most of the people there were ordering the Macho Nachos for an appetizer. We did this, too. But we also ordered the Queso Fundido con Carne. Excellent. As good as everything was, the real standout that night was the service. I wish I knew our waitress' name because she was fantastic. After my first review of El Vez, I was contacted (via Yelp) by a manager. He was not thrilled about what I had to say and wanted to see if he could entice my wife and I back. I was impressed with this. Knowing that someone from the restaurant checks the Yelp reviews, I want to be as specific as I can about our waitress so that the management can be aware of who their best people are. She was about 30 years old, with dark brown hair pulled into a ponytail, and wearing glasses.",3,3,2,Former Restaurant Writer C.,"New York, NY",30,21,0
3.0,1/17/2015,"The food is average with average décor, and average service, making this a fairly average place. El Vez is a very defined and distinguished restaurant. Being one of the only popular Mexican restaurants in its area, El Vez definitely has a captivated audience. It can always be seen full on weekdays and weekends. Great for groups, and small parties, El Vez has a certain satisfactory feel to it. The décor is simple, while there isn't anything to get too hyped on, the place radiates a rustic feel. Despite their large amounts of seating, El Vez always has a wait so coming early usually helps.​The main flaw of El Vez is its price. Charging 36 dollars for tacos that are mediocre is something that should be frowned upon. Each order can feed two people, however it leaves each person with only two fully stuffed tacos. In addition, there are many ingredients missing, for example the lettuce, (which I consider a staple in my tacos) was not given. The tacos are more of a fajita style dish where you make your own. This may be the only ""Saving grace"" for this dish because of the personal satisfaction that you can get from making your own tacos.​The appetizers are better than the entrees. The apps we ordered were the nachos and guacamole. The nachos may be the only thing on the menu that's worthy of your money. It is prepared in a unique way almost like a giant pizza. The chips underneath the heap of toppings are crispy vs. many places that have soft soggy chips. The dish is a little cheesy (no pun intended) and it can feel like just a mouthful of cheese, however the right pieces provide the right tastes.The Guacamole on the other hand is not worth your money at all. Though it does have a distinct taste. Its tangy and soft flavors are only enough for one person. The portion of this app is not sufficient enough to share, and frankly the guac is not worth it. The food is average with average décor, and average service, making this a fairly average place.",1,0,0,Adi K.,"Edgewater, NJ",4,6,0

For food, we shared the Snapper Aguachile, which was quite delicious but too small, then followed that up with the Vuelva a la Vida, and Black Beans and Rice respectively.

1.0,1/9/2015,"I have been here before and this was the second time I came here.  I came on a weekday when the bar area was more busy than the dining area. We were seated promptly, and the server came in to take our order. We ordered the classic nachos and chips and salsa. The guacamole was good - but could probably could use more seasoning (more lime, more spice). The salsa was more like a pico de gallo and felt too dry and a little bland. I also very clearly mentioned to the server that I am vegan and gluten free and asked the server what I could eat. He told me I couldn't have the enchiladas because it is already pre made with cheese. I asked him if there was any tacos I could have and he told me I could have the crispy cauliflower tacos and that they were made with corn tacos so should be good for me. My friend ordered the tuna tostadas. Finally, my tacos came out and they looked batter friend, so I asked my server again if they were gluten free and he vehemently said that ""yes, we don't batter fry the cauliflowers here."" I chose to believe him - BIG MISTAKE!! Something had seemed off about the tacos from the beginning, they were definitely tempura fried - they were so crisp and light. The tacos are decent but I would have personally preferred some hot salsa on it. But they were definitely not gluten free, I ate 2 out of my 3 tacos and asked a different server, who promptly told me that the tacos indeed were not gluten free. I was absolutely furious! This is my biggest tick, if servers don't know what is or isn't gluten free - go and ask! The server had the audacity to come and tell me that he didn't that I was gluten free.  Absolutely ridiculous! Don't just say something is GF, when it isn't. Eventually, the manager came to our table, apologized profusely and comped our meal. If you have dietary restrictions, I would recommend either not going here or sticking to the basics - rice, beans, guacamole and salsa. And definitely ask to speak with the manager or the chef, if you are concerned that your server is not sure.",8,3,5,Akrati J.,"New York, NY",1373,211,712

2.0,1/6/2015,"Well the 3.5 stars of this place CERTAINLY overrate it.  Maybe it's the junior analysts at Goldman Sachs (next door) coming in with no experience of good restaurants, or maybe it's the fact that it's in the equivalent of no-man's land, Manhattan, but really I have no idea how this rating is so high!The space is quite nice with lots of room to move, and the ambiance is rustic/old world with a suit-filled flavour from all the finance folks floating around this area.The service, however, is horrid.  They sat us right away and gave us water - two people asked if we wanted it, one came back after 5 minutes to deliver.  That was the last we saw of anyone for 30 minutes - not even a waiter passing by!  When we asked for someone by raising our hand and making eye contact, they finally came thru the relatively empty restaurant to take an order.  From there, another 30 minutes for food - no water glass filling, no beer replacements (on empty for 20 minutes).  You see a trend here, and it held all night.The food was fine - bland, however, and pricey.  The guac we were told would serve 4 people, and it would comfortably really serve only two (for $14!!).  No free chips and salsa here either ($5)!  The mains were not half bad - this is not a gorge-yourself Mexican experience so come having had appetisers elsewhere.  Chicken tacos for two were solid, again if a bit bland.  They did bring more tortillas when asked and didn't charge, but those, too, took 15-20 minutes to arrive.Beers are $6-8, cocktails about $12 and up.Not recommended unless you're at Goldman and don't want to cross West where there is legitimately good food to be had for a reasonable price and with service to match.",0,0,0,Nathan B.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",171,181,176

Unfortunately, I've left most often unsatisfied with the experience both in terms of food (mainly due to portions) and their service. On one dining experience, I ordered one of their crab tostada and it was absolutely tiny (for a price of $14). My friends who had also ordered dishes like the enchiladas were very disappointed by the portions as well. Definitely not a good value for your money and I the taste wasn't much better either. The crab inside was moist and had a very unstructured texture. Far better places to go for this kind of cuisine.Also, when it came time when we wanted to split the bill, the waitress had a lot of difficulty simply explaining how many cards they could take and how we should ideally split this. For a place that I'm sure get's a lot of large groups, they honestly should either have more clear guidelines dictated to the waiters/waitresses or just be more flexible.",2,0,0,Kevin J.,"Manhattan, NY",712,246,1045
1.0,12/23/2014,"I am a frequent guest at the Conrad, situated right next door to El Vez. A colleague had recommended the restaurant to me, and though I did not come with high expectations, I left feeling extraordinarily disappointed.I was here with a companion on a reasonably-busy Monday night, with several large groups seated around us. The mood was a bit odd: the decor said ""trendy"" but the clientele screamed ""office party."" The combination of the two gave off mixed messages.The inauspicious beginning was the fact that no one attended to our table for at least 10 minutes. Finally, a server showed up to take our drink orders. We had water, the Frozen Blood Orange margarita ($11) and the Bitter Guava margarita ($12). I thought the Bitter Guava was acceptable, but not exceptional. The flavor of the drink was underwhelming, because I could taste the Campari more than anything else (and surely not guava). My companion's frozen margarita did not look like it was the correct consistency, and he confirmed that it was very watery. He also said that he could barely taste any liquor.It again took quite a long time for our food orders to be taken. During this time, I even had to flag down somebody who appeared to be a manager to refill our waters as no server had come by.  I was embarrassed at having to do that, but she appeared to take it in stride and did in fact fill our waters.When our server finally returned, we ordered the Classic Guacamole ($14), and the Tacos for 2 (Chicken and Shrimp, $38). As we waited, our drinks sat empty -- in fact, we were only asked if we wanted another round of drinks when we asked for the cheque. The answer was definitely not, given our prior experience, but I thought it was strange that the server had not come by with a similar inquiry earlier on in the evening. He had very much been M.I.A.As for the food, the guacamole was acceptable, but a bit lacking in flavor and portion. As a point of comparison, Dos Caminos has ""traditional"" guac for two for $14. It comes in a similarly-sized bowl, but with more guac and much heavier on the flavor. We felt let down by the guac at El Vez.The Tacos for 2 were ""build-your-own"" and I enjoyed this particular aspect of the dish. If only I could say the same about the rest of the dish. For one, it struck me as very bland. The meats were not dry, but most of the flavor came from the assortment of sauces (2 salsas, sour cream, and some guac) rather than the meats themselves. Also, the kitchen was a bit stingy portion-wise. We only had 4 shrimp (whole) between us and slightly more pieces of chicken (sliced). I had expected something more at $38. The bill came to $85 or so for the two of us, BEFORE tip, and without dessert. I am familiar with Starr Restaurants and thus hope that this experience was not representative of their portfolio. Unless things change, I will not be returning, and will indeed seek comment from the colleague who referred me to El Vez.NOT RECOMMENDED.",2,1,0,Mickey M.,"New York, NY",0,192,0
3.0,12/16/2014,"3.5 StarsEl Vez is a dark-lit restaurant with a consistent Mexican theme without bordering on tackiness at all. Big circular booths fill the back room and are perfect for bigger groups. This one is right in the financial district not too far from good ol Whole Foods. The service we received was spot on, full of great recommendations (with fuerte too not half-assed), and friendly banter! Well onto the food.For an appetizer I can not recommend more highly the guacamoles. My favorite is the Tito Santana Guac, rife with mango, red peppers, jicama, and for spice habaneros and serrano chiles! The avocados themselves were some of the most smoothly mixed that gave such a creamy texture to them I couldn't stop eating it. These may look expensive, but definitely were worth it. Bottom line: GET THE GUAC.Onto the menu - as a vegetarian two things stood out to me, the Queso Fundido con Hongos (a very cheesy dish with wild truffles and huitlacoche, another mushroom that gives more texture than flavor). This dish was what I ended up getting and while very flavorful, might have had too much cheese with it and needed to be less dry. Adding the numerous hot sauces to this dish was a great addition and something I would recommend (ask for the habanero spicy sauce for sure). The other dish I wish I could've tried too was the black bean enchilada - definitely getting that next time I show. As for the meat eaters, the tacos for two are the way to go. The single serving tacos are extremely tiny in size, so even if you're solo go for tacos for two and have another meal to take home with you (the food portions are literally at least 3x the size with tacos for two). The carne asada were well-enjoyed by my group with again the addition of the spicy habanero salsa. Finally for drinks, this place has a full menu, but as I usually enjoy with Mexican, nothing quite livens up a night like tequila and margaritas.

3.0,9/15/2014,"I tried to go to Stephen Starr's El Vez on a Saturday night in Philly and I was quoted a 2 hour wait. The NYC outpost isn't as popular and although it's much bigger, I can also see why. First of all, it's next to Goldman. Expect suits.Second, the place is huge. I really haven't seen this large of a restaurant in NYC in a while. It literally takes up half the block with some outdoor seating to boot.Service wasn't great. Although very nice, drinks came mid meal, requested items were never to be seen. No bueno. The overall experience wasn't there. Drinks. Although a wonderful cocktail list, your cocktails need a little more cock... or is it tail? I don't mind paying $12 for a drink, but when it's all ice and mixer, a girl can tell. I did prefer the Skinny Paloma over the mint, basil margarita.Well, people aren't lying about the nachos. You definitely need to get them and so worth the visit to El Vez for them. Each piece perfectly smothered. We opted for chorizo and it was a great move. An order is good for 3-4 people. The guac was fine. Flavorless, but nice sized portion. The mole trio was a lot of food for the price, but bland. Chef, where do you think you are? Omaha? This is fuckin' New York City, we can take our food with some spice, yo. Get it together. You may list that as mole, but I know mole and that wasn't mole. You know what I really liked? My oxtail enchiladas. Get those and for sure you'll get some envious glares at your table. Overall, I didn't think it was too expensive. I mean it's Tribeca/FiDi and it's a nice spot. I do have to say it's comparable to a Dos Caminos type place: It's expensive white people Mexican. It's not bad per se, just lacks soul.Overall, not a bad spot out. If they actually made their cocktails with alcohol and I left after 2 margaritas a bit tipsy and service was a bit more on point, this review would have been jacked up to 4 stars.",10,3,3,Stephanie Y.,"Berkeley, CA",4999,1763,3377
3.0,9/13/2014,"Even over just the past few months, the Battery Park area has been slowly rising from a culinary wasteland to... well, a culinary ghost town. But at least it's moving in the right direction. And the addition of El Vez does help, but not by very much. El Vez is fairly standard Tex Mex food and they're certainly taking advantage of the area's tourist traffic and financial firms to jack up their prices, but they do excel in a few areas. First, let's start with the guacamole.The Tito Santana guac with habanero, pepper, and mango tastes great and has a nice kick, despite not being as spicy as you'd expect from the listed ingredients. The Bazooka guac with goat cheese and pistachios is excellent as well. The cheese and nuts really elevate the guacamole to something very different and very interesting. And even the standard Classic Guacamole here has cojita cheese and jalapeno, which adds a nice touch. You can't go wrong with any of these, and if you have a large enough party, it's worth getting them all just to try them out.The rest of El Vez's menu doesn't really deviate from your standard Mexican restaurant fare and food is good, but nothing spectacular. The oxtail enchiladas and crab enchiladas are good, if a little bland, but add a little (or a lot of) hot sauce and the flavors really start to pop. And if you like your food spicy, the habanero-based hot sauce really does pack a punch. It may not be a good sign when the quality of the food is contingent on the hot sauce, but at least the terrific sauce is there for the taking.Otherwise, the El Vez experience is still pretty unremarkable. The decor falls into the category of ""generically quirky"" as is par for the course at these types of restaurants, and the service is a little on the slow side. El Vez's biggest strength is the dearth of other choices in the area, but in any other part of Manhattan, there may not be a compelling reason to pick it over any other restaurant.",0,0,0,Alsan A.,"Manhattan, NY",101,74,0

We started out with sangrias reminded me of ""Juicy Juice"".  No balance between sweet (fruity) and the  brandy (alcohol).  Will not order again..... For appetizers we started off with the crab and cactus salsa (won't order again-just crab meat and salsa).  There was absolutely nothing special about this appetizer.  On the other hand the ""nacho mama"" was soooo good.   The nachos are made in a pizza pan (neat concept) and are plentiful!  The pickled red onion and jalapenos made this appetizer worth every bite!  We then had the guacamole (made at the table.  Typical fresh guacamole.  A little stingy on the avocados as they only used 1 to make the guacamole!  For the entrees we decided on Crab enchiladas (awesome with the cilantro) and the grilled Fish Tacos (ok - nothing special).  The one item I was waiting for since I walked in the door was the Churros!!!!  They were hot and crispy!  Simply devine and best part of the meal!  This place gets 4 stars because of the excellent service!  The waiter had a great balance of anticipating our needs and giving us enough space to enjoy our dinner.  WIll definitely go again!",1,0,1,Jennifer K.,"New York, NY",26,145,48

I have been only here twice, one for lunch and one for dinner. Now that the initial opening buzz has died down, the restaurant is quite empty during lunch. Tito Santana Guacamole (mango, red bell pepper, jicama, habañero & serrano chiles) - I expected this to be extremely spicy with all the peppers, but it was not. On the contrary, the mango and jicama made it quite refreshing. I highly recommend to order this for the table.""Bazooka"" Limon Guacamole (Goat cheese, chile flakes & pistachios) - Not a fan, simply because I dislike Goat cheese which came in chunks throughout the guacamole. Needs more pistachios and chile flakes as the goat cheese was the predominant flavorThe guacamoles come with a huge bowl of chips that is more than enough, but they will still refill it once empty.Grilled Fish Taco (Avocado, cabbage slaw) - I asked for the fixings on the side so I can build the tacos myself, and what came was the saddest looking plate I've ever seen. The tiny pieces of fish looked so lonely on the tortilla. Once I added the toppings, the tacos looked somewhat better. but looked better with the fixings. They are kind of expensive for how small they are.Milanesa (crispy chicken breast, black beans, cotija cheese, avocado & pickled jalapeño) - I only had a piece of this from a coworker, but in terms of size, cost, and tastiness ratio, this was definitely the best. Shrimp Tacos (avocado, cotija cheese & salsa de arbol) - The shrimp was deliciously marinated, but quantity is small for the price. Toppings consisted of a tiny piece of avocado and scattering of cotija cheese. I didn't really taste the salsa but if it was there they were very light-handed on it.I'm no expert on Mexican food, but given the marked up prices, probably from being close to a lot of big firms in the area, and small portions, this wouldn't be one of the first choices I would go to.",6,3,4,Jocelyn K.,"Jersey City, NJ",479,885,4955

There's a larger outdoor space and we were able to grab a table for two without any wait. We started off with a Blood Orange Margarita and a Pineapple Mezcalito. Super refreshing and delicious. Staff was friendly and service was prompt but not rushed. Sara, one of the managers, was super personable and help suggest some items to try.There are three types of guacamole to try, we went with the Tito Santana. I normally don't like fruit in my guacamole, but i'm glad we took the suggestions, it was perfectly spiced and i loved the jicama addition. We also go the Crab Tostadas, Mahi Mahi Tacos, and Shrimp Tacos to share.  We were pretty pleased about our order. The previous meal we tried the other grilled fish tacos (I love having the choice between fried and grilled fish tacos) and the nachos. The nachos were amazing, and our group of four had a hard time finishing the app. Every single chip had the perfect portion of cheese and chorizo, no digging around for the jackpot!I think i have at least one or two return trips  so that i can finish my list of things i wanted to try from the menu.

She did give us shots at the end of order, but I don't think that should be necessary if I'm paying $40 for a drink.",1,0,0,Kristi T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0

You can tell that the servers here really take pride in the work that they do, and everything that was suggested to us was well worth the price. To start, we had the Tito Santana Guacamole which was INCREDIBLE. The flavor combination was just right with just enough sweetness from the mango to make the taste interesting. Definitely one of the better guac's that I have tasted in quite some time. Next up was the Snapper Aguachile. This was my first time having a ceviche, so I may not be the right judge of quality, but everything tasted fresh and well prepared. My friend usually has ceviche, and he kept raving about it. We both ordered steak tacos and the grilled fish tacos which were good as well. To finish off the meal, I had the choco taco and my friend had the classic flan.

4.0,5/14/2014,"A longtime Philly staple, El Vez is finally in NYC!Just down the street from Goldman, the crowd is very button-down and grey slacks heavy.  There's also a stroller parking area, which scared the hell out of me, but I guess that's what you get in TriBeCa.  After work, the bar is absolutely packed - not easy to snag a seat if you're just popping in sans-reservations.  The space is really big - There's outdoor seating as well, and the street it's positioned on (Vesey) is relatively quiet in terms of traffic.The decor is cool -  I particularly enjoyed a quartet of bedazzled skulls positioned above our round table.  We had a reservation, and they seated us pretty quickly after everyone arrived.As far as drinks go, Margaritas are the obvious choice.  If you're into frozen vs on the rocks, be sure to ask first, as some are served frozen without it being explicitly pointed out in the menu (the blood orange one, for example.) I wanted to try more than one kind, however, the red bell pepper spicy margarita was so fantastic, I had to stick with it for 2 drinks.  I also tried the cucumber one - but gotta stick with red bell pepper. It's made with mescal, so definitely has a smoky kick to it - but it isn't overwhelmingly spicy and tastes like fresh vegetables.Everyone was raving over the nachos on 4sq, so had to give that a shot, as well as the bazooka limon guacamole.  The guacamole is served with goat cheese and pistachio - could have gone without the goat cheese, but the pistachios definitely were a nice touch.  Might add that to guac I make at home... And the nachos did live up to the hype.  They're served in a pizza dish, so each chip has at least 90% coverage of chesse, beans, jalapeños, etc.  Our group shared tacos / quesadillas after that, and the standout was 100% the mahi mahi tacos.  (Also tried the zucchini blossom quesadilla - fine, but could've probably made it myself - and the grilled fish tacos, which were very good.)  The Mahi Mahi is fried fish with spicy chipotle and vegetables, but in a rolled soft tortilla served almost like an enchilada, sans-sauce. They're easy to slice up and share, and SO GOOD.  Service was on top of it - the tacos did take a while to arrive, but we were having a good time and already had our nachos & guac.  Definitely an easy, solid choice for a more casual business dinner or a bday celebration.",14,7,13,Emily R.,"Manhattan, NY",452,361,4

To me, bigger is not necessarily better and I think El Vez exemplifies this times 50.  The service has been disappointing, the food, while good, does not reflect the high price tag.  While I might swing by for a less expensive Tecate can, there is better Mexican to be had in NYC and neighboring Jersey City.",3,1,1,Sara G.,"Jersey City, NJ",218,108,3

1.0,5/12/2014,"Decent food. Horrible service. High prices. For starters, we were a little early so while waiting for another couple at the bar, we decided to order some drinks. Ten minutes later, our friends arrive and the hostess says the table is ready and she would bring our drinks. Ten minutes after being seated, the waiter then comes to our table and informs us that they never made our drinks because we were being seated so we needed to order them again. Strike one. We decided to share everything so we ordered a salad and some appetizers, followed by some tacos, and then a few main courses. We instructed our waiter to bring everything out separately. So imagine our surprise when ALL the food arrived at once. Strike two. That was the last we saw of our waiter until the check arrived. Horribly inattentive service. Not worth the prices. Strike three.For many years, NYC used to have a dearth of decent Mexican restaurants. However, things have changed for the better over the past few years.

It was basically a cheese pizza with shrimp on it. Delicious, flagrant and extremely filling. I also ordered the Grilled Corn on the Cob (grilled corn, lime, chipotle & queso fresco). It was delicious except for the red spice that it was doused in. It was too overpowering and I couldn't enjoy the entire cob. Overall, I enjoyed my experience.

2.0,5/5/2014,"I still remember my first visit to the original El Vez in Philadelphia several years back, when I was first introduced to the frozen margaritas. There was, of course, the gleaming motorcycle in the center of the bar and a nonstop playlist of Spanish/Latin-themed music. It's almost fitting that restaurateur Stephen Starr decided to bring his venue to NYC, and conveniently opened it less than a block from my office. Similar to the original venue, El Vez NYC boasts a bright, lively interior. The bar area has plenty of standing room space, which get pretty crowded once the afternoon and evenings roll by on weekdays. The actual dining room is similarly spacious, with plenty of four-tops as well as booth seating around the perimeter of the area. I had booked a lunch reservation for 6 a week in advance, a decision that my team was grateful for once we entered a completely packed greeting area. Despite the existence of said reservation, however, it took us nearly half an hour to be seated.We placed our orders with little difficulty, and started off with a couple of guacamoles and salsa for the table. The Salsa, a blend of chopped tomatoes, tomatillos, red onion, and jalapenos with a splash of lime, was a tasty, if not watered down, mixture. The two specialty guacamoles available on the menu, the ""Bazooka"" Limon and the Tito Santana, were slightly better than the salsa. The ""Bazooka"", featuring goat cheese, chile flakes, chopped pistachios, and slivers of roasted tomato was a creative take on the traditional version; it was nutty with the distinctive edge attributable to the goat cheese. The Tito Santana, on the other hand, utilized chopped mangos, red bell peppers, jicama, habañero and serrano chillies as ingredients, and was a lighter, crisper contrast to the former. Both guacamoles, though, lacked a substantial kick from any of the weak additions of lime, citrus, or cilantro.As an entree, I went with the Oxtail Enchiladas, and what I recieved was a large plate with three enchiladas that, put together, were slightly larger than a deck of playing cards. The oxtail was well-cooked and tender, albeit monotonous in flavor, and wrapped in corn tortillas; they were topped with salsa guajillo, melted chihuahua cheese, crema, and sliced red onion. Minute portions aside, the flavors went well together, although what sticks in my memory the most is the hefty price tag ($18) on such a small and simple dish. The failure of both the price-to-portion and price-to-quality ratio was pretty much across the board, though, as I noted my colleagues' dishes; each appeared as though it had come out from an home cook's kitchen with a price mark-up at least twice as much as it should have been, even for New York prices.Despite the nostalgia that I have for El Vez, I have to give Starr's newest venture a less-than-favorable assessment. For those who may be curious or are in the area, stick with the small plates (chips and appetizers) and avoid the larger (at least in price) plates; this venue is best suited for drinks and apps instead of a longer, sit-down meal.",13,6,9,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827
3.0,5/5/2014,"With the imminent arrival of Hudson Eats and now El Vez, the dining situation in Battery Park City is really looking up lately.It must be the horrendous service that is bringing the reviews down here, because the food was pretty good. We experienced terrible service too, most likely since they just opened a week ago.I knew this place would be doing tons of business during the week for workers in the area getting drinks for happy hour, but I did not expect it to be so packed on Sunday night when we came for dinner at 7 PM.It's also probably very different on the weekend - there was a large fleet of strollers parked out front, with the TriBeCa families representing heavily.After waiting for our table for a few minutes, and overhearing wait time quotes of 45 minutes, we were shown to our table in the back of the restaurant, at which point I realized how enormous this place is. The neighboring Blue Smoke is not going to be happy as they will be stealing tons of their business here as they can pack in a huge number of people.Eager to try a ton of stuff from the great-looking menu, this was one of those times when the waitress warned us we were being disgustingly obese, but we disregarded this usually silly advice and were able to easily finish most of the great food:- Bazooka Limon Guacamole ($16)This was really great, as it was much more than typical guacamole. Topped with goat cheese, pistachios and roasted tomatoes, it was really delicious. The big basket of chips it was served with were great too, nice and warm and crispy, so one of the guacamoles is definitely a must to start.The chips took quite awhile to come out, but then the next part of the meal is what almost called for a 2-star review. After waiting for an agonizing half an hour for any more food, they brought out the entire rest of the meal all at once. I think they might need some lessons in coursing. Luckily it was all very tasty at least, though some of it arrived lukewarm:- Chopped Salad ($15)This was the sole healthy item to make us feel better about ourselves. It was ok, but I would skip it at that price.- Señorita Margarita Tlayuda ($13)This was delicious - it's a large, cracker-thin tortilla cut into four pizza-like slices and topped with cheese, garlic, tomatoes and basil.- Black Beans & White Rice ($5)These were quite good and had a ton more flavor than you would expect from beans and rice. It's a good accompaniment for the tacos.- Crispy Mahi Mahi Tacos ($16 for 2)These were the better of the 2 tacos we tried - there were 2 long, rolled flour tortillas filled with fried fish, cabbage and avocado. They tasted great and were the only item along with the rice and beans that were really hot, which probably helped.- Brisket Tacos ($16 for 3)These were pretty good - 3 little corn tortillas topped with brisket, jicama slaw and salsa. The meat was a bit fatty and the tortillas tasted store bought and got very hard after sitting for a bit, but they were decent.- Tres Leches ($8)This was not great - I would stick to the milks and leave the fruit away from this cake. It wasn't nearly sweet and spongy enough and the pineapple and kiwi flanking the cake just didn't go well with it.- Chocolate Taco ($6)This was much better, but still basically an upscale version of those Choco-Tacos you get from Taco Bell and Mister Softee. I would definitely recommend it as a satisfying sweet to end the meal.I could see this turning into a good neighborhood spot, but it's not there yet. They were still fumbling around a lot, bringing plates to the wrong tables, etc. Some of the food was really excellent, so I wouldn't mind coming back in a bit to give it another try.",18,7,7,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834

Tonight, just a few nights after opening,  my two Mexican food and margarita loving girlfriends and I gave it a shot and thrilled to report we were beyond impressed. The service was incredible - especially for a place that large and crowded and brand new. The chips and guacamole were perfect with just the right amount of spice and we had to ask for a bowl of the the smokey salsa, it was that good. The mahi tacos were out of this world and very substantial and the basic nachos were old school and delicous. My friends loved their margs but they did look pretty heavy on the ice cubes in my opinion. The carnitas were perfect but we were too full to really enjoy them because the nachos portion was huge! But again, the service was spectacular and I can't wait to go back with my husband for the tequila sampling, post baby! I do agree with a previous review that it was a little awkward when waiting for our table in the bar that the poor guys were trying to squeeze thru with food. I didn't see any enormous trays so maybe they were delivering appetizers to tables further into the bar but I couldn't tell. And if you go at 5 pm on a saturday, anywhere in Battery Park and Tribeca,  expect there to be kids. There are so few options for us parents in the hood.

3.0,4/29/2014,"great place, more authentic and upscale than Southwest in Battery Park. But, and this is the first time Ive ever said this in my life, the food is WAY too salty. Absolutely everything is too salty...please stop with the salt! Your flavor is there, calm down!",1,0,0,Renee P.,"New York, NY",0,12,2
3.0,4/28/2014,"Loved El Vez!  We had a pitcher of sangria and the guac only so cannot comment on dinner but the vibe was happy and upbeat and the service was friendly.  When I first walked in, I was a little taken aback by how crowded it was but then I was lucky to get a table at the bar.  Only downside I would say is that they do not seem to have tables for two for dinner, only reservations for bigger tables seem to be available.Came back for dinner last night and would definitely go back for drinks and apps but I do not think I would return for dinner.  The dining rooms are filled with kids, have of them running around the tables.  The waiter gave us the wrong nachos then of course the correct nachos took time to come out which I understand since the restaurant is new but you would think they would have comped us a drink or something while we were waiting.  Oh well.  Still a good drink spot!",1,1,1,Tanzeena H.,"New York, NY",96,60,43
2.0,4/28/2014,"We went to El Vez last night, Sunday, April 27. We had two appetizers and some drinks.  Some of the service problems I'm sure will be ironed out in time, but there was a lot going wrong.1) There were actual children sitting in barstools at the bar. If families come in and are waiting for a table, they should not be waiting at the bar.  Put them at a table in the bar area.  I believe this is illegal anyway.  If parents are just there to get their drink on, leave the kids at home.  I know it's Battery Park City but why is a six year old taking up bar space?2) The restaurant is designed so that the food coming out of the kitchen has to pass through the bar.  There are a constant stream of servers with food running the gauntlet.  Bad idea.  I can only imagine when the bar is crowded, this must be a disaster.3)  I had the mahi mahi taco appetizer which came rolled up in two tortillas.  Not a taco.  Extremely bland and, at $16, more expensive than getting the far superior mahi mahi tacos down the street at North End Grill at $4 a piece.  My friend got the chipotle chicken tacos which were  good, but, again, at $14, expensive for what you get.4) The service was off.  We waited forever for chips and salsa.  Friends at a nearby table weren't even offered a drink for 20 minutes. Our chips and their entire meal were comped, so that's good news.5) The drinks were reasonable.  I had $8 Granache by the glass.6) The atmosphere and music were good.I'm sure they'll work out the service issues, but the food is a wild card at those prices.  I'll go back again when things have settled down.",3,1,0,Christina C.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,7,0
5.0,4/24/2014,"Went to El Vez for their friends and family opening.... It was awesome! The place was packed but service was still excellent, as was the food and drinks. I've been to the Philly location several times and this location is just as good (if not better!) and even cooler decor. Highlights of the night: margaritas (tried 3 different ones, all very good!), the guacamole with goat cheese, pine nuts and roasted tomatoes is maybe the best guac I've had ever, and the shrimp tacos were great! Everything is very fresh and tasty. I fully intend on being a regular here as it's just a short trip from my home in Jersey City and happens to be right on the way home along my husband commute! Perfect place to meet up for date night or any night for that matter :)",2,0,1,Jess G.,"Jersey City, NJ",13,42,1
