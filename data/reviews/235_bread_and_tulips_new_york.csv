3.0,5/1/2019,"My friend and I came here on a whim after our first choice was booked out. We ended up having a okay post-work meal. Go downstairs to be seated - we were seated without a reservation when we arrived around 6:30. As for the food, it's a bit expensive for basic italian fare. The scallops were tasty, but were a bit too oily. The wine was good, but I noticed the server had just recommended the most expensive one though when I asked what would pair well. More bread would have been nice as well - the basket isn't really tended to when you run out. For dessert, the affogato was good, but I've had better. I would be willing to give this place another visit though - it was a solid meal, but I just wasn't wowed by anything.",0,0,0,LeAnne B.,"New York, NY",86,174,127
4.0,4/12/2019,This place was such a pleasant surprise.  Didn't know what to expect.    I've passed this place many times before and not ventured in.    I think the outside signage is very misleading.  The place has a rustic and very comfortable feel.  The food was delicious and the service was great.  The prices are pretty reasonable too.  I definitely will go back to this place and recommend it to other friends!,0,0,0,N D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,0

4.0,3/17/2019,For a hotel restaurant this place is not what you would expect. This is more like a nice restaurant that happens to have a relationship with a hotel. I had the salmon and it it was cooked to perfection paired with sautéed spinach and Lima beans. I also tried the dark chocolate mouse and gelato for dessert which was fantastic.,0,0,0,Shane W.,"Madison, WI",112,125,184

4.0,2/4/2019,"Food 4/5Service 4.5/5Food - I'm not an Italian food person myself. I've just never found it to be a fulfilling meal. However, this place may have changed my mind. We were a large party of 8, so it was the chance for us to try lots of things on the menu. We ordered a variety of pastas and pizzas. I'm not going to detail into every one of them, but they are all well made. The pastas were all a perfect al dente, not too chewy, not too soft. They are coated and garnished lightly as to not overwhelm the pasta itself. The pizzas as well were artfully done. We sat kind of near the counter were the pizzas were being made, so we were able to watch the chef cook and make our pizzas. It was so fun. The crust is nice and puffy and chewy, but thin on the bottom. Crispy to the bite, but with enough texture to hold up the toppings. Service - We had one server for our entire table. We are a pretty rowdy bunch, but we were luckily sat in this party area that was blocked from the rest of the dining room. He balanced our orders and requests with grace -- he did a great job. For a party of 8, our gratuity was also not included, but we tipped the man well. Would recommend. great location, solid experience.",0,0,1,Giselle C.,"New York, NY",561,91,228

5.0,1/2/2019,"Happy New Year everyone!There was no hostess at the podium but a large sign letting customers know to head downstairs. Came here today for a team lunch to celebrate my manager's birthday. We were seated at a long table in the middle of the restaurant with the view of the brick oven. The decor was very cozy. There were so many options for lunch either you can order Soup & Sandwich, Salad & Pizza, or Three Course Prix Fixe. I was debating between the Brisket Blend Burger or Creste Di Gallo (con Salsiccia) but I went with the pasta dish...usually pesto contained nuts so I made sure that they weren't any because I am allergic to nuts. Since our server never came back to our table that the pesto was safe for me to eat. Wow, I absolutely loved my dish so much with the delicious fresh pesto and chopped up sausage ::hubba hubba:: ""mama like""Most of my colleagues ordered from the Prix Fixe menu while others got a Cobb Salad minus cheese, Steak Tagliata Salad, Spaghetti minus breadcrumbs + the ""Soup of Day"" - Mushroom We shared the Chocolate & Hazelnut Cake and Tiramisu for the table.

First of all, the wait staff and bartenders were great-super friendly, funny, and not overbearing. Service was prompt. Things to try:Fried artichoke-the sauce that came with it was amazingBurrata and nduja pizza- a great mix of burrata and spicy sausageMeatball appetizer- these were 3 meatballs for $15 but so worth it with great tenderness and tasteQuattro formaggio pizza-also really really good.

5.0,10/16/2018,"Fantastic place! I made a reservation here for a surprise birthday dinner and they delivered! Upon entering, you'll notice it's lit in a way that makes you feel cozy and welcome. The decor is nice and welcoming. On our table was a bottle with some ornaments and ""happy birthday"" written on the bottle, which is a great touch!On to food. While it is not cheap, it is not pricy. You get what you pay for, which is high quality freshly made food. For appetizer, we ordered the meatballs. First of, possibly the best meatballs I've ate. Meat was tender and full of flavor, and the sauce just enhanced and paired well with the meatball.For the entree, I ordered the skirt steak. It came out medium rare, and was cut into nice even pieces. Meat was tender, almost melt in your mouth. You usually never get this texture with skirt steak but they somehow managed it! It also came with a salad and fries. Fries were crunchy and flavorful, salad was eaten by someone else who can actually appreciate salads.After our meal is where they really outdone themselves. They surprised the birthday girl with a free slice of cake to celebrate the occasion. We got a slice of chocolate mousse cake that was simply divine. For a mousse cake, it had more texture than what I was accustomed (not a bad thing). They also gave everyone a glass of wine to top it off, all on the house. Our server was very attentive and sweet. She definitely made the meal enjoyable.Would definitely come back here given the high level of food and service displayed!",2,0,1,Andrew C.,"New York, NY",217,161,250

4.0,8/16/2018,"The wait for the food was sooo long I could've gone home and back for the meal. Ok just kidding but we waited over 40 minutes and our food was still not out. The waitress came over and told us the food is on the way and its taking awhile because we got all entrees. She probably came over because she saw me say to my friend ""why's it taking so long?!"" even though I swear I was whispering. I appreciated that she at least came over and let us know so we're not just getting hangry by the minute. The food came and surprisingly... it was really good! My friend and I were really shocked and impressed. The sauce was different and tasteful and the duck meat was tender. Overall was a good experience. I didn't like how hard the bread slices and the linguine were. I think I had better pasta if we were just talking about pasta alone but I would definitely return to try the other dishes.",2,0,1,Winnie L.,"Brooklyn, NY",220,140,346
4.0,8/12/2018,"Took advantage of restaurant week this past Thursday and I was so happy I did! My boyfriend and i ordered the crab cakes and burrata to start, the steak and scallops for entrees, and the tiramisu and tartufo al limoncello for dessert. The burrata had the perfect thick firm layer on the outside and the creamy inside went delicious with the bread they served. The crab cakes were also yummy and came with some sort of peppery sauce. The scallops were cooked to perfection but they were a little on the salty side (shout-out to my waiter for warning us in advance). We ordered the steak medium and it came a little too chewy so would def recommend getting medium rare. The dessert was delicious, especially the tartufo.

5.0,8/3/2018,"Went here for our anniversary dinner, and it was fantastic! They had decorated our table especially for the occasion.We took advantage of the restaurant week deal and tried six things - the burrata, the crab cakes, the duck meatloaf, scallops, chocolate mousse with hazelnut ice cream, and the tartufo al limoncello. They also give fresh bread and olive oil (great quality oil) prior to bringing everything out. When we asked for more bread, they promptly brought it out. The burrata was delicious, medium-thick skin and very creamy inside. Went great with the bread.The crab-cake went great with the radish/apple/red onion salad on the side, and was complimented by a spicy mayo type sauce.The duck meatloaf was a true highlight of the night - the red cabbage bed it was on was coated with the same sour cherry sauce on the duck, and went together amazingly.The scallops were tender and had a good bite, while the asparagus was crisp, but not hard to chew on. The sauce on the plate was very palatable. The chocolate mousse melted in your mouth (my favorite!), while the tartufo was adorable. The tartufo came with what I believe were very fresh raisins or some berry, and while I don't like raisins, it was a perfect mix!  At the end, while waiting for our check, they gave us two small glasses of moscato on the house. It was very kind! Would definitely come again, and recommend to anybody looking for a wonderful place to celebrate. We left satisfied and not overly full - a perfect meal.",0,0,0,Aryana J.,"Warwick, RI",0,5,5

We got the squid ink pasta with crab meat, the rigatoni, the four cheese pizza, and the pizza with burrata and spicy sausage. Everything was amazing! The squid ink pasta was so flavorful and I loved the chunks of crab. The pizzas are quite large and definitely enough for 2 people, we ended up taking half off it home.

5.0,5/24/2018,Stumbled into this place and was pleasantly surprised. We started off with grilled prawns that were excellent. Next we had mushrooms in a cheese sauce with Arugula that came served in a cast iron pan that was amazing. Oh and the bread they served was also amazing. My favorite. Crunchy outside with tasty chewy dough inside. For a main dish we had the home made bucatini in a great tomato sauce with speck and cheese.  I thought I was in Italy. We had all this with a couple glasses of their house Super Tuscan wine. We ended the meal simply with an Espresso and a little tasty biscotti.  Even the espresso was excellent. Service was also very good with the waitress coming back to us after every dish to make sure we were happy with the dish. I highly recommend this restaurant.

We had an early reservation because we were catching a Broadway show later, and they welcomed us with some gratis bubbly and showed us to our adorable cozy round table with some birthday decorations on it. This is located in a ""basement"" if you will, but it's a nice mix of rustic and cultural bohemian decor with low lighting. Bread was tasty and we had it with the fresh ricotta with rough salt. Parpadelle is my favorite pasta and their fresh pasta with amazing lamb Ragu (really the reason I wanted to come here) certainly lived up to my hopes, and my husbands strip steak was tender and perfectly cooked. I had the pear tart and he had tiramisu, both were good. Service was attentive but not overbearing, and they really cared to make sure we got to the show on time.

You could actually have a conversation without shouting, which I find to be a rarity in NYC restaurants. I'm vegan so the food options were a little limited. All their handmade pasta and pizza dough contains egg. They have a gluten free pasta which is vegan, so I got that with a very basic tomato sauce. It was fine, but unremarkable. I really enjoyed the olives and kale salad (ordered without cheese).

3.0,11/16/2017,"Came here last night and part of the restaurant was roped off due to a private event. I really liked the dim lighting, brick walls, and the whole set up of the restaurant minus the fact where we were sitting was kind of tucked away behind a curtain in an alcove type of area. It made it harder to flag down a waitress just to place our order. For our meal, I split the burrata appetizer with my friend and it was a sizable portion. The balsamic vingear I asked for had a very strange taste...it didn't taste like the usual balsamic vinegar that is served at other restaurants. This was spicy and almost reminded me of a sauce that would go with an entree....it was just very strange and that plus the olive oil with bread was a bit weird. My veal bolognese portion was enough to last me for last night's dinner and today's lunch! I felt the veal was a little on the dryer side, but the presentation of the dish itself was great. For dessert, HIGHLY recommend the chocolate mousse cake and hazelnut gelato. It was SO smooth and a perfect way to end the meal. Between all this and a glass of wine, the total with tips came out to be $73.

Each was made with seasonal and local ingredients which definitely came through in the flavors. We also ordered a bottle of wine which was delicious it was a red from California and we drink it dry. The appetizers were very filling but we did make some room for pasta (of course!). I ordered the Bolognese, my friend ordered a seasonal pasta dish and one of the other girls got on mushroom pasta. We shared another a few appetizers as well for the main course just to get more of a menu sampling.

She made fantastic suggestions and answered all of our questions with ease. The food and cocktails were 5-star! I will be returning and cannot stop talking about this meal. We both ordered house cocktails that were served promptly and were greeted with freshly cut house made bread. I highly suggest the Grilled Octopus as a started-- it was flavorful and fresh. The Hen-of-the-Woods pizza was delectable with an earthy flavor and kick of heat from crushed peppers however, it could have done with out the fresh arugula topping. My boyfriend (a New York chef) and I were surprised at the lightness of the house-made Pappardelle pasta. It was complimented with a rich braised leg-of-lamb Bolognese that was too good to leave any behind. We finished the meal with the Pear Tart-- a perfect combination of semi-sweet pastry and passion fruit sorbet, again so light and flavorful.

4.0,2/19/2017,"Had a great time here with family on a Friday evening. Food was delicious, ambiance was great, decor was a touch eclectic which gave the restaurant a cool vibe - large upside down wicker baskets were used as lamp shades over one table, 8-10 different lanterns hung over the partial wall that separated the bar area from the dining area downstairs, etc.Portion sizes were smaller than I expected from an Italian place, but by no means insufficient. It was nice to order a carbonara dish and not walk out hating myself and feeling like there was a bowling ball in my stomach.We started w/ the meatball and burratta appetizers and also split the burratta pizza.Between all of us, we ordered the duck, the lamb pappardelle, the strip steak, the roasted chicken and the carbonara. And a side of brussel sprouts and pancetta, and a side of sauteed broccoli in garlic and oil. Very pleased with the meal.The only thing that kept this from a 5 star was the service. The waitstaff was attentive when they were present, but that was a little off. There was no hostess when I entered the restaurant around 5:30pm so I awkwardly walked around looking for my family at their table. A few other employees were on their cell phones, so I didn't bother asking for direction. The server was very thorough, and had great suggestions as we asked what was popular from each category.

The host was so very gracious about my being 20m late though the other 2 guests were already seated. The pizza station was 20ft away so I could see them custom making pizza's to order & was quite excited. We were seated in the downstairs corner which is so intimate, private, and cozy as to be preferred. The interior design is spic-and-span, modern, chic, clean, and comfortable.

2.0,11/8/2016,"My primary issue is with the service.  The food is good and the prix fixe lunch is a bargain. However, mediocre service will prevent me from coming back. Based on the recommendation of yelp and the restaurants bib gourmand recommendation from Michelin I thought this would a good choice for lunch but I was really disappointed.  I asked the waitress for a recommendation, and instead of explaining that they were best known for pastas and pizzas as explained on their website she just said that pasta would be more filling than the steak.  The steak was cooked to my specifications and flavorful, but my companion was not impressed with the pasta. We both enjoyed our appetizers a nice tangy kale salad and a burrata tomato salad.  While the hostess and the back waiter were very helpful, the waitress running the show on November 1st during the lunch hour provided sub par service. After she took our order she dropped the ball completely leaving her back waiter to deliver the remaining courses and to ask us what we had ordered for dessert so he could get it.  I eventually had to get up and ask the waitress for the check, because after the first course had been delivered, she only stopped by the table once to offer pepper and  to ask how the food was. She was more attentive to the tables surrounding us.

A sign reads 'happy hour' and shows the drinks and eats at their deal prices.  I decide to opt in.I was impressed by their pizza deal and cocktail of the day. Both strong and with lots of flavor.

I opted to sit in the bar/lounge in order to take advantage of the specials and the setup was great too.The lounge is filled with soft leather sofas and chairs with decorative pillows, a brick accent wall, and warm lighting.

This is of course always a matter of taste but we had difficulty choosing what to select for each course, the selection was amazing. The Heirloom tomato with buffalo mozzerella was exquisite, we also had the chorizo with shrimp  on a bed of chick and fava beans, simply wonderful, the sauce was too good to leave behind we asked for extra bread so we could take full advantage of it. We all went for the seared scallops, we're all seafood fans. The scallops were perfectly done and served on a bed of fresh asparagus and the most delicate sauce, here were were again, making use of the excellent bread.

5.0,2/12/2016,"Initially this started with my telling my friend that I was going to walk north for exercise from the financial district until we had to go to a Yelp Queens event earlier this week. She then insisted I come join her for her company's happy hour session. I felt awkward but she insisted since a lot of people backed out and man was I glad I stopped by. The area in which we were situated was like a little alcove downstairs from the entrance of Bread and Tulips. The lighting is dim with old school lightbulbs and rustic warm wood tables. The cocktail menu was both intriguing and held a variety of strong libations for everyone's palate and the wine menu was pretty fantastic as well. Between the two of us we tried about half the cocktail menu. Stares awkwardly at feet. My favorites were definitely a toss between the Detox: Reyka vodka, St. Germain, Kiwi, Cucumber, and fresh lime or the Strawberry Mint Julep for those wanting something sweeter that still packs a punch. The Rucola Gimlet was interesting as well (a vodka based drink that uses arugula as its base) and the Rosemary Collins was quite refreshing. I feel like a lush. For bites in between drinks the girls ordered mini grilled cheese sammies with soup (tiny but so flavorful and adorable!), Meatballs (really seasoned and cooked well, only tried a half of one), a spread of a variety of cheeses and meats with crusty bread, and a wide variety of pizzas that were cut into sixteenths for us. There was the spinach with ricotta, grana padano, garlic, meyer lemon, extra virgin olive oil; Mortadella with salami parmigiano, fresno peppers, pistachios, olive oil, fior di latte mozzarella; Margarita with san marzano tomato, fresh mozzarella and basil; and lastly and my personal favorite the Quattro formaggi with mozzarella, grana, fontina, gorgonzola, and caramelized onions. Two pasta dishes also came out on the bar area that I tried a forkful of each. Both were cooked al dente and had very rich and distinct flavors. The Bucatini was smothered with a fresh light tomato sauce, grana padano (which is like a very rich parmesan), and guanciale (cured or smoked meat from pork cheeks) with red pepper flakes. The pork was succulent and amazing with the thick noodles. Though, the winner on flavor had to go by a narrow hair to the Fettucine in a veal bolognese sauce. I had to stop myself from wanting to devour more than a small portion. Also, both pastas came in very hearty portion sizes. I had never been to Bread and Tulips before but their hospitality was warm and both the food and drinks were pretty well above average.

5.0,2/11/2016,"Came here for my first time during last year's Winter Restaurant week. My party of 3 and I had reservations and we were seated immediately. The ambience downstairs is warm, rustic and modern. Really perfect for a date or girls night out.For starters I had a light arugula based salad with a prosecco vinaigrette and freshly shaved sheets of aged Parmesan. As my entree, I went with their Quattro Formaggi Pizza (mozerella, granna, fontina, Gorgonzola and I asked them to nix the caramelized onions). Dessert, complimentary bread and cookies. I'm going back to the bread...it was delicious, warm and perfect. I get why their name is ""Bread & Tulips""...I also recently had the pleasure of my office hosting an event here. We had quite the impressive spread of meats, cheeses, pizzas, pasta dishes, grilled cheese/tomato soup things and meatballs. I got to help figure out what things to order and I could not have been happier with everything. The quality of the food and cocktails here is seriously superb and Jonathan (bartender downstairs) was really awesome. I've now officially tried 4 out of the 5 brick oven pizzas available here. Including:+. MARGARITA - san marzano tomato, fresh mozzarella and basil.+ QUATTRO FORMAGGI - See above.+  MORTADELLA (salami) - parmigiano, Fresno peppers, pistachios, olive oil and fior di latte mozzarella. +  SPINACH - ricotta, grana padano, garlic Meyer lemon and extra virgin olive oil.Pasta dishes I've tried here include:+  BUCATINI - San Marzano Tomatoes, guanciale, pepper flakes and grana padano.+  FETTUCCINI -  veal bolognese sauce with grana padano.Both pasta dishes were fantastic portions, perfectly cooked and had rich delicious flavors. Personally, the veal bolognese fettuccini was the pasta winner of night to me.The meatballs here tasted homemade and were delicious but could have been bigger. The sugo added a nice flavor though and they were saucy and also topped with shaved cheese (maybe more grana padano? Tasted a little different from Parmesan).Cocktail-wise I got to try 6 out of the 8 cocktails on their menu and some white wine on my first visit. I definitely recommend their Strawberry Mint Julep and their Detox as my favorites. The Rucola Gimlet with fresh flavors of arugula was also delicious and fresh - definitely a unique and creative way to use a salad base in a drink. Cheers to healthy drinking!

4.0,2/6/2016,"My friend and I came for Winter Restaurant Week. We were led to the downstairs dining area which was nice and inviting. I liked the wood tables, warm accents and intimate feel. There was a yellow tulip on the table and we were given rustic white bread to start with. Our waiter, Ryan was amazing. He was so friendly and on top of it, even though the restaurant was quite busy that night. He answered all of our questions patiently and was very knowledgeable about the menu. He went above and beyond for us! I decided on the house made meatballs for my appetizer, which I thought was pretty good. It had a hearty savory taste with yummy sauce, parmesan and basil leaves. My friend had the scallops and I think I actually liked this dish better. I normally am not a fan of scallops, but here it was delicious! It was pan seared to perfection, covered in flavorful juices and had tasty gigante (very large) and garbanzo beans on the side. For my entree, I ordered the strip steak tagliata, which came with both parmesan fries and arugula salad with parmesan shavings. The steak was served sliced into small pieces and cooked in natural juices, which was lovely. I really enjoyed the tender and robust taste of the steak. I had it cooked on the well done side, but it wasn't dry at all! I liked the fries, which were slightly crispy, with fluffy potato taste inside. The salad was pretty bland though. I didn't taste any dressing on it. I decided on the dark chocolate mousse cake with hazelnut gelato for desert. The cake itself was a little small, but tasted rich and creamy. The hazelnut gelato was wonderful and paired with the cake very well. My friend loved the gelato so much, she ordered another scoop. Ryan actually gave her 2 scoops, so she was able to share some with me. AND he didn't charge us for the extra gelato. I also tried my friend's dessert - The crostata di pere, which is like a pear tart. I think I liked it more than her because she let me have more than half! The crostata came with blood orange gelato, which was just okay but the crostata itself was a delightful mix of almond and pear. There seemed to be an almond base and pear baked into it on the side. The crust was so good as well. It was lightly sweet and a refreshing contrast to the heavier chocolate cake. My friend and I had a great time here and I'm happy I finally got to try this place out!",9,7,9,Kathy X.,"Queens, NY",783,438,5876

5.0,11/28/2015,"Had a Saturday night birthday dinner to plan for a large group. I wanted something easy, relaxed, and somewhat economical, so I decided to give Bread & Tulips a try. The special events manager, Jennifer, responded to my email request right away and laid out all the information I needed to plan the evening. She was fine with the number of guests fluctuating (you know how it is getting New Yorkers all on the same schedule) and we were able to square away our plans in no time.This isn't the staff's first day at the rodeo, they really know there stuff: large parties are assigned a pre-fixe menu that is a series of (seemingly never-ending) courses served family style --with or without accompanying flights of wine depending upon your tastes. The courses come from an abbreviated version of the main restaurant menu so, save for fancier fare such as lamb or octopus, you're still getting a nice selection. (Though the addition of their fried olives would be most welcome).The set prices were definitely a great idea as I wanted to spare my guests an egregiously high bill thanks to that always wonky ""tea drinkers to wine bottle orderers"" ratio often faced with group dinners. They ask that the bill be split over no more than 4 credit cards, but I gave my guests a heads up and we all paid with cash to keep things simple.We reserved the back room (which is really more of a banquet table on the other side of the lounge and not a separate space), which was quite lovely and tranquil.The staff was very gracious and attentive serving heaping platter after platter of delicious fare --salad, pizzas, roast chicken and steak, pasta, and two types of desert-- all brought out in a leisurely manner so that we might take our time and enjoy the space. Oh, and wine, lots and lots of wine. A different glass for each course.Jennifer even went the extra mile and set up my vegan guests with a series of entrees to suit their tastes apart from the standard carnivorous menu.Definitely a very classy, stress-free birthday evening.

5.0,11/22/2015,"One of my favorite dinner experiences in Manhattan thus far! I made a reservation ahead of time for my sister's birthday on a Saturday night.Though we arrive half an hour early, we were taken care of right away and led downstairs by the host to wait to be seated. As we sat down in the little nook of the lounge area, we thought to ourselves ""we'd have no problem waiting here for half an hour!"" While my sister went to use the ladies' room, I asked our waitress if there was anything we could do for her birthday, she said she'd let our server know to place a candle on the dessert we ordered. Service was excellent -- Ryan took care of us most of the evening, giving some of his own food recommendations. The FOOD. We ordered and shared the fried artichokes that came with a yogurt-type sauce. The balance was perfect. I also ordered us the burrata dish that came with sliced tomatoes in olive oil. I've had amazing burrata in San Diego (apparently it's a thing there), and this was definitely up there in terms of quality.For dinner, I had some of the Hen of The Woods (mushroom) pizza with arugula. It was excellent and not too much. The pasta dishes were also exceptional and just enough. I tried my sister's bucatini dish and was in love. For dessert, we shared the tiramisu (topped with a birthday candle), which was unsurprisingly very good. The decor of this restaurant is so, so cute and refined. There was a lively communal-like table in the middle downstairs that further added to the rustic Italian feel of the restaurant. Lots of different seating arrangements, for intimate dates, to family engagements. The waiting area by the bar actually was reserved for a private event, which is something to consider in the future.

4.0,7/31/2015,Decor beautiful. Romantic. We had kale salad light and fresh. Meatball had a incredible red sauce. Octopus was yummie bf thought it was rubbery but I loved it. I had the sea bass small portion but just perfect for my appetite and simple but yet very flavorful. My bf had the steak which was small portion but very good great sauce. They serve a lot of things with potatoes which I'm not a fan of and feel like something better could be plated. And for dessert vanilla bean pan cotta and raspberry sauce it was so so I'm not a panna cotta fan so not a fair review but the chocolate moouse was pretty yummie some parts were a little dry but I ate it up b the ice cream moisten it up. Our server Kimberley was very sweet and excellent recommendations I wouldn't have got the sea bass if she didn't rave about.

We were happy to find several student budget-friendly options on the menu, ranging from decently priced pizzas (around $13-$15) to higher priced pastas ($20-25), although they were well worth it. We ended up ordering both pizza and pasta. From my friends who ordered the pizza, they said it was pretty good. I had the bucatini pasta, which was probably one of the best pastas I've had in a long time. You could tell that the pasta was homemade, and had the perfect ""pasta chew"".

There's a lounge/couch area by the bar which is a great place to be to grab a drink and wait for your table or your friend to arrive. There's a lot of space in the area which is another great place. It was also really cute because there were tulips on every table, alongside was the bread that was served. I came here for restaurant week and tried the meatballs & burrata as starters/appetizers, both which were really great. Personally the meatballs were a little as the burrata was a little overwhelming for me but I believe that's just because of the type of dish that it naturally is, not because the restaurant made it poorly or anything like that. For entrees I tried the squid ink pasta and the steak dish, both which were absolutely AMAZING. Would definitely come here for the squid ink pasta alone even if every other dish at this place was horrible. For dessert I got the panna cotta which was amazingly delicious as well.

5.0,12/27/2014,"Bread & Tulips. I've been a customer and friend since the first time I was introduced to this place by a friend through her networking group. I remember walking down the steps that it held an ambiance similar to something euphoric. There was something that I couldn't place at the time, only to realize that it was beyond my expectations. Whether you are coming in for their pizzas or for their delicious antipastos during their popular happy hour, Bread & Tulips wins at every turn. The pastas (especially the squid ink) is delicious and savory. The small bites are perfect for afterwork cocktails. Their family style serving is perfect for a night out with close friends and family (which even includes an alcove with a long wooden soprano table). While food is definitely a reason to come in, I would say that the ambiance is beyond a date night atmosphere and there are a wide variety of reasons as to why one should have their event at this venue. Dimly lit, it always gives an intimate feeling, even while meeting someone for the first time. I've come here plenty a time to meet friends and colleagues and found myself staying beyond the meeting.Riccardo, the owner, is gracious and treats me like family. Again, I can list a plethora of reasons as to why Bread & Tulips wins, but the real reason is behind Riccardo's vision and what he created (and that includes the staff that he has chosen and vice versa). I don't want to exclude the rooftop area of Hotel Giraffe, where B&T also serves.Whether or not you, the reader, views this as biased is up to you. I came in here with an open and objective mind, as someone who harbors nostalgia for hole in the wall and spots that make the perfect cup of coffee that I frequented for my entire life. The thing is that I have found a loyalty to this place that I didn't think it was possible if it weren't for that level of care that Riccardo and his staff gave me - and I'm confident that Bread & Tulips will give the same to you.

We shared the mains, as none of us could make our mind up on what we wanted to eat, so we had the veal bolognese, squid ink pasta with seafood and the roast chicken.

Although I have had better pizza in the city, I just really love how perfect this place is for a drink, a conversation and some good food to go along with it. At times, it's super empty - but what a luxury in New York. Great for if you want a cozy, atmospheric spot to catch up with someone important while sipping good cocktails.",1,0,1,Kelly L.,"Manhattan, NY",14,12,0

The pizza here is excellent -- nice slightly charred crust and they didn't go insane with the toppings like a lot of places do so that the whole thing turns into a soggy pile of blah. I would have actually pigged the whole thing up but refrained only for propriety's sake. I also had the kale Caesar salad. Now, I don't even like kale all that much, but this was a really nice Caesar salad, not overdressed, with the chicken actually cooked properly. The space is also really nice, and it would probably be a great place to come after work to hang out and have drinks. Gracious service, too -- my boss mentioned that the music was too loud when we were at lunch (it kind of was), and the manager turned it down right away, which I thought was cool; a lot of places would have just looked at you like, ""What are you, some sort of communist?""",2,1,0,Laura H.,"Woodside, NY",1,25,0

Good food, solid dishes, nothing that made a super huge impression.  But-I couldn't order off of the menu, all tables were served family style from a set menu, so maybe I'm missing some of the kitchen's magic. Everything was served family style at about 10 tables throughout the entire dining roomOur first course included: A tossed salad with shaved Parmesan and thinly sliced radishes.A plate of cured meats (this I liked the best, but how can you not love good prosciutto when it's available?)Home made ricotta cheese to spread over toasted bread drizzled with olive oil (again, nothing exciting here)Our pasta course was:Al dente penei pasta in a rosa sauce with cubes of mozzarella cheese (the cheese was phenom &the pasta was perfectly done) Our dinner menu included:Grilled steak and  roasted potatoes  (meh, OK, but not impressive)Roasted chicken (nicely seasoned and moist, but it's a roasted chicken, again not exciting)Grilled vegetables (grilled tri-color peppers and zucchini. I do this on my stove top at home. Not special, good, but OK...)I had to leave before dessert was served, so I can't give any opinion on how that may have turned out.Also-the acoustics for our party were horrible. It's a really loud dining room when it's full and everyone has had a few drinks. I could barely hear the person sitting next to me, and forget about the person two seats away from me. Which is unfortunate-he seemed interesting. They have lighting fixtures in giant woven baskets hanging from the ceilings that people kept walking into all night. Again, the wine flowed freely, so that could have been part of the problem, but they just seemed too big & too low or their purpose.Food & service was good-but I expected more from a NYC dining experience than what I was presented with that evening.",0,0,0,Alison C.,"Montclair, NJ",36,15,6

4.0,10/30/2013,"Really lovely and a total fluke I ended up here tonight with a DC friend and three of her kids after Wilhelmina, whose offices are close to 23rd and Park subway. Prix Fixe lunch is 25 and includes a squid ink pasta and tagliatelle. They have diverse wine list by the glass, from the cheap Primitivo at 9 for glass and 13 quartino to a Sancerre much more. I chose a nice Malbec quartino for 16. After lunch at Dorrian's Red Hand--mac and cheese appetizer which is more than a reasonable portion for an entree unless you plan to be a chick who weighs in at 200 pounds--I just wanted a light supper. The vegetable soup for 7 or 8 is outstanding and healthy with clear broth and lots of fresh veggies including carrots, mushrooms (the ones with the long white stem) and lima beans. It was subtle, which my elderly father for whom I care three months, would call tasteless but it was excellent. Great service and very cute downstairs (everything is downstairs including the bar with a good happy hour from 4 to 7). The beet and goat cheese ravioli I tasted was quite good though I'm not sure I'd order it myself. All the pasta looked good and the gelato was much enjoyed by my friend's children. It's close to Sarabeth's , which is where they had intended to go, but it's so pricey at Sarabeth's and this is really good food at reasonable prices in a cute space with *excellent* music which motivated me to install Sound Hound on my iPhone so that when I hear music I like I can find out what it is.

I worked with Jennifer Cavalier, the Events Coordinator, and she was terrific in getting me set up and followed up afterward as well. I was looking for a space that was intimate but not too closed off, an area that wasn't too large or too small since we had a party of twelve and good food/drink without breaking the bank. I reserved the chefs table which is in a semi private space tucked within the restaurant and it was the perfect choice. I had a choice of going with either their tasting menu or ordering a la carte off the menu and both options had good variety and were incredibly reasonable (price) for NYC. Given the variety of palates we had in our party, we ended up opting for ordering a la carte. The restaurant was also open to having me come in early to decorate the space and they also allowed me to bring in a birthday cake and did not charge a cutting fee.

I found it odd that we had to either both order off the restaurant week menu or off the regular menu (something with the computer programming).The first things we noticed was how empty the restaurant was for lunch, and especially during restaurant week! The location is ideal, and the setting itself (wood paneling, plenty of wine on display) is beautiful.  I ordered the baked arugula pizza and my friend ordered the handmade triofe. The pizza was just as expected (a little heavy on the arugula though) and my friend's handmade triofe had an interesting (in a good way) texture.For its price-point, the restaurant just makes the cut.

I imagine the entrees are also top notch and plan to go back to find out, but sharing lots of things is certainly not a bad idea here. Biggest standouts for me were the octopus - cooked 100% perfectly - and the olives, which I think were complimentary, but they were the best olives ever. Olives are perhaps my favorite food but somehow I'd never had this type before.

When we arrived, the hostess wished us a happy birthday by name. Even cuter, they had prepared printed menus with Happy Birthday on top. What a cute touch.Our waitress was present (without being overbaring) and made sure to give us clean plates between courses, freshen our water each time she stopped by and made sure we were never low on our drinks. One of my friends got a glass of wine (her second) and it didn't taste correct. Without hesitating, she whisked up the wine and brough a fresh glass (which tasted correct, they must have opened a corked bottle).The food was delicious, well portioned and tasty. The appetizer meatballs were great (and generous sized compared to other meatball apps you see around town). The pizza looked great, my fish was cooked quite well.What made this a real 5-star experience was the level of care and thoughtfulness that everyone from the hostess, to the waitress to the manager on duty took to take care of us.

It's not easy to find a nice, quiet restaurant in Manhattan, but this place is it.It's a pretty space, intimate but not crowded. I'm thinking the downstairs descent to the restaurant's main area throws people off a bit; it's been half-empty each time I've been there. Maybe people don't know it's here.The service has been inconsistent. The first time I was here, our server was friendly and professional, she knew when to come over and ask for things and when to stay away and let us continue our conversation. The second time, our server was nice but had the strangest timing.  When we asked for a minute to look over the drink menu, he literally gave us a minute and not one second more. He would come over to ask if we were ready to order, and when we said we were, he'd turn around and leave. This happened during both entrees and dessert.The food is solid, but nothing special. I've had the Ricotta Tortellini and Handmade Trofie. The tortellini is very good, but a little on the skimpy side. The trofie, which initially put me off because it looked like a bowl of worms, was hearty and flavorful.

The wine selection is very good, the bread almost as good as in Europe, and the olive oil has a specific strong taste which only the best olive oil has - fruitiness, pungency and bitterness combined together.

Highly recommend. For entrees we ordered the pork shoulder, the steak and the pappardelle. Unfortunately, these paled in comparison to the appetizers. All three were just mediocre (except for the parsnip puree that came with the pork shoulder, that was yummy). The pappardelle was so oversalted that even me (a pasta lover) left about half on my plate. Ambiance wise, this place is a hit. Perfect for some wine and to enjoy some appetizers.

You walk through this little doorway and downstairs to the restaurant.It's a nice hidden gem. It has a nice rustic feel. I was here for a birthday party. The place wasn't crowded, and we took over a nice set of tables in the middle of the restaurant. I hear the manager that set up the whole bday party with the organizers was great to work with and very accommodating. A+ on service.For the appetizer spread, we got the Insalata di Polpo, Fresh Ricotta Cheese, and a margherita brick oven pizza. The grilled octopus was good. It wasn't the best i've had, but it was still tender. It may have been over seasoned with the vinaigrette, but it was still yummy. The brick oven pizza wasn't bad too as an appetizer. It was a nice small size, so everyone was able to get a 1/4 of the pizza and still have room for the other courses. The best app was the Fresh Ricotta cheese. OMGGGGG, usually ricotta is pretty salty, but this wasn't at all. You can just tell this was very super duper freshly made. The ricotta was pure heavenly bliss. It came with bread to spread it on, but you don't need it. You can just take spoonfuls and eat it just the way it is.For entrees we had the Roasted Organic Chicken and the Orecchiette with braised duck. The chicken was massive. It was a bit dry with the white meat but the crispy skin was yummy. The orecchiette was cooked beautifully and the duck was hearty and scrumptious. For dessert, the worker at Bread & Tulips ordered a birthday cake for our group from another location, so i won't talk about that.

3.0,1/8/2012,"Came here for dinner with a friend and ate at a bar even though we had table reservations.  The place was EMPTY on a Thursday night.  Not sure why it's so under the radar because the place is cute and well situated, the food is good and people are friendly.  I had actually never heard of the place when I booked a table on OpenTable and just took the reservation because they are the only restaurant in Gramercy with availability!  Great find!  But this is definitely not the place to come if you are on a diet.  Everything we had was delicious but also incredibly rich and slathered in non-healthy good stuff.  For example, we ordered the housemade ricotta which was AWESOME and fatty enough in its own right, however the kitchen slathered the bread in butter also.  Yum but your waist band's worst nightmare.  If I get this next time, I will just ask for plain bread.  That ricotta is heavenly, you cannot stop eating it!  We also ordered the mushroom ravioli and the papperdelle.  Very yum.",1,0,0,Diane C.,"Hoboken, NJ",244,531,7
4.0,1/8/2012,"I came here on a Friday night to use a GiltCity voucher I had purchased for a 3-course dinner for two. Both of us really enjoyed the items we got. We had the ricotta crostini and butternut squash soup as appetizers, ravioli del plin and the black sea bass as entrees, and the apple crumb cake and affogato (simply espresso poured over vanilla ice cream - didn't know it could be so delicious!) as desserts. The only thing I didn't really enjoy was the apple crumb cake, but it looks like they've taken that off the menu now. We also each enjoyed a great glass of wine each.The service was great and the atmosphere was perfect for a nice dinner out. Since the prices are a little high, I probably wouldn't come back until I had another coupon or wanted a nice place to go for a special occasion - nothing to say about the quality of the restaurant though, just living on a student budget. Would definitely recommend.",1,0,1,Sara E.,"Portland, OR",8,49,0
3.0,1/2/2012,"We came here on a Friday night, and it was not crowded, and it had a nice ambiance except for the big television screen at the bar.  The man had a delicious martini that had cucumber, grapefruit, and kiwi.  I had a huge endive salad for an appetizer, but it was actually main course size, but pretty good.  He had the sea scallops, which were nicely cooked, but the sauce lacked flavor.  It was OK, but bland.  The mains were pasta with tomato and prociutto (bucatini) and then the duck.  The pasta was perfectly cooked but it felt more like a lunch dish that can be found at any decent italian restaurant, and the sauce was too watery.  I thought the duck was fine, but again, nothing exceptional.  Three stars because the food was just OK, but nothing to write home about.",0,0,0,Charlotte R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,23,0
4.0,12/17/2011,"I had a late dinner here on a Friday. Although the night started off rough, the table  service and food was absolutely fabulous and make ultimately for a great night. We had reservations for 8:15 and got there a minute or two early and checked with two hostesses upstairs. They noted our names and told it would be a few minutes to clear our table. Fifteen to twenty minutes later, they had not seated us or even updated us so we went to them again and they got our number and name wrong. Then we waited additionally as they let later groups in without any recognition. Finally we had waited somewhere around 40 minutes and they realized that they still had not seated us. A nice, knowledgable woman from downstairs came, apologized and offered us a free drink downstairs at the bar while they got our table together. She was great, really apologized and took control of the situation. They had a festive cocktail list and a good selection of wines by the glass. Our drinks were great and we were able to find some seats near the bar. Finally we were seated and a super nice waiter came by and apologized again for the wait and asked if we needed anything right away. The menu had a great local selection with some really interesting vegetable sides. The waiter then brought bread quickly, set up olive oil and took our order. We were astonished about how fast our meals came - which was great! I ordered the butternut squash soup for appetizer. It was flavorful, satisfying and thoroughly enjoyed the grilled octopus as my entrée. The waiter continued incredible service throughout the meal and definitely let us linger. The dessert menu looked yummy as well.The interior design downstairs is great. They were accomondating some big parties when we were there and have a nice lounge near the bar as well. It was cozy, warm, inviting but spacious at the same time. They have some kinks to work out with their hostess service and organization but I will definitely return.",1,1,0,Caitlin M.,"Jersey City, NJ",56,98,0
5.0,12/1/2011,"This is by far one of my favorite places to eat.  To start, they have a great cocktail menu with signature cocktails made by very nice bartenders and then the food...Having an array of small plates and delicious entrees, I have yet to find something I do not like.  I have visited several times, and it never ceases to impress me.  There is an atmosphere of warmth and family and the ambiance is quite inviting.Go for the octopus to start  with .  It will melt in your mouth.   If that is not your thing, you cannot fail with their brick oven pizza's that are warm and gooey yet have that fire crispness at the end.  Finally try the Black Tagliatelle.  Incredible.  Their menu (as any good menu should) changes with time, but there are a few mainstays I mentioned.  This is a perfect dinner or date venue, and worth every last bite.PS-The dessert if to die for, do not skip it.  Chocolate & Hazelnut; hands down.",0,0,0,Sheri S.,"NY, NY",3,1,0
5.0,11/17/2011,"This is a rare and precious find in a town glutted with restaurants both plebeian & spectacular, and everything else in between. Spectacular usually comes at a price point that is as intangible as a reservation is to procure, and this being NY - even the plebeian commands a hefty price. These days I'm not willing to shell out hard earned cash for hackneyed dishes that I can make better at home, but with the holidays coming and year-end burn-out settling in, I desperately needed a little break. I never dreamt that I would also get the chance to indulge my epicurean tendencies as well, but at Bread and Tulips, I did. It might be hard to imagine that such a treat might come at a price that won't furrow your brow or tense your muscles, or that you might try something exciting and unique, but it does and you will in this little parcel of peace and gastronomical pleasure on Park Avenue @ 26th Street next to the Giraffe Hotel. You must have a pizza - I'd go for ""Lardo,"" or ""Hen of the Woods"" - and their Pappardelle (with Lamb) is to die for. One thing you must NOT do is skip dessert. These otherworldly confections are not to be missed. I've had them all and couldn't possibly pick a favorite, but I'd start with the Chocolate Hazelnut and work my way down. I feel like I should qualify that with, ""of course not all in one sitting"" but truth be told: I wouldn't blame you if you did.",0,0,0,Beth W.,"Albertson, NY",121,5,0
5.0,11/14/2011,"I've been to B&T a couple times and they confirm their consistency in great food, great service and ambiance. My first time there was with a friend visiting NY, and the other time with a bunch of friends for a Birthday party.The first thing that you get when you walk in is how much attention has been put into every little detail there. It feels sophisticated, but unpretentious, and I love the wooden long table in the bar area - so cozy. Now let's get to the good stuff: THE OCTOPUS APPETIZER!!! OMG!! (I normally don't say omg, but it deserves!) Seriously nothing like I've experienced before! It melts in your mouth, it has the perfect texture and flavor, very balanced and it is so fresh I almost had to order a second one. And their potatoes are so amazing too! I also had a pizza, I think the name was Hen of the Woods (like the Fleet Foxes song :) and it was sooo good!!! I can still taste it. I think they have that one seasonally. That's probably why everything tastes so fresh and healthy! I ate so much and left feeling great - all fresh ingredients and plenty of earthy flavors! I should also mention I am a vegetarian and the menu has plenty to offer.The staff is very pleasant and attentive. And they are good looking too - smart owners ;)Overall this is a great spot and I feel comfortable going there on a date, or with my family for dinner.

He didn't seemed concerned that we had to go back to work (even after we told him) and wanted to clear our table first.  Also, no bread was offered to us while we waited for our food and it was a long time for our food to arrive.I would come back here for the food and not for the service.  Make sure you have plenty of time.

3.0,10/18/2011,"At the moment of my visit, this is probably a 2.75 stars, but overall since I would be willing to try it again...

Overall:Food, presentation, pricing & overall atmosphere for the area was pleasant enough that I would try it again if I was meeting someone in the area on a busier night.  If it isn't a better experience on a busier night... I probably wouldn't be back.My impression is they are trying to save on staffing on a quiet night (Monday), but I'd suggest putting your patrons all in the same section so you can cover (of course this may have cancelled out quiet table... but there is a happy medium)  Hopefully they will shine over time & the neighborhood will have another great evening choice.",1,0,0,Lisa D.,"New York, NY",12,335,318

3.0,10/12/2011,Came in last night (Tuesday)  for a dinner.  We walked downstairs into cozy atmosphere with a pizza oven in front of their kitchen. I like how they try to support local farmers. They have a decent wine list and a semi private room (chef's table) in the back if you have a larger party.To start we had charred octopus and sea scallops. The sea scallops were very well cooked and I liked how they came with roasted tomatoes. It comes with 2 scallops so if you want more you should def order an extra serving.  The octopus was pretty good served with potatoesGrano Arso Carbonara was so mushroomy (not a big fan of the mushrooms) but it was good. I like how it was topped off with the egg.Pork and beans dish was good. It tasted hearty. Black sea bass was ok. The portions are a bit small minus the pasta dish.I didn't have a chance to try the raved about lardo and egg pizza but I may come back to try it.The only minus I would say would be the lack of service.

2.0,9/28/2011,"Date night last week came courtesy of a Thrillist deal I found a few weeks ago. I don't know what it is about restaurants with simple names (hello, Fig + Olive), but I always gravitate toward them.The entrance to Bread and Tulips is just a hostess stand plus a downstairs stairway. I wasn't sure what to expect when we descended, but the seating area was warm and inviting with lots of wood and exposed red bricks. Soul jams pumped throughout the restaurant, and I loved the planter full of baby chili pepper plants. Our deal came with two shared plates, a brick oven pizza, plus two glasses of wine and gelato.Out of the six shared plates offered, the Crostini with foie gras, pickled blueberries and toasted almonds piqued my interest most. By itself, the foie gras was kind of boring, but the bright flavor of the pickled blueberries really took it to the next level. I would have liked the bread to be crunchier, but the toasted almonds helped keep the textures playful.When the Fritto Misto came out my jaw literally dropped. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it definitely wasn't a bucket full of fried goodness. Inside was chickpea panisse, green tomatoes, meat-stuffed olives and arancini with a side of lemon aioli.The fried green tomatoes were out of this world. So fresh and crisp, I could have eaten a whole plate of just those. We also found what tasted like fried lemon. It was ridiculously refreshing, especially with the lemon aioli. The chickpea panisse was a little too mushy for my taste. All in all, I liked bits and pieces of it, but the Fritto Misto was just too greasy.I immediately started salivating when our Bresaola, Mustard Greens, Buffalo Mozzarella and Parmigiano brick oven pizza arrived at the table. The crust was deliciously light and baked to a nice crispness. The mustard greens, however, overpowered almost all of the other flavors. And don't even get me started on the buffalo mozzarella. That was the one component I was most looking forward to, and instead, I didn't taste it AT ALL. Without it, the pizza was far dryer than it should have been.I honestly didn't have much room left by the time dessert rolled around. That was probably a good thing because the dessert was gross. I wish there was a way to say it nicer, but I almost spit the nectarine sorbet out. The buttercream gelato wasn't much better.",0,0,0,Victoria P.,"Astoria, NY",25,57,0

Smooth & creamy, mint-forward taste then salty on the back end, served with grilled bread - it's simply AMAZING. Charred octopus starter was interesting, but slightly chewy.Mains: Homemade trofie pasta with lamb ragu was very good but someone was a little too eager with the salt shaker in the kitchen (and i love salty food), and the Smoked Pork Shoulder dish was overall delicious, if a little stringy.  Service was friendly and accommodating.
