5.0,5/2/2019,"Came here for a work lunch, making a reservation through OpenTable. The restaurant is two levels with a lovely open kitchen. Our server, Kristin, was amazing from start to finish. Very calm, friendly and professional. Two of the four guests did the Pre-Fixe (PF) Lunch, so we were able to try their appetizers and desserts as well.Note: All the food we had was extremely light but filling, without missing a beat of flavor!Crab Nachos with Sea Urchin ""Queso"": Although expensive, it was absolutely delicious. There is a good amount of fresh crab pieces; I wish there was more uni, but overall a fantastic appetizer.Chilled Octopus with Yellow Bell Pepper Juice and Black Mint (PF app): The octopus was very tender and I loved the little potatoes it came with. It's a beautiful dish with the bright yellow juice.Chilled Shrimp with Cucumber and Pasilla Mixe (PF app): The shrimp was quite jumbo and the entire dish had hints of cucumber. I was obsessed with the pasilla mixe. I put it on my tacos.Fish Tempura Tacos: Amazing. Very tasty, light yet filling, and the fish was incredibly fresh. Each order comes with 2 tacos on corn tortillas, small in size.Ice Cream Sandwich with Oaxacan Chocolate: This was just OK. The chocolate taste was overpowering.Dessert Taco: This was cute and wasn't too sweet, so it was a nice way to end the meal.Overall, a great dining experience. Highly recommend!",0,0,0,Lindsey S.,"New York, NY",355,277,203

2.0,4/28/2019,"Went here on a Saturday night and were seated promptly. However, we didn't get our waters poured and menus more than 5 minutes after we were seated. Tables in other sections got theirs and we were kept waiting. The food was only average. The guacamole tasted like any store-bought version and was not worth the $21 price tag. The black cod was too salty and overpowered the rest of the dish; the octopus was extremely fishy, and the pork belly was 90% fat (not an exaggeration.)For drinks, we ordered the tamarind julep which was way too flat on flavor and again, not worth the $19 price tag.Cherry on top was that they delivered the wrong food to our table not once, or twice, but THREE times. The whole restaurant seemed short-staffed and service was extremely disorganized and none of the busboys or servers seemed to enjoy their jobs; ""thank you""s for water refills were completely ignored with sullen faces. Not worth it for the price.",0,0,0,Amanda L.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",113,41,29

5.0,4/18/2019,"I actually came here a couple of months ago and found photos in my phone from my meal here. I wanted to definitely give this place the credit it deserves.We did a pre-fixe menu in which we got to pick an appetizer each and 2 tacos per person, followed by a dessert. For the appetizer, we ordered separate salsa and chips. We received 7 different salsas with our chips, all of them were fantastic. From our pre-fixe, we got the duck tamal and king salmon. The king salmon was so delicious, I still remember it till this day. For the tacos, we were recommended pork belly and octopus, and they were fantastic choices. Lastly, we got a ginger and black currant sorbet, and it was delicious!Warning: This place is very expensive. We ordered 2 arnold palmers, it was really good but we spent about $160 on our meal. I wouldn't say I can commit to coming everyday but definitely would come back. 10/10. The servers were also extremely friendly and nice!",0,0,0,Cindy K.,"New York, NY",330,75,166

4.0,4/3/2019,"Very nice but extremely pricy business lunch. We were a group of 4 and decided to have the prix-fix menu for $38, which included choice of appetizer, choice of tacos, and dessert. We heard great things about the dessert taco, which was not on the prix-fix menu. We asked the waiter if we could swap it and she kindly let us. On our table, we had the tamal and salmon for appetizer, and the bacon tacos and steak tacos for entree. Both appetizers and entrees came out quickly and tasted really good. Unfortunately the size of the tacos is quite small, especially compare to their price ($18-$22 for 2 tacos a la carte). Finally we had the dessert corn taco, which was really tasty. Overall, really enjoyed our lunch. However, the price is a bit over the top, and that is the reason why I don't feel as if the restaurant deserves a 5 star rating.",0,0,0,Matteo G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",190,135,154

5.0,3/28/2019,"Excellent dinner at Empellon last night, with bold flavors, unlikely and successful combinations and impeccable execution. The guac is a must for the salsas it comes with (all absolutely delicious from smokey to creamy, hot to velvety, yum!). The smoked cod appetizer is not only presented with great plating, it's also flaky, savory, briny, and overall delicious. To try! Also highlighted: the pineapple dessert served with chamomile ice cream, a great combo. And get a couple of fresh margaritas to go with everything. I recommend the pineapple one, and the smoked pomegranate mezcal. Great evening!",0,0,0,Jessica S.,"Manhattan, NY",205,458,332
1.0,3/23/2019,This place is nice. I just don't understand how they can have happy hour in their other locations and not this one. I think the menu should be cohesive. I work a few blocks from this location but travel downtown for the specials. I'm pretty sure they'll have more business if they offered the same services as their other locations.

5.0,3/16/2019,"Popular Midtown HH spot with creative modern Mexican fusion bar food and exceptional molecular gastronomy desserts.We had:- Crab and uni nachos - very tasty and light as far as nachos go.  I've never seen this dish anywhere else and it's shocking that it hasn't gone viral given how good (and easy to make?) it is.  Great for sharing or to hog for yourself. - tempura fish tacos, came with two - pretty substantial pieces of fried fish tempura.  Solidly good and filling bar food though I wouldn't say the best fish tacos I've ever had.- cocktails were a bit on the sour/bitter side for me personally.  I guess to complement the food?  I would have preferred slightly more subtle sourness.- avocado dessert which is a dish made to look exactly like a real avocado half, with the exact same texture, consistency, and color.  Even had a spray painted on black shell.  Came on a bed of granitas and salt.  Was not too sweet, a bit like a toned down slightly avocado-y key lime pie.- the standout dish was the Banana dessert, which looks like a stick of butter on blackened banana peel and tasted like... something banana-y that's incredibly delicious and I can't quite describe.  I don't know where their dessert chef came from but I don't think I've had a dessert this good outside of Michelin 3-star restaurants.  (Edit: googled to find out that chef Alex Stupak used to be pastry chef at Alinea and WD-50.. so actually spot on)The desserts will set you back about $17 each but they are really unique and IMO worth trying.  Food is good overall but desserts are worth a special trip for.",2,1,1,Sallie D.,"Manhattan, NY",207,227,3461

4.0,3/9/2019,"The food is so delicious that I would have given five stars, except that the restaurant is SO LOUD and the service started out strangely. The space is beautiful but the kitchen is open and there is tile everywhere. With no soft surfaces to absorb any noise, we pretty much had to yell to hear each other. Since we didn't have a reservation, the hostess offered to pull chairs from the bar to a table in the bar area for us. Maybe she couldn't hear us, because when we accepted her offer, she said ""great!"" ...and promptly disappeared. After a while, we decided to pull the chairs over to the table ourselves. Once we did, a waitress walked over who had clearly not been told about us since she didn't even have menus for us, but she got some and from that moment on, the service was good. All that aside, once we got our food, we didn't care about the weird start or the noise because the food was just so good, we were too busy chewing to speak anyway. The guacamole was so fresh and we loved trying all the different salsas. The cabbage salad is satisfyingly crunchy and flavorful, and the tacos were just perfect. I'll definitely be back at this restaurant, but I think I'll probably get take-out instead.",0,0,0,Nikki S.,"New York, NY",1,4,0
4.0,3/8/2019,"Creative play on your favorite Mexican cuisine. Came on a Tuesday and was really packed so would recommend to make a reservation. The tacos came in a good size and served in 2s. Absolutely loved the grilled octopus and fish tacos. We tried all the different salsa (total of 7) and the best one in my opinion was the 3rd darker Smokey one, has a chipotle taste and not too spicy. Definitely make room for dessert, it was the highlight of the meal. We ordered the avocado yogurt dessert (shaped like a half avocado, still blows my mind), the banana ice cream, tequila barrel ice cream, and the corn ice cream taco. If you have to pick one, I would go for the banana ice cream. The tequila one was interesting and most of the alcohol flavor comes with the chocolate sauce that sits on the side. As cool as the avo dessert looked, there was too much citrus and salt going on but did it for the gram.",1,2,0,Florence V.,"Dyker Heights, NY",116,73,295
4.0,3/4/2019,"This place is GREAT! It's sort of a modern, classy Mexican joint. Due to the location in Midtown, this makes for an ideal business lunch spot. It also has a very nice trendy vibe to it. The food is very creative, the service is superb and the ingredients seem clean and all come together as pretty delicious. They already have a bunch of great vegetarian friendly options on their menu but they can also add more/customize if you request it (I had falafel tacos there once, which isn't on the menu usually). I LOVE LOVE the salsa bar that comes with an order of guacamole. The guacamole portion is small but once you add in all the chips and sauce options, it's almost as if you're getting two different orders for one. The sauces go from mild to spicy and it's great to try different ones and combine some to get your perfect sauce. They add a perfect kick to their entrees as well! Another favorite of mine is the chopped cabbage salad if you want something light. It's very unique and a good portion for a lunch (I think it's actually an appetizer on their menu) once you account for all the chips/guac you've been throwing down. I haven't been able to try their drinks yet but definitely want to go back and try these soon!I haven't been able to find great Mexican, sit-down places in Manhattan that fit my palette so this one was a great addition to the neighborhood!",0,1,0,Ridd M.,"Montclair, NJ",193,83,70
3.0,3/3/2019,"This was an average experience. Which sucks b/c I was really hyped about this place since I'm a huge fan of it's dickish owner Alex Stupak. I came here with company (great company) and was very hyper and excited to sit down. Even though we had a reservation we had to wait about 35 minutes before we were finally seated. Again, we did NOT come as a walk in. We had a reservation and STILL had to wait a long time. Once you are finally seated and can ignore the unpleasantness of waiting, you can take in the gorgeous decor. I'm a big fan of how they decorated the inside. The food came quick enough but I honestly thought it was overpriced tacos. The two food items that really stood out was the flight of salsas and the desserts both of which were very delicious and memorable. I would come back for the desserts but not for much else.",1,0,0,Saddmun A.,"New York, NY",289,142,34

4.0,2/28/2019,"The service was amazing. The cocktails were great. The food was good. Definitely not Midtown's best when talking strictly about the food and flavor. I'd probably only come back for the margarita and the service. The food had a great idea behind it but was definitely lacking flavor. If I'm paying midtown prices I want to be WOWed. It wasn't bad at all but wasn't anything to write home about. Our meals were good but nothing that would bring us to bring out of town guests or ourselves back. We got the guacamole which was awesome but the salsas were okay. The meat on our tacos were cooked perfectly. We got the bacon and pastrami tacos. The tortilla on the tacos were bland. Our desserts weren't impressive. The corn taco was super tiny. The chocolate ice cream sandwich came in a wrapping like you get in the grocery store but tasted good. So they get the 4 star for the guacamole, margaritas, and the service but that's about it!",0,0,0,Addi W.,"Queens, NY",209,27,13
3.0,2/27/2019,"As you walk in, the decor is absolutely gorgeous!  It's very elegant yet still very welcoming.  Surprising as the restaurant is very spacious with a full second floor for dining.  I would, however, always sit downstairs as I LOVED the open kitchen.  It goes beautifully with space and those tables to the back of the room get a great view of the action while still having privacy.On to the food ... the menu is full of experimental tales on classical dishes so if you're looking for traditional this is not it.  The fancy experimental (plus location and decor) do drive the price up so be prepared to pay a good penny for food.  That said food is pretty good.  The dressing on the Shishito peppers is out of this world! I could have these forever!  The rest of the dishes I had (tuna tartare and sticky rice tamal with duck) were reasonably good.  I loved the duck topping on the tamal, but much prefer my traditional corn tamal.All in all, I would come back to try other dishes, but would reserve this for when I'm craving fancier Mexican food.",0,0,0,Marines M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,42,15

The corn taxi dessert was also interesting, kind of small though-- can be finished in 3 bites.The pastrami tacos were OK, they came out kind of cold.

4.0,2/17/2019,"My girlfriend and I went there for dinner. We started with margaritas and guacamole with seven salsas. Unfortunately, margarita tastes almost like pure liquor to us ;(. The salsas were quite good and provide a full range of flavors from sweet to spicy. But be aware as three of them were decently spicy and may not be as enjoyable as the rest. The chips were full of corn flavor themselves, which was very to our liking. The coriander in guacamole really added a kick into the flavor. As a coriander lover, I found it perfect. My girlfriend does not like coriander in general but did not quite notice it either. In short, we both really loved this dish.Next, we had the octopus taco. It was packed with flavor, thanks to the amazing sauce. However, I did find the tortilla and the octopus were both a bit too dry. I think it would be better if they could keep moist. For the main course, we had the crispy pork belly and the skirt steak. They both had a bit of spicy taste in them. To me, the skirt steak was very tender; however, the plating was naive and I found the steak a little too salty. Fortunately, the pork belly had a great presentation. The mint and the beets truly added flavors as well as textures. I had fun exploring different elements of this dish and was fairly pleased. At last, we ordered the corn ice-cream taco and the banana ice-cream. The banana ice-cream looked like a piece of butter sitting on some dark chocolate but the taste was much better. Banana flavor with a touch of jasmine worked well together. The corn ice-cream had a great idea behind it. It tastes fine to me but sadly not to my girlfriend. Though improvements could be made, I would say we were pleased with this dinner and would love to go back to explore more.",0,0,0,Carlton Y.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,0

The falafel tacos were a joke. 2 teeny tiny very dry and flavorless falafels on each taco, again no sauce. The flan dessert with lemon sorbet was very good and the dragon margarita my lunch date said was slamming. Although the space was gorgeous and staff were courteous and attentive, I really went there expecting to have a nice meal - after all, that is the point isn't it?

For entrees, we got three different tacos - the grilled chicken, the steak and fried fish tempura. We definitely favored the steak out of all three but enjoyed all of the choices. For dessert we tried a couple of things: the avocado dessert, the banana ice cream and the chocolate flan. Out of the three dessert options, our favorite was the banana ice cream.

Favorite was the salsa verde. Now for the dessert, I ordered the avocado ice cream and the corn taco. The avocado was a hit, everyone at the table thought it was uniquely delicious. Also the entire dessert was edible outside of the plate. However the corn ice cream taco could've been maybe just a bit bigger. It was literally too tiny to share with anyone. I didn't think it would've been that small a dessert, perhaps 2 on a plate would've been better. Despite the size, it was tasty, if only everyone else could've experienced it.And of course the margaritas were delicious.",3,0,3,John T.,"Queens, NY",321,438,529
4.0,1/2/2019,"This restaurant came recommended by friends who I was visiting one weekend in NYC. Since this restaurant is mid-town and fairly walkable (and not too far from the subway) it is fairly convenient to get to.This place is tastefully decorated and has both an a la carte and a prix fixe menu. We had reservations, but in any case the restaurant has plenty of seating with a ground level and upstairs also, and also a private room too. The prix fixe was well executed - since the restaurant is Mexican there are a lot of tacos! I had the quinoa and endive salad (very good), the falafel soft taco (okay-good) and the ice cream for dessert. They had some other more unusual dishes too such as the sand-shark taco (I was not feeling too adventurous, but maybe next time) and a pumpkin cheesecake (I tasted some from  friends and it was delicious!)Very nice, hip place - although next time I would probably order a la carte as I was still hungry after the prix fixe!",0,0,0,Yasmine B.,"Arlington, VA",8,233,571
4.0,1/1/2019,"You can, and should, come here to sample the entire dessert menu -- a plethora of astounding desserts that bring a sense of Willy Wonka wonder. The avocado and lime granita is such a playful dish, visually and tastefully exciting. The corn tacos hit you with corn flavor in fresh, toasty, and creamy variations. Truly one of the more special experiences in the city, at least when it comes to dessert.",0,1,1,Edward J.,"Brooklyn, NY",135,279,4
4.0,1/1/2019,"I'm so sad I only got a chance to go to Empellón on New Year's Eve because only a prix fix menu was available and I wasn't able to try all their food. However I did get the guacamole and seven salsas. The guacamole was very fresh and seasoned well. The seven salsas were all so different but I really liked the spiciest one which I thought was mango habanero. The chips were also fried well and not stale but there is a steep price tag of 21. I also got the queso fundido which was an interesting dish. It was like melted mozzarella with beef tartare and some crunchy thing on top. You has to scoop it into soft corn tacos. I liked it a lot! However the star of the show was the steak taco. It was so tender and juicy and melted in your mouth. I didn't like the fish taco that much. The pomegranate margarita was also good. For dessert, there was the avocado dish which I didn't like but the concept was really cool. They made avocado and paired it with a lemon lime sorbet and yogurt. It was best eaten together but I still didn't like the taste of it. The biggest letdown was the ice cream taco. It was the smallest thing in the world and it was 8 dollars, I rather get a choco taco from the grocery store. I didn't like the corn ice cream, it was way too buttery for me",0,0,0,Janice S.,"Flushing, NY",0,24,13
3.0,1/1/2019,"This is a review of the New Year's Eve experience. Great decor, nice music, good vibe. Not super exciting or loud, but if you're here with friends and family it's nice and low-key. It wasn't the most exciting place to be--many people left before midnight. The food is decent. Not too bad, but also not that great. The best items were definitely the dessert (avocado was good and so was the chocolate mousse). However, they ran out of 1 of the 3 entree options (the monkfish), with no alternative substitutions, which I find pretty unacceptable when you are charging $125 for a 3 course menu with limited options. The waiter wasn't even very apologetic about it. The portion sizes were small so maybe eat a dinner before hand if you have a later seating--for some reason, I just assumed that I would be full from the meal, but I was definitely still hungry (and they close the kitchen down). I also understand that it's NYE and the staff wants to go home, but they were definitely in a rush and we felt very pressured to leave by 12:30 or so. The waitstaff clearly did not want to be there and were not very friendly. Overall, I would not recommend Empellón for NYE, especially given the price. If it was like $75 or so, I'd be more forgiving for not even having my entree choice, etc., but at $125 it's just not a good value.",0,0,0,Michael C.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,182,0

These were okay, but had little to no alcohol in them. For $18 I'd hold off and order wine. We later got glasses of Malbec which were much better. As for entrees, we ordered the bacon tacos and fish tacos, which I would definitely recommend.

The sides - brussel sprouts were good but the shishito peppers were not even cooked through.

Very fast if time happens to be a concern. Regarding food: the guacamole is wonderful! They offered 7 different dips ranging from mild to spicy. They are both beautiful and tasty. We tried the octopus taco, black quinoa salad and duck sticky rice. I listed them in the order of my preference, which interestingly aligns with the level of creativity of the dish. The duck sticky rice could be inspired by a Chinese traditional dim sum called sticky rice chicken. For Chinese audience, they put duck on top instead of inside the sticky rice, exactly like the difference between baozi and pizza if you may. Overall, love it!

5.0,11/21/2018,"I was craving Mexican food and found Empellón through an article on Thrillist titled ""The 16 Best Mexican Spots in NYC"". They were not wrong to include Empellón on this list. Empellón has a prix-fixe menu for lunch (choice of an appetizer, tacos and dessert), which I thought was a reasonable deal at $38. We were hungry so we ordered from the prix-fixe menu (King Salmon, Skirt Steak Tacos and the Pumpkin Flan) and we added several other items off the a la carte menu (Crab Nachos with Sea Urchin Queso, Smoked Black Cod with Potato-Chorizo Vinaigrette, Fish Tempura Tacos with Lime Mayonnaise, and Chicken with Goat's Milk Yoghurt Tacos). We finished up with the Corn Ice Cream Tacos and the Pineapple with Pillonccillo, Bee Pollen and Chamomile Ice Cream. The stand-out dishes of this meal were the Smoked Black Cod, the Fish Tempura Tacos and the Pineapple dessert. The potato-chorizo vinaigrette added an incredible burst of flavor to the smokiness of the slices of cod, half of which were seasoned differently from the other half. The fish tempura was deep fried perfectly and the earthy flavors of the corn tortillas and batter balanced out the creamy acidity of the lime mayonnaise without overpowering each other.The Pineapple dessert gets its own paragraph because it was a truly special dish. The dominant flavors are honey, chamomile and brown sugar (from the Pilloncillo). The pineapple ring that appears in the dish is actually a reconstructed pineapple which tastes like candied pineapple chunks held together with a thin crust of brûlée-d sugar. The flavors of the bee pollen and the Pilloncillo lent a unique flavor to the dish. Lastly, our server (Stephen) deserves a shoutout for making sure we had a thoroughly enjoyable meal. Besides the suggestions for what to order, the tortilla chips in our nachos were stale the first time around, so he had the kitchen send us a new one and took it off of our bill along with the pineapple dessert.We will definitely be back here soon!",2,0,0,Adrian A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,22,86

This is a two story Beehive anchored by an open kitchen where you can watch the crew mad dancing like a Bolshoi rehearsal. There is a long Bar that greets you when you wander in, but you'll never get close enough to the to shout your drink request. Make a sign at home and hold it over your head asking for the Bar Menu and hope for the best. The decor compliments the space. Pendant fixtures drip a low light glow on the show and the earthy tones if you came for the feel in addition to the food. (Me? I can enjoy a real feel at my own crib. I'm here now for the chow). The Decor, the floor show, all good. The Food...really good.  The Staff: Couldn't care less downstairs (Host excluded). Upstairs they couldn't do or care more. A platoon of Pros. Moral: Go up to eat up. The upstairs dining space is above the melee, civilized and you get to look down at the Ant Farm below. Caveat: Find Ozzy, and sit wherever he is working/serving.  The Vibe: Downstairs...Ants. Upstairs, your Aunt. Mostly 6 digit incomers willing to drop 5 of those digits on Brett Kavanaugh Beach Party Food. I have to say, just have a gnaw and be amazed at what comes out of the kitchen as opposed to your high school history. The Bar: The Signature Cocktails are listed in a loose leaf binder like the notes you filched from someone who knew the stuff cold in Chemistry Class. You'll recognize many of the same ingredients, too. A Devil's Margin had Avua Cachaca, (new Trojan Defensive Tackle)  Ginger Beer, Lelay Cassis, and Compari. This kitchen sink arrived in a tall glass with a metal straw. The management wants to save the environment and help you relive your 21st in some dark Tiki Bar at the same time. This bad ass drink was as strong as an Inca Trail Porter. It was a Vermouthy Sangria-esq cleanse even though it had nothing to do with either and was a perfect first round to pair with the bar bites. (Which are better than Porter bites.)After that I tried the Living Still Life. Good thing I'm still living to write about it. Leopold New York Apple Whiskey, Fino Sherry, Egg Whites, and Lemon all mixed up together. It was total refreshment and with the extra wide steel straw you can really get a super suck to gin up the festivities or stroll downstairs and blend your bender into the blender. The Food: Ahora estamos hablando! Who woulda thunk that Tailgate Take-a-Way or a Baby Shower Brunch Buffet could be elevated to such lofty heights? But here it is. The Latin (nee Mexican) feast awaiting you will turn a Frat Party into a Tails and Gowns Pinky extended soiree. Crab Nachos with Uni had loads of Crab and nodes of Uni. Caveat: Like all things that have a Nacho in it, eat like a hungry Hamster as the chips go limp quick. (Any Donald And Stormy reference is purely coincidental.) The thin slices of Jalapeno gave it a last trimester baby kick of heat. Nice dish, this. The Queso Fundido had Steak Tartare (although I didn't find it), and chopped Cornuts. (I found all of those). Wowser, this was addictive. With house made steamin' hot Tortillas, Salsas it was truly terrific. Melted Cheese and chrunchy things, it had all my favorite food groups in a bowl. Caveat: Eat it fast before your companions discover how damn good it really is. The Sticky Rice Tamal with Red Chili Duck was not a dish to duck. Go out of your way to have it. The brick of Sauced Rice was forearm thick and as dense as Pence. Wildly delicious. The Chopped Cabbage Salad with Roasted Fava Bean Dressing came as a perfectly formed disk the size of a Frisbee. Too pretty to eat, I ate it.  This was a Master Class of all chopped salads, The Cabbage was crisp and the perky creamy dressing will eliminate any stressing over if ordering it was the right choice. Here my voice. You chose wisely. A brace of Tacos rounded out the meal and my belly. The kitchen ain't stingy, either. Saucer sized tacos (two to an order) were generous to say the least.  The Rueben Taco had a pile of lean Pastrami with Kraut, Whole Grain Mustard, and Melted White Cheddar. Think J-Lo does Netanyahu. The Tempura Fish Tacos were way better than anything you'll get at Mikawa, Tokyo's Temple of Tempura. The added Slaw and Salsa were wonderful and the coating was so crunchy I'm gonna have to have my crowns checked.  The Falafel made me falafeel good. Jerusalem hits Jalisco. If this restaurant was in LA it would take 60 days to snag a table. Wait a minute, it took 60 days to snag this table in New York, and rightfully so. Make the effort.

3.0,10/4/2018,"Service is polite and efficient without being intrusive. The food was at times pedestrian and over salted and other times inedible. On order: crab nachos, brussels, tartare quest, and short rib. Nachos were too lightly dressed with crab to command the $30 price tag and the corn chips themselves were cold. Sprouts were fine, but the balsamic soy (?) glaze was a bit heavy on some of the dish. Queso in theory sounded amazing but was nearly inedible. The crackling topper overwhelmed the dish and the cheese lacked any flavor. The cheese was also congealing by the time it made it to our table so fundido it was not. Short rib presentation was messy and the actual dish was drowning in salt. We've gone to Empellon before and loved it. Maybe we ordered the wrong items or arrived to close to closing but things were just off.

5.0,9/29/2018,"Mmmm, what an amazing ""taqueria."" I put it in quotes because it's much fancier than a standard taqueria, but still classified as one online. The chef truly does an amazing job with flavor combinations. My boyfriend is picky and he literally loved every single thing we ate. I thought this place was fantastic!! The ambiance, the food, the service, everything was just awesome! I really can't wait to go back. We had the guacamole and seven sauces of goodness, the second and third spiciest as well as the green salsa were my faves. So delicious. I really really enjoyed them. Topping the chip with some guacamole and a dab of any sauce is key! Then we had the queso fundido with beef tartare and boy it was absolutely awesome. They serve it with tortillas and the beef tartare is in the queso with corn nuts on top which added a really nice crunch. I really loved this app. What a great creation. We also had the Brussels sprouts which had awesome flavor and were charred so nicely!! We had the hash brown tacos and I'd eat them everyday for breakfast if I could! Truly a great meal and a delicious ice cream sandwich for dessert also.For more food pics - check out my Instagram @exploreations",2,0,0,Jessica G.,"Larchmont, NY",86,155,445
5.0,9/28/2018,"Had the pleasure of enjoying the prix-fixe lunch here this week with my team and was blown away by the beautiful plating and the flavorful food. We started off with guacamole to share which comes with the beautiful selection of 7 different salsas / sauces, arranged from least to most spicy. Although I'm a hot sauce fiend, I fell in love with the mild yet nuanced cashew sauce at the very front of the sauce selection. The guac is pretty standard but tastes very good paired with the salsas / sauces and the tortilla chips are freshly made which I always appreciate. I would say though that $21 seems quite steep for the size of the guac. For my appetizer I got the King Salmon with trout roe. It was gorgeously plated. Usually I don't take pictures when I'm eating with colleagues cuz its a little embarrassing but it was so beautiful I couldn't resist. The creme dots around the salmon was almost reminiscent of cream cheese and I loved the little pops of trout roe throughout the salmon. For the entree, I got the Octopus tacos which were very tender legs (crispy toward the ends) with salsa verde and celery & celery leaves. To be honest, I thought the octopus was too tender for my liking in a taco. I can see why they added celery to give it more differentiated texture but it fell flat of the oomph I expected. I may have been happier if it was a chewier octopus leg? Who knows. Either way, the octopus was very well executed and would be a star if it were served alone. For dessert I got the wild sounding grape sorbet with ginger while the rest of my coworkers opted for the chocolate ice cream bar. Now, I know what an ice cream bar is so I wanted to try something new and crazy. When our desserts arrived, all of my coworkers looked at my plate with envy as the ""sorbet"" ended up being a beautifully plated cake-like dessert with lightly gingered ice cream surrounding a thin layer of grape jam with a nice crunchy meringue like cookie at the bottom. Their ice cream bars were pretty standard, run of the mill looking, but I'm sure it was delicious too. We dallied a little at our table after lunch to wait out the rain but the waitstaff was gracious and professional throughout our stay. Overall, very surprised at how much I enjoyed this meal. Even more so because I didn't pick up the bill :)",0,0,1,Kaitlin C.,"New York, NY",24,73,170
4.0,9/27/2018,"Found!Straight from the West and East Village comes this lively and innovative Mexican spot. Founded by Chef Alex Stupak who was the pastry chef at WD-50 (the Goldman Sachs of chef training programs); he certainly has an appreciation for the drama of food without losing sight of the flavor.

3.0,9/17/2018,"I really wanted to like this place but had a lot of trouble getting over the amount I was paying for the quality of the flavoring. I hate diving right into negatives though so I'll start with a few positives.The service was very good. Almost incongruous with the casual nature of that cuisine historically. This is a good place to bring well to do parents who want to feel like they are having ""off beat"" food but don't want to do so in a LES hipster hole. The inventiveness of the food was also admirable. You have to respect someone for actually being able to make a pastrami taco tasty! But we were disappointed that not much else lived up to our expectations. Also the atmosphere was somehow incongruously stuffy for how playful the menu was. Something that we had even more trouble reconciling when the bill came. If you are hungry for delicious tacos, there are way better places to go. If you are hungry for steak, There are way better places to go. But if you are stuck in midtown and don't feel like traveling far, have a drink at the bar and say you went. Because the drinks were our favorite part. AMAZING tequila selections and fun menu items.",0,0,0,Al R.,"New York, NY",19,91,76
5.0,9/13/2018,"This is honestly probably my favorite Mexican-influenced restaurant in the city. There is just a wonderful vibe here with an open kitchen. Everything feels pretty fancy, the presentation of the dishes are really nice, and the food is spot on. I've only been here for lunch, but both times expectations were exceeded. The guac is nothing special, but the different salsas you get to try give you a fresh take on the gauc and chips. The chips themselves are crisp and just salty enough, without the excessive oil or dryness. The tacos are unique and each time they have been executed very well. It is probably one of the more expensive restaurants in the Mexican category, but I think there's enough here that its well worth it.",6,4,7,Lu H.,"New York, NY",294,570,1967
4.0,9/8/2018,"We all know that nagging feeling when you're debating whether to go to a buzzy Midtown mega-restaurant: Am I just an adorable-yet-foolish sheep running into a pricey pen with mediocre eats?I definitely had that discomfort when I booked Empellon, but after a thoroughly lovely Sunday night meal, all my angst was a distant memory.Most surprisingly, the meal ended up being affordable -- if you're a fairly light eater and don't feel the need to splurge on A5 Wagyu beef, you can fill up for a very fair price. Yes, you'll probably spend anywhere from $14 to $22 for two tacos, but they're substantial tacos, not to mention delicious. The wine list caters to high rollers, but it has plenty of options for the hoi polloi.Most importantly, the meal was a brilliant combination of fun and fine dining. The servers are pros all the way and not the least bit snooty, and many of the dishes -- from the chips with guacamole and seven salsas, to the seasonal fruit dessert assortment -- are just flat-out good times. In closing, ""Empellon"" means ""shove,"" and if you're on the fence about stopping by this hotspot, I hope this review helps push you over the top to book a table.",20,10,19,Jeff O.,"Manhattan, NY",274,278,702

The food doesn't  disappoint as well. I love the gauc, the crab and uni nachos. Fish tempura tacos and octopus tacos were also amazing.  The portion for their mains are huge, so be careful if you want to order Main, making sure you share and don't go crazy on starters. Or just like what we did,skip main and stick with starters and tacos. The avocado dessert is very instagramable, the taste was not bad.The service was very good. The price is also not cheap here.

3.0,8/20/2018,"I want to give the place a 4 due to the bartender service, nice guy and wants to be helpful and the decor is modern and clean lines make it pleasant.The food is where I find it to be lacking.Ordered the guac and chips, comes with an array of different sauces. This is a ""hit"". Would go great with cold beer as an app.Ordered the shrimp, 4 of them, and the short ribs confit. Both had glaring issues. The shrimp at $9 a pop better be amazing and these were barely edible. Over-salted with rock salt and overcooked. Just a failure. I recommend finding another way to use these beautiful shellfish. The short ribs, cooked very tender and as a dish,presentation is good and textures were good but heavy-handed with the cumin. I find cumin that is not blended with other spices tends to be one-dimensional. It can be too dominant. This dish was saved by the delightful corn tortillas. The best food in the country and best talent can be found in NY, you have got to be on your game. I find that what I had needs to be reworked or altogether eliminated as menu options.

5.0,8/16/2018,"Came back solely to have more desserts, but found a few gems along the way. Crab Nachos with Sea Urchin ""Queso"" (5/5): I am still dreaming about these nachos. The best mix of high-low, sea urchin blended into the velveeta-like cheese sauce, topped liberally and evenly with sweet crab and little chunks of sea urchin. Pricey but so worth it for how much seafood you get. I wanted to lick the plate! Chopped Cabbage Salad with Toasted Fava Bean Dressing (4.5/5): similar to a caesar but I much prefer the flavors in this non-boring hearty salad. That creamy dressing is so tasty, and there's a lot of texture going on. Pastrami Tacos with Mustard Seed Salsa (4.5/5): why hasn't this been done before? Swapping out the rye bread with fresh tortillas is a fun take on a pastrami sandwich, piled high with legitimately great pastrami and plenty of wholegrain mustard. Short Rib Confit with Picadillo Garnish (4/5): the picadillo part comes in the form of sweet raisins and aromatic vegetables - another interesting way to present a taco. There's enough to make 4-6 tacos. Corn Ice Cream Tacos (5/5): I absolutely had to get this again and it's still one of my favorite desserts. Avocado (4/5): caved into the instagram pressure and was delighted by how sophisticated it really was. It reminded me of key lime pie with the creamy mousse brightened up by icy refreshing sorbet. Worth trying once.Fruit for the table (5/5): a dessert that lets you play with your food! 7 different ways of using the seasonal fruit, all very creative and tasty. We clearly overordered this feast for 2 people (blame it on the margaritas), but I was very happy with my leftover short rib the next day.",4,2,3,Lillian Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",462,285,1300

For $16 it is a little hefty price wise but it's meant for sharing and the place is really nice. So, what exactly is this dessert? The actual ""avocado"" is a mix of avocado (duh), lime purée, and whipped cream. It's then molded to look like an avocado and is placed on eucalyptus yogurt and surrounded by salt (yes, I said salt on a dessert). I feel like it would either be a hit or a miss for most people- it was definitely a hit in my book. It strongly resembled a key lime pie to me (given the tanginess, sweetness, and creamy texture to it) but it was also unique due to the salt ""rim"" which I actually thought made it more refreshing.

2.0,8/8/2018,"I've been to this place on three occasions now, mainly because it was convenient for the folks I was meeting who work nearby.  Each time there have been three or four members of staff congregated in the doorway, talking to each other.  One hosts and one hangs coats/bags, the others just continue to talk (or be on their phones on occasion) so I've no idea what they are doing other than looking pretty... The food is on the whole pretty good, but highly over-priced and prices seem to keep rising- the guacamole, (which is delicious) is absolutely tiny in size and is now $21! It's barely enough to feed one person.The chopped cabbage salad is much more appetizing than it sounds - give it a go. Being pescatarian I cannot comment on the meat dishes, but I made the mistake of ordering the falafel tacos once - trust me - don't.  They were the driest, most tasteless falafels I have ever eaten - I've honestly had far better from a street vendor.  Not the standard I would expect from a restaurant of this caliber or price point.The music is deafeningly loud, making it near impossible to hear who you are speaking with - if I wanted to go to a concert or club I would - it's dinner people - turn the music down!The service is highly variable, which I find incredibly irritating, particularly when there seems to be an inordinate amount of staff standing around talking.  It's very hard to get someone's attention (perhaps due to the music?!) There used to be a good bar staff there, who really knew their craft and encouraged you to try new drinks (I highly recommend Casa Dragones tequila),  but this seems to have changed, with new, young and inexperienced staff, which I think drags down the tone of the establishment greatly.  This might be a little picky - but I also sat at the bar once and my stool back was loose with a screw sticking out that I caught my hand on - health and safety issue anyone?!  To be fair I didn't mention it to anyone at the restaurant, but quality furniture should be a given if you're paying $25 for a glass of champagne...All in all, for the prices you pay and the average service I would say try elsewhere - Cosme and La Esquina provide a superior quality of food and much better atmosphere.Management, perhaps if you had less staff who appear to be doing very little then you could adjust the prices down somewhat?",0,0,0,Victoria F.,"Stirling, United Kingdom",0,20,4

They have 8 types and you can always swap Tequila for Mezcal (if you haven't tried it you have to!).- Guacamole with 7 salsas ($21): love that they tell you what each sauce is.- Octopus Tacos with Celery and Salsa Verde ($22): soooo good!! Get it!Overall great place, I only took one star off because there is no chicken in the menu (not one taco!) and because it is pricier than the other locations (don't blame them cause rent here is much more $$).",1,0,1,Daniela G.,"Manhattan, NY",95,130,418

4.0,5/22/2018,A great Mexican establishment! I ordered the guacamole with chips and it was accompanied by seven sauces that each added a new world of flavor to my appetizer. The steak tacos were also amazing; it was somehow chewy and melt-in-your-mouth at the same time. And definitely do not skip the dessert - the tres leches with popcorn was one of the best and most unique versions of the dish I had ever seen. I was sad the portions weren't bigger,0,0,0,Matt M.,"Philadelphia, PA",253,80,160
1.0,5/21/2018,"FOOD POISONING. I have never had such bad experience at the restaurant that was on top handled so poorly by management. I go out a lot for business dinners in the city and have visited this establishment before. Naturally, avocado desert was memorable so I decided to take my family there for Mother's Day this year - it was me, my mother, my husband and my 1 and a half year old son. We opted for prefix brunch so we can try multiple things. One of the items was salmon tartare which I don't eat but my husband and mother had it. My mom got sick in the car on the way home, my husband lasted a bit longer but was literally incapacitated by by the time we got back home about 2 hours after. Bad food poisoning with everything that accompanies it. After I saw my husband get that sick I realized it was not a accident. I called the restaurant and spoke to the manager Chris who was less than understanding and stated ""that he can't verify my complain"" and was basically annoyed. After I described in detailed what happened, he offered me a gift certificate to come back - which was not something I was willing to entertain at that time, as you can imagine. He promised to have his general manager call me next day to ""explore other options"". It has been over a week and I m yet to hear from anyone. What a shame for such establishment - we are never coming back to any of the 3 locations! Not my choice to pay $250 for food poisoning ever again.",0,0,0,Irina S.,"Astoria, NY",1,4,0
4.0,5/15/2018,"I tried Empellon's downtown locations several years ago and had a hit-or-miss experience each time. I was not eager to try the midtown location but I did keep it on my list. Finally an opportunity came up and I had dinner there. I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked everything coming out the kitchen. It's an interesting menu that appears to be Mexican-influence, not authentic, cuisine.Started with the Guacamole with Seven [interesting] Salsas and the excellent Crab Nachos with Sea Urchin ""Queso"". I could've eaten multiple orders of the crab nachos - so balanced with flavors, not salty, and so delicious!Also tried the shareable order Smoked Black Cod pieces with Potato-Chorizo Vinaigrette. I think if you're looking for a light dish light on flavors this would suffice - not a standout item but it's ok. Tasted fresh, high quality. The roasted prawns with the addictive chintestle is messy to eat but delicious.Went a little wild on the tacos - got tacos with thick cut bacon and also tacos with octopus. They were  different and they were good! They were flavorful, and again high in quality.The skirt steak with Persian onion salad was ok. I think the dishes with seafood, albeit inconsistent on flavor profiles, are the best items to get.For desserts tried the chocolate mousse and the famous avocado dessert. The latter was the favorite . Don't be fooled by the visual image of avocado. It's really an excellent dessert with lime, olive oil, and eucalyptus yogurt.Overall, a pleasant dining experience in an upscale setting for Mexican-influenced fare",0,0,0,Rose I.,"Manhattan, NY",105,441,3759

The custard and lime ice make such a great combination, so definitely eat this before the ice melts. The portion is big so I would split this with two or three other people.Corn ice cream taco ($8) - also really great and I love the use of corn throughout. It's on the sweeter side so I would definitely get this if you like sweet desserts more than sour-sweet ones. Note that this is quite small.Tropical fruit ($8/person) - really pretty but honestly wasn't super wowed by this. This is a bed of ice with eight different kinds of fruit, and it's much lighter than the rest of the dessert options. The coconut meringue, lychee with lime, and dragonfruit-mezcal capsule were my favorites.

For dessert we shared the avocado and the ice cream tacos, both of which were soooo amazing.I wouldn't come back here though because the rest of the menu doesn't look that interesting to me.

4.0,4/22/2018,"This is a great place for small groups looking for a fun dinner. I decided to bring an old friend to dinner for his birthday here, and found the noise level a little loud in the cavernous space, but we still had an enjoyable night.  We both loved the food, and I'll definitely be bringing groups here in order to enjoy more of the menu. Though be warned that you may be sitting in very close proximity to other diners.Crab Nachos with Sea Urchin ""Queso"": deceptively light tasting for nachos, I could easily eat this briny appetizer for dinner at the bar during a happy hour, really, I could eat this anytime! Thinking about it now makes me want to pop back in now for an order.Octopus taco with celery and salsa verde: a single tender yet crispy tentacle rests on the corn tortilla with the celery and sala verde, lovely, but slightly overshadowed by the other items we had.pastrami taco with mustard seed salsa: a surprisingly generous chunk of tender pastrami made this an absolute pleasure. Why has no one else thought to throw pastrami on tortillas? I expected the mustard seed to be too much, but loved the flavor of this. This is the kind of food subversion that makes my stomach happy. (^. ~)Crispy Pork Belly with chicharron and herbs: sadly, we were not able to do this dish justice as we overloaded on everything else we had ordered, but you receive fatty pork belly in a chicharron bowl (smash!) with herbs, avocado and radishes with habanero sauce drizzled tableside. We should have eaten this with more tortillas, but just couldn't do it (mainly since we knew I'd be going dessert crazy later)corn with unpopped amaranth: crunchy, tart and spicy, I really enjoyed this side, and had we a bit more appetite, I'd definitely spoon this on top of everything.corn ice cream taco: I know this is everyone's favorite dessert, and enjoyed the sweet and salty contrast, but I was more in love with the other desserts. ""avocado"" dessert with lime, olive oil and eucalyptus yogurt.  Beyond the fun appearance, this was such a creamy key lime dream of a dessert. It truly looks like half an avocado resting in mounds of salt, but the tart creaminess with the citrus granita was rich and refreshing at the same time. This is so worth getting, and not just because it makes for a great photo.tropical fruit for the table (this changes seasonally and I'd come back happily for every version of playful light dessert).  I definitely see the WD~50 influences in this dessert:lychee with lime: as tiny as this was, I loved the combination of sweet and sour, wish I could have had more of this passionfruit dipped in acai - make sure you eat the entire piece in one bite, this one is....juicy. I enjoyed the tart flavor and the explosion in my mouthmango with red chile - perfect tiny bite of mango sprinkled with red chile, definitely a high class riff on the sliced mangos in chile sold streetside in sandwich bagspineapple with hoja santa - delicious, juicy and sweet, the hoja santa had a jelly like texture, very funcoconut meringue - my dining parter didn't enjoy this, but I loved thisdragonfruit-mezcal capsule - this tasted strangely like a tamarind popsicle to me, wasn't my favorite of all the tiny bitesgreen papaya with green chile - this was pretty, but neither one of us found this memorable, and had trouble describing the flavor except as nuttyguava raspado - a tart grown up icee, my friend wasn't a fan, but I thought this would be great in the summer.I definitely want to try the variations of fruit for the table every time they change it, and crab nachos every weekend!",2,0,2,Jennifer C.,"Flushing, NY",74,100,429

5.0,4/15/2018,"I wanted to do something special for my 500th review, and Alex Stupak impressing me must qualify. This is the fourth of his Mexican-influenced establishments I've visited, and I think this is the place where his vision makes the most sense. It's a little corporate, but it's anything but bland.The impressive bi-level space is accented with surreal art and sleek fixtures. Around 5:30 pm during our break in Angels in America, the space was pretty empty, but by the time we left about an hour and change later it was pretty buzzing. Would recommend a reservation for prime weekend hours.We did the pre-theater (well, mid-theater for us) menu, where you get a choice of starter, communal main dishes, and a choice of dessert. Two of us got margarita ($18)-- one Spicy Cucumber and one Saffron. The price reflects the real estate, though it was a good margarita with high quality ingredients.The seven salsas came out before our food. Several of these are great, most of these merely average, though it makes for a fun conversation piece.Starters came out quickly. Two of our party members did the cabbage salad, and while I made fun of them for being boring, this dish was actually exceptional in both flavor and texture. The sticky rice tamal with duck was good. My king salmon was one of the better tartares I've had in town-- great flavor on the salmon perked up with generous ikura and delicious gooseberries. Perfect plating. It doesn't get better than this, folks.As we had a party of 4, we got to pick two communal mains. Sea bream was good, with impressive plating and a nice textural balance between flaky fish, creamy sauce, translucent onions, and green tomato slices. Short rib was simply incredible. The meat was so tender, and the plate of what looked like random accoutrements worked so well. Jalapenos, raisins, and grapes, oh my! All wrapped up in a soft homemade taco.We tried all of the desserts due to our party size, but I would say you can do one dessert for every 2 people given the size. They're all visually impressive. The avocado is the most social media famous, and it was like a creamy key lime pie filling surrounded by refreshing citrusy ice. The banana ice cream could have been mistaken for a stick of butter, though it didn't deliver much flavor for me. The chocolate mousse is impeccably marbled and rich, though the chicory coffee granita is a bit of a jolt.My favorite dessert, though, was the pineapple dish. A single ring of caramelized pineapple was complemented by delicious drops of sauce and crunchy sugar and bee pollen. Upstaging it was a sphere of chamomile ice cream-- I would buy this by the pint. Although we were all stuffed by this point, we were fighting over the last bites.Service was uniformly excellent. Bathrooms are plentiful and clean.I was waffling between four and five, as not all dishes exceeded expectations and the pricing is sky-high, but my picky eater parents were raving and my friend declared it to be the best food she's had in New York. So I'll give it to you, Stupak.I don't think doing the prix fixe is necessary, as it's a lot of food.

3.0,4/14/2018,Average place in Manhattan.  Service was nice and easy reservation even at last minute around 9:30  on a Friday night.  Mexican influence food.  It's hard to make fine dining from Mexican food.  My kid felt like a taco so we went here for a late snack.  Nothing special in any of the dishes we had which included the mandatory guacamole whenever you come to a Mexican place.  Came with a variety of salsas ranging from mild to hot (7 total).  Broken taco shells for chips.  This was ok.  Queso fundido was not really anything other than present.  Not much flavor with the beef crunchy bits.  Came with fresh made tortilla which was the best part.  The salad consisting of fresh oranges and onions dressed with mint and a mildVinaigrette dressing was refreshing and actually good.  Nothing Mexican about it other than the cheese block in the center.  Steak tacos ok but again nothing special.  My kid ate the tortilla more than the meat from 1 of the 2 tacos. Had the Brussels sprouts which were good (as is standard in town). Dessert was a ice cream cookie packaged along with some after dinner drink (house special I think).  Again no need to go out of your way for these.  The margaritas was good with a spicy salt rim. Overall this place is ok for a guy trying to show a lady a good time.  The restaurant has a nice ambience and the food nicely presented with service.  But a bit spendy for just dining to get some quick food (175 after tip for he above listed). Probably not high on the list considering many other restaurants with food and cuisine more accommodating to high end unique preparation.  It's just hard to make high end Mexican food and it's not the restaurants or staffs fault.  It's just my own expectations of comfort Mexican food.,1,0,0,Jay V.,"Seattle, WA",10,234,220

5.0,4/9/2018,"Chef Alex Stupak has achieved something special at his super upscale version of a Taqueria. Stupak has successfully appropriated Mexican cuisine and created a menu for the pallet of sophisticated Manhattan diners. While some of the offerings at Empellón are the same as  those at the downtown versions of it namesake. Across -the-board the cuisine here represents a new kind of fusion that provides a really unique experience.Set In a sleek two story dining room -yes, in many upscale places there are still such things as dining rooms- the vibe is friendly albeit a bit formal.The hipsterish male servers wear suit jackets and their demeanor is somewhat theatrical. Our female server was charming and apparently very happy to be working here. Hopefully the fine people at the front of the house and on the floor are sharing their substantial gratuities (Empellón is expensive ) with their comrades behind the scenes.  Our table of four shared our dinner which was just the trick because because the sin of coveting thy neighbors plate would have resulted in much jealously and conflict had we not.The array of starters began with the Sea Urchin Nachos, a luxurious version of this American Tex-Mex favorite;Pastrami Taco's with Mustard seeds, a paean to NYC's Katz's  Deli - which was just wonderful; Sticky Rice Tamales with Red Chile Duck; and the beautifully decorated King Salmon with good berries and Pasilla mixe. This Lox rocked.The main dishes  were, Corn with Cotija Anejo, Sea Bream with Chaquiles Verde,and a plate of humongous roasted Prawns in Chili Oil. These prawns were no shrimps....some of the biggest we ever consumed.The deserts of Banana ice cream with Jasmine CajetaAnd the now famed -in the NYC desert Hall of Fame  btw right next to the Holocaust Museum  in Battery Park-Avocado with lime oil and eucalyptus yogurt. Both were extraordinary and hats off to Empellón's world-class pastry chef non other than owner Alex Stupak.Empellón is already a huge hit on the New York city dining scene so get on the bandwagon and go.Tip: Empellón is very expensive and if you go all in ,which is advisable based on this review, you maybe in for $200 per person with drinks desserts and gratuity.If you want to try this must do,they have a Prix Fixe offer on the weekends for about 50 bucks.

Paired with the excellent corn tortillas, it was something different than what I've previously had at other Mexican restaurants.  A quick note that the tortilla chips and salsa selection was a true highlight.We shared the pork belly and skirt steak entrees, which were both excellent.  The persian onion salad with the skirt steak in particular was great.  It had great flavor and had a great crunch.  The pork belly was perfectly cooked and seasoned well.  We celebrated a birthday and were provided a complimentary corn ice cream taco.  The ice cream had incredible corn flavor and was presented beautifully.  The service overall was attentive and quick as well.  A great, great modern Mexican option.",0,0,0,Ryan K.,"New York, NY",249,21,0

I enjoyed taking clients here a few times but I stopped because I felt like such a chump for throwing down hundreds of dollars here -- even despite charging lunch on the corporate card. @Empellon: I'm not sure how you came up with $39 for tacos as closer to $30 prix fixe is standard in midtown (for example: limani, avra madison, etc).

We got crab nachos (with sea urchin ""queso""), sticky rice tamal, fish tempura tacos, short rib confit, and two desserts (ice cream sandwich and corn ice cream taco)  Everything was very good. The crab nachos were as great as advertised. The duck that came on top of the tamal was excellent. The lime mayo in the tacos was great, although fitting the fish into the tortilla wasn't entirely easy. The tacos that resulted from the short rib dish were more structurally adequate, and the flavors really jumped. (We also thought the tortillas that came with this dish were better than the ones that came with the tacos -- weird, but maybe just a random thing.)The desserts were excellent, as expected. I'm not sure which I liked better, but the corn ice cream taco is obviously more unique. On the prices -- while I don't want to say this was all completely overpriced, it definitely is on the high-end of what could be reasonable. In the end, we really liked everything we got, the portions were pretty good, and I'd love to eat all of these dishes again (along with several others on the menu here, such as the king salmon or the pork belly). But I did find myself thinking that if Cosme or Atla were producing the same dishes, it would have been better, and I wouldn't even be thinking of the price. Almost every bite at those places is one of the best you can find in the city.

4.0,3/25/2018,"This was a near-flawless lazy Sunday lunch after a fast paced and hectic week. Perhaps I was ready to be spoiled, maybe for the first time in seven days my mind had slowed and I allowed myself the energy to concentrate on nothing but a meal. Regardless, this was quite the meal on which to concentrate!I believe my favorite plate was the first. The Sticky Rice Tamal was opened at the table, the leaf wrappings laid flat. A spunky Red Chili Duck ragout was spooned on top. The starchy rice was broken by the rich duck sauce. The combination was perfect. The Prawn was almost it's equal. Here, less effort provided equally interesting returns. A simple salted shallot (?) mix dropped over the top of a flawlessly prepared prawn.I also ordered the Octopus Tacos. Celery was curled atop, along with watercress, cilantro and a beautifully heated salsa verde. In total, I loved the result. I missed, however the individual taste of the Octopus. This minuscule point should not dissuade other's enjoyment. The dessert here demands a separate paragraph. I ordered the Avocado mousse, expecting something different. (Avocado is not typically found on dessert menus!) What I got defied expectations. The avocado was blended with Greek yogurt and scooped back into the mold of a half of an avocado and placed over a bed of lime ice shaving that resembled snow. Through the magic of food preparation, the mousse was ""painted"" to resemble a real avocado! It was food-based Trompe l'oeil! I was told that this is the most photographed plate in New York! Totally understandable. It deserves that accolade.Interestingly, they offer a few Ciders to accompany their meals. I tried the French Aval. It really worked as a nice compliment to the fully spiced foods. More and more, I am enjoying Cider as an alternative to wine or beer with a meal. It has a freshness the other lack. This is sophisticated food that owes much to humble meals.

Having just been back from a literally stomach wrenching trip to Mexico, this satisfies cravings. I could actually eat this without vomiting for days. Though, I ordered way too much and couldn't enjoy the full extent of the meal (I was starving when I ordered. Here's what I'd do again: 7 salsas (Smokey cashew was most unique, and addicting; chips themselves were sooo good), and crab uni nachos. I started reading the NYT review of this place while waiting for my full party but didn't finish it--shoulda read it all bc I did find the tacos unremarkable, but the dessert a totally new experience. Avocado dessert blew my mind. Not going to lie, the eucalyptus in it brought me back to the spin room at equinox, all sweaty treating my endorphins to a cold eucalyptus infused towel, haha. What I wouldn't do again: sticky rice tamale (bc I eat this stuff for under $5 from a Chinese deli) and hash brown taco--carb in a carb, and as waiter described it, it's exactly what you'd expect: hash brown in a taco.

I had the octopus tacos- very tasty, and my friend had the short rib confit. The margaritas (mandarin and pineapple) were also tasty- not too strong and not too weak.

We had the crab nachos which were room temperature and lacked flavor (we actually forgot there was crab in there). Then we had the fish tacos. The fish itself was perfectly fried however it was on a soggy tortilla. It made for some messy eating. We also had the beef short ribs. I almost cried. It was room temperature. There was a potential for this to be an excellent dish as the beef itself was moist and soft. However with a room temperature dish and all the topping that went on it, which were also room temperature, the flavors didn't get the reception it deserved.The experience was a very pricey one and left us so disappointed.

Our table sampled shares of the queso fundido with black truffles, the octopus, fish, and falafel tacos, and the cabbage salad, washing it all down with classic margaritas. The octopus tacos were my favorite, but I also enjoyed the cabbage salad. However, the queso fundido was disappointing and at $32, I wouldn't go for it again.While not the friendliest, the service was nonetheless satisfactory, in spite of the overlooked salad that only came out after I asked about it.I'd like to return for the sea urchin nachos, which hopefully wouldn't be as disappointing as the queso fundido.Ya veremos!",1,1,1,Rebecca G.,"Manhattan, NY",59,754,46

4.0,2/1/2018,"Calling Empellon ""Mexican food"" is like calling Kendrick Lamar ""just another rapper."" Both are rooted in their respective cultures, but they recenter the status quo to a point where it simply can't be boxed up and recognized with an inaccurate label. They've both elevated a product that no longer has the look and feel of their predecessors. Whether that's a positive is up to the consumer - some people like things just the way they are. But if you like your tacos safe and familiar, or your rap stale with a dollop of Bubba Sparxxx, you're probably best served dining elsewhere.If you're a first time visitor to Empellon, you're going to scoff at the sticker price. You won't find any two tacos under $14, and those are vegetarian (the hash brown tacos). Purists might reminisce of the 45 tacos they got for a peso during their last vacation to Tulum, but this isn't a foreign country and these aren't street tacos. These are a whole other species.I got the pastrami tacos with mustard seed salsa ($22), and they weren't like any other taco I've ever consumed. It was like Katz's and Los Tacos No.1 shacked up and made a multi-ethnic baby. It both was and wasn't ""Mexican food"" on its face, but it was tasty and I would get it again. You'll see a lot of similarly avant-garde items on their menu, and hopefully you have a good enough relationship with your accounts payable department to expense and enjoy them all. Don't miss their ice cream corn taco for dessert if you're a sweets person. It's received a lot of love in the people-who-take-pictures-of-their-food circles for good reason.

3.0,1/1/2018,"Empellón is fine for what it is - a trendy, upscale Mexican spot, great for dates or dinner with the girls when you want decent food in a cool venue but don't necessarily need it to be the best meal of your life. The menu isn't huge and it definitely lends itself better to sharing than ordering individual entrees. The chips with guacamole and seven salsas is a really nice app for sharing - and it's definitely picture perfect for those of you who are obnoxious about taking pictures of their food like I am. At $21, it's pricey, but the portion size is pretty big. I was pretty full after just sharing the chips with one other person. My two favorite salsas were the smoky cashew (totally unlike anything I've had before) and the spicy habanero (yum! definitely packs some heat but it's not overpowering). The rest were fairly average and we agreed the chips were too salty.The tacos are around $20 for an order of 2, which I thought was pretty egregious. We ordered the skirt steak tacos to share. They were fine but nothing exceptional - there was nothing on the taco besides the steak so we dressed them up with the leftover salsa. Some of the tacos are pretty creative (octopus, falafel, pastrami).We then split the short rib confit ($42) with picadillo garnish. It was absolutely delicious and the short rib completely fell apart in our mouths. Like everything else we had, though, I felt like it was notably overpriced.Next up we split the avocado dessert ($16), which is basically a custardy/yogurty dessert with key lime shaved ice. Neither one of us particularly liked the dessert, although the presentation was awesome. The wine/cocktail/beer menu is relatively limited but I was happy with my riesling. Cocktails will run you $19 per - but the menu seems cool. If I were going to go back, I'd definitely want to try one (or a few).Service was overly attentive. Our server had very poor timing and frequently interrupted us. We were admittedly dining slowly but I did feel very rushed.

So you better be comfortable yelling at your dining companion, because no matter what time of day you come here, it will be crowded and loud. The restaurant is extremely well decorated with homage paid to Dali and the Spanish surrealist movement with unexpected sculptures and a mannerist color palette. It's cool and weird but works. I love the food and would suggest starting with the salsa sampler which allows you to try about 10 different salsas ranging from baby spice to ohmygodthisishot. Something for everyone.

1.0,12/3/2017,"I came here for my birthday and left wishing I had never been born. Let's start with the drinks. The ""Por Que No?"" margarita was supposed to be tequila with pineapple juice, Serrano chiles, and cilantro. It was 90% pineapple juice. I immediately sent it back and got a mezcal margarita instead. That was better, but it was still not nearly good enough to command the $18 price tag. For starters, we ordered the crab nachos and the king salmon, only because we were disappointed to discover that review favorites such as the uni toast and lobster and cucumber were no longer on the menu. The $30 crab nachos came out room temperature and topped with stringy canned/fake crabmeat, not the lump crab you would expect for that price. That was sent back after a couple lackluster bites. The king salmon was good, but almost too cold, as though it has been made in advance and refrigerated for too long. When we sent back the crab nachos, we ordered queso fundido topped with steak tartare as a replacement. Before it came out, we spoke to the manager who apologized and assured us he was going to improve our experience. Unfortunately, the queso fundido arrived cold, tasting like poorly reheated Velveeta topped with Bacos. At this point, we officially gave up on Empellon and walked out of the restaurant.Not only was this a disaster of a birthday meal, but having been to Empellon Taqueria and Cocina (including having done the chef's table tasting menu) I came in with high expectations. The latest venture, however, is an enormous disappointment and I would not recommend it to anyone.",3,0,1,Michael S.,"Manhattan, NY",35,147,51
2.0,12/3/2017,"I really wanted to like Empellón but sadly our experience last night left much to be desired. Pros: -Decor on point -Ambiance is overall okay-Innovative food options, the beef confit and chicken rice are good. Cons: SERVICE: We were quickly shown to our tables once we arrived but that's where the extent of good service ended. - it took a few tries for the person who comes to give the menu to get our drink orders correct even though we had just ordered coke and beer. - after setting us up with drinks, it took approximately one hour for someone to come take our order. We kept asking each of the waiters, managers passing by our table to take our order and they kept saying oh one minute one minute and then never came. Uhhh, what? - about mid way through our meal someone who appeared to be a ""manager"" in a suit and a beard arrived and kept rushing us through our food with ""who wants the last bite"" and ""are we quite done with this one"" and ""should we clear now"" announcements literally every 10 seconds. We were catching up with a friend who's here to visit from Europe after months, so this was extremely annoying and rude - not to mention the fact that they took hours to take order and deliver food, and then rushed us through the meal. For this kind of a price point (approximately 100 dollars a person) this is not what can be expected. And it wasn't even like we were the last table to clear or they had follow up people to sit. It was the end of the night and there were quite a few tables still eating, including a large loud group of some work colleagues behind us who were yet to leave. We were confused and disappointed. - we ordered two desserts and received only one and the check with ""when you are ready"". We reminded this ""manager"" of the second dessert multiple times and he kept saying it should be here shortly...and then after we had finished the first dessert and was not willing to wait anymore, and saw that he hadn't included the second dessert in the check -- we realized that he hadn't at all meant to give it to us I guess. When I brought it to his attention and said we don't want it anyway here are our credit cards for payment -- he didn't even the courtesy to apologize and instead just said that settles it then. Again confused and disappointed, these people need some serious restaurant service training. - on top of all this, the much awaited Crab Nachos came to us with soft and soggy chips. Oy vey. No, I will not be returning and sadly can not recommend you to try it either. There are many other places in NYC that are much better options at this price range.",0,1,0,Angelique A.,"Manhattan, NY",10,107,62
4.0,11/29/2017,"We went to Empellon for a birthday dinner since we've had great experiences at the other spots in the Empellon family. This newest Empellon restaurant is in Midtown, and the feel of the restaurant definitely reflected that. While nicely designed, it felt a little more corporate, for lack of a better word. But the food was still delicious.They recommend that you order one item from each section of the menu (for the table, starters, sides, tacos, and mains), but we ordered 3 starters and 2 shared plates instead because we wanted to make sure we saved enough room to try their creative dessert menu. The shared plates were a little bigger than we anticipated though, so we probably could have ordered one less dish and been fine.First up was the guacamole with 7 salsas. We previously got this back at Empellon Cocina and really liked it. It's basically a salsa flight accompanied by some chips and a bowl of guacamole. It was all tasty and a good start for the meal, but I was a little disappointed that at some point over the years they switched out my favorite sikil pak salsa for a more plain roja.We also got the crab nachos with sea urchin queso. Topped with a plentiful amount of crab and urchin that really mimicked cheese, these would be an awesome and decadent bar snack. The sea urchin didn't have as much briny flavor as we expected or hoped for, but we would get this again.The 3 starters we got were the king salmon, the carrots with figs and queso fresco, and the sticky rice tamal with red chili duck. The carrot dish was my favorite of the three, and was so light and fresh. The tamal with duck was also very good, but very heavy because of all that rice.After all that, I was pretty full but trying dessert was a must here. We had heard great things about the corn ice cream tacos and seen lots of photos of the avocado dessert, so we got both of those. The avocado was really interesting but having tried it, I don't need to get it again. The corn ice cream taco, on the other hand, I could order over and over again.The last dessert we got was the apples, which were 8 single-serving apple snacks. I loved this, because it was like trying 8 different desserts in one (and I also love apple desserts). They were all good, and I now feel like we have to go back at a different time of year to see what they do with other fruits.Overall, our dinner at Empellon was a good experience. It's on the more expensive side so I don't see us going there for a full dinner on a regular basis, but it was good for a special occasion. Thinking our next visit might just be an order of crab nachos, corn ice cream tacos, and some bite-size fruit desserts.",1,0,0,Marissa L.,"New York, NY",15,221,485

4.0,11/21/2017,"This place definitely takes an interesting spin on Mexican cuisine. They have the seven salsas with guacamole and homemade tortilla chips which is a must whenever you dine here. It's a pretty pricey dish, but definitely worth it since they refill on the chips at no additional cost! They also have a lot of vegetarian dishes. The corn entree is extremely filling and amazing. The hash brown tacos were personally not my favorite, but my friends definitely enjoyed it. I enjoyed the fish tacos, however, they were not particularly life-changing. What brings this place to four stars is definitely the desserts. They have very cool and interesting takes on their desserts. Particularly with their avocado dish, which is like a key lime pie over some flavored ice/snow. The corn taco tastes very similar to the Momofuku cereal milk soft serve, which I know many people are already huge fans of. Also, they do this interesting take on seasonal desserts served many different ways-- I'd highly recommend trying one of these!

The chips were big and beautiful but tasted bland. Was not particularly impressed with any of the tacos and we ordered every single one except the octopus. For 14 -18 bucks they were nothing special. I get the restaurant was going for higher end and interesting flavors but it just didn't taste authentic nor particularly very good. Biggest disappointment was the fish taco which is generally my favorite. I did like the nachos with uni and crab but not sure if there was actual uni in it.

4.0,10/6/2017,"Hosted company event in the private space upstairs here on a Thursday night. So glad we did. They set us up with great wait staff, classic and cucumber margaritas, passed hors d'ouevres, a seven salsa with guacamole station as well as a trio of tacos. They were great about accommodating dietary restrictions (from virgin margaritas, veganism, no dairy/lactose intolerance, etc etc). On to the goods!Guacamole with Seven Salsas: 10/10The guacamole was fabulous! Perfect level of chunkiness and creaminess and spice. Love the large freshly made tortilla chips of varying sizes for dipping. The chips have enough weight to hold a good amount of guac without bending - major key. I didn't love every one of the salsas but there were so many that all tastebuds will be satisfied. My personal favorites trended on the hot side (I.e. habanero but with a special affinity for the smoked cashew version as well). The seven included: salsa roja, smoked cashew, verde, borracha, tomatillo-chipotle, arbol and habanero. They labeled each and placed them in order of mild to spiciest, which was really helpful (and unfortunately a thing that many other spots wouldn't think to do). Deconstructed Tacos:Again, tortillas were clearly fresh and house made. Light flavor paired well with variety of fillings. Chicken with chipotle: 8/10Very juicy (dry chicken is the worst amirite?!) and tastyFish Escabeche: 5/10Tasted ""fishy"" :/ Could've used a bit more spice but perhaps that can be cured with the addition of your favorite salsa. Mushrooms: 7/10Melange of mushrooms made a meaty meal. (Did you like that? I'm a nerd who LOVES alliteration. What are you gonna do?) Passed apps included:Oyster shooters (billed as just oysters, which threw us off): tasty but too ""adventurous"" for the majority of our group. Corn salad with cotija cheese: reminiscent of elote but missing the spice. Smoked plantain sopes: eh. Think the plantains should've been a bit sweeter to balance the smoke. Novel idea but fell a little short. These were presented with and without the crema for our anti-dairy friends. Chicken meatballs: for the gains crowd. Pretty delicious and diet friendly. Beef tartare tostadas: the tiniest and cutest of the apps. Good flavor but not life changing. Open bar packages start at $40/pp for two hours. Margaritas, Sancerre and Tempranillos on offer were all delicious.

Since I wasn't too hungry I just wanted starters and desserts. I was conflicted between two starters so I asked for a suggestion from the waiter. He suggested the King Salmon. I'm glad he did. At first I was a bit scared since there were many components to the dish but, It was the perfect blend of Spicy, tart, and creamy. The caviar on the top gave it a nice little bite. For dessert I had the strawberry 7 ways, while t was a tiny dish it was sophisticated and just the right amount. Each bite had a different texture and flavor profile. I must say I enjoyed it very much. Might I just add it was very inexpensive at only $7.Lastly I enjoyed the Avocado dessert. Again another beautiful plate to look at.

2.0,8/6/2017,"This is not Mexican food. It's fusion with the word ""taco"". For example, ""steak taco"" really is chopped steak with a cheese sauce and some other flavored sauce, which makes it taste like a Philly Cheese steak. The guacamole was expensive, and wasn't your Mexican chips with guacamole. The tortilla tasted like papadam (an Indian flat bread like a chip) and the ""salsas"", all 7 or so of them, tastes like a series of non-salsa items. Like curry, aioli mayo, bbq sauce, pureed spices. Such a waste of money and time. I'd rather eat at Cascabel Taqueria, which even isn't mind blowing, but at least better in every way except midtown decor.",0,0,0,KZ H.,"New York, NY",2,48,59
2.0,8/5/2017,"Went for dinner. Nice reception and pleasant table. Very sloppy, spotty service. Chips and pretty decent guacamole came out before the drinks. Then before we even had a chance to touch the chips out came the Tamale and the chicken and beef tacos all together. Talk about fast food. I sent back the tacos and asked them to send them  when we finished the tamale and the chips. They could have kept the tacos; both were very bland. The last bite of taco summoned the appearance of the pork belly main course and some very lightly roasted (they needed a little more blistering) shishito peppers. Pork belly was also a bit bland with a flavorless and unspicy Habanero (or at least that's what the waiter called it) sauce served with 3 bits of avocado and some greens on a slightly fishy tasting Chicharron base. The only thing interesting in that dish were the greens. Dessert, the Banana Ice Cream; we weren't going to waste another 14 bucks on a second one based on what we had up to this point, was actually very good. As was the coffee and my cocktails (some adaptation of a Dark and Stormy). Overall I'd wait to see if they get their act in order. For now go have a cocktail, the guacamole and a dessert.

4.0,7/30/2017,"The food is very good -- intricate and unusual enough in composition to make even standard dishes exciting, and yet not overly fussy. We had the duck/sticky rice and the golden beets as appetizers. The former was hearty and spicy, with a great texture. The latter was a bit too sweet, but paired well with the layer of icy coconuty layer that i can only describe as citrousy and hot (!). For the main course we shared the short rib, which comes covered in a variety of nuts, stuffed olives, and marinated grapes, all of which marry well with the meat, especially if you eat it altogether in the tortillas provided. The beans side dish was fantastic: smoky and brightened by pickled vegetables. For the dessert, we had the corn ice cream tacos and the strawberries sampler. Both were fine, but the strawberry gives you a chance to sample half a dozen different preparations, a few of which are great. On the downside, the beer selection is miserable. There are good Mexican beers out there. None are on the menu. Cigar City Jai Alai IPA is the only good one you're going to get. The music is a disaster in volume and variety. It's as if they had decided to strike a blow against elite dining by making you feel as if you were eating at a 4th of July BBQ for 20 year olds. Upstairs it's not great. Downstairs, you have to yell to be heard across the table.

The ambiance and vibe are wonderful (I loved the beautiful tile floors...there really was great attention to detail in the design and execution of the space) and it's followed up but outstanding service and killer food. The wait staff was extremely attentive without being overbearing and very knowledgeable about the cuisine. You can see them standing in an organized line next to the impressive open kitchen ready to shuttle out your dish the second it hits the plate.The chips and salsa are on almost every table and for good reason. The salsas are damn tasty and it's just fun to try all the different flavors. Adding the guac makes sense, so do that too. The melted cheese steak tar tar was a big hit with friends and an easy to share starter. I've also tried the scallop ceviche, chopped cabbage salad and spicy rice tamale and would happily order them again. All the tacos I've tried have been delicious so go nuts. The short rib entrée is super tender and one beefy piece of meat, best shared and very good.The desserts are also top notch. Stupak was a pastry chef at Alinea and before that Cleo in Boston (repping my old college town) The corn ice cream taco is awesome ... It's like a high end choco taco but may need some docle de leche for dipping to complete that childhood memory. All in, the restaurant is fantastic and even better considering it's in midtown where so many options fall flat, aren't as fun or as good.

In order of preference they are: short rib, corn ice cream tacos, corn, pork belly, crab nachos, and duck tamal. The one dish I would not get again was the cucumber with lobster because of how creamy/saucy it was. All the dishes were really incredible!!We were celebrating one friend's birthday and so we asked the server to please put a candle in the dessert. They mixed up which table had asked for this and they took a candle dessert to the table next to us accidentally ruining the surprise at our table.

There was no attempt to rush the process or offer a glass of wine while they asked us to wait. After we sat down, they rolled in (literally) three new tables for people who never arrived. Who is managing this place? The starter tacos were at best, acceptable. Two small bites, $16. The main courses were a mixed bag with the corn dish ($29) quite tasty and satisfying and the sea bream ($34) not successful at all. We did not stay for desserts.

Luckily, Kris turned things around and I recently gave the restaurant another shot. Long story short: weekends are dead with questionable service so stick to weekday meals (welcome to midtown corporate life, I suppose).Food: GET the spicy cucumber margarita, guac and salsa sampling, pastrami, sweetbreads and beef tacos, and corn ice cream tacos. SKIP the uni toast (rubbery egg whites), rainier salad (disproportionate cheese), octopus tacos (overwhelming peanut butter), and the devil's margin cocktail (just gross...despite my love for each of the ingredients separately).

The guacamole was perfectly spiced and the scallops can only be described as divine and dainty. We then ordered four types of tacos to share - hash brown, roast beef, chicken and fish. I tired the chicken and fish. Just lovely, fresh and flavorful. Our finale was the spare ribs. The meat was tender and melted in our mouths. I also tried the Devil's Margin cocktail and the spicy cucumber Margarita. The former is a twist on the El Diablo made with cachaca and a splash of Campari. Refreshing after a hot summer day. The spicy cucumber Margarita was also lovely, more sweet than tart with a very spicy rim. The ambience was gracious, with beautiful tile work, art on ledges and interior design. The bathrooms were a bit odd as they have only two and they are both unisex. The problem is that there is a front locking room for sink off of the also locking toilet room for each. It's confusing for lining up and would be better to be just two large bathrooms.

4.0,6/23/2017,"Having been to Empellon Al Pastor and Empellon Taqueria and really liking them, I had high expectations of the new Empellon flagship and decided to check this place out after hearing some good reviews. Since it's located in Midtown and I was here for a weekday lunch, the crowd is very different from their other two locations (very business-y, almost like a trendier but less moneyed version of the Four Seasons power lunch crowd). The food is superb. My friend and I split an appetizer order of two duck tamales and the chicken guisado and lamb sweetbread tacos. My favorite was the lamb taco - sweetbreads were really well-seasoned and not overcooked and also came with lamb barbacoa, which were equally delicious. The chicken taco was decent though I thought that the zucchini didn't really contribute much flavor . Tamales were also good but I would have liked the duck to be a bit more spicy (as they were described on the menu as ""red chili duck""). The dessert we got - chocolate mousse with goats milk shaved ice and cold brew coffee - was also quite amazing and a great end to our meal.",0,0,1,Honghui Y.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",84,190,84
4.0,6/15/2017,"KenScale: 8.5/10No chef has quite made an impact in recent years on the Mexican dining scene in New York City like Alex Stupak who started out as a pastry chef before opening up a series of Empellon restaurants pushing the boundaries of Mexico's versatile cuisine by focusing, among other items, on tacos. Compared to the more modest downtown restaurants, the latest Empellon restaurant in Midtown is sort of a coming out party for chef Stupak, with an ambitiously large two-story space and a menu that seems to have matured. I have visited Empellon Cocina in East Village (which has recently shuttered) a couple of times before and while I appreciated the novelty of modern Mexican cuisine, I also felt the essence of what makes Mexican cuisine great was somewhat lacking. In Empellon Midtown, I can say that the kitchen has arrived at that optimal point where you know you're getting Mexican food but with some unexpected twists here and there and makes your dining experience even more satisfying. When my wife Jun and I showed up at the dining space on a Sunday evening, chef Stupak was at the kitchen with vigilant eyes at the staff working on various dishes. He looked somewhat imposing to us, but the food at the new Empellon has definitely loosened up compared to Empellon Cocina, free from the constant creative pressure to bring something no one had thought of. After 30 years of my life, I have somewhat become tired of nacos and for health reasons try to avoid them unless I'm really starving. If the crab nachos with sea urchin ""queso"" are what I need to eat for the next 30 years, I certainly wouldn't mind. It was so delicious (in Jun's words, predictability so given the use of sea urchin) that I couldn't stop reaching my hands even after knowing that there are other dishes to come. Sticky rice tamales with red chile duck was also outstanding, and its portion perfect for a starter. Since we were at a taco master's restaurant, we had to try a couple, right? Jun and I slightly preferred the pastrami ones with mustard seed salsa over the one that came with lamb sweetbreads. We initially thought the pastrami might be too stuffy once we saw the enormous chunks of meat inside the taco shell, but the balance of flavor and texture in the meat was actually quite memorable, making us wonder why other chefs haven't thought about this concept before. By the time the short rib confit arrived, we were pretty stuffed but after tasting a piece of short rib, I knew I had to put this beautiful dish into tortillas and get some extra bites. The juicy meat with picadillo garnish on the side was just so magnificent that we decided to pack the leftovers even though we rarely do that at a restaurant. Everyone is talking about the avocado dessert at Empellon Midtown, so even though both of us were barely breathing at that point from eating, we still needed to try it. It was undoubtedly a show-stopper, with colorful blend of lime and Eucalyptus yogurt that gave, in chef Stupak's own word when he approached our table, a sensation of a delightful key lime pie. Not only was it beautiful in appearance (hence all the Instagram photos for the plate) but the complex yet refreshing flavor was absolutely wonderful. Getting a reservation wasn't too difficult and on a Sunday evening the second floor of the trendy dining space was mostly empty, making me wonder if the choice to go with a Midtown location was more driven by the objective of attracting corporate crowds during weekdays than locals looking for leisurely weekend meals. There is full bar with plenty of tequila and mezcal based cocktail options to complement your meal. I was pleasantly surprised by what Empellon Midtown brought to the table and would love to see how chef Stupak's kitchen evolves over time. It really has made a big statement in terms of presenting delicious Mexican cuisine that can please anyone no matter what dish you order.",7,2,3,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738
5.0,6/13/2017,"Empellón earns these five stars easily and gracefully. The atmosphere of the restaurant is trendy and happy. Upon entering, I was greeted by a hostess as she opened a huge glass door for me. At this point, I knew this was going to be a treat! I sat at the bar and was taken care of by Graham who really knew his stuff when it came to mixology and brews. Some might say he's a wizard but he humbly goes by bartender. Witty banter and quick service from him. He was able to pinpoint the kind of beer I wanted and my taste buds could never be happier! I started the night off with the Sticky Rice Tamales with Red Chile Duck. Being from California and my access to tamales and Mexican food of the likes; I was skeptical. Once I unwrapped those bad boy tamales, the smell of them seduced me and left me wanting more. After those delicious tamales were finished, we were greeted with Chopped Cabbage Salad with Toasted Fava Bean dressing. Can I say this? HOLY FUCKING SHIT this salad was monumental. I have never tasted a salad so delicious and it was secretly healthy for me which is a plus. Another server, Marsha, came by when we were done and had suggested to get the Crab Nachos with Sea Urchin ""queso"". Man, you wouldn't even realize that there wasn't any cheese on these nachos because they puréed that sea urchin so well and it was delicious. Thinking about crab nachos makes me assume that there wouldn't be a healthy serving of crab on the chips but was I wrong. They put at least a half pound, if not more on it. Fantastic! Once all was said and done, we moved on to the fireworks of this whole operation. Dessert. Dessert is actually a specialty and Marsha guided me to get the strawberries 7 different ways. I can't say much about this because I vacuumed those tasty lil thangs hella fast. Overall - great service, great good, great drinks, and great atmosphere.

The other star came off because of the restaurant's policy to refuse to serve drinks at the bar between the lunch and dinner shifts, even though the place is fully staffed.  That policy recently resulted in a group of us having to go drink $250 away elsewhere.  It's a dumb policy, especially given the ice-fueled profit margins they must have from the bar.  Dumb policies deserve lower ratings.",0,0,0,M.

We started with a round of drinks. The spicy cucumber margarita is a good drink to try if you want something different. For starters we ordered the guacamole which is sharing size for two. We had to ask for second rounds of chips. It was accompanied by  an array of different sauces that our server never explained to us what they were so, we spent time burning our mouths bc we couldn't tell what was spicy Versus not. Brussels sprout dish was just okay. Again, no one explained how it came and it was small for an app to share for 4 people. Duck tamales were baby size and for -$6.00 each you should PASS. The tacos, definitely small and just okay. I've had way better street tacos. We tried the chicken, fish, and falafel and one were spectacular which came open face and were small as well. We were just unsatisfied so we didn't order anything else. Dessert, we got the corn tacos and the Ice scream  sandwich which was a stick of cinnamon we couldn't eat. Service- well our server wasn't to keen on explaining anything or offering recommendations. For the price you pay, you would expect spectacular service. Oh well.. Overall the ambiance and restaurant is beautiful, but that's about it. If you want authentic Mexican food with good service this isn't the place.",4,1,1,Krizia C.,"Manhattan, NY",369,329,215
2.0,5/7/2017,Cool and trendy yes. Worth your money definitely not. Good drinks highly recommend the spicy cucumber margarita! Food portions are small and relatively expensive. Tacos are good but nothing to write home about. Desserts bites that doesn't really satisfied you. Don't get what the big hype is all about...,0,0,1,Shachar M.,"New York, NY",272,134,45
1.0,5/6/2017,"I don't know how it is possible to mess up a taco, but this place easily did it hands down.  How do you put peanut butter sauce in an octopus taco?  That alone sounds repulsive, but I'm not the one to hate it before trying it and so I tried it and I hated it.  The $30 fideua was also a disaster, when it came to the table it looked like a salad and we nearly sent it back to the kitchen until someone lifted the mess of shredded cheese on top of it which revealed a vermicelli.  Traditionally fideua is a pasta that comes in a flat iron pan, like with paella.  This item came out in a stone like plate the size of a ladies' fist.  We split this entree between the 3 of us and we couldn't even finish the dish, it was quite difficult to stomach the weird flavors in there.  And although the service was so-so, the maitre'd was quite obnoxious, we walked in at 6 pm for a table for three and was advise that there was nothing available, however, and miraculously a tabled opened up but we would need our entire party present to be seated which is understandable.  What occurs next is just mind boggling...  they us seat anyway!  Mind you there is a second level with seating for the restaurant, and that area remained half empty during our entire meal.  Sorry, but your try too hard innovative meal strategy was a real bust...",0,1,0,Gemma K.,"New York, NY",0,51,15
5.0,5/2/2017,"Empellon!Really excited to find another date to go back! Ambiance was spacious and modern. Perfect for date or dinner with gals. Although it's large it still preserved a sense of intamacy at the table. Great cocktail list (spicy cucumber is my fav!) Had some really respectable mescal and tequila drinks with fresh juices-really well balanced and unique. Food is yum! Leans more traditional with some flare (guac with 7 sauces) to more inventive (pastrami or hashbrowns taco anyone?)I can't stop thinking about the beets starter with this creamy sauce and shaved salted ice! It was such a refreshing dish that almost straddled dessert and starter. Service was VIP and staff was available, gracious and friendly! Great dinner!",1,0,0,Jo L.,"New York, NY",0,17,1
5.0,5/2/2017,"Beautiful space, bar, and atmosphere!  Cocktails are creative, fresh, and made with high quality ingredients and garnishes! Service is warm and friendly and love the open kitchen! The downstairs is lively and upbeat, the upstairs might be more fit for a quieter experience for those that desire more privacy- but love that the space allows you the option to choose your vibe! Bathrooms are stocked with organic soap and mouthwash-nice touch- loved the fun taco selections- hash brown and the pastrami were my two favorites! Definitely get the 7 salsas- a fantastic pairing for the whole meal! Empire Estate Riesling is on their bottle list and goes great with the cuisine! Next time I want to try the A5 Wagyu fajitas for sure- will be back soon, as Empellon is as fancy as their Rolex store neighbor and in my opinion equally as classic !",0,0,0,Jenna B.,"Manhattan, NY",305,1,0

1.0,4/28/2017,"Folks really dont get mexcian food or tacos in manhattan.  I think the restaurant confuses being creative for the sake of being creative.  Creativity matters only when it 1) amplifies the food, or 2) changes one's experience in eating a standard dish while maintaining the integrity and excellence of that dish.  Otherwise being creative alone is pointless.We literally took one bite of the taco and passed.  We also didnt finish dessert.  I had just spent 2 wks in cali (nor and socal) eating on avg one tacqueria every 1.5 days.  As context i grew up in norcal and went to college in san diego.Food: 1.5Service: 4Ambiance: 4O/all: 1.5 (bias skewed towards food)Things to note:1/ lunch pre fixe of $35 not a bad deal for midtown--starter, 2 tacos, and a dessert2/ gorgeous restaurant3/ our server was excellent and encouraged us to provide feedback since we took one bite of our tacos4/ the crab nachos were actually quite good--crab, hakaido uni, cheese, creme, and really well fried 'high end' tortillas5/ the stewed chicken and steak tacos were horrible, embarassingly so.  the steak was rubbery while the chicken was bland; and the various other pairings with the protein didnt help improve the tacos.  our starters were decent...the yellow beet.6/ desserts were uninspiring",0,0,0,Pat R.,"Manhattan, NY",33,429,0

3.0,4/22/2017,"Been anticipating this place for a while now, as it's very close to where I work (ok ok, it's literally in the lobby :)But, I must say it's my least favorite of all the Empellons.The bar area has some high tables which make it very inconvenient to hang out, as people are getting waitress service there too I think and getting food and stuff.The bathrooms couldn't possibly be further from the bar.Food is decent and they took some of the staples from the Taqueria downtown... Some interesting Margaritas on the menu, but to be honest, I still have to work through a lot of it. Overall, I'm sure will do nicely given the Hedge-Fund hotel above with their readily accessible expense-accounts... but won't be my pick for a sit-down meal in the hood. Maybe just hang at the bar for now....not sure I want to spend money on A5 quality beef being converted to Tacos (isn't the whole idea originally about cheap cuts of meat stewed a long time?)... well maybe I like the idea better on someone else's aforementioned expense-account :) p.s. staff is incredible and super-friendly.",4,1,1,Abul R.,"Brooklyn, NY",54,304,181

3.0,4/4/2017,"So excited they opened. Anyone who works in the area knows the dire need for new places. But I really feel they missed an opportunity here. The bar is way too small for a midtown crowd and the layout is strange with upstairs bathrooms and 2 oddly placed staircases. People could not fit in the door or get drinks. Plus in the confusion they put other peoples' charges on my bill which I did not catch at the time. Not acceptable for a group with this much experience. And $17-18 small glass Margaritas is steep even for the expense account crowd. Food is just as good as the other locations. Fresh, and insanely overpriced. Still glad we have new place around here, but it will not be our new everyday spot I hoped it would be.",4,0,1,P C.,"New York, NY",6,142,11

5.0,3/30/2017,"Enjoyed lunch last week, so decided to come back and try some other dishes.Good thing I came because they were giving out to customers today couple of complimentary dishes, shrimp & corn ice cream tacos. Both should be on the menu.Their prix fix lunch at $35 is a very good value, which included an appetizer, tacos of your choice, and dessert.The lobster salad, split roast beef tacos, and grapefruit crème brûlée - all very good.The best dishes were the queso fresco w/ citrus fruits/trout roe (a combination that I wouldn't find appetizing, but this dish was amazing and would order again) and the A5 wagyu fajitas w/ black pepper mole. The $125 price tag for the fajitas can be a bit intimidating, but you are getting 8 oz of the highest grade wagyu - a great value, imo, considering that you would get much less for a similar price at other NYC restaurants.Also, highly recommend the 'citrus' bites, quite creative & delicious.

Happened to luck into a reservation on second day they were open by making it on their website. Food is wildly overpriced-even for midtown. 2 small tacos for $18, seriously? That is insulting. Waiter pushed us so we were ordering then ""right"" amount of food but I dont think he gave it any thought and had us order more than needed.Waiter kept forgetting dietary issues.

5.0,3/23/2017,"The newest and biggest Empellón is now open in Midtown with lots of great new stuff.There are some tacos from the downtown location and staples like guac on the menu, but the new stuff is what we focused on. Most intriguing were definitely the Octopus Tacos with Celery and Peanut Butter ($18 for 2). Yes, peanut butter. These were excellent, as were the Hash Brown Tacos and Falafel Tacos with Grasshopper Hummus (both $14 for 2).We also got the Pork Salad ($35) from the ""Closers"" section of the menu, which reflects the Midtown location  in both price and the name of the section. Served in a giant Chicharron bowl, it was delicious, but you will especially love it if you like the really fatty type of pork.Definitely save room for the desserts, especially that sweet Avocado everybody's been talking about.",9,3,5,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1695,69834
