1.0,2/25/2019,"If I could give this a zero star, I would.  This is the third time I have been here.  I believe that anyone could have a bad night, so I am a forgiving type of reviewer.  I certainly will NEVER come back as long as the ""manager"" Lorraine is working there. I experienced bad (rude) service from her before, and complained to another manager on that occasion about her.  This time, in an empty restaurant on a cold Monday evening, she chose to seat us right next to a large and loud party.  When we asked to move to another part of her empty restaurant, instead of being accommodating, she copped an attitude saying the other parts of the restaurant were too cold.  She simply did not want to get off her rear end and walk an extra three steps.  She was incredibly rude!The food here has always been good and a great value.  It's a shame that this person ruined my appetite for this restaurant.  There are plenty of great choices for a good meal, warm atmosphere and friendly service all along 3rd Avenue in Bay Ridge.  Avoid this one and Lorraine!",1,0,0,Bud A.,"Asbury Park, NJ",0,5,0

5.0,2/13/2019,I came here for brunch recently with a group of 10 and it was just so good that I can't stop thinking about going back! Their brunch for $30 is an absolute STEAL. The eggs Benedict was AMAZING & their variety of food + 6 different drinks included was awesome. They brought out pitcher after pitcher of mimosa + Bellini as soon as the previous one was empty! The seating area was so cute - you were inside but it had this outdoorsy/garden vibe with tons of sunlight shining in. Best part - I have a gluten allergy & stupidly did not warn them however the waitress came back saying they could make anything gluten free!! I was able to get my eggs Benedict with gluten free bread & did not get sick from cross contamination. Definitely recommend for brunch!,0,0,0,Ashley M.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",117,25,1

3.0,12/2/2018,Walked by this place almost every day and I said one day I would try it out. Food was pretty good but I think prices are too high. They have price fixed options but your paying for it. We sat in the back atrium area which was nice and the waitress took good care of us. I tried the pasta with vodka sauce based on waitress recommendation stating it was a signature dish. I enjoyed it so no complaints. They have a good size bar but at lunch it was empty. I once saw a happy hour special advertised that looked good including food specials. Not sure if they still do that but if they did I would come back to try out the bar menu and grab a few cold ones.,0,0,0,Bryan L.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,171,126

2.0,7/30/2018,"My son and daughter-in-law (both lawyers) took me and my mother to this restaurant on 8/28/18 for a 3-course meal ($42 + tax & gratuity per person). The staff was very nice and helpful when it came to turning off the a/c in the area, the dining area was clean and well lit. However, when the food was being brought out the server reached behind me to place my son's food on the table & accidentally poured my son's meal (penne pasta w/cheese sauce) down the back of my new blouse which created 3 separate stains on my blouse. After a wasted attempt at using a cloth napkin to ""clean"" the spots on my blouse the server nervously proceeded with bringing the rest of the food to the table. The mistake she made was reaching over me to place a hot plate of food in front of my son when she should have sat the food on the table from the front not from behind the customer. I'm just pissed at the resolution to the issue which was to hand me a business card and tell me to submit a cleaning bill for my shirt. They never asked for my name so how were they going to remember me? Are you serious???? My son spent over $200 for that meal and didn't receive so much as a $10 discount off the bill. My cleaning bill would be less than it would cost in gas for me to travel back to bay ridge to receive reimbursement. I'm sorry Greenhouse Cafe but the way you handled that problem is unacceptable and I will NEVER return to your establishment!

4.0,3/9/2018,"Coming here last Saturday night to celebrate my mother-in-law's birthday was really a very strong recommendation by my husband, who's work had their Christmas dinner here last year.  He raved how great everything was, so when we were coming up short of a new place to go to for the occasion, this place was the top contender. We were escorted to the back greenhouse area in the right corner, next to the door that leads to their garden area.  It was nicely lit with white lights, making it really visually festive and celebratory.  Sitting in the back was a little cooler, but gave us the space that we needed to feel comfortable.We LUCKED OUT when the waitress gave us the Restaurant Week menu that was expiring the next day for their $42 pre-fix menu of an appetizer, entree, and dessert.  I'm talking surf n turf and filet minion people!  No doubt in my mind that I was banking on the surf n turf, and my hubby got the shrimp and penne al a vodka, which was very surprising to me, especially from the selection he had.  I can honestly say that both choices weren't foolish ones.  My lobster tail was fresh and cooked to perfection, paired with some melted butter on the side with some fresh veggies like carrots and zucchini.  My filet minion was paired with a delish homemade bbq secret sauce that had me dying for more!  It was an excellent portion and was even able to share some with my husband, because I was definitely having more than one helping of his shrimps!  The vodka sauce was insanely good; bread dipping wasn't an option.By the time dessert came around, I was looking for some chocolate mousse and that's what I got!  My husband opted for the brownie overload and OMG...it's every girl's dream!  Two fudge brownies with whipped cream and hot fudge - just stick a fork in me - I was DONE!I would definitely love to come back for another occasion!",1,1,4,Jaclyn C.,"Brooklyn, NY",1216,896,1227

First, we had a reservation and they sat us in between two cash registers, next to the bathroom and the kitchen so everyone is literally walking around you and it wasn't very busy.  Service was very slow, the waitress was very forgetful and unpleasant. Prefixed menu $26 pp you get ""unlimited"" mimosas ( unlimited is in quotes because they do not try to serve you more than one) it took the waitress 40 Minutes to bring us mimosas then we informed the busboy, and the manager then 10 minutes later she brings it and did not  apologize for taking so long and by then we were finishing our desserts. 50 minutes to get a second mimosa that didn't taste good either was disappointing. Caesar salad had a bad aftertaste, and then the entree: I am a big fan of eggs Benedict but this place eggs Benedict was sour and the egg white was still clear meaning it was undercooked.

3.0,4/20/2017,"Visited this restaurant for Easter Sunday.  Haven't been here since High School which has been over 10 years. Overall experience was good. Just a couple of things I thought could have went a bit differently. When we first sat downwe were givwn a pitcher of water. I woukd have thought they woukd have served us our first glass of water atleast. But, no that didn't happen. We placed our orders food didn't take long at all to come out. They had a pre fixed menu so I'm sure most of the food was half way prepped already. Anyway the thing that bothered me the most was the manager, possibly the owner. He went around asking tables how everything was and if they needed anything. But the one table he did not ask was mine. My family and I were completely disregarded. Didn't think much of it. Until when it came time to pay our check. Once I realized we finished our entire meal and paid the bill and never approached my him. So I took it upon myself when we were leaving the establishment to let him know. So I turned to him and said....""By the way the food was very good. Butter was a bit frozen for the bread but over all food was good. Just though you might like to know, considering your completely disregarded my table as you were making your rounds. Didn't even wish us happy easter but you have a great day sir"".... A little courtesy goes a long way. I like when establishments make it they're priority to reach out to every guest. This owner/manager didn't make it his priority so overall rating gets 3 stars. Oh and by the way coacktails definitely on the pricey side. Hennessey and Coke prob about a 10oz glass $12 dollars.

The penne vodka and balsamic dressing were not saturated with garlic, yet were flavorful. The shrimp scampi seemed to be a crowd pleaser.

As soon as I walked in, I automatically loved the place. The bar is right on the right when you walk in and you really feel the ""pub"" atmosphere. It has the ""pub"" look, but very elegant. As we walked towards our table, the atmosphere changes. It really looks like a cafe. There are a bunch of little tables, and a veranda type of seating outside. All the napkins and tablecloths were a forest green color, complimenting ""Greenhouse"" cafe. The waitress led us to a little round table in the back. We had plenty of room and weren't on top of other tables like in a lot of other restaurants. The brunch special was $29.95 for a three course meal, unlimited mimosas, and a choice of tea or coffee. We both got the fruit plate to start off. The fruit was very well displayed and very fresh. The waitress was very attentive and as soon as we finished a mimosa, she was ready to bring out another one. I ordered the eggs benedict, which was fantastic. I haven't been ordering it lately because I find most places don't cook the canadian bacon correctly, but this bacon was perfect. For dessert we both got the brownie, which was loaded with chocolate chips. I wish I could've eaten more of it, but I was too full. I really enjoyed this place.

Complete waste of money. First of all we were seated in a VERY noisy room we couldn't even hear ourselves talk. We should have just left at that point. We started with the onion soup which was pretty good, after that everything went downhill. We ordered two pina coloadas which were HORRIBLE and left a bitter aftertaste. Bartender may have put rum in them but if he did, you could not taste it at all, it was just two very bitter frozen drinks that tasted awful. After that our meals came. my mom had a pork chop which was so tough she could barely get her knife thru it and the baked potato was so small and cold it was like fast food. I had the fish and chips which were soggy and tasteless. I've had better fish from Gortons frozen.  Basically inedible. the fries were horrible, just a bunch of shriveled up potatoes cut up and cooked and tasted awful. Didn't eat any of them. Then we moved on to desert hoping that would be good. I ordered the ""Brownie"" which wasn't a brownie but just some cheap cakey chocolate cake. again...didn't eat it. Tasted awful. mom had apple turnover which was blahh. Even the bread we got at the table felt warm on the outside but you open it and the inside was cold!

5.0,4/13/2015,"As a person with Celiac Disease, I am often hesitant to attend events at restaurants whose menus are predominantly Italian.  Even if they say to notify the staff of your gluten sensitivity, that usually means, ""We'll accomodate you with a salad and grilled chicken cutlet., so you don't starve to death while watching everyone else enjoy their food.""  NOT SO at the Greenhouse.  Last Saturday, I attended a reunion there and the person organizing it told me they would ""take care"" of me and my gluten issues.  I got there expecting to eat nothing but salad, mussels and sausage and peppers.  I was very surprised when they brought me a platter of assorted gluten free appetizers including chicken skewers, mozzarella in carrozza and meatballs.  As I started to dig in to the appetizers, they brought out a large plate of gluten free penne ala vodka and a platter of assorted entree selections including more meatballs, eggplant parmigiana and a yummy chicken dish with eggplant and mozzarella that I don't know the name of.  Everything was delicious, but there was no way I could eat it all, so the staff kindly wrapped the rest for me to take home.  And they even brought me a special gluten free dessert!I have no idea if this is normal for a catered event at The Greenhouse, or if our event organizer was very persuasive or paid extra for me, but it was the best treatment I have ever received at any restaurant or catering facility that claims to accommodate those with gluten restrictions, including my children's weddings, which I coordinated!While I no longer live in Brooklyn, The Greenhouse will definitely be my first choice any time we're looking for a place to eat in the area.",6,0,2,Mary R.,"Wantagh, NY",0,7,0

I had stuffed mushrooms with olives and mozzarella cheese and I had no hint of olives, and the mushrooms were a little rubbery. For dinner I had a grilled salmon with vegetables, mashed potatoes, over a bed of spinach. This was a bit better than the appetizer but still very basic. That's what this place is: basic. A step above a generic diner under a fancy-ish sounding name. The menu has nothing that leaps out at you, like ""Oh that sounds good!"" There's chicken and shrimp dishes that are ""prepared any style."" NO! Prepare a dish and tell me what it is, maybe it'll be good, but don't tell me that I need to tell the restaurant how to prepare a dish. I can stay home for that! They have a good location and ample space, but the decor is extremely dated and not at all special. The clientele when I was there is older and maybe that's why it's still around? It's a place they know to get a shrimp scampi and lasagna There was also a man and woman very loudly singing that was highly irritating.

3.0,3/28/2013,"A quiet restaurant in a quiet neighborhood, at least on a Sunday afternoon. My friend's coworker had suggested Greenhouse Cafe and my friends and I decided on this place for brunch. Once you enter inside, there was a pub, eating area, and what seems to be a private area. We ordered from the brunch menu. There is definitely something for everyone. I opted for the mimosa, soup du jour (cream of broccoli), traditional spinach salad, and the apple strudel (yes, that is a lot of food). I did contemplate between the salad, quiche, and crepe but ultimately wanted something light. The mimosa was good (unlike the pina colada) and the cream of broccoli was surprising good and huge! The spinach salad was also huge topped with sliced apples, walnuts, grilled chicken and blue cheese. There was too much going on on my plate. I also wish they asked me what dressing I wanted before giving me the Italian dressing (maybe raspberry vinaigrette?) I took a bite of the eggs benedict arnold with grilled salmon and the pancakes. The pancakes were fluffy, something I would've enjoyed but the grilled salmon on the eggs benedict would've been better with smoked salmon. The praised apple strudel tasted like an old Entenmann's, not recommended. Overall, the meal was filling for $25. Service was slow and laid back which was good and bad. Good because we didn't feel rushed. Also, the fresh baked muffins listed on the menu were no where to be found.

Eggs Benedict Arnold with a nice slice of salmon but too much bland hollandaise sauce which drowned out the rest of the dish. However the accompanying fries and veggies were delish.  Dessert was apple strudel but I had my fill with the unlimited mimosas so I doggie bagged it and its waiting for me tonight!Overall a nice safe place for brunch.

I do not claim to have tried a lot of the food as it is usually late night when I drop in.  The wings are good! The service has been mostly good, although you can tell they are having some issues behind the bar. The best thing about Greenhouse is the authentic Bay Ridge, BK crowd. I love the regulars who frequent this place and it has been an experience getting to know these fantastic people who have been coming here for 10+ years.

5.0,7/16/2011,"Ok, had to upgrade this review to 5 stars because I had the epic BRUNCH experience.First, the ""Cognac glazed grilled grapefruit"" is mind blowing. And I'm a guy who has never liked grapefruit (suggestion though for cerated spoons so diners can dig out all the deliciousness)Also, I sat at the bar and bartender Polina is awesome, personable and guided me through the menu.The Benedict Arnold is the Salmon benedict: hearty. filling. and still I had room for the fries, veggies and.... apple strudel. Epic 3 course brunch. Priced under 30 bucks.Bottomless mimosas, muffins and coffee on top of all that.**Unpretentious local haunt. (If you are local, no reason this couldn't quickly become a habit).Also the ""Nanny"" is one of the best things on the menu if you are in search of lighter fare.  Grilled chicken in an olive paste in a warm pita.

3.0,6/8/2011,"Food: The bread was hot and yummy. The main course was ok. I don't see why the entree cost 19 dollars for chicken, mushrooms and sloppy cheese with veggies but a pasta of the same portion and with chicken would only be 15. Also I like how the menu said it's 'stuffed' when they put the chicken on top of random cheese and mushrooms. The gravy was a bit nasty too. The top layer of it was like rubber goop. The mash was good but the chip on top was kind of retarded...and greasy. Upon Arrival:...So is the waitress doubling as the hostess or did I miss something? The woman at the bar didn't even acknowledge us either so we're just looking around wondering if anyone was gonna come around to seat us. Service: I'm not sure why we had a waiter and a waitress but the waiter was much friendlier and attentive than the waitress was. What rubbed me the wrong way was when my friends asked what drinks they had. It seemed legitimate enough considering there wasn't a single drink listed on their menu. So the waitress goes ""Well what do you want?"" That's not really an answer....I have to sit there and play 20 questions to decide on something? And then even so, was she going to go through the prices too? I don't get why the drink menu had to be a secret. Etc:....we went on karaoke night apparently....after a round of Frank Sinatra and 90's hip hop, they kept going YEAAAA BROOKLYNNNNNNN....Oh god please shut up.Generally it was okay but probably wouldn't do a repeat here.",2,3,0,Melanie S.,"Brooklyn, NY",23,180,8
1.0,2/24/2011,"Beyond disappointment.I had somewhat high expectations for Greenhouse because from what I saw, this was the only restaurant in Bay Ridge that participates in restaurant week. I ordered the surf and turf entree - filet mignon and lobster tail and both were terrible--did they forget to add flavoring or what?

Since we went as a group, I got to try the seafood salad, zucchini chips and the mussels on a white sauce (my favorite) for appetizers and they were all pretty good.  For entrees, I tried the Filet of Sole stuffed with crabmeat (ok), the penne with shrimp (pasta was ok, but shrip was delicious!), the salmon... All the dishes are decent, a little bland for my taste...Our server was great.  She patiently repeated all options for our big group and did a great job explaning the dishes and making suggestions.A good value overall.  I'd go back if I'm in the area...",4,0,2,Silvia G.,"Orange County, CA",707,721,4486

1.0,1/3/2011,"I signed up to Yelp just to write this review and warn others of this TERRIBLE TERRIBLE PLACE!!!!. $25 for the worst food of your life. I had friends visiting and took them to this highly referred cafe for brunch the day after new years. The moment we received the bread rolls at the table I knew something was wrong. They were old, dry, crusty with white edges.. pretty much your basic corner bodega store bought items. They were super hot on the outside and cold on the inside.My friends orders the Eggs Benedict Arnold which has salmon. Needless to say, the salmon was so bad my  friend got food poisoning for the rest of the day. The hollandaise sauce had gone bad as well and had a horrible tangy aftertaste. The lobster Bisque soup was straight out of the can with the worst metallic taste. The meat looked greenish with disgusting black charr that looked even worse. The only good thing was the unlimited drinks and we sure took advantage of this since the food was out of the question. I didn't even know places like this existed in the city, it was so terrible.

At Greenhouse a $25 brunch includes unlimited brunch drinks (which does not include OJ, but does include mimosas), appetizer, entree, dessert, and coffee - which is great. However the food was sub-par. My salad was sad, by benedict was meh and my friend's caesar salad was a salad with two chicken cutlets thrown on top (not chopped) and some fries on the side (who knows the logic behind serving fries with a salad?) overall, the food was alright at best.THE WORST? The hostess and one of the servers. They were sitting by the bar when we walked in. After seating us they started catching real attitude with the customers sitting next to us just because they moved the table. i mean serious attitude - so loud i couldn't have a conversation with the people i was sitting with.

2.0,10/3/2010,"I think we have been here once, we have lived a block away for 4 years and I've never been drawn to the place, mostly due to word of mouth - a friend ordered a cheeseburger there a year or so ago and said the ""cheese"" was cheese whiz (I've had a similar experience at another otherwise good restaurant within a few blocks from Greenhouse, so it might be a neighborhood eccentricity); recently someone else said that if you don't want cheese whiz on your cheeseburger at Greenhouse you have to ask for real cheese.  I figure that a place that has as its default cheese whiz on a ""cheeseburger"" probably isn't for me.  Plus $48/person for a party package sounds pricey for Bay Ridge.",0,0,0,Jeanne S.,"Brooklyn, NY",73,20,0

Everyone in the party enjoyed their dinners and we got some fabulous service. I ordered the Surf anf Turf from the RESTAURANT WEEK promotion. I thought it was enough food for $35 but you could've just stuck to regular specials for $25 just like someone else just mentioned.  The lobster tail was impressive and calamari as appetizer was so damn good. I loved it.,6,0,4,Jordan W.,"Bronx, NY",1532,1252,4031

They had a $25 prixe fixe instead of the $35 restaurant week one, meal choices were about the same. I had fried calamari, 12 oz steak strip with mashed potatoes and rice and fresh fruit to finish off. The fried calamari wasn't bad but I've had better. The steak was where it went all wrong. I asked for medium rare, some parts were undercooked some were overcooked. The rice tasted terrible, the mashed potatoes were somewhat doable. Lastly the fruit, it didn't taste incredibly fresh but it wasn't stale atleast.

4.0,2/24/2010,"I am a little shocked by some of the bad reviews for Greenhouse Cafe. I went here recently for a kind of 'girls day' with my mom, both grandmas, 2 aunts, and cousin.  It's very pretty, a long old wooden bar, and we were seated in the room off of the left of the bar at the front window. When we saw just the plain menu I was not happy with some of the prices, but then I realized there was a 'complete lunch' menu for $19.95.  We all decided to get this. You got an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert. They also brought delicious warm bread to the table.  Food: I got the caesar salad as an appetizer, very good. I got the penne vodka with grilled chicken as my entree, which was HUGE and also delicious, and I got the apple strudel for dessert, which was pretty darn good. I think EVERYONE in my party was VERY satisfied with the food. We were definitely stuffed also. Negative: My 8 year old cousin had 3 sprites, all in small glasses I guess because she was a child, and they charged us 2.50 for each. I didn't even know restaurants still did that, charge per soda, it wasn't bottled or anything.Overall: Food was great, atmosphere was nice, we sat for a LONG time and didn't feel rushed. A big PLUS for me is that they refilled the water glasses consistently and without being asked.",4,0,1,Melissa W.,"New York, NY",191,334,423
4.0,9/14/2009,"Yup, a ""Bay Ridge institution."" My grandfather likes this place, so we eat there from time to time... I have never loved it, and one recent time I had the salmon over ""exotic salad"" and it was just terrible. Fish was dry and overcooked, salad was dry and underdressed. (And exotic = romaine and fruit chunks, if you're curious.) So when it came time to plan a big family dinner, I was very against holding it here. However, I was overruled. And you know? It turned out pretty well. They're used to big groups, and the food wasn't bad at all. It wasn't amazing either, but it was fine for something like what we were doing, where the main purpose was getting the family together and not spending too much money.The service was very good and I think we were very well taken care of. Our waiter was attentive, super respectful to my grandfather, flirted with my feisty great-aunt, was cool and down to earth with the teenagers, and got us everything we needed. Bravo to him, truly. We spent about four hours in the place on a Thursday night and there was no problem with that. They also agreed to let us order from the restaurant week menu ($35 pp, drinks a la carte), rather than buying a party package ($48 pp, drinks included) which was a plus, because we weren't a huge drinking crowd and the restaurant week menu includes things like surf and turf and prime rib, whereas the party menu is heavy on the chicken francese type stuff. Dinner (appetizer, entrée, dessert and coffee/tea) and drinks for 19 people came to just under $1100, which included tax and gratuity.So yeah, I was being kind of snobby about the place, but it turned out to be *perfect* for the occasion.

2.0,5/27/2009,"When it comes to restaurants in Bay Ridge, I've learned that there's ""good"" and then there's ""Bay Ridge good.""  The latter consists of restaurants that have been here for decades and relied on the patronage of people who've lived in the area their whole lives.  However, these restaurants tend to be living off their old reputations and are basically going through the motions now, serving sub-par food.  The Greenhouse Cafe is one of these ""Bay Ridge good"" types of establishments.I went recently for lunch and was severely disappointed.  I ordered flounder francaise and it was undercooked with a flavorless sauce.  My dining partner had French fries which were also undercooked.  When the waiter came to clear our table, he asked how we liked the fries (almost the whole plate was full, so that should have answered his question) and I told him they were undercooked.  He looked shocked and said, ""But they're fresh cut!""  Well, that's all fine and dandy, but they need more time in the fryer!Our server was quite pleasant but the food took forever to arrive.  We were the only people there so it's not like they were backlogged.  Our server disappeared for a while again when it came to get the check.  I think we ended up being there for close to two hours for what should have been a quick lunch.Greenhouse Cafe was established in 1979 and I don't think the rooms have been updated since then.  The carpet was worn and everything looked dated.I  wouldn't go back to the Greenhouse Cafe especially when there are far better restaurants in the neighborhood.  I'm sure there are generations of Bay Ridgers who would disagree with me, but I'm happy to check out other fine establishments.",5,1,1,Tressa D.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,24,0
1.0,4/21/2009,"On Friday night, we were out looking for a place to eat and converse. So, we decided on the Greenhouse Cafe.  This was my first time there, though my fiancee and her friend had been there a couple of times. We were seated in the back as soon as we got there.  The atmosphere was okay.  The back room features a large window that overlooks the small yard that is decorated with lighted trees. There was a band playing (a little loud for conversation) and a birthday party going on.They have a fixed price menu at $25 for an appetizer, entree, desert, and coffee.  The food was pretty good, I ordered pork over a bacon-kraut with vegtables as the main course.  The service was a bit slow, but we figured that the birthday party was overwhelming the staff (though it wasn't that large... trying to give them the benefit of the doubt).When it came time for desert, it took over 30 minutes to be served with coffee. We were okay with waiting because we were enjoying each others company.  While the coffee came the desert never did. So after another 30 minutes I found a bus boy (since the waiter was nowhere to be found) to try and get our check.  So he went and got our waiter.The waiter showed up and asked if we wanted our check and then he disappeared again for 20 minutes.  We were about to just get up and leave some money on the table when he came back over and realized he didn't give us the check yet.  So again, he went off to get the check.This time when he came back, I looked over the check and stated that he never brought out the desert, could he adjust the check accordingly.  To which he replied ""I don't have to take anything off the check."" There was no, ""oh I am sorry"" or ""let me see what I could do""... it was just a flat out ""nope too bad for you"".  Together our bill was $45.50 and I usually tip 20%... But this time, probably the first time in my life, I left no tip.  I figured that would cover the cost of the desert and make a statement about the service.  I have no desire to ever go back to a place that treats their customers so poorly.  With slow service and rude waiters.

2.0,3/11/2009,"I've been here twice. Once for dinner, which I had steak, and was delicious, but maybe the wine was talking. The second time, of which this review is about, was horrible. Saturday lunch. I ordered the stuffed mushrooms. They came out, sitting in a puddle of spaghetti sauce, which was also ladled on top of them, with pieces of mozzarella on top of each one. They were soggy and gross. The philly cheese steak sandwich was leather. And, I normally like very well done meat, but this was unedible. The service was bad. It took longer to get our check then the entire rest of lunch combined. A table of four, who came in at least 10 minutes after me, started to be served food before my small table of two. I was charged for a second cup of coffee even though it was suppose to be included in the meal. The tablecloth, OMG. It was white and had nasty grease stains all over it. I actually was so grossed out that I had to shift it around. And, we had to sit in an outside covered gazebo with air conditioning on...in the dead of winter. There were huge private parties occupying the rest of the restaurant so regular customers were shifted off into Siberia outside. Very bad meal.

3.0,12/3/2008,"It's what we call ""Catering Hall Food."" The Greenhouse Cafe is sort of a Bay Ridge institution in its own right. It's well known by many people (geriatrics like my parents and grandparents really like it, so much so that my grandparents had their 50th wedding anniversary party here) and they do have a reliable, somewhat Italian-American, but more American menu with items that are friendly to a variety of palettes and their prices, while probably a bit high for Third Avenue in Bay Ridge, are still rather reasonable for this type of dining experience.The dining room(s) are neutrally-decorated and there's kind of an odd configuration which might lead you through two dining rooms before you get to your own, but there is a cute glass-enclosed room in the back (I suppose this is the ""greenhouse"") and there is an open-air patio adjoining it, so you sit out doors in fair weather. As I mentioned, the food is all pretty standard, but generally good. There are generous-sized portions and there are a lot of things on the menu. There is also a full bar and a decent, if slightly overpriced wine list. The staff is attentive, although when it gets busier, service can be a bit lackluster. Overall, a very decent place to dine in Bay Ridge, and if you have really picky children or grandparents, they'll probably find something they like here.",3,2,0,Justin S.,"New York, NY",862,480,83
