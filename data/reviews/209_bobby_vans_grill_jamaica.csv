3.0,4/25/2019,"I was not impressed too much with the visit to this restaurant in JFK. I dont normally expect amazing things from airport restaurants, but with the name and credibility from the other Bobby Vans in the city I figured to give it a try. It took quite a while to be seated, although the hostess ended up being our server, she was sweet. I ordered an old fashioned and it was just okay. Not one I'd order again, and I love old fashions and bourbon. As for the food, my partner got the lobster ravioli. Literally came with maybe six ravioli. It was alright, just not filling for the price. I ordered the strip steak and it was cooked well, and the mashed potato's were decent. I think I'm just comparing the food to the price you pay and the atmosphere and it just wasn't my favorite.

The 12oz burger adding bacon and cheese along with a soda clocks in right around the Priority Pass credit limit. I had my burger cooked to a very nice medium (still a little worried about food safety of rare ground beef), and if the 12oz was pre-cooking weight I wouldn't know it. It was huge and very juicy. Both the cheese and bacon were great. I am not much of a fries person, but they included a huge mound. Free refills on sodas you would expect.Service was good, but they warned other customers that most dishes take 20m to come out without warning me, so maybe they thought I looked like I knew what I was doing as I presented my Priority Pass upfront.",0,0,0,Ronald W.,"Redmond, WA",172,774,657

I agreed without looking closely at the menu to see what it came with. They put American cheese on them! What?! Sorry but that should never have crossed the chef's mind when putting the menu together let alone making it for guests.

4.0,3/27/2019,"Despite the high number of negative reviews, we decided to give this Bobby Van's a try, especially since our priority pass provides $28 credit per guest. We had breakfast shortly after 7am on a Wednesday morning. There weren't too many other patrons dining at the time. Fearful of a long wait, we planned extra time before our flight so that we didn't have to rush. I ordered the steak and eggs and it came out in about 15 minutes. Although the steak was slight over cooked to my preference, it exceeded my expectations. The server was attentive and checked in on us frequently. Overall, I would recommended Bobby Van's as for a quick pre-flight meal.

3.0,3/16/2019,"Stopped by Bobby Van's for a quick meal before boarding our flight at JFK Terminal 8. The service is mediocre and depending on what you get, so is the food. Not sure why their servers aren't more efficient since it was early evening and the dining room was barely even 1/3 full. It just seemed to take forever for them to come by and check on us during the meal and also bring us the check at the end. I had to patiently wait a while to order dessert and then again when I was ready to pay and leave.As for the food, I got the beef short ribs and it was pretty good. Well cooked and tender, not dry at all. My wife got the shrimp scampi, however, and there was zero taste. Not sure if they forgot to put the sauce/seasoning on it, or if their sauce/butter is just tasteless but it really just tasted like plain pasta. She had to ask for marinara to dump on the dish just to be able to finish it. For dessert they do have Junior's Cheesecake though and they only charge about $1-2 more than the Junior's location we had visited in the city. Not bad at all considering this is at the airport! Overall I wouldn't recommend this spot unless you're just dying for a nice restaurant at JFK.

Worst part of this restaurant is that they don't make provisions for the fact people have luggage with them. Just a generally uncomfortable dining experience being shoved into a tiny 2 person booth trying to keep all of your luggage with you, trying to work and there being no outlets to use. This is not comparable to a working lounge. Prices are absurd for an airport because, get real, we're in an airport, not Manhattan. Had $26 shrimp scampi which was 4 shrimp + a mound of linguini that had zero taste. My husband told me it tasted like they forgot to put sauce on it.

We sat at the bar, but it took the servers about 5 minutes to clear the food left behind by the couple before us. After that, we received menus, but it took a longer time for us to actually have our order taken, and an even longer time for us to be able to get a second round of drinks and get the bill. The wine we got was pretty standard, if not a bit overpriced (although expected, since you're at an airport).

Bobby Van's Grill is conveniently located in Terminal 8 (American Airlines) of JFK. As soon as you go through Security, you'll see it on your right hand side. I was told by the gentleman in the front that the wait for food would be at least 35 minutes when I was looking to be seated. Not a big deal was my response. I really only wanted a drink and grabbed a seat at the bar. Bartender was great. He took my order as soon as I was ready, checked in on how I was enjoying myself and my drink on a regular basis, made sure I didn't need anything else. I really enjoyed the Manhattan I ordered. Well balanced and made just the way I liked.I asked the waiter if I could order an appetizer or side dish that didn't take long to cook and he said it wouldn't be a problem. My order of mac and cheese came out within 15 minutes. The mac wasn't bad, but wasn't great either. I had to add some salt and pepper for that extra kick and roundness of flavors.My drink and side dish came out to $26, shy of the $28 limit. I provided them with my Priority Pass Card (they take the QR code too) and I was good to go. Don't forget to tip!! All the haters must be having a full on meal here.

Service is prompt as a high level restaurant should be. The only downside I saw is the cooking. Like many people have said, the chef isn't very good at delivering correct order. Asked for a medium well burger but presented with a well done. Hmmm. Also got a lobster ravioli.

You can see the restaurant right after security and when we stopped by the host lady said the wait is 1hr or so but it's first come first serve so there is no system where I can put my name down and come back. Since we had some time before boarding, we decided to get some water and just come back in 5 min to wait around near the check in area- but the suddenly the wait time decreased to zero min and we were seated right away There are actually lots of seating behind the bar area and when we were seated there were definitely empty tables so I was confused why the host quoted us an hour wait.... in term of service, our waiter was nice but the service was terribly slow. Took us a while to order, get food, get drinks, get checks.... just everything was slow It worked out because we had enough buffer time but I can imagine people getting frustrated if they didn't have enough time Food was okay - again for the discount it's great deal - but if I had to pay the full price?

3.0,4/18/2018,"The priority pass lounge in terminal 8 is actually just a restaurant--but don't let that fool you, members get in with a +1, and combined, you get $56 to spend on whatever you want. Sure, there are no comfortable chairs, very few options for charging up your devices, and it's not super quiet or restricted to lounge-goers, but the tradeoff is having an entire menu, drinks and food, to choose from. No restrictions. One beer, one glass of wine, and a split buffalo chicken sandwich with a side salad came in at just under $50--completely free. A quick cash tip and we were out the door. I'm glad we ate something, because our flight to London offered coach dinner options that were...what's a nice way to say this...less than stellar?If you have priority pass and find yourself in terminal 8 with time to spare, I say calculate as many ways to spend $56 as possible and pick your favorite. Or go ham on the menu and consider the $56 off an added bonus. Pro Tip: Tell them about your priority pass card before you sit down, not at the end of the meal, as the table next to us did.

Other patrons were so shocked by the situation, people started getting up and leaving. Long story short, this place has a nice interior, and for the most part the staff is great (beware of the bartender I saw today), but for an airport restaurant, having no food out to your guests after an hour is unacceptable.

I had the Bobby Van's Burger and a Spicy Chicken Wrap. I love burgers. Period. Yet Bobby Van's burger made me cringe. The wrap was a joke. The tortilla was burnt, and the Spicy Wrap was as un-spicy as one could get. The interiors are upscale and servers are nice, but the food is just bad.

They ask me what channel. I say NBC sports. They ask channel #. I say I don't live in Brooklyn so I don't know.  My food arrives. Waitress asks me to google the channel ""or something"" while I'm about to eat my $22 burger. Other waiter come over and figures it out in like 90 seconds.  My waitress / bartender is openly complaining about my request to other customers.  She is also talking about me to other employees because she is 1) not out of earshot and 2) it's a giveaway when two other staff are looking at me while she is gesticulating and clearly annoyed. She then proceeds to act totally hostile the rest of the time. Doesn't refill water. Doesn't ask how I'm doing. Complains to a third employee who catches me staring him when I hear her complaining again and he is looking at me.   Bottom line is this - do you think I LIKE sitting around an airport waiting for a delayed flight?  Does the staff there think I'm just having a great old time on a Thursday night taking a 10:20pm flight?  No - I'm not having a good time. I'm paying $22 for a burger and $17 for a glass of wine so I can be comfortable, have good service and make the most out of an otherwise difficult situation.  So Bobby Vans at JFK terminal 8, and the waitress with the awful attitude on Thursday May 18th at 9:30pm thanks for being terrible.  I gave your tip to the one nice person at the restaurant : the guy who actually helped change the channel and had the audacity to chat with me for a bit afterwards.  Sorry that changing a freaking TV channel had to cause such an absolute meltdown with the staff.  Well trained people they are not.",7,4,0,Robert G.,"TriBeCa, Manhattan, NY",0,9,0

Tasty food with good service, I am a fan.The Deets:Note: This review is breakfast time based only. I use JFK more frequently now in morning flights back to RDU. Very early morning. So Bobby Van's is very conveniently located right after the TSA line in Terminal 8. BV's is a nice place, a bit more dressed up than usual airport venues with nice wooden finishes and clean appearance. The staff has been prompt in seating as well as taking care of my beverages/taking my order. As you may imagine, most prices are a bit high but it's airport food, expected. I find a good value is their breakfast sandwich that can be served on a variety of bread options (my fave is English muffin), egg, sausage or bacon, and cheese. It's a good portion for the price comparing to the rest of the menu that can be quite a bit more cost for your breakfast choice (again, expected at an airport eatery).

Second, it's not a bad place to park yourself for a few hours and not feel rushed or pressured to leave. You'll almost certainly need this in Terminal 8, since American Airlines is one of the worst carriers on the planet.The food: skip everything and go right to the steaks, which are A-grade and as good as the stuff in the Manhattan restaurants. Do it, too, because people who go to steakhouses and order ""chicken"" or ""salad"" are just lame and often self-rigtheous diet zealots. The appetizers were pretty bad: French Onion soup was bland, Mac and Cheese a cut above velveeta (with very cheap pasta), and burger had a bun that was either overly toasted, overly frozen, or some combo of both. The strawberry shortcake was basically Sara Lee poundcake, strawberries, and supermarket whipped cream. Look, I may be some non-descript meek AZN, but I can tell a scam when I see and taste one.The plus side besides the steak: it's good service, very attentive and kind and aware of your flight time.

I don't expect much from airport food, and this was right there along with my expectations. I ordered a Caesar salad which was too creamy, the croutons were airy and small, like the packaged variety. It's not hard to make croutons and homemade croutons are a world away from the packaged kind!The onion soup had bacon in it, which our waiter did have the foresight to mention. I wasn't a big fan of the flavor, and the soup itself had a sweetness to it that was almost too much, the broth was just too heavy.The pasta special of the day was linguine with a spicy tomato sauce and seafood. It arrived well past al dente which already turned me off to it. The sauce was thick, dark red and not spicy. The seafood were just mussels and shrimp, and while the shrimp were very large, they were so bland and undercooked.

And then my Nicoise salad arrived and just ugh. I had to saw at the seared tuna with a steak knife. The connective tissue was stringy and the tuna was dry yet slimy at the same time. The lettuce was soaked in a gross dressing and the hard boiled egg slices had a thick black ring around the yolk indicating over cooking. I would rate it as the worst salad I have ever eaten in my life. My one bite of the tuna was chewy/fishy, just horrible. I set the plate to one side. The waitress walked by maybe 3 or 4 times, no ""how is everything?""I eventually caught her eye and asked for the check. She looked at my completely full plate with stringy bits of tuna semi-hacked apart and said ""All set?""

4.0,11/30/2009,"HEADLINE: Exceedingly rare refuge from the typically abysmal airport fare and surroundings ... a spectacular addition to the dining / drinking alternatives for the weary traveler ... business or leisure ... at JFK's Terminal 8 Traveling back to California from CT over the Thanksgiving holidays with the family in tow brought us in touch with this relatively new establishment within Terminal 8 at JFK. The exterior facade of the place was what immediately caught the wife's attention. Having suffered through waaaaaayyyy too many Chili's or MacDonald's during travel, we were intrigued by the place's exterior and then blown away upon entering this establishment. Deep, rich hardwoods (both flooring and wall panels) have been combined with sand-colored marble or granite and glass to create an absolute oasis for the weary traveller. The bar is outstandingly set up with two flat screens behind it. Beautiful glassed cabinets showcase bottles of Veuve Clicquot and Dom. The front room that you enter into is largely set up with dark-stained wood elevated tables that sit two to four, or regular tables that can be configured any which way. The back room seems to be larger and equally accommodating of small or large groups. There is a very large flat screen on the right wall nicely panelled, and the space is open and airy ... very pleasing to the eye. High quality light sconces and chandeliers abound. 'Warm' and 'cozy' and 'rich' are words that I have NEVER uttered regarding any airport facility ... this place outdoes even the finest Admiral Clubs or elite waiting points at any airport I've ever been through. The menu is diverse, though typically biased in a ""good"" steakhouse way ... Starter selections are ample, as are the salad selections. The big entrees are meat-oriented, as you might guess, and their sides (all $6.50 a piece) are very nice to look through as well ... the mac & cheese certainly caught my eye as a side dish but I couldn't rationalize getting that after stuffing my pie hole the last three days straight. Wifey and I ordered the Sirloin Sliders, mine with bacon and blue cheese / hers with bacon and American. Four neat little ground sirloin hamburgers arrived on a plate accompanied by a nice mound of french fries. The sliders themselves were cooked medium and were very tasty. The rolls were of high quality ... not your typical styrofoam whitebread versions. The bacon was done to a crisp ... perfect! ... and the french fries quite possible might have been the best thing on the plate ... skins on, wonderfully salted, perfectly fried, incredible texture, flavorful and not greasy whatsoever ... absolutely outstanding! The college kid ordered up Buffalo Wings and the Quesadillas. I could smell the zing in the wings about ten feet away as the waiter delivered them. He thought they were fantastic, served with a nice portion of blue cheese dressing and the requisite celery and carrot stalks. I tried his Quesadillas ... fabulous ... wonderfully melted cheese, mushrooms and chicken served with side ramekins of sour cream, guac and a fresh salsa (not your typical bottled variety whatsoever). I pounded down two pints of Bass Ale on tap, seriously considering to go instead with Stella Artois ... very cool that an airport bar would have Stella in bottles, much less on tap ... serious props, guys!!! The wife had a couple of glasses of Kendall-Jackson Reserve Chard and the fine glassware was a nice touch ... as were the real metal utensils and chinaware. Tab was not cheap, but I must say, this was the best way to start a long flight back home to California. I would never imagine running into a classy joint like this in an airport. Totally worth the premium given this joint's high quality of ambiance and comfort and food. Do yourself a favor ... especially you business expense account types ... treat yourself and visit this place!!!!!! You won't be disappointed.",0,1,0,Ned H.,"Nipomo, CA",16,116,19
5.0,11/16/2009,"As far as airport restaurants goes, this is gold.  Proper burgers, real knives and linen, attentive service.  They also have a departures screen in the front bar area so you can keep an eye on your flight.  Pricier than your average airport bar and grill, but  the added dignity is worth every penny.",3,0,1,Joe H.,"London, United Kingdom",64,64,6
2.0,10/2/2009,"First things first, this review is just for the air port rendition of the chain and not for the actual restaurants itself.  Second, this is for the non-steak items so take it for what you will.I had a few hours to spend in my layover from London, but I spent most of that time in the airport lounge getting some work done, so when I finally sat down to eat, I was actually in a bit of a rush, and this turned out to not be the kind of restaurant that could accommodate you in a rush.  Now for the non-steak menu, I think there's food that arty-clogging good, and just plain artery clogging, the burger and the steak wrap fell into the latter.  The service was pretty spotty depending on which waiter/ress you got.  The table next to mine seemed pretty happy with theirs, but everyone with ours seemed universally unhappy from the lack of water re-fills, incorrectly placed food orders, and taking forever to get his attention, But maybe it wasn't entirely his fault since someone higher up thought it would be a good idea to give him 8 tables to man by himself. So I were to do over the experience, I would save two hours for the meal and order the steak, assuming of course that I had the two hours, and wanted to splurge $100 on a meal at the airport and not wait to go into the city.",1,0,0,Peter C.,"Washington, DC",8,97,56

1.0,9/21/2009,"This restaurant sucked.  We got to the airport early and decided to stop at Bobby Vans.  We had 2.5 hrs to kill.  By the time we were done, our flight was already boarding.Good thing we had so much time.  We waited 20 min. for the server to take our drink order, then we had to wait so long to get our drinks that my dad went to the bar to get them.  We thought since it took so long to get our drinks we better order right away.  Good thing we did, it took appox. 40 min to get half our food, then another 20 to get some more, and by the time we were done eating, my brother still had not got his sandwich.  Whi;e we were there a couple sitting behind us had the same complaint with the manager.  They switched our server because he got mad because we went to the bar for our drinks.  A couple sitting next to us, ordered drinks only and left without leaving tip because service was so bad.  By the time my brother got his food we had to leave so he scarfed down his food.  They didn't even comp us his lunch, eventhough it took an over an hour to get a sandwich.We didn't tip, and when my dad complained to the manager, he said ok, and the table was only occupied for 47 min.  That's because he took our order and waited forever to put it in.  No apology no nothing.  Its no wonder the service is crappy, the manager looked like a lazy bum, who spent more time eating the food then customer satisfaction.  Huge disappointment, and the food was cold.  Bobby Van's would be nice at a different location.  The Bartender was nice but it stopped with him.  They were all a mess.",1,0,0,Kristle C.,"Gilroy, CA",4,12,1

4.0,9/2/2009,"We got to the airport early for our flight home, and immediately saw Bobby Van's right after security.  Had the special lollypop lamb chops (which were bigger than lollypops) and sauteed mushrooms at the bar.  Absolutely not your standard airport chow - it was delicious - a fitting last meal in New York.    The barman was great, made a great Manhattan according to my traveling companion.  Fun company at the bar, other passengers in great traveling moods,  flying wherever American Airlines flies from JFK.  Departure screen to the bar's left is handy-dandy.   I highly recommend spending time here if you're going through JFK, even if it's just for a drink.  We have nothing like it at LAX which is embarrassing.",1,0,0,Robert M.,"Long Beach, CA",1,91,0
