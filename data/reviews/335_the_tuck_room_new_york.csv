1.0,4/26/2019,This place is terrible. The servers and bartenders try but the drinks are sugary and sweet as hell. The food is bland and the most limited bar menu. A travesty of a place to go before or after a movie. Pass on this and hit another restaurant in the area.,0,0,0,Randy P.,"Riverdale, NJ",88,15,1
2.0,4/22/2019,Not as good as I expected. Food was basic. It was a Friday night & the manager was making the staff do all the extra cleaning that should have been done on a week night. Killed the vibe.,0,0,0,Eva F.,"Isle Of Palms, Charleston, SC",149,5,0

3.0,4/12/2019,"I normally love this restaurant for after work drinks and food.  Today's lunch was disappointing.  Ordered the Tuna Poke and the tuna was in chunks, the rice was dry, the chips burnt, and the onions and tomatoes was sparse.  If the lunchtime chef does not know how to make the dish, it should not be offered on the menu.DO NOT GET THE TUNA POKE FOR LUNCH",0,0,0,Dee R.,"Long Island City, NY",0,2,0
4.0,4/11/2019,Went here for happy hour and we really enjoyed it. The happy hour deal is great but it's a pretty short one (they had 'last call' at 6:40!).

2.0,3/31/2019,"This place is a disappointment for service and food.Venue: (4/5) this restaurant is on the third floor of an I Pic theater.  That's pretty cool.  It has a lounge chic feel to the restaurant.  I saw dates, and groups of all sizes.  The party I was with took a private room and had about 8-10 people coming in and out.Food (3/5) overall ok but misses on many itemsTruffle fries (2/5) - how can you mess up fries? At tuck it was a miss.  The fries came out somewhat warm.  Some were crispy others were not.  No one wanted to get a second order even with plenty of drinksBrussels sprouts (3/5) ok but nothing to remember Calamari (4/5) good.  We reordered this.Pizza (2/5) pass on thisService (1/5) - oh my.  We started to get drinks from  the bar instead of waiting for the waitress to return.  She was pretty slow.  Napkins we had to get from the bar and utensils at times.  I ordered a vodka soda with cucumber she brought a mimosa.  The place was not full but the waitress seemed overwhelmed.",2,0,0,Lana T.,"Financial District, NY",376,334,160
4.0,3/31/2019,"I LOVE iPic and am loyal to them, so I try to eat at Tuck Room each time I watch a movie but to be honest, I rather eat from the movie menu than the limited menu at Tuck. I don't find the food great either, but the drinks and service are fantastic. I recommend sticking to the salads and drinks. The burgers are also good but on the heavy side and quite pricey I might add.",0,0,0,Cheryl A.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",109,43,59
4.0,3/30/2019,Came here bc we wanted something to eat before our movie. We were seated quickly and out waitress was really nice. I ordered the sangria which was pretty good. For food I had the calamari and it was so good I ate all of it lol. For my entree I ordered the chicken Caesar salad. Our waitress was very attentive by checking on us not too overwhelming.

5.0,3/16/2019,"This restaurant is one of the coolest, upscale eateries in New York! I had the best Impossible Vegan burger I've ever eaten. It was far superior to the vegan restaurants I frequent. Cilia was my server. She's a wine expert. I had a crisp, semi sweet, semi dry Pinot Grigio to compliment my burger. It was Cilia's perfect suggestion! The decor is exquisite!

3.0,3/2/2019,"Meh not impressed. I went to the Tuck Room because I was seeing a movie at the same location. Looks like this is a spot for everyone to pre game before seeing their feature so it is very crowded.  I went on a Friday night for the release of Alita Battle Angel.  After standing for a while I was able to secure some seats at the bar.  I grabbed a few drinks, some sliders, and a lobster roll. The sliders were good but the lobster roll was not. It came with some super hard chips that I didn't eat because they probably would have chipped a tooth.  I thought I was ordered drinks from their late night happy hour menu since they had the flyers sitting right in front of me at the bar. When I questioned the bar tender about it she tried telling me that because when I ordered it was a few minutes before ten and that's when happy hour started. Event though I didn't leave until 1145 right when my movie started. I didn't have the time or energy to haggle so I just left. I probably will not return even if I see a movie over here again I will go somewhere else or just order my drinks in the theatre.",1,0,0,Ravon H.,"WINDSOR MILL, MD",139,246,155
1.0,2/23/2019,"I have never written a review worse than 3 stars in my life. I never complain really. We wanted to try the IPic theater below for my birthday. I decided that it would be easier to go to the restaurant right above before instead of somewhere else. I also thought since this place got decent reviews it couldn't be so bad. I also read the reviews and saw some bad ones with food, but figured there was exaggerations.Well it was the worst meal I have ever had in New York City. To start off, I made reservations a week before and said in the comments it was my birthday. They called me to confirm my reservation day of and asked if I had any request. I replied saying no request besides it's my birthday. I come in and tel the hostess my name and she didn't speak and stared at her iPad for 5 min, then took us to a four top right by the elevator. I said I was a bit confused because the whole place was empty. She then moved us to a two top by the window. They never mentioned my birthday once the whole meal.We ordered the ribs and burger. I can't begin to explain how bad the ribs are. I can't quite understand what chef could make something like that, taste it and begin to think that there was any flavor. The coleslaw on the plate actually smelled like garbage. The burger which we asked for medium rare, was medium well and tasted bland. I would not suggest anyone coming here. The one star is for the waitress, she was very nice!",1,0,1,Rebecca F.,"Brooklyn, NY",36,62,5
3.0,2/13/2019,"Came here with some friends who trekked over from Brooklyn. The space is trendy enough without being pretentious.   While all the food we ate was delicious (Mediterranean burgers, poke and Ruben croquettes), we really came here for the beverages. They do have a broad selection of NY beers. My rating was pulled down to three stars by the inexperienced bartender. Her drinks were poorly executed and she couldn't pull a good pour off the beer taps. I suspect she was using a recipe cheat sheet but she still messed up every single cocktail.  Even if you don't have to go, check out the bathrooms to get some ideas for when you renovate your home's bathroom.",4,1,1,L E.,"New York, NY",272,123,0

1.0,1/2/2019,"Been wanting to come here for over a year and looking forward to it! Work a block away from the restaurant, suggest that restaurant to friends and family. My parents were in town and wanted a quick lunch before my dinner shift! Came in at 2:54 at 3:05 ordered our food at 3:31 asked what the status was on our food, the waiter responded it's only been ten minutes, you should have told me you were in a rush! 35 minutes later my salad came out with rotten tomatoes and bland shrimp! Definitely not blackened shrimp! The waiter then tried to up charge 2dollars for sweet potato fries that are no additional increase as stated on the menu for the fried chicken sandwich! My parents food came out with cold fries and sandwich! For someone in the service industry, this was beyond horrible experience not to mention took so long to hail down the waiter I had to leave in to work! 1 hour and counting no appetizers desserts or frills! Do not recommend! The kicker was there were only 2 tables besides us in the place! So there is no excuse for slow or rude service!",1,0,0,Jacqueline Z.,"Roslyn Heights, NY",47,23,13
3.0,12/31/2018,"Place has nice decor. Although it caters to hipsters. You know those foo foo boys in skinny jeans and the girls who aren't sure if they are coming or going. Menu has like 6 items for main courses.  There were a few items we ordered that were not seasoned as described.. For instant they are roasted brussel sprouts were supposed to be roasted with salt and pepper in lemon juice. Well all we could taste was horse radish and the waiter insisted they were not made that way. He told my wife that he would check with the kitchen to see if there is anything they could do and we never heard back from him. I don't recall his name but I believe it was Chris.  I ordered their mango Habanero baby back ribs which I was told was a large portion which turned out to be almost a 1/2 a rack. The mango Habanero sauce was extremely sweet in overwhelmed the ribs. I did not taste any flavor of have a narrow it was almost like a mango sweet-and-sour sauce. The texture of the ribs were perfect they came off the bone easily as they should and had good flavor after I removed the mango sauce.  My daughter order their salmon special for the evening which came with potatoes and roasted brussel sprouts which also had a horse radish taste. Don't get me wrong we love brussel sprouts but when you bite into them and they taste like horseradish it's not appetizing or appealing to eat. My wife ordered a chicken schnitzel which was a very good and she also had the horse radish brussel sprouts. The restaurant is overpriced for their servings. For instance it was $18 for 3 Ice T's. My wife overheard  Our waiter talking to the table behind us who was only seated for 10 minutes explaining that their drinks were coming out late and he would comp one of their drinks due to the inconvenience. This was a little upsetting to us cents he never got back to us about the brussel sprouts. We were not offered anything for the inconvenience of that side item. That is when we realized they cater to hipsters, foofoo boys and dumb millennials.  I do not believe I took any pictures of the food because the lighting is absolutely horrible you need a flashlight to read your menu and see your food once it's brought to the table. I understand a restaurant trying to make a romantic setting but when you cannot see what's on the table it does it make a good impression on a consumer in regards to food presentation. Over all I would give the restaurant of 3 for food, 5 for décor and 2's for the waiter.",2,0,2,Pappy H.,"Pompano Beach, FL",31,201,1578

You have to take two escalators up above the movie theater, so it really is ""tucked"" away :)I love the decor, but that's b/c I'm a sucker for books and library themes. I love the walls of books they have here, and the random antiquey decor. The bartenders were super friendly and helpful, and the small plates we ordered were great.

5.0,12/8/2018,I'm going to sound like an alcoholic but whatever I'm on vacation. I have been to the tuck room 3 times in 1.5 weeks! Why? Because the happy hour is the best happy hour I have experienced since living in manhattan! Ladies- $6 cocktails that actually. has. FRUIT! Call me extra but this is the level of Bougie on a Budget I aspire to be. Happy hour is daily from 4-7pm.. that's right folks includes the weekends! My favorite drink is the ginger fizz drink. They have food during happy hour as well those crispy green beans $7.5 and Korean beef sliders $12 are fireeeee! The also have a live Dj on the weekends. Just go there.

3.0,12/2/2018,"I came here eith my Book Club for a Happy Hour  during the summer.  Let's just say I didn't get happy.  Drinks started at abkut $8-$10 which to me felt like a regular priced drink.  So there wasn't any type of deal or special.  Which meant most of us were sitting there babysitting the same drink practucally our whoke time there.  I also ordered a side of french fries to go with my drink.  They weren't  too bad but it was the only thing I was in the mood for.  The bartender sated the demands of a group of 10 females. He even did a last call for happy hour.  The place itself was very spacious, even the bar.  The bar was like an oval towards the center of the room.  The decor was very upscale and creative.  One of the corners was set up like a seating area in a library or book cafe.  This place would definitely be an ideal date night spot.  It has great atmosphere and the ability to get initmate in an open area.",0,0,0,Elethia M.,"New York, NY",172,212,1058

5.0,10/27/2018,So I met up with some of my friends for drinks and appetizers. The spot is awesome. The drinks are really good. My first waiter unfortunately left but we had a new waitress right after I love your appetizers they are great . And the dessert was really good too. We went when you had the violinist DJ combo. They are amazing. The vibe in the Decour in that space is what I look for when I come to visit my hometown.  I'm an artist so I totally appreciate the artwork in the back room.

2.0,10/13/2018,"Eat somewhere else, unless you are very hungry, you love burgers and you are ready to pay $28 per burger.The bad: We were a party of 4, arrived at 6pm with no reservation and were seated right away. The restaurant/bar is beautiful and was half full. Ordered 2 beers and 2 lemonades. 15 minute wait for the drinks. Ordered 2 burgers, 1 pizza and 1 tuna poke bowl. 30 minute wait, the burgers were great, the poke bowl was a disaster (stagnant taste and decided not to eat it) and the pizza never arrived. The IPA beer we ordered had a rusty flavor. The beer draft system may need some maintenance.The good: Great manager. He withdraw the poke bowl from the table and a asap brought the missing pizza to the table. The pizza was lousy at best. A good frozen pizza tastes much better. To compensate for the bad experience, the very professional manager decided not to charge the poke bowl and the pizza. We decided not to order dessert and bought a great Ben & Jerrys 2 blocks away :-)We will not eat again at this restaurant. However, good atmosphere for drinks.

5.0,10/13/2018,"A+++. The Tuck Room has it all - excellent food, service, and ambiance. With so few good dining options in the area, this new addition to the south street seaport area was desperately needed. Somewhat hidden (take the escalators up two flights when you see the theater), it feels less touristy and more upscale. Interior design is beautiful especially over the bar area and we had the pleasure of sitting in the nook by the windows - loved their oversized plush chairs! Great service as they accommodated our party size change and our server brought us separate checks without so much as batting an eyelash (usually other restaurants give you a hard time when you ask for separate checks and you have a larger party). Also, very clean and spacious bathroom.Food was amazing and great quality. My friends all loved their food, from lobster rolls to salad to dessert. I loved my burger - one of the best I've had in NYC. It was cooked to perfection and tasted great - probably because they use quality meat and season it well. Love the fact that they got the temperature just right - I'm always disappointed when the outside is charred or burnt and the inside is not cooked enough, but I asked for medium and it was perfection! Thoroughly cooked and no charring or burning on the outside of the patty, that's how a burger should be done! Finally someone who knows how to cook a burger in this town! And the fries were great too.

4.0,8/26/2018,"I went here on a Sunday night with a party of 4. The atmosphere is dark and intimate. We got a table next to the windows overlooking the pier.Appetizer = Pork Belly wraps. Perfect mix of flavors. Cute presentation of the dish! I didn't realize we would have to put the wraps together ourselves when we ordered, but it was pleasant. I ordered the The Marrow Burger for my entree, which comes with a mountain of french fries. It was phenomenal. One of the best burger's I've ever had. The burger was not only extremely juicy but it also came with the most delicious, thick pieces of bacon I've ever had on a burger. The portion was more than substantial, they definitely don't skimp out on the french fries! Pro-tip: I saved the sauce that came with the pork belly wraps to eat with my fries... real gooood. Also, one person from my party got the salmon. I didn't try it but she said it was dry, so I'd maybe pass on that.I took off a star because the service was pretty slow. The ordering of our food was prompt, but it pretty much went downhill after that. It took a while to get our food and to get the attention of the servers throughout the course of our dinner. A party at table by us had to go out and look for a server...

4.0,8/18/2018,"Our party of four was looking for a dinner venue near Pier 17. After a quick Yelp search, we decided on The Tuck Room, attracted by the small plate menu. We were seated by the window, which offers light, but only a view of the highway. There is much to like about The Tuck Room, though the Chef Burger is not one of them.Our waitress arrived quickly, and the service was excellent throughout the meal. We tried the Pizza (very good), Chicken Spätzle (delicious), a side of Green Beans (very tasty), and the Chef Burger (not good!). We happen to like our fries piping hot and crispy, and though the initial order did not arrive as hoped, the waitress quickly brought us a large side of fries, perfectly prepared, My personal French fry theory is that, if you're going to consume that many calories, the fries should be awesome. And these were very tasty on the second attempt.Everyone enjoyed their dinners except for the two diners who unfortunately opted for the Chef Burgers. These were dry, fell apart when eating, with too little burger and too much bun. They were a big disappointment. We did like the ambiance, and otherwise enjoyed our dinners.

3.0,7/28/2018,"Made a 2pm reservation during July 2018's NY restaurant week. They had sent me an email advertising their $26 lunch course so my friend and I decided to check it on out. Because it was midday on a Thursday it was fairly empty. Just a couple of tourists having lunch. I'm sure it gets pretty busy and loud but for this time it was very quiet so having a conversation was totally doable. Their bathroom is huuuge and beautiful and clean. I've used it before after seeing a movie on the floor below them from iPic theaters. So that's a wonderfully reliable feature to this place. There is seating and a large vanity mirror.They have a nice bar, didn't sit there though so can't say much about it. I'm not a big drinker either but they have an expansive selection as we've noticed perusing their drink booklet. Super comfortable seating! However, even though it was midday, the ambiance is nice but a little dark for my personal preference. They do have window seating but the inner seats lighting is very dimmed. This would work well for more intimate visits. Would be a nice place to do date night, dinner and a movie downstairs!Overall it was a nice experience, but as others have mentioned there's nothing special about it. Service was okay, food was decent but way too overpriced for it's average quality. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but wouldn't cross it off my list if I was in the area and wanted a reliable place to eat.

We had a blast.  The food was amazing and the service was incredible! It made her birthday such a special time. For the food: Reuben Croquettes - amazing! Tasty little bites of deliciousness! The pastrami was great and the thousand island sauce was creamy and decadent. Then we had the grilled farmers market pizza which was topped with super fresh and bright ingredients.  ""K-Town Short Rib Sliders- yum!! These were my fav! So flavorful and soft. I loved the sauce/ marinade.  We also had truffle fries- which were awesome! Loved the Parmesan cheese on top! That always makes truffle fries better. We also had the Brioche Crusted Crab Cakes- I did not try them because I'm not a seafood person but everyone else liked them. For the Drinks: We got a delicious bottle of wine that was suggested by our server that paired well with everything that we ate! We also tried a few of the specialty drinks that were creative and tasty- a little bit pricey but worth it for one fancy drink!For the Service: Outstanding! Our server was so on point! He was funny, made great suggestions, and made our evening special by bringing out a surprise happy birthday dessert! I wish I could remember his name! The manager was also really sweet!

Upon arrival we were greeted by the hostess then seated. As we walked to our seats I noticed how packed the bar area was. *lightbulb goes off in my head* so I ask the waitress if happy hr is only at the bar and she said yes. Now I am known as the planner to my friends, I research all restaurants before going. There's no mention on the Tuck Room's website of happy hr only being at the bar. Had it said so I wouldn't have chose this location. But I digress...Our  waiter comes over takes our drink order then comes back 10mins later with our drinks. One of the tables being serviced by my waiter had him very flustered. Idk what was going on but I do know because of it we sat 30mins before placing our apps order. Another 30mins before placing our entree order. When the entrees did come which was an additional 30mins the fries were incorrect. We ordered truffle and received regular fries. Waited another 15mins to bring the correct fries. Don't get me wrong my waiter was a very nice gentleman but whatever was going on with him and the other table he was serving effected our service.

We shared a lobster role and Cobb salad. I was thankful that the lobster roll wasn't overloaded with mayo. There was a light dressing which accented the lobster taste very nicely. The cobb salad was refreshing and not heavy at all. You can add chicken, shrimp or lobster if you like. My favorite part was the lychee infused iced tea.

It was happy hour and they let you drink during the movie, so it was a win win!Their sangria was pretty great. I'm not usually a white sangria person at all, but this recipe was a lot spicier than most white sangrias and had a bit of a kick to it. It was very well made and something different than expected.I also tried The Kiss, which was just okay. I wouldn't order it again myself but if you are looking for something light and fresh you might want to try this.The Picpoul de Pinet wine was also pretty decent and a variety you don't normally see on lists, which was nice.The real standout of their list, though, is the Rum Rum Punch! I could drink those forever! I wish they were part of the happy hour but even so they are completely worth the $14. If you love rum, this is the cocktail for you.They also have a by the bottle wine list. I tried the Barbaresco since they were doing half price on bottles. Even at full price, the prices are pretty reasonable, but it was a steal at half off and was amazing.Service was great. It took a while to get the bottle but the bartenders were otherwise friendly and good at making drinks.

We are New Yorkers and are accustomed to expensive restaurants, but we at least expect the food to be decent. For example, the charcuterie board was $36 and there was about 5 small pieces/squares of meat and cheese. It was mostly olives, nuts, and berries. And the meat and cheese tasted like it just came from a plastic package at the local supermarket, something I could have done myself. Charcuterie boards for that price usually include a lot more.

Yelp said they had brunch and when I checked their website I found a brunch menu.  The brunch menu looked so good so I immediately made a reservation.I was surprised we got one on such short notice. To our surprise, we were literally the only ones in the restaurant on a Sunday at 12:00pm. This is probably because in actuality they don't have a brunch menu. I mistakenly looked at the brunch menu for Miami. This can be confusing for people! This location should think about bringing that brunch menu to their New York City location. There's not many brunch places in Fidi, and this would definitely bring in more people. This location has a lunch menu with a variety of burgers. Fortunately, I can always go for a good burger. I got the green goddess burger which sounded better than it actually tasted. I wouldn't order this again. I got the sweet potatoes fries that came with a curry ketchup. I was not feeling that. We split a non wedge cut salad which was pretty tasty, but did not come with the blue cheese mousse like stated. Our waiter was super friendly.We've been for drinks and dinner in the past and have had better experiences. They have very cool nitro alcoholic drinks (I will post a video of my drink).

1.0,4/26/2018,"March 24th was an awful day at The Tuck Room. Today is April 26th and I haven't been back since and it's been the best choice we made. My husband and I (were regulars of the tuck room at least once a week) are APPALLED by how we were treated! We came in at 4:30pm and left 2am but in between our time our beloved servers: Brian, Deion, barback RJ, Miguel and Maria were told not to serve us! When asked why, they said it was because of the incident that should have been taken care of well before causing trouble to our party of 4 in the front row of the bar. Three women were sitting behind us in an area the staff knew they weren't suppose to be for what seems to be 2 hours. In between that time I used the bathroom and walked to my seat (the front row of the bar). I was told by the women to push my seat all the way in and ""I told them you shouldn't be sitting there"". Telling me that I should move my seat all the way in. I do not need to explain that this is physically impossible! They shouldn't be there in the first place. When they tried to start an altercation, I just said ""I'm not petty"" and moved on. I told the staff about this issue, they told me they were right on it. An hour later, it was not taken care of. I recorded them because they were still there and I felt uncomfortable. So I left for 40mins. I only stayed for my husband. When my husband was wondering where I was, I came back. It was then I recorded them in disappointment that they were still there blocking the front row from going to the bathroom. They wanted to once again start an altercation. I told them I should tell the manger and they told me ""no you're not going to tell the manger"". I told them I'm over this and this conversation is over. When we asked to be served more drinks we were told that we were cut off. My husband was cut off from being served as he knew nothing of what was going on. How are we to be treated this way? When we asked the reason, it was mentioned it was at the manger's Discretion. I demanded to ask who the manger was. I waited to talk to the manager, Megan, and was told this decision was made by her and to cut off ""everyone"" but I'm not sure if it was just us when we weren't in the wrong and I reported the problem first. It looked like nothing was done until much later and the reaction was to cut us off with no explanation. None of us were but you can ask the bar staff for proof on that matter. I spoke to Megan and told her she needs to talk to my husband who was shocked at all of this. Completely dissatisfied on how she handled the situation. She told us that she was just cutting everyone off. Saying when stressed that's how she handles things. After explaining the situation I said we don't need to explain any further then she just walked away. When I asked again to be served the barback, RJ told us we STILL weren't to be served. Once again I asked for the manager, Megan and she told us that we WERE to be so served but most of the staff was not informed we were able to be served again. We receive no apology. My husband and I spends tons at the tuck room are disappointed that we made the choice never to come back. If you ask anybody who is on the staff, they will tell you we are not the people who cause trouble let alone threaten people such as the ladies who wanted to start an altercation. Staff will also tell you Megan did not handled the situation correctly. Loyal customers should be treated with respect. The fact that we weren't even asked what happen or our side of the story  is insulting. This SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED. We were embarrassed that we were treated in this way. I hope it's understood that we do not need to bring our business here. There are plenty of other places with better location.Attached are photos proving the fact that the ladies shouldn't be sitting there, blocking the front row from exiting.

Service was terrible from the start: we were at a long table parallel to the bar, and it was unclear if there was a waiter or if we ordered at the bar. 5 minutes passed, no clarity. I went to the bar to order and was informed he'd send a waiter to us, then we literally tussled over the happy hour menu as the bartender grabbed it from me. We knew happy hour was over, we just wanted to see a drink list!Waiter comes, one person asks for a menu and he literally disappears, even though the rest of us knew what we wanted to drink. It takes forever to get a menu, and he drops it off and disappears again!! We finally put in our drink order, and then stand around for an additional 10 minutes waiting. At this point we decided we might as well cancel the drinks and just order at our seats, as the movie was about to start. Obviously no waiter in sight, so I ask the bartender to cancel our order. He insists on looking at my ticket to prove our movie is beginning, which is insane, and then talks to the man painstakingly slowly making drinks and says ours are halfway done, so we wait. 10 MINUTES LATER we have our drinks, and the check has finally come. The bartender clearly lied to us, our drinks were far from ready despite having been ordered 15 minutes before. I made it very clear that this was a frustrating experience, we were lied to about how ready our drinks were, we didn't get comped despite being clearly frustrated, and we were late to our movie. Don't bother, just let the lovely people serving in the theatre take care of you instead of the inept people at the bar.",4,1,0,Whitney M.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",238,1,0

It looks like a cute mix between speakeasy and library, the walls are large bookcases and just overall decor was just super chiq.We had a party of 14 people and were seated in the back which was definitely much more intimate and had the feeling that it was a restaurant all to ourselves. The pre-fix menu was quite nice, there an abundance of food for the price because this is not the first restaurant week that I have ever been to. There was a full three course menu where you walked out feeling...wow I am so full. We started off with a full appetizer, my main course was a salmon - cooked to perfection and the dessert...there were three! Not three options but you got to taste all three!! There was so much desert most of us did not even eat it all.

1.0,9/30/2017,"DON'T COME HERE ! The service here was extremely terrible .I went to the bar during happy hour and the bartenders saw me several times and refused to acknowledge that I was waiting but were so eager to help ""OTHER PEOPLE "". I was waiting 10 minutes until I had to get the bar-backs attention and even he was hesitant to assist me. I told him what I wanted and that I wanted to keep my tab open but he lied to me, and said that they don't keep tabs open. I asked why they don't but he couldn't give me a straight answer until the manager overheard our conversation and said that they would. After that interaction I had to wait additional 15 minutes just to get a glass of wine from the bar. When I finished my drink and wanted to order my second one I told the bartender what I wanted and he just gave me a bad look and aggressively demanded to see my ID. I asked why do I need to show my ID after I've just ordered a drink and they had my tab open on top of that ? But he just looked at me and walked away without a word and was pointing at me to several other bartenders but he never came back to me and he and other bartenders continue to serve ""OTHER PEOPLE"". I've waited another additional 10 minutes and he never came back to me. At this point I've had enough of the blatant disrespect and demanded to get my check and immediately they were quick to give it to me. But it took them over 20 minutes to acknowledge my presence, hesitation of serving me a drink and refusal of a second one. It's clear to me they didn't want people like myself to enter their establishment because I don't look like the demographic of people that they usually serve. I'm a native New Yorker, and lived here all my life and I've never been so disrespected and poorly treated like this. I don't recommend anyone coming to this place. Unless you want staff to be micro aggressive with you. This place has worst customer service and hospitality I've ever experienced in my life.

Very sweet waitress. 5 stars. However kitchen took 30+min for order. Bring fries and kid's pizza at least. So a mixed bag.

The shot was placed in an inverted lime half. So that is not a full shot by the way. I opted to flame it and it was the worst idea.

2.0,8/3/2017,"Mehhhhhhhhhhhh. I guess I'm the odd one out in this sea of great reviews, eh? This place was wholly disappointing. Atmosphere: cool, like a library. Really crowded on a Thursday evening. Made reservations and came 10 minutes early but were asked to wait until it was actually 6:30 (our reservation time). I didn't mind this at all, though. Food: was originally here for restaurant week, but were told EVERYONE in the party had to order restaurant week for any one person to order from the restaurant week menu. I'm almost positive this isn't the norm for all other restaurants participating in restaurant week, unless regulations have changed. So this already turned me off a bit. I opted for the lobster roll with old bay chips. Probably the least appetizing lobster roll I've had, tbh. The bread was bland and cold and was literally half of the entire sandwich. The lobster meat was so little and tossed up with so much sauce (mayo?) and celery that it lost its novelty lobster taste. The old bay chips were so, so stale. It was like kettle chips left out for a few days. And $21, ughhhhh. My friend got the turkey burger and she said it had interesting flavors (not sure if she meant that in a good way). Thought the place would redeem itself by ordering the apple pot pie dessert. This thing was $15 and it was all show. It looks piled high, but then when you break the puff pastry (which by the way is dry af), it is hollowwwwww with maybe a quarter of an inch, about one layer, of diced apples. The only thing I liked was the ice cream that had chocolate chunks in it. Let me reiterate, this dessert cost more than two plates of halal guys, and it was literally three bites without the dry dry puff pastry. You think they would have at least filled the ramekin, but they didn't even fill it halfway. So so ridiculous!Everything is severely overpriced. My friend's sprite was $6! That's a pint of draft beer in some places. YEEEEESH.Service: Severely lacking. Our waitress was nice, and apologized at first, but she never did anything to rectify the situation. During dinner my friend asked for a sprite (as mentioned earlier) and the waitress totally forgot about it until she came back to our area and noticed that we were looking at her.

First off, I really liked the location of the restaurant because it is located in South Street Seaport and it's situated next to all the piers. Before I entered the restaurant on the 3rd floor, I got drinks at the bar on the 2nd floor. I got two cocktails, the Kiss and the Sail Away. The Sail Away was really delicious because the blood orange masked the taste of the alcohol very well. The decor and ambiance of the restaurant is very modern on the hip side and was embellished  by books on the wall and comfy cushioned chairs. The reason why I gave the restaurant 3 stars was mainly because of the food. For Restaurant Week, you don't get a choice for appetizers, but instead you get a sampler plate of 3 dishes. I didn't really enjoy drinking the tomato bisque just because I don't like the idea of basically drinking tomato sauce without any pasta. The salad was what you would expect a mediocre salad to taste. The crab cake was my favorite from the sampler, but wasn't the best. On top of the Restaurant Week appetizer, I also got the calamari, the pizza, and the truffle fries. They weren't anything special. The calamari was interesting because it had gochujang, which added an interesting twist to a classic dish.For the entrée, I got to try the salmon and the mango + habanero bbq baby back ribs (+$6 supplement). The salmon was very well cooked and fresh. However, parts of the salmon was a bit salty. I had very high expectations for the ribs after many reviews raved about how delicious they were. However, I was very disappointed as they were not as flavorful as I had hoped and came to me a bit more on the warm/cold side. The ribs came with AMAZING soft corn bread topped off with a honey glaze and whipped cheese. The corn bread was my boyfriend's favorite part of the meal. I loved it as well. By the time dessert came, I was already super full so sadly I couldn't enjoy all of the dessert. The portion size was huge as it came with a chocolate s'mores cake AND a creamsicle sundae coupe. The sundae was very fruity and refreshing and was not too heavy or rich. While the dessert was very delicious, my complaints derive from the service. I had a party of 6. They only brought 4 plates of dessert at first and dropped one of them, so only 3 people got their desserts. We wanted to wait for everyone to get their dessert before we started eating but the dessert was melting. Also, while the server handed me my dessert, I watched his thumb make his way into one of my marshmallows... I don't really know how I feel about that, but he looked at the marshmallow on his thumb and said oops. Overall, the waiter was very friendly. He could have paid attention to the table a bit more. Our water wasn't really refilled and they kept trying to take plates of food away that wasn't finished yet. I enjoyed the experience and thought the concept of the restaurant was cool but I don't think I will be coming back! A good place to try or stop by to get drinks if you're in the area though.",1,1,1,Kristina Y.,"Hollis, NY",578,61,85
5.0,7/23/2017,"As a native New Yorker I have been fortunate enough to go to many restaurants.  After some time, they tend to not be able to maintain the quality you first remember when you went their for the first time.  Not with The Tuck Room.  They do not disappoint.  I've been there for dinner (scrumptious) and just came from brunch - outstanding.  The food is amazing and the service is top notch.  Today we had Tiffany-Nicole as our server.  Not only is she lovely but the perfect server - sweet, warm, considerate, not overbearing.  The way a server should behave.  When you are next downtown in the Seaport area, check them out.  You will not be disappointed.",0,0,0,Amy E.,"New York, NY",0,20,0

Both were served with a side salad and potatoes. The portions were hearty and delicious. Lucas, our server, was very attentive. He listened to our story about having the day off from work and came back after placing our order to let me know that the onions were raw, then he went back to hold them.

As I go up the escalator I was already woowed, it is beautifully decorated. We arrived and greeted by the host which was very welcoming. Hannah was our waitress and boy she was like welcome to the Tuck Room and to NYC as we mentioned it was our first time .. she was the sweetest and recommended so many items , you can tell that she was sincere about her recommendations... so I was in the mood for ribs and she recommended the Mango Habanero ones, truffle fries, for drinks she recommended the strawberry mojito..and for dessert this vanilla ice cream with orange / Mango type ice with gold leaves it was like a creamcicle... the ribs were to die for .. everything was damn good and I am not exaggerating... The best part is we met Chef Barrios and came to see how our food was and how the service was ... I'm sorry but we have never experienced this at any restaurant even here in LA we felt like freaken awesome. I 1000000% recommend this place.

The place is a beautiful modern hotspot but the staff had a humble, ""we're new"" mentality which made it feel very cozy and fun and not pretentious at all. They have cocktails on tap which is interesting and are actually very good, I had The Kiss. The bartenders brought me an aperitif first that was a smoking riesling with a lime to cleanse my palate before my drink which was really nice. When there was a delay for my guests' drinks, they brought them a tasking cocktail to hold them over. They even moved our table to the lounge area so we could take advantage of the happy hour specials on the appetizers, which by the way, were all pretty good. They were also attentive to the fact that we needed to be in an out pretty quickly because we were seeing a play - this is something they are used to being conscious about because of the movie theatre in the building.

Hell yeah, we'll take some ice cream.

5.0,1/15/2017,Prescreening drink at The Tuck Room. Met the woman whom opened this location (Sally?) and decided to check it out.  As she recommended we Downloaded the iPic app and booked some premium movie seats and are now enjoying great music and drinks in beautiful dimly lit bar while sitting on incredibly comfortable Italian leather stools. This place is great. Friendly bartenders.Large TVs to watch football before movie too.,1,0,1,Maureen H.,"Boston, MA",1,16,20
3.0,1/9/2017,"The Tuck Room is a cool/hip restaurant and bar in Fulton but the service needs improvement.  My wife and I visit the Bethesda, MD iPic and attached restaurant (City Perch) often and while we were in NYC, we decided to visit the iPic and The Tuck Room.  Upon walking in, you are instantly in awe of the murals and paintings on the walls.  It's a very dark space but it has unique lighting and it has a cool/hip lounge feel. We decided to sit at the bar but there was limited seating still available at the bar so we had to sit in front of the ice chipping station.  The ice chipping station at the bar is the spot that the bartenders chip the ice to make large cubes for those who want an ice square in their drinks to limit the melting ice in their drink.  It has a large clear glass to protect the customers on the other side, but unfortunately, when the bartenders chipped the ice, it would still go all over the place and on our plates on the bar-top.  We were at first greeted by a great guy (I forgot his name) and he instantly got our drinks ready (Cabernet and Moscow Mule).  The Moscow Mule wasn't too bad, and my wife's wine was fine.  We ordered a Shrimp Cocktail and a Farmers Market Pizza.  Both food items were brought over quickly and were both very tasty.  Again, the ice chipping station and glass got in the way of dropping over items.  All of the sudden, the bartender we first started with disappeared.  I'm guessing his shift was over because he was no where to be found.  We were then stuck with a bartender who didn't really care about us at all.  A young woman (I believe maybe was a manager) came by and asked if we needed drinks and I said yes, but she ultimately forgot about us and carried on with whatever else she was doing.  We had some friend visit us at the bar and it took a long time to get the bartenders attention and it wasn't that busy since it was a Sunday evening.  We did one more drink at the bar and then we left to go to our movie.  Again, it took awhile to get the attention of someone so I could pay my bill.  Overall, the food was very good and the place has a good feel, but since the service wasn't anything great, there are probably better options within the city.  If I'm visiting NYC again, I'm not sure I will personally visit again.",0,0,0,Brian A.,"Annapolis, MD",82,67,316
5.0,1/3/2017,"I went there for Christmas.  A friend was in town, and I begged out after Christmas dinner to hang out.  They wanted something to eat, so we looked to see what was open and chose this place. The cocktails are great.  They go down smooth, but have some kick to them.  They were good.  And then there was the burger, since my friend insisted on me eating red meat. Look, I know it costs close to $30. Yes, I know you can get multiple burgers at Five Guys and still afford some Cajun fries afterwards.  But trust when I say this burger was divine.  I never had a burger that rich without being greasy.  That ground brisket is amazing, almost better than sex.  It made my night.  It's a bit on the pricy side, but it's definitely worth a treat.",1,1,1,Todd G.,"Queens Village, NY",33,25,0
4.0,1/1/2017,"3.5 stars review***I came here for lunch yesterday with a 12p reservation. We were two of maybe 6 people dining so it was pretty dead for a Saturday. Decor and layout was nice. We both ordered the chef burger which was delicious. Bacon in the burger was on point. The reason this review is more of a 3.5 versus 4 star review was that the fries and burger were served almost 17 minutes (timed it) apart. By the time the burger finally arrived, the fries were cold. The wait for the burger was fine but minus points for not serving together.",0,0,0,Kami S.,"Chelsea, Manhattan, NY",148,99,118
4.0,12/22/2016,"I've come here twice so far (lush) and both experiences have been pretty great. One for dinner with one friend that's a foodie and once for a group lunch. I actually even would be tempted to come back another time to be honest (although, prices are a bit high), but there is a hidden bookcase lounge area for members of the movie theater. Which I so happened to totally sign up for for their free promotion a few months ago. (Things Ingrid has to scratch off her to do list when she goes to see a movie here). I digress. This is a chain high end restaurant by the way. They also have locations in Houston, Miami, and LA. Probably also adjacent to fancy movie theaters. For dinner I've tried the New England Lobster Roll - really fresh, really outstanding and flavorful, super buttery and some of the freshest lobster I've ever had. Red Hook who? This is so much better. Insanely shocking for a theater restaurant. Spicy sweet pork belly wraps - There are so many components to this dish, but overall its very very good. It's a make your own tapas booth pretty much. Reminds me a bit of PF Chang's lettuce wraps. You have your bib lettuce, some citrusy limes, radish slices, diced jalapenos, a variety of spices and salts, cilantro - all displayed out for you to prepare yourself together to your desire. Pork belly was a little dry but super flavorful. Entrees - Damn, get the chinatown duck. This is up there for one of the most hearty and amazing dishes I've ever had duck wise in my life. Glazed in hoisin sauce with a crispy exterior, it was essentially, a mound of glistening pulled duck meat. The additional sauce on the side to dip in was also pleasurable, since it had been warmed. Accompaniment of fresh ginger, carrot, pickled vegetables, cilantro, and a make your own bahn mi style situation was set up. The rolls were kind of like a cross between dinner rolls and egg bread. They were interesting. Less of a bun and more of an eggy texture but definitely pleasurable. I'm still having dreams over this duck and it lasted me about 3 meals. My friend went with the signature Marrow Burger, which is supposed to be their star menu item. It was a great burger. Ground brisket, short rib&chuck, bone marrow aioli, smoked cheddar, and candied espelette bacon. Not the best burger I've ever had though. So many fancy meats jumbled together does not make one great. Hmmm. Happy hour you can get marked down appetizers to $10 and $5 beers, $7 cocktails and wine I believe. Not horrible for the area. Normal hour prices its a bit expensive. Some of the dishes are outrageously marked but I think the duck is definitely one of those random pieces that is worth its price tag.My experience for lunch was a bit different. Tried a variety of sliders. The portobello is outstanding as well as the pulled pork. Truffle fries and fried green beans (who would think this is a thing) are freaking great. I went with the Green Goddess Turkey burger, which I kind of regretted later. It was good but dry as hell. Flavorful, but dry as hell. It's hard to make a decent turkey burger moist though, I will give you that. It had goat cheese (very sparse), with a mediterranean flare and very thinly sliced cucumbers. The green sauce was kind of neat. I have no idea what it was, basil and harissa? The Greek's answer to pesto sauce? I enjoyed that, wish it was mixed more with like a mayo into an aioli or something to help with the dryness. Other people ordered pretty much every other burger on the menu. Thought the Boss looked the most impressive (double stacked cheeseburger, dripping with jerk thousand island sauce, but it also looked like the hardest to eat for a lunch when I had to also go back to work. Overall, thoughts - I would come here for an over-priced dinner over an over-priced lunch. There are better burger places nearby for way cheaper. Come for happy hour for the discount apps and drinks, check out the hidden bookcase lounge. It's worth checking out. Get the duck.",3,1,2,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",843,1384,11457

They're dealing with opening pains but the space, the old Fulton fish market, is a great spot. Interior is dark with nice subdued lighting and a great looking bar. The marrrow burger is ridiculously good as was the poke bowl and the charcoal shrimp with beets. Schnitzel was good also. Friendly, hard trying staff still needs a little more time under their belts but it was very pleasant overall experience. I think they could do really well here if they continue to improve.",0,0,0,E J.,"Smithtown, NY",0,34,0
2.0,12/16/2016,"I've been to The Tuck Room 3.5 times:  1st: I saw a movie at the iPic and when using the rest rooms discovered The Tuck Room.  I thought it looked like a great venue.  Fun music, cool decor. I liked it.  2nd:  I sent emails to the contact on the website about a reservation that went unanswered.  Since I live in the neighborhood, I decided to stop by and ask in person about a reservation for a holiday happy hour.  Max was very helpful.  He gave me contact info for the Events Manager and even a coupon for a lunch.  Again, fun music and cool decor.  It was a nice place to grab a drink with my friend and get answers to my questions- although a bit more effort required to get answers about a reservation at a venue than I've ever gone through before.  3rd:  The lunch was good.  Food was tasty, service was attentive, and atmosphere is fun.  I had the ceasar salad and my friend had the breakfast sandwich.  Because it is relatively new and not known as a lunch spot, we pretty much had the whole place to ourselves.  This is the "".5"" because it never actually happened:  I continued to email and call about a reservation for over a week.  Emails (to the contact provided by Max) requesting party package details went unanswered and phone calls directly to the Tuck Room directed me to send another email.  It was disappointing since Max insisted that a reservation for a group happy hour would be possible and that they were excited for more people in the neighborhood to come experience the Tuck Room.  The convoluted process to make a reservation for a party and lackadaisical responses from multiple communication channels did not match that message.  Clearly, some kinks that need to be worked out with how they set guest expectations and handle communication.  We hosted our holiday event at another venue around the corner and had a great time.  All of us have pretty blase feelings about what the Tuck Room has to offer because of the way the treat returning and potential customers.  Service seems like a low priority for them- an interesting approach for a new place.  Overall:  There are plenty of other places in this area that will match the food/drinks/ambiance, beat the price, and be more appreciative of your business.",1,0,0,Hannah Z.,"Manhattan, NY",147,13,0

The drinks were quite inventive as well. Portions of the restaurant have drapes that can create some privacy from the rest of the restaurant. So for those considering a private function, this could be your perfect venue. In terms of food, I enjoyed the turkey  and grilled avocado - halved and served with shallot avocado mousse. The kitchen was also flexible about tailoring the food to our dietary restrictions.Overall a great experience though because the music can get quite loud (but not too loud!) it may not be the perfect setting for a quiet, serious chat!",0,0,0,Shulin T.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",22,238,402

The only thing that I would suggest them stepping their game up with is the food and drinks. I ordered the Fulton punch which was tasty but full of more ice than anything else. When my drink was finished and the ice melted, my glass was 3/4 full of melted ice. For food I ordered the lobster roll, which I am willing to pay anything for a lobster roll as long as it's worth it, so let me just say I've had bigger and better lobster rolls with the soup man for only $10 and iPic lobster roll was twice that amount and half the amount of lobster inside.

1.0,10/24/2016,"I had been told prior to the grand opening of The Tuck Room that there was a hidden bar behind the bookshelf. So when I went this weekend I asked a the hostess about the hidden room and how I could go about getting into the hidden bar. Having frequented PDT and Laws Raines Room I wasn't sure if there was a certain way I had to go about making reservations. The hostess was rude and obnoxious. She looked at me like I was crazy and said there was NO hidden bar. So I asked ""if it wasn't a bar then what was behind the bookshelf?"" to which she replied condescendingly ""the only thing behind the bookshelf is the wall"". My friend and I went downstairs to watch a movie and decided we wanted to keep drinking once the movie was over.  So we went back to The Tuck Room and lo and behold the bookshelf was open and you could see clearly into a beautifully furnished bar. When we walked up to the hostess again she refused to speak to us and told another hostess ""they want to see the room"". This second hostess wouldn't explain why we were lied to about the room and told us that the room was for premiers"".Let's circle back to the fact that this bar is inside of an iPic theater. And not some celebrity hotspot. If the room is for premiers that's all the first hostess had to say. Not lie about it and especially not be rude, condescending, and nasty. Safe to say I won't be coming back. And should you decide to come here you should ask the hostess about the secret hidden bar just for fun.",13,5,3,Jennifer B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,1
