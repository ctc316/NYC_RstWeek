5.0,4/22/2019,"We decided to risk this restaurant even after seeing the 3 1/2 star yelp rating. Anytime I go into a restaurant with low expectations, it is hard to raise them. This restaurant did exactly that. We started off with an array of fried seafood and vegetables, that was delicious. For my main course, I had scallops, they were delicious, cooked perfectly and with a divine sauce. My partner got the seared tuna, which was seasoned, and cooked, perfectly. Furthermore, my experience was only bettered by the amazing atmosphere, and the warm, attentive service. Ignore any bad review about this place: it is one of the best in town.",0,0,0,Trevor R.,"Williamsburg, VA",0,3,0

2.0,4/10/2019,"We went to Cesca last week before seeing Seinfeld, so it was very convenient being close to the Beacon.  But the experience was terrible.  The place was very busy and at times, it seemed like they couldn't handle it.  The maître d' took our order and got us drinks.  But they forgot about us (many waiters walked right past us as if we weren't there). We didn't get our food until 9:10 and we had to be at the Beacon by 9:30.  The Tuna was fishy and dry, which 2 of us had.  We felt neglected and rushed.  For $65/person (without tip), I expect more.",0,0,0,Anthony L.,"Purchase, NY",113,1,0

1.0,3/17/2019,"Waited very very long time for our order and only served 2 of the 5 items we ordered.  The part of order that did come was very subpar.  I am giving one star because there isn't a zero star option.  I live few blocks from this restaurant and haven't been in a year.  Stopped in for brunch at 12:30pm this weekend with my husband and 4 year old son.  The restaurant was busy but not full so they seated us right away.  After ordering, we waited 20+ minutes and had a hard time finding our waiter during that time.  He never stopped to check in on us or to update us on our food.  When we did flag him down and asked about our food, he said he would go check.  Waiter came back to say they were working on food and not his fault the restaurant was busy ad kitchen was having issues.  Then we waited another 15+ minutes and didn't hear from him.  I was about to get up and leave when our food came.  However, they did NOT serve my son's main entree and 2 other side dishes we ordered.  Instead of asking for the missing dishes and waiting even longer, we just gave up on those dishes.  I was so irritated by the experience I wasn't hungry anymore anyway.  My eggs Benedict had the thinest slice of ham with very soggy (water?) english muffins that were not toasted, my salad not dressed.  They really shouldn't serve brunch if they can't get brunch dishes right.  When we got our food we asked for the check (we were running late to an appointment) and asked to speak to the manager.  The manager did not come and speak with us.  I also need to mention that the initial check included an item that was not served to us.  We had that corrected.  This neighborhood restaurant is permanently off my list.",0,0,0,Lynn J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0

2.0,3/1/2019,Used a Pulsd deal and was really excited about trying a new restaurant with what appeared to be decent reviews. Completely let down as the actual menu we were sat with was replaced with a completely different menu with different inferior menu options. Salmon was hard. Veal and beef ragout was tasteless and the replacement ice cream (instead of the homemade sorbet on the menu). It was clearly store bought. I thought the point was to attract new clientele via these deals not subject potential new customers to a inferior experience. Disappointing.,0,0,0,Karim T.,"New York, NY",102,7,4
2.0,2/18/2019,"There was a time in the not-so-distant past when Cesca was a more than reliable choice for upscale Italian.  These were the days when the food packed some punch, the restaurant had life, and the servers had personality. Those days are gone.  Our most recent dining experience at Cesca was, in a word, weird.  We were welcomed rather perfunctorily and escorted to our table along the foyer that connects the bar area to the main dining room.  Taking quick stock of our surroundings, it felt as though we had been dropped into a parade of rejects that nonetheless found a home at Cesca.  The group included a gentleman wearing workout clothes -- shorts and a t-shirt -- as if he had come directly to a Friday night dinner at Cesca from the gym, some Eurotrashy couples sporting soccer jerseys and cameras as if they had just stopped in from a tour of the Empire State Building, and, well, us.The first person to stop by our table to take drink orders seemed most unpleased to see us, or to be taking our order, which it took her several minutes to return with.  One of those cocktails - advertised on the drink list as a spicy cucumber margarita, tasted like a glass of water with a few squeezes of lime juice.  No spice, no cucumber, no tequila.  I suppose ordering a margarita at an Italian restaurant was a mistake, but why list it on the menu as one of your few featured cocktails if you don't know how to make it?  In sending the drink back for a glass of wine instead, I framed my criticism a bit more gently, but it was received poorly all the same, without any apology.At some point, mercifully, another server took over.  She was friendlier and even willing to tell us what the specials were.  After what seemed like an eternity--and after watching other tables order after us and get their food before us--our salad and octopus arrived.  I fear they fetched it out of the Hudson River it took so long.To be fair, it was fine, and the pasta dishes that followed it were decent as well.  None of it was special or close to special--hardly satisfying enough to justify the well-above-market prices they continue to charge.  At bottom, Cesca continues to make decent food, but you'd be much wiser to order it for pick-up or get it delivered, than deal with the excruciating experience of actually sitting through a meal there.  Life is too short to eat out at inhospitable places, particularly when their food isn't great.",0,0,0,Noah X.,"New York, NY",0,27,0
4.0,2/18/2019,"Truth be told, I've lived down the street from this place for well over a decade, and only came in once before for a drink..  so what brought me in?  My neighbor and I decided to break bread, and we wanted to try something new..  plus had a 20% off discount, so we figured what's to lose?We had a light dinner..  the main dining area is very cozy, feels like someone's living room..  lots of fabric so it was lively on a Friday night, without being loud.  Server was great, attentive..  and the manager made a point to say hello and even take our order.   We split a simple salad which was totally adequate, but doesn't warrant the 4*..  the bread served was fresh from the oven, and its companion tapenade was excellent.  Our mains were the mushroom truffle ravioli and the scallops with fava bean puree and mushrooms.  Both dishes were top of their class, and were just shy of $30, but given the environment, level of service, and quality..  were well worth it.  I've been in way too many ""uppity"" Italian places that just do mediocre food at this same price point and you're left feeling like there is no value.  I will return..  for lazy 'round the corner special occasions.",0,0,0,Andrew B.,"New York, NY",4,11,0
5.0,2/14/2019,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time here at 'cesca.  I walked in worried, since it was lunch hour, and it was quiet almost silent inside as we were seated. There were curtains surrounding tables which gave it a stage like feeling, especially when you take a look at the polished wooden floors which feel tasteful.  For the prix fix menu for restaurant week, I had a fantastic time with my teacher friend from LaGuardia.  It was an amazing experience.  The waitress and the manager were super professional and classy.  They answered our questions, and they shared suggestions of wines and also told us what most people enjoyed when visiting.  We had some white and red wine, and our glasses were never empty.  Our dessert was spectacular.   Our selection was the Tirimisu, which was totally worth it in my humble opinion.  I felt like I was in Italy, which I was when I studied abroad my junior semester.  My favorite part of the evening was Anatra or the seared duck breast, with butternut squash puree and grilled zucchini. That dish alone was quite breathtaking and measured up in terms of flavor and taste.  I was impressed by the elegance and ambience of the restaurant as well as the elegance of the staff.  I could tell that the people who worked here invested in making people feel at home and welcomed especially if they are just visiting or here for Restaurant Week.  It was an unforgettable experience, and my friend and I are planning a future visit back again soon.  I can't wait.",1,0,0,Polly H.,"Queens, NY",212,919,770

1.0,2/8/2019,"Over an hour later. Still waiting for our entree. Wow. I miss the original Cesca. Let me count the reasons. Okay. So, I am a long-time resident of the UWS. I miss All State (best fried chicken ever). And Telepan; I miss Telepan terribly. Currently enjoy Oxbow Tavern w some regularity, Cafe Luxembourg for classics and old times' sake, Jean Georges for something special, and a whole host of other less upscale and pricey places, but very tasty restaurants. For years, the original Cesca was high on my list: they prepared delicious fresh grilled fish, the best scallops over cauliflower purée that you'll ever have, and many other yummy things. The service was excellent, the wait staff professional and attentive, the ambience just lively enough at the bar, and elegant in the main dining room. And, like the servers on the floor, the bartenders were also always professional and attentive. Cut to about 18 months to two years ago. The place was sold. I went in with a friend and sat in the main dining room. Halfway through my meal I discovered a cockroach crawling up the wall next to me. When I pointed this out to the waiter he did anything but apologize, and he certainly didn't try to get it. The hostess was of no help either. That kept me away until this past Friday night, February 8, 2019.  My husband and I sat at the bar. The coziness of the original restaurant is gone; they've added more tables, it's noisy, and populated by folks that I might've seen at  a 2nd Ave. bar/ Burger joint back in the late 70s. I was a young teen at the time grabbing a burger after a movie with friends, but it wasn't lost on me that the bar was really a pick up lounge. This is what Cesca's bar has become. You sit at the bar paying just as much for food as you did at the original restaurant, watching and hearing dishes tossed into a bin at the end of the bar, at bar height. Not exactly what you expect when you're spending 37 bucks on your scallop entrée. Oh by the way, they now serve only 4 scallops, tasteless and ill-prepared over a thimble full of cauliflower purée. The kale Caesar salad looked a mess, I kid you not, a mess. No care was taken to presentation. The diner one Avenue over  takes more care to presentation. It was also under dressed. When I asked to please send it back and have appropriate dressing, one of the bartenders quickly gave me another drink as though that would make up for what shouldn't have been a problem to begin with. The fried cauliflower -, I've had better fried cauliflower ... really many places. Oh, I almost forgot the bread that seemed to be warm, was actually still frozen and cold in the middle once you tore a piece off. Once upon a time the bread was a highlight at Cesca. Shall I go on? Yes, wait: the bathrooms were a mess with overflowing trash cans and no remaining paper towels. The new owners are banking on the name and reputation of the original Cesca. But, their restaurant is really pretty awful, and quite frankly the amount of money they are charging for lousy food shows a stunning lack of integrity and raw, unadulterated greed. Save you money. If you like good food, professional wait staff, and a true dining experience, go to Oxbow or, really, anywhere else in the neighborhood.",2,0,0,M. S.,"New York, NY",0,25,0

We not only enjoyed the service and the food but the spaciousness of the restaurant where you can choose the space you are most comfortable in. We will come back, I would like to have other friends experience what we did (hopefully with another Pulsd),  taste other dishes and request a table in another area to have the full experience.

It was flabby and tasteless.   What was worse was the recommended pst dish of tagliatelle in a Bolognese sauce. In a word - BLAND.  This was not even mediocre food.  Below average for sure.

Never asked us a question.  I heard him ask other patrons at the tables around us how their meal was.  He also brought us our desserts. Which was a perfect opening for him to ask us a that question.

I've also had a really lovely dinner in their spacious and well appointed dining room (One of the better things about this place- you can dine in relative peace without other diners being on top of you). HOWEVER... we recently decided to eat here for brunch, which is a relatively new thing for them. The host and waitress staff are completely lovely. The prices are reasonable- and we wanted to up our game as per the usual neighborhood diner fare.  But what a disappointment! I ordered the Salmon Benedict~ not a complex dish. But this was truly below par. WAY below par. When the food finally came out (long wait time), the eggs were cold, the english muffin wasn't toasted (even the diner gets this right!), the hollandaise sauce was on the sweet side and the salmon was just... off. I didn't finish it. Not fresh. The salad that came with it was more like an afterthought- from a bag of mixed greens just tossed on the plate. The potatoes were cold and completely without flavor or seasoning. I had to ask for salt, which is not kept on the tables for some reason. I would have expected this quality of a meal from a lesser establishment, but not from Cesca. The kitchen is clearly off. On our way out, we enquired as to whether or not the place was under new ownership. Sure enough, it has been, for the past year. Now I'm beginning to understand why they're serving brunch. They're also going to start doing lunch. I hope that they get the kitchen in shape, or this place won't last. It has certainly lost its luster.",2,0,0,Nyc Y.,"Manhattan, NY",0,24,0

I ordered a beer when my food arrived and 15 minutes later still no beer. I asked another waitress, still no beer. Finally I spot our waitress and remind her about the beer.

Beautifully decorated, great style, lovely service.  It is deceptively large inside and there's pockets of tables you can partition off for a private dinner party.  Seems like a perfect spot for a date, dinner with friends, or a family night out.  I immediately thought ""my mom would love this place.""I had a Puls'd deal and went with an appetite (2 apps, 2 entrees, 2 desserts, & a bottle of wine for 2).  We split the burrata and Caesar Lacinato (kale), both delicious and the waiter brought us some crusty bread which was wonderful.  I have to recommend the pasta, the tagliatelle bolognese was out of this world.  Cooked perfectly and evenly dressed with savory, sumptuous veal/beef ragout. All other pasta's that passed by onto other patrons looked equally as delectable.  My partner ordered the pollo, juicy inside with crispy skin outside.  It came on a perfect bed of Brussel sprouts and turnips. We were stuffed, but opted for the sorbet and a special orange cake with gelato for dessert.  Sorbet is always a delight, but the orange cake was the star - tasted like a creamsicle dreamsicle! I don't recall the wine, it was the waiter's recommendation.  A lovely Sangiovese blend, fruit forward with savory and earthy tones to round it out.Fantastic experience and would definitely return to try more pasta!",0,0,0,Julia S.,"Queens, Queens, NY",2,27,2

1.0,11/10/2018,"This used to be one of my favorite restaurants on the UWS and my husband and I were sadly disappointed with our experience there last night. We immediately noticed that the ambiance was completely different. The lighting in the bar area where we always love to sit was much brighter. It used to have warm, low lighting that created a charming and intimate bar dining experience. It became clear pretty quickly by the feel of the place that it is under new management or ownership. When we went to sit at a high top table a woman was occupying additional seats with her shopping bags and handbags. Turns out she worked there! We next saw her walk by with plates of food that she served to someone. Then she moved her bags to a different high top table where she and the manager stood ""guard"" over the bar area. Our waitress was barely communicative and basically grunted to us. The food was ok but the lighting, loitering managers/owners, and unfriendly service made for very poor ambiance. I doubt we will ever go back. It's sad because I used to love this place.",3,0,0,Camille M.,"Manhattan, NY",1,6,0
5.0,10/28/2018,"We were going to an 8:00 concert at the Beacon last night with some friends. We were staying in the Theatre District, and I had brain fade and didn't book a restaurant for dinner. So there was nothing to be had around our hotel until after 7:30, no help.I scrambled and started looking in the Beacon area,  figuring the theatre crowd wouldn't be packing joints that far uptown. Found Cesca, reviews looked good and they could seat us at 6:30. Normally a restaurant in the Amsterdam/75th St. area of the UWS that could take a last minute reservation for four at 6:30 on a Saturday night would spook me, but we were in a bind.I needn't have worried, they knocked our socks off! The service was a bit slow, but the food, ambiance, and general experience was top notch. We had a mix of dietary demands at our table, vegetarian, pasta, steak & seafood, and they accommodated each of us beautifully!I highly recommend this gem, and we will be making the trek up to the UWS again soon to enjoy their fare and hospitality.",0,0,0,Jeff G.,"Webster, NY",1,26,8

3.0,10/16/2018,"A peculiar, chaotic, fair-to-somewhat decent experience. Cesca has been on my radar for ages, seeing that I've been an UWS resident for a number of years now. I've walked past it numerous times, not bothering to stop in and/or making reservation due to my sweeping judgment about ""upscale"" UWS restaurants. Though I do love living up here, the dining scene here is probably the worst of all city neighborhoods. At least all Manhattan neighborhoods. There are a few solid spots around here and even better ones up in Harlem, but I'm hesitant to put Cesca in that category. Though the food was adequate overall, it bored me. There was nothing special, nothing memorable. Just a bunch of somewhat-decent, overpriced Italian food. My advice? Spend your money elsewhere.Came here as part of a large party on a Saturday night. We did the pre-theater three course menu and according to my uncle, they let him bring his own wine (it's not a BYO establishment). The food was pretty boring but behind us, the servers were flitting around with far more energy. Being right next to the Beacon, I imagine that pre-show dinners are often this crazy. I'm not sure if I've ever dined with a party this large, so it was a new experience getting to see how a large group is handled at a steady clip. Though we didn't order any wines from Cesca's menu, I did get the chance to try a few cocktails. I remember that mine contained fig-infused vodka and was quite tasty. I asked the waiter what he thought of it before I ordered it, and he responded that it's ""great for the ladies"" which nearly changed my mind about ordering it. If I had been more drinks in at that point, I imagine that this waiter would've become victim to a short-but-mighty, overly PC diatribe from yours truly.  But instead a ""ha ha, okay"" and a one very indulgent eye roll was all I could muster. I'm not sure if this is how it usually works here with the pre-theater fare, but appetizers were served family style. I tried the mussels and the kale salad, both of which were okay but just tired. The kale salad was fresh but appeared to be as simple as baby kale, parmesan, and maybe light dressing. I was the only person at the table who ate it. Guess it was just the *obligatory vegetable at an Italian restaurant*. The mussels were perhaps a bit better, but as someone who adores mussels, these did not excite me. My entree was the Faroe Island salmon filet, served w/ caramelized fennel, Gaeta olives, roasted plum tomatoes, sunchoke puree. This was probably the highlight of the night. The caramelized fennel was just fabulous, great flavor to it. Had the salmon cooked medium and I was happy with the execution on that. I thought the flavors all blended well together and the sunchoke puree rounded it all out nicely. Italian places like their pasta but they've gotta have a solid salmon preparation, too.So, other than the very outdated comment by our waiter, the service was solid. We got desserts to share at the end, nothing too exciting--cheesecake, tiramisu, all straightforward, classic stuff. Cesca just plays it safe and seems to have been doing this for a number of years now. It's a shame that there's not exciting dining culture in the 'hood, because I don't think a place like this would be sustainable in a place like the West Village. But for now, I guess Beacon-goers who don't mind some overpriced, dependable fare will continue coming here. And sometimes that's all ya need.",5,2,3,Molly T.,"New York, NY",887,463,1480

My friend and I sat at the bar where he took superb care of us. We had dinner -- the kale salad and mushroom ravioli were delicious, btw. The meal was perfectly timed and the wine was nicely paired.

She loves salads and said it was the best she has had anywhere with a light fresh and tasty dressing. I started with the artichoke hearts and was blown away. Some kinda chef magic in the prep of that dish. For our main courses, she had the seared tuna and I had branzino. Both were perfect.

But why bartender says there's no ticket he can't make drinks? The waiter lied. He didn't even send the order. No good. Bringing ketchup after we asked THREE times and finally gave up and finished the entire dinner. We laughed when the waiter said ""I told this guy to bring it up but blah blah"" dude. It's JUST NOT okay to find excuses instead of simply apologizing and being honest. We were nice enough to comment how nice it was that the manager came over and that it made our night a better one, then the waiter was so dismissive he was like ""oh okay thanks"" then just walked right away. What????? It is a joke. A bad joke. That's when I decided to write a review.

The Bolognese and fried cauliflower appetizer were delicious but I won't be headed back soon because the service is really subpar. We went on a Friday evening at 8:15pm and there were very few people there, but getting the waitstaff's attention to order anything was very difficult. The drinks took a very long time coming out next, and the waiter told us there had a been a backup at the bar. That's completely fine, but a lot less believable when the waiter took so long to see us at any point and each dish took a long time. The nail in the coffin was yet another delay just to pay the check. It shouldn't ever take over an hour to receive your main dish if that dish is pasta.

At the tail end of our meal, a gentlemen I presume to have been the manager gave us a complimentary yet generous refill of wine since our bottle was done before we got to dessert.  The girls and I will definitely be returning soon, and might place this as one of our staple restaurants in our monthly ""get together"" dining rotation since we loved it so much! 10/10 would recommend !",0,0,0,Ivana M.,"New York, NY",3,19,0

5.0,6/24/2018,"Once again, my wife planned a wonderful Saturday evening for us as she carried over the celebration of my birthday, several days earlier. So then, tonight's venture would include dinner at CESCA's on West 75th St followed by an 8PM DOO WOP performance at the Beacon Theater;this would be our first visit to Cesca's.For us, we avoid the typical pre-theater rush; we carefully select our restaurants as our time (and funds) are two very important factors that serve to make for an enjoyable dining experience. It was for those reasons that we chose CESCA, and we are so elated that we did!Arriving with 6:15PM reservations, we were greeted warmly and shown to our table without any delay. We were also given a choice of other tables to choose from which was an unexpected perk. My first impressions of Cesca were very positive: very attractive dining area, bar, open kitchen. The placement of tables afforded significant distant in-between them. The design theme evoked casual elegance, yet was still conservative. I now knew this would be an enjoyable dining experience.Without any delay, tumblers of water were placed on our table along with fresh bread and a tomato paste spread. Our drink order arrived quickly. Our server, Staka, was very personable, yet transparent; somewhat similar to having your own personal table attendant. Our drinks were mixed perfectly. Staka even provided me with extra jumbo olives for my Martini as requested!Our dinner arrived well within the expected time frame. Both of us had apps which we raved over; our main courses were both delicious and plentiful! The timing between primo and secondo was excellent! We immediately noted the degree of freshness of our food as well as the unique flavors. Seated not too far from the open kitchen brought the scent of the Chef's culinary skills within reach which heightened our overall experience.Overall, dining at Cesca's was a unique experience. No stress, no issues, a genuine class operation, yet unobtrusive. Management stopped by several times to inquire if all was OK. Again, our server, Staka, made it all happen; almost like being in your own private dining room.

Cesca was the perfect Italian experience I could have asked for. Walking in, you can tell they take great pride in the decor and experience they would like you to have. Greeted by a lovely gentleman at the door, we were escorted to our table. We were a party of 6 women (you can imagine the noise) and were seated thankfully in this beautiful private area of the restaurant so our noise didn't disturb the rest of the diners at the establishment. Almost immediately the manager of the restaurant came over to us and told us he'd be taking care of us this evening and what can I say? It was one of the smoothest dinner services I've been to. We ordered the best dishes on the menu and didn't have to wait long before they came out the kitchen. My favourite dishes of the evening was the burrata, carciofi, tagliatelle, & steak tagliata. They make the burrata with apple sage puree and crushed pistachios. It was so different, tasty and pleasant. The steak was cooked at a perfect medium rare, absolutely juicy and delectable. Not a single dish had a crumb left over. I'd say pure perfection on their part. For dessert they sent us (me) a happy birthday dessert, the vanilla panna cotta with raspberry puree. We also had the royal chocolate log which tasted like a snickers bar (yassss) and the mini cannoli. The ambiance was magnificent, price on point and parking was easy.

The chicken was ordinary, the brussel sprouts were almost raw and the fries which were thrown on top of the chicken, were soggy. Another at our table got cavatelli con salsiccia which was described with sausage, cannellini beans and light tomato sauce. No beans, but zucchini?, and the sauce was anything but light.

The complementary bread is delicious.  We asked for potatoes to be well-done/crispy but they were not. They dont give you very much. The Eggs Your Way comes with frittelle (something different) but they forgot it. It was very good - perhaps the best thing we ate there. We also got the eggs benedict. The English muffin wasn't toasted which usually it is and I prefer. It came with some salad. They had a guy on the guitar playing blues/jazz so it enhanced the ambience.  Overall, it was OK.  I'm sure it will improve over time.",1,0,0,Jazz C.,"Manhattan, NY",2,150,546

You're welcome.We came here about 3 years ago. Loved the food, but we remembered having a rude server. ""Oh well"" we thought, it was probably just that one guy. Let's go back, we liked the foodMISTAKE.We arrived for a party of 3 around 8:15pm for dinner. The host seated us, and promptly went back to stand at the host stand and scroll through her phone. (I worked in the service industry for years. This is unnacceptable and tacky. Wow.) It took about 15 minutes for a waiter to come over and greet us and take our drink order. This is not me exaggerating. I went up TWICE to the host, (remember, the one on her phone?) and asked if our server would be coming over. She acted surprised that he hadn't come over yet, but she would have been aware of that if she WAS NOT ON HER PHONE.She went to remind him of his table, and again, he didn't come over for almost 5 more minutes.Now listen. It would be one thing if this place was packed. It was deserted. I supposed he was the only server on the floor? But still, he probably had four tables, and not ONCE did a manager come over to see how our meal was, or to apologize for the delay in service.The food was mediocre. Drink refills were asked for, and didn't come for 10 minutes. I asked for olive oil, and when he returned to ask how the meal was, I had to remind him two times for olive oil. OLIVE OIL.

I pointed out to the waiter that it's regular bacon and he told me I was wrong and walked away. No...I know the difference between regular and Canadian bacon. Finally got another waiter to come over and take it away. I was then given a plate of COLD, RAW meat that looked like slices of spam. WTF? I sent that back and when they returned with it a 3rd time it seemed like they maybe microwaved it for 15 seconds. It was still raw and now had a slight gray coloring to it so I sent it back for good. The staff didn't even offer an apology.

We sat at a table of 4 that was jammed up against another table, and it took about 5 minutes of us standing around until they finally came over and moved some things around so that we could actually sit.  Eggs Benedict was unremarkable.  A few weird squares of bread thrown in the middle of the table.  Coffee below average. We ordered a side dish of Canadian bacon and they brought out the standard strips of maple bacon. When we pointed out to the waiter it was not Canadian bacon he insisted it was. We got another waiter who took it away and brought us back slices of cold uncooked Canadian bacon. We absolutely couldn't believe it, another waiter came and apologized and brought them back hot, but clearly something was wrong with what they were trying to serve us.  I don't leave many reviews but I rely on Yelp all the time to guide me and I think it is only fair to anyone who might read this that I post this review.  Spare yourself from this below-average brunch offering, there's just too many choices in the city and honestly I have never had such a poor breakfast in Manhattan.",3,0,0,Alec L.,"Mountain Lakes, NJ",1,18,0

No one offered to take our coats, and when someone finally did,  we found no place to put purse or package while removing coats.  The coat check woman stood stupidly by and watched.  Cesura aspires to more than it delivers.  Many waitpersons and managers walk the dining rooms, but none seem able to cope...the noise is excruciating and food is slow in arriving.  The fritelle we ordered is a fritter of tasteless cheese without the promise of prosciutto.  Scallops, which were fine, did not benefit from a puree of cauliflower which added nothing.  After a twenty five minute wait for ice-cream dessert, and three efforts to reach out to floor personnel who could do nothing...a manager[?} arrived to ask about our dinner.  When we expressed dis-satisfaction, he promptly left.  Cesca remains a lonely uws attempt at fine dining, but it has much to learn about hospitality. Back to coat check to retrieve coats and no one at desk to greet incoming guests or get coats.  Finally a suit meanders over to greet newcomers but we intervened and insisted he find our coats...probable never saw a coat check ticket before, as so many patrons did not check, but he did vanish and reappeared some minutes later with our things so we could escape.",1,1,1,Thelma S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,69,0

It was genuine and professional. I also saw him dealing with a vegan customer who had automatically assumed the menu included a vegan option, which it didn't.

1.0,12/9/2017,"'Cesca has long been one of my ""go to"" restaurants following events at Lincoln Center, and  I have dined here on numerous occasions. I always found it to have a knowledgeable and efficient staff and dependable cuisine. This is clearly no longer the case. To echo an earlier comment, I should have considered recent Yelp reviews. Arriving five minutes early for my reservation, I was told the wait would be five to ten minutes unless I took the last table in the bar proper. Since the din was unbearable and the mob made the area impassable, I advised the hostess that I would wait at the bar for such a short wait. Having finally navigated my passage to the bar, I stood for about thirty minutes on a sore knee nursing my glass of wine. The next 1/2 hour was spent on a much needed bar stool nursing my knee and my wine, foolishly assuming I would be seated at any moment. I have patience, but after one hour my patience had evaporated along with the wine. As I left, I had the decency to advise the hostess that she should cancel the reservation. The stunning reply: ""No one came to get you for your table?""  Whether my experience was the product of indifference, complacency or ineptitude, I cannot say. Obviously I am unable to comment on the new menu offerings, and  I doubt I will return to do so (In spite of the fact that I just realized I have some credit remaining on an old gift card).",0,0,0,John M.,"Waikiki, Honolulu, HI",0,2,0

1.0,4/30/2016,"Literally the worst upscale dining experience I have ever had in NYC.  From the moment we walked in until we departed 2 1/4 hours later.  I called at the time of our reservation to tell the hostess that we were just around the corner.  We arrived 10 minutes later only be told that our table wasn't ready with no apology and slight irritation at me when I expressed my irritation.  We got a drink at the bar only after waiting 5 minutes and finally having to flag down the bartender.  20 minutes later the hostess came to get us over a half hour after our reservation time.  Again, no apology. We were seated and menus and water arrived pretty quickly.  After about ten minutes we had to ask our waiter, who was ver nice, for bread.  Given how pricey this place is you'd think that they'd give you a decent bread basket.  It was instead the most pathetic little bread basket with a 6 tiny slices of stale bread.Our appetizer salads arrived without too much delay.  They were pretty small and after I finished mine feeling very disappointed and that it was the most boring salad ever I realized they neglected to include the most important ingredient - the cheese!!!!! So paid $15 or so dollars for a few leaves of lettuce and a sprinkling of walnuts,  infuriating.I was so caught up in our conversation that I didn't even realize that an ENTIRE HOUR had passed since we got our appetizers. At which point our waiter came over to ask if we wanted DESSERT!  No joke.  We had to tell him we hadn't even gotten our entrees yet.  They arrived shortly thereafter and I've never felt so ripped off in my life.  I paid $45 for Veal Milanese which arrived as one piece of breaded fried veal on a plate with a measly spattering of sauce and some undressed frisée on top.  That's it! No vegetables nothing else.  It was an okay size but of course it's pounded so in the end it wasn't that much and it was no tastier than I could have gotten at and run of the mill Italian restaurant at a third of the price with accoutrements.  My fellow diners had pasta that was just okay and a rather small portion.  Again given the prices you'd expect a little more generosity with the portions and infinitely better food.  An absolutely terrible infuriating dining experience.  This is my first restaurant review ever.

We shared it at the table and have no idea where it went. - large portions: the dishes we each ordered were huge. Had trouble finishing. - Who doesnt like unlimited bread before the food comes? High quality olive oil and herbs served with it- Arctic Char - recommended by the waiter. It was delicious. Light, refreshing. The lemon riso melts in your mouth.- Pasta is cooked well. I think the reviews that hate on the pasta may have come on an off day.- Desserts - warm chocolate cake - i mean where does this ever go wrong?Marscapone cheesecake - light, airy, great texture and flavorGripes:- a bit on the pricey side, but you can tell this place has its regulars- Short Ribs in Brodo - it was aiiiighhtt. More on the heavy side. The root vegetables and the soft ribs were cooked to perfection.

Given the ever-increasing competition in the neighborhood, the folks at 'Cesca have some work to do.  Either bring back Colicchio or hire some chefs who can handle these simple dishes that any home cook can master with ease.  I am going to need some incentive to make a return visit.",1,0,1,Max B.,"Dobbs Ferry, NY",2,9,0

We were waiting for wine to be poured in our empty glasses so many times we grew tired of futilely waiving for the waiter and got up and fished it out of the bucket and poured our wine ourselves. Waiter referred to the whole Branzino special as ""Bol... Bol... Bolbino??"" When we corrected him, he admitted that he had actually never heard of Branzino prior.

I'm pretty sure they have a sommelier as well.Appetizers are great, particularly the calamari. The Farro salad is also a hit every time.I was not feeling very hungry soI got the spaghetti with cracked pepper, which was fine. The pappardelle and the lamb shank were big hits.Finally I must point out that, while many have marked Cesca as not ""kid friendly,"" I think it depends on how you define that term.

It was supposed to be a four course meal priced at $90 per person. First of all, there we  no four courses. I had the octopus, which I found gross. It was huge pieces of octopus fried with a kind polenta served with beans. It tasted terrible. We also had the beet carpaccio which I found insulting as a dish. One beet was thinly sliced and served with goat cheese. It was such a small dish. The sole as main course was excellent. And then came the dessert. Chocolate fondue for two, which was melted chocolate with a few pieces of fruit. It was a tasty dish, but this should have been for one person, not for two. Overall, I thought the dinner was overpriced, the quantity of the food small and I thought the octopus was simply terrible. For $90 you expect a lot more.

I told Stephanie I wanted to order something different and she took care of me right away. we liked her so much when our reservation at 8:30 was ready (right on time) we asked if we could be seated with her. she was super fun and energetic. we ordered the prosciutto fritters they were absolutely AMAZING. omg I could eat another order right now, for dinner I had the scallops which I was skeptical about because of the corn purée and the farro it was served won, but let me tell you I was not disappointed at all....jeff ordered a special that was recommended which was penne, tomatoes, asparagus and chicken sausage wow that was great too!!! all in all the meal, service and ambiance was excellent. we dined here for our two year anniversary and we were not disappointed in the least. I recommend Stephanie as your waitress 100% because she really made the night extra special, even wishing is a happy anniversary when bringing our dessert out.  love this place, will be coming back sooner than later!",1,0,1,nicole s.,"Norwood, NJ",14,48,19
3.0,9/1/2014,"Our food was good and overall experience was ok, but it was a little pricey for just ok. I had the bolognese. It was tasty but would have enjoyed it better if the sauce was thicker. The sauce was almost just a jus that they cooked the meat in. My fiancé had the trout salad. The original came out smothered in a buttermilk dressing, which she is allergic to. The menu didn't state that the salad had a buttermilk dressing, but the staff was very good about replacing it promptly with a new non-dairy salad. I ask for a little side of red sauce to add to my bolognese for which I was charged $1. I'm not upset about the amount but more the principal of charging for a side of sauce when the restaurant is charging $22+ for a bowl of pasta.",2,1,0,Peter R.,"Manhattan, NY",29,155,2

Meat and cheese plate was sad for the price they charge.Service was indifferent.No one even came to ask how things were. At this level restaurant we were very disappointed and certainly will not be back. Way too expensive for mediocre food.Food actually came out so fast had to wonder why???

Here's my take on everything:- Meat and Cheese plate: good but I've had better Proscuitto- Prosciutto and Parmesan fritters: nice and airy but too much dough for me- Cauliflower fritters: Maybe my favorite thing here! Fried, savory, and had the right crunch!- Mixed green salad: nice and light. Why does salad taste so much better when someone else makes it!?- Cavatelli: freshly made pasta. Delicious with every bite. A simple red sauce to go with it. - Chocolate Truffle cake: rich and creamy.

5.0,4/6/2014,"Cesca is a lovely restaurant on the Upper West Side of NYC. It is an Italian-American restaurant with a farm-to table menu. The bar area is open and spacious with plenty of seating. Some, if not all wines by the glass and beers are half off at Happy Hour. I was pleased to see Banfi among the wines offered by the bottle. We visited Banfi in Italy and have never been disappointed.  There were five of us all arriving at different times.  We were seated immediately in a large oval booth in the dining area and did not have to wait for the whole party to arrive. The waitress was very accommodating throughout.The slow roasted duck was amazing, a real treat. I was not planning on eating more than a salad but one of my friends ordered it and it looked great.  So glad I did. It was divine! One of the best ducks I've ever had.  It was a bit Czechoslovakian in nature served over smoked bacon, grilled frissee, grapes and mushrooms.  We tried two of the salads. Both were delicious - the arugula salad with blood orange, meyer lemon and goat cheese and the escarole salad with mint and hazelnuts. Mussels, another favorite, were nicely flavored in a citrus lemon broth and served with crusty bread, just the way I like it!I look forward to my return so I can try some of the other interesting dishes on the menu.",5,0,0,Julia M.,"PACIFIC PLSDS, CA",13,82,288
4.0,3/5/2014,"I ate at 'Cesca for my aunt's birthday dinner a few weeks ago and had a lovely time. The breakdown is below!Food: Quite delicious. I had the Escarole Salad (delicious and complex - I thought the toasted hazelnuts balanced the spicy greens well), Burrata Cappellacci (I wasn't expecting much of this as it looked mostly like some interestingly shaped ravioli but was I wrong. This dish melted in my mouth), and the Apple Fritters for dessert (can only be described as indulgant - little apple doughnuts dipped in salted caramel sauce and mascarpone whipped cream). I also had a Pomegrantini (I ordered that one somewhat shamefully...but it was delicious! Great mix of sour and sweet) and we had 5 bottles of prosecco for the table.Service: Attentive and knowledgeable. Our server was always availble when we needed him, but wasn't hovering. I was actually impressed at how quickly he responded in such a packed restraunt. Ambiance: A little on the loud side, which made conversation a bit difficult at the beginning, but we didn't notice it at the end of the evening.Overall, I had a lovely time and would definitely visit 'Cesca again!",0,0,0,Mary R.,"New York, NY",0,11,1
3.0,1/18/2014,"I'm a bit mixed on my star rating, and I'll tell ya why. I had tickets to the opera on Saturday night and had made a resy weeks in advance at Betony. I had been wanting to go since it opened and even more so after it was showing up on every must dine here list. The only time I could get was 5:45 so I took it. Now the opera didn't start until 8:30 so when a woman called to confirm my reservation I politely asked if maybe I could push it until like 6:15. I mean come on, it's a Saturday in New York and her response? Oh no, we're fully committed...bite me...especially after reading all the negative reviews, no thanks, I'll take my money elsewhere. A friend of mine talks about Cesca a lot when he's on the UWS so since I couldn't get into any place last minute pre-theatre and Cesca had availability I was in. We walked in and were seated promptly. This place is huge and actually has a cool old time vibe if only they could turn the lights down a bit. It was probably half full even at this hour and by the time we left it was jammin. We were served with some nice warm crusty bread with olive oil right away. What happened next once we ordered a bottle of wine was a bit strange. I ordered a 2002 aglianico. The waiter showed me the bottle but didn't open it at the table. When he poured me a taste the color was way off. The wine was obviously corked and after smelling and tasting it I was certain of it. Our waiter said he was going to have the sommelier taste it, I said fine, I'd love to talk to him. He then returns, sans sommelier, and says that he deemed it fine. Now I'm not saying I'm an expert, yet, but I know when a wine has turned. The sommelier should have come over to the table to discuss and I might have accepted it thinking my taste buds were a bit off but since he didn't I said, sorry, no dice. I then chose a 2010 nobile di montepulciano which was pretty darn good. For food we decided to split the arugula salad, average, but the dressing was great, the straciatelli which was amazing and the tagliatelle verde alla bolognese, spinach pasta with veal and lamb ragu which was another winner. Another strange thing with the service was we had no less than 5 bus boys try to take our bread and straciatelli while we were still working on it. Our waiter wouldn't bring our pasta while we still had that on the table so we finally had to say it was ok to bring it because we saw it sitting under a warmer. The meal was definitely decent but the other hiccups were a bit of a turn off. A slightly above average choice for Italian when you're on the UWS.",0,0,1,Leslie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",82,444,2

I'm really glad I did.My wife and I ordered a half bottle of white wine, which was really good. To start, we ordered some smaller plates. Sunchokes were nice and sweet and lemony.  The eggplant-ricotta-tomato rolls, which looked like sushi, were good as well. We also got the homemade strachiatella, which was fantastic, despite being totally unnecessary. We also ordered the yellowtail crudo, which was good, but I wouldn't necessarily get it again.We split one entree: the mushroom pasta. The pasta is made in-house (I think), cooked nicely, and the mushroom ragu was perfect. Not overly creamy and the mushrooms had a nice bite.We finished it off with the mascarpone cheesecake and two decaf espressos.It's not often that we leave a restaurant feeling like we just ate a really great meal, but Cesca did not disappoint.

I mean, I love diarrhea as much as the next guy, but...I digress. Anyway, as a server, I try to give other servers some slack, but our server was annoyed from the beginning to hear that there were a few vegans at the table. I asked what my options were as it said ""vegan options available"" on the menu. He said there weren't really any options. My boyfriend ordered some plain pasta with tomato sauce which came out with cheese, Ay yi yi. Our server disappeared a whole lot, so another server graciously remedied the pasta and ran our card at the end of the meal after he saw us trying to pay for a long time.

Located right on our corner it's been our favorite neighborhood bar from the moment we moved to the area, and the atmosphere is down right cozy, especially in the winter when it snows. There always seems to be just the right number of people there; not too busy as to turn you away and not a dead zone where you fear the quality.  The best seat in the house is the over stuffed booth in front of a large window looking out to the street, which is perfect for people watching. If you want to turn it up a notch the interior restaurant has a more formal vibe. We've never encountered bad service, but I agree with other reviews that the food can be a little uneven at times. I've mostly seen this with their sides, such as the brussel sprouts and Tuscan herb fries, both of which were over seasoned last time we ordered.

Also the basic/(first on the menu?) salad - who knew lettuce w/ a simple parmesan-infused dressing (but not heavy like a ranch or anything) could be worth writing about.Only complaint is the food's delivered in recyclable/biodegradable containers...so if you save the left-overs for tomorrow & reheat the cardboard occasionally gets too involved.

The four of us found the Prix Fix menu for Restaurant Week a bit ""throw-away"".  The choices presented seemed a bit unusual.  We all eschewed the clam appetizer.  Three of us chose the veal soup and one the warm goat cheese salad.  They were all enjoyed. For the main course, two of us chose the pork sausage and found it tasty and filling. One decided to try the mackerel - a choice I've never seen on any menu in New York as it is a dark fish and quite strong.  She found her choice to be just ""OK"".  The fourth in our party ordered the whole wheat pasta with cauliflower, which came less than al dente and, after the three of us tasted it, agreed it was inedible.  Our excellent waitress brought a  small bowl of  cauliflower in lieu of that inedible entree. For dessert, one of us chose the assorted gelati, and I chose the chocolate cake.  We were not disappointed.  Our two wives selected the date mousse, which - after we all tasted it- agreed was like eating sweetened mayonnaise.  My wife left her dessert totally uneaten.   We had excellent service, the noise level was reasonably good and, of course, the general ambience is lovely.  Our collective suggestion is, perhaps, to make some adjustment in the choices given on the Restaurant Week menu and/or to work with the sous chefs on the quality of several of the dishes mentioned.",0,0,0,Susan P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0

The ambiance was lovely, as always. I was very pleasantly surprised that Cesca treated that day as a regular Monday, with 50% off bottles of wine, and did not come up with some elaborate holiday prix fixe menu with jacked-up prices. The food was good, but a bit uneven. Minestra stew was delicious, but a little over-salted. Tagiatelle bolognese (recommended by our waitress as the best pasta) was good, but nothing special, also over-salted.  However, I *loved* the appetizer pasta portion, bcs it left plenty of room for dessert :)  My husband's octopus with fennel salad and roasted duck were quite good.  The desserts were fine, skippable.  The creme caramel came out as an extremely rich and firm creme brulee.  Mascarpone cheesecake was good, also very rich.What was really lacking this time was the service - strange, bcs I don't remember it ever being an issue on prior visits. It was well-intentioned and efficient, but our waitress seemed completely overwhelmed and gave off the most hectic vibe.  Like, she was trying to be nice, but *really* could not spare any time because she seemed to be taking care of about double the amount of tables she was capable of handling.  She made a mistake with my dessert after I waffled between chocolate cake and cheesecake and decided on the chocolate.  Also, she put the check on the table when we just started eating dessert - a cardinal sin with me! - and didn't even say thank you!On the other hand, she did her job, aside from the dessert mistake, and packed our leftover half bottle of wine without us even having to ask - bonus points for that.Assuming that the service issues were a glitch, a solid 3.5 stars.",2,0,0,Marina D.,"Manhattan, NY",5,52,0

(However, if you are not into eating sushi or raw seafood, I would not recommend this dish.) I had the squid ink taglionini with Maine lobster meat.

The other people at my table had  the pork chop, striped bass (a special that night) and salmon. Everybody thought the dish they ordered was delicious and that's saying something because they are all foodies who have travelled all over the world. Our waiter provided excellent service and gave good wine recommendations. He was well versed with the wine menu and pairing them with our orders.

It's a great place to have dinner by yourself or with a group of friends.I went there most recently last Friday night. One of my favorite dishes on the Cesca menu is the salmon tartar. I get it pretty much everytime I dine there. The salmon is mixed with chiles, pine nuts and salsa verde, giving it a rainbow of flavors and textures.Believe it or not, I have not yet tried any of the pasta dishes, but I can recommend the assorted crostini, a cheese plate, the grilled salmon and the sirloin steak.

2.0,5/13/2012,"I've eaten here before and enjoyed it very much.  Today, ok it was Mother's Day, but the restaurant was not very crowded for brunch at 12:45pm.  I ordered from the special brunch menu the crespelle with scrambled egg, bacon and fontina.  The first order that came out had crepes that were burnt and the wrong filling - apples, walnuts and goat cheese I think.  The waiter took it back, apologized, and returned with a new order - this one had gummy, underdone crepes and a fried egg, not scrambled.  It was tasteless to start out and really, not what the menu said it was. When I realized, after opening the crepe up, that the egg was not actually scrambled, I notified the very nice waiter who apologized.  I think that some compensation should have been given - either take the item off the bill (especially since it was essentially uneaten) or at least send over a little plate of cookies or a cappuccino or something.  This was a very disappointing meal and not what I expect from a place I've always enjoyed.  Also, someone at the table ordered spaghetti without meatballs because they are vegetarian, and the order came out with meatballs but at least that one came  back the way it was supposed to be.",1,0,0,Patricia G.,"New York, NY",0,5,0

The duckling was overcooked and the cod and pasta were passable. We skipped dessert but all had some form of espresso.

4.0,11/2/2010,"There is a wide variety of unique restaurants littered throughout this City, but invariably what I most look for in any destination is a trio of factors which I can't overlook: good ambience, good food, and good service. I am happy to say that 'Cesca delivered in all three categories, with plenty of room to spare.We visited this past weekend and not only was the wait staff attentive and friendly, the dinner recommendations were accurate and helpful. More importantly, everything we enjoyed that evening was not only tasty and delicious, it was just unique enough to set 'Cesca apart from the myriad other restaurants in the crowded NYC food landscape.We started with some fresh, salty focaccia and cocktails, and moved onto the marinated olives and a trio of artisinal cheeses (the herb truffled peccorino romano was really excellent). And our waitress suggested we skip the parmigiano reggiano as we'd be having same with our dinners, which was not only a good point but she directed us to the romano, which was really outstanding.To follow, we had three dishes: the roast duck, the lamb orrechette, and the halibut in ""crazy water."" While the halibut dish was only good, the duck was perfectly roasted and a real treat. And the lamb sausage with orrechette pasta was really solid.We passed on dessert simply because we'd eaten and enjoyed so much -- and made our way to Crumbs Bakery nearby. Another excellent stop, and also highly recommended.However, one thing which was unusual -- in a good way -- about 'Cesca was the fact that the ambience, which is homy, cozy and inviting, was actually somewhat modern in appearance and -- oddly -- featured a classic rock soundtrack. By odd, I don't mean that in a negative way; it's just that the music was more befitting of some dive/frat bar, and we really enjoyed it far more than what we expected, which was old-world Italian and/or French love songs and/or jazz.

I ended up getting up starting with the house soup which was cauliflower pureed with shrimp and it was to die for. The bowl was quite large and came topped with 2 large prawns. It was absolutely delicious. For my main course I had the special which was rigatoni with the house sauce and on the side was the meats (a meat sauce with one large meatball and sausage) and you piled it onto your pasta as you pleased.

What a shock that she didn't care for her friend's  ""clams with pasta.""  ""The bread they served was ok, not the greatest;"" well, that will come as a shock to the legions of Sullivan Street Bakery fans, from whom Cesca has been buying their bread for years.I understand when someone gives a mediocre review for a restaurant that is clearly mediocre, but Jewelyn's problems had more to do with a) her inability to problem solve, and b) her dislike of food that she already knew she disliked. Hardly fair to the restaurant, and not very objective. And lets get rid of the hearsay: ""My friend mention something like they charge if you no show, don't know how true that is."" Like many restaurants in Manhattan, Cesca takes a credit card for parties of 6 (or maybe it's 8) or more, and tells you you will be charged $25 for a no-show. Obviously you can't be charged if you a) make a reservation online, and/or b) don't volunteer a way to be charged. No, I am not associated with the restaurant. No, I am not a shill. I've just enjoyed many meals there in the past 6 years, and am tired of reading so-called reviews that feature the ignorance of the poster. Have something to say? Great!

You can definitely tell the two restaurants have the same owner. They have the same ""feel"" of an upscale wine bar and restaurant. 'Cesca, however, is a bit fancier. The menu is large, with items that can shared by the table and those to be ordered individually. For appetizers, we had the Escarole Salad (with hazelnuts, red onion, mint, pecorino, and sherry vinaigrette) and the Endive Salad (with cooked apple, walnut, and gorgonzola cheese). Both salads were fresh and flavorful. As entrees, we had the Garganelli (with house made chicken sausage and chestnut) and Tuna with Pine Nut Sauce. We both enjoyed our meals very much. The pasta was perfectly al dente and the tuna cooked to perfection. 'Cesca is a very nice upscale restaurant with an extensive wine list and menu to suit a large group or an intimate dinner for two.

3.0,4/28/2009,"I found this place when doing research over the internet and travel books when planning my New York trip for Spring Break. I read that it was one of the best italian places in Manhattan. So I was curious to see what it was all about. I had dinner here on my last night in the city. After eating at another well known italian joint (located near Time Square) I was kind of dissapointed. It was my best friend and I... we did enjoy our meal... he had the clams with pasta and I had their pasta stuff with duck... that I thought was really salty... but finished everything on my plate. I'm not a fan of clams but did try his pasta and sauce and didn't care for it either. The bread they served was ok, not the greatest... we did have their special for the evening which was a salad with cheese... which was pretty tasty but nothing really stood out to me to make me remember it today. We went there via subway... and didn't have a problem finding the spot. Reservations is a good option... if you have time... we booked ours online... and they did call us a day or two ahead of time to confirm. My friend mention something like they charge if you no show, don't know how true that is. As far as for service... it was ok... Would I go back there again if I was in NYC? NO! But I'm glad I atleast tried it out for myself. My friend really enjoyed his dinner and thought his meal was really good while on the other hand, I wasn't pleased with mines. I wouldn't suggest my friends or family to dine here... the food didn't impress me. That's probably why I didn't bother looking at or staying for dessert.So 3 stars... for nice set up... (we sat in a booth) clean bathrooms... little selection on the menu...and  salty duck ( I never care to eat duck because they're to cute to eat, but because of the not so many options to choose from on the menu, duck was the only thing that interested me) This place is on the expensive side... so think twice before entering.P.S. check out my photos from my experience at 'Cesca.

One chose the Saturday night special, lamb shank, was perfect.  The second choice was the linguini with clams and that too was very good.  However, the vegetable entree was very disappointing.  While the menu claimed it was grilled seasonal vegetables - it was a cold entree and the beets were certainly not grilled.  But the wine and the desert were exceptional. My only recommendation is that if they are offering a vegetarian main course, that it match the quality of the rest of the menu and not treat vegetarians/or vegetables as second class citizens.",1,0,2,Andrea U.,"Ashton, MD",0,5,0

3.0,12/28/2008,"When I first started frequenting 'Cesca about two years ago, it was a really solid performer: The food quality was excellent, the portions and prep nice, but not overdone, the service superb, and the ambiance warm and inviting, especially the bar area, which holds many people very comfortably, and has amazing ""feng shui"" for a restaurant bar.Sadly, 'Cesca is slowly beginning that all-too-familiar downward arc towards restaurant mediocrity as it ages. While the bar area is still a great hang-out spot for a small group to get a drink and snack, and the service still pleasant and passable, the food quality and prep has clearly slipped several notches, while the prices have actually increased. The one exception to that would have to be in the area of desert, which are still excellent. Our recent visit found the Cauliflower Misto soggy, the vegetable plate pretty lame and the pasta overdone, though apparently the meat dishes were excellent. This would not have been the case even as late as end of last year (2007).While I will still eat there when looking for an slightly upscale place to eat in the UWS, I won't be rushing to go as I once have.

3.0,5/5/2008,"I'm rating this in context of the UWS -  - where there is a dearth of decent italian restaurants. Don't make this your birthday place or the place you want to impress someone at.  Its not a first rate experience. This place always looks so inviting from the outside, lively and cozy. The front section looks like a great place for a drink. Darkly lit interior - interesting bar in the back - open fireplace/oven.In the back there are tables where you can have privacy (near the kitchen) and cannot hear neighbor's conversation. Other tables are close to one another, however there are enough that are set a part. It is lively - noise wise. The attitude is relaxed, casual. Surprisingly the waitstaff was below average in presentation/dress- if you care about these things as I've noticed some have commented  on in their reviews  - the service would be equally at home at a ""best buy.""  You could wear jeans or a suit here and still feel comfortable. Overpriced and not so ""down home"" pricing. ($32 for grilled tuna etc.- all deserts were $10)The grilled tuna was okay, the squid ink pasta is better at papparadella - depending on how much cheese and flavor you like. The desert was really good, both the chocalate cake and fodda (tasted like a chocalate mousse kit kat bar.)Latte less than average, served in tiny espresso cup. The small bread basket contains that country style bread I don't care for with 2 foccaccia.

The restaurant itself is lovely - we were seated in the back, wine cellar area and it was an intimate setting - a great place to carry on a conversation.  When I first looked at the menu, I was a little concerned because none of the entrees appealed to me.  My husband had called ahead and was told that there was a chicken option, but the menu did not reflect that.  I inquired with the waitress and didn't get too far - because it was a special occasion, I didn't want to make a fuss, so I left it at that - glad I did, because my entree (striped bass) was delicious and quite possibly the best fish I've ever had at a restaurant.  But, let's start at the beginning - there were two courses of appetizers - I had the prosciutto fritters - basically fried proscicutto with lots of parm cheese - delicious!  Next, I had the alfredo with mushrooms - this tasted much like one of my favorite Fig and Olive dishes and was extremely tasty - the mushrooms were large and delicous.  My husband had the risotto with lump crab meat - also very good.  After the entrees was the first course of dessert - I had the chocolate cake - good, but nothing incredible or unique.  My husband ordered the marscapone cheescake with orange sauce - really tasty and different than any cheesecake I've tried.  After the cake, we were served a plate of three different cookies - almond, bicotti and chocolate - all very good.  The bread served on the table was fantastic and when I asked for some more foccacia, our waitress brought out a whole basket full of the warm bread.  All in all, a very expensive, but very delicious meal.",1,1,1,Hilary M.,"New York, NY",2,71,0
