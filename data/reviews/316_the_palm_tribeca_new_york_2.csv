5.0,1/24/2019,There's a reason why this establishment has an impeccable reputation. Plain downright amazing. I eat out a lot but wouldn't come here if it wasn't for restaurant week. Just not in my budget Started with probably the most delicious soup I've ever had- bacon corn chowder. Creamy and piping hot. Filet mignon (rare) was perfect. Amazingly seasoned Key lime pie was perfect for ending and I have to say again the decaf coffee was the best I've ever tasted out! Would love to know what coffee they use. Fantastic service.

2.0,1/5/2019,"This is in hopes management reads this. Please check the schedule for 1/5/19. The second my daughter and I walked in the door, your hostess seemed annoyed and disinterested. She was annoyed when I asked for kids menu and then when we were seated in the bar area, got a major attitude when she changed the channel and I calmly asked if she could put the nfl playoffs back on. She rolled her eyes and said I am if you can see. Can't make this shit up. I ordered a Sauvignon blanc and the waitress on the bar forgot to get it. At least she was pleasant about it. The burger my daughter got was fantastic and my Chilean sea bass was great but the Brussel sprouts we cold. At that price point, get your shit together.

4.0,12/12/2018,"I had the privilege of attending an insurance industry party which the palm hosted.  The h'orderves where delicious, nice variety and enough to go around.  The staff were very accomodating from the servers to the bartenders. Bar had a great selection of wines and spirits.  The pre-fixed menu had great selection of meats and a Chilean Sea Bass. I ordered a NY Strip Steak with a nice pink center but didn't feel like the steak was tender, felt like the outside was tough.  The potatoes and Green beans were delicious. For dessert, I chose the Key Lime Pie which the Blueberry topping made it just a bit too sweet.   Surprisingly we didn't get coffee at the time which normally would compliment the dessert.  The overall experience was great.

3.0,11/14/2018,"A great ribeye. But I go to a high-end steakhouse for the vibe -- this place has no vibe. In a place this expensive, the bartender shouldn't be wearing blue jeans.

There didn't seem to be any seasoned staff -- everyone was very young with no real social skills that make for an elevated experience like some of the top steakhouses in Manhattan.

4.0,11/3/2018,"I've always really enjoyed the Palm restaurants for their unique charm, professional service and quality dishes. A bit of a shame I have never reviewed any of their locations before, since I have been at all the other NYC locations numerous times, yet this visit was the first time @ The Palm's Tribeca location.First of all, Ivy was a wonderful hostess, tremendously polite and an absolutely refreshing hostess to deal with, and our waiter, Beatt, He had a charming, pleasant demeanor, and was being professionally attentive without being intrusive. I even had great conversation with another server Jeff that was engaging and even helped me snap some special Photos.   None of the staff knew it, but this is why my son and I were out for a celebratory steak for my upcoming 44th Birthday on this Friday night. Food;   for our Appetizers ordered, we started with the Calamari, and as Brooklyn Italians, Charles and I are a a bit critical of this dish wherever we dine, thankfully, not only was the seasoning and breading flavorful, but the calamari was fresh, tender and tasted great, we both agreed it was very enjoyable.  We also had the obligatory Steak House Bacon app, which the Palm courteously split up on separate plates for us, it tasted good, but we both enjoy American crispy thin Bacon far much more, nothing wrong with this dish, just as I mentioned, we ordered it because it is an Obligatory Steakhouse dinner appetizer.For Entrees, Charles had the Prime NY Strip 14 OZ, which was cooked perfectly, and he also enjoyed ( actually devoured) a side of French Fries, to the surprise of no-one.  I order the 24 Oz, Bone in Rib Eye, again cooked perfectly, adding the 1/2 Lobster accompaniment. Each of these were very tasty, approaching fullness, I focused on the Rib Cap and shared some of it with Charles to show my 14 yr old son the difference in the cuts of meat. I also enjoyed some of Andy's Salad and creamed spinach as well.As I mentioned before, the staff was great, since we over ordered in a glutinous manner, every thing was packed up and ready for us to take home, I've been snacking all day on this meal.  The Strip was very tasty after broiling it slightly.   This isn't a very crowded steak house on a Friday night, and it met all of my desires across the board. A unique setting that my son enjoyed and a dinner we will not forget sharing together.    Thanks very much for the memorable dinner and wonderful service.   See you soon Palm Tribeca!",4,1,2,Matt C.,"Brooklyn, NY",138,260,371

2.0,9/21/2018,"This review is strictly off my first Mealpal order, an app that offers lunch subscriptions giving you access to the best restaurants for $6 per meal. Now I am no stranger to dining out frequently, as much as 4-6 times a day. I decided to give Mealpal a chance because of the convenience it offered at the palm of my hands.Today the Palm offered a ""Steak Chop Chop"" salad, which was supposed to be a chopped salad with steak. What I received was a barely full container of chopped salad and a few pieces of what appeared to be burnt overcooked beef tips. In addition to that it was mostly fatty ""beef"" not ""steak"" that was not really edible. Now I do not know if the quality and quantity was compromised due to the fact that it was ordered through a third party or if it is their actual serving. If this is what the restaurant actually sells as a steak salad its definitely not worth it, you'd better off getting the summer steak salad at Beans & Greens for $14 as you are getting a full portion of salad and real sliced steak not these burnt ends that The Palm is offering. And if this just what they are giving Mealpal users, it really defeats the purpose, they should just leave the service.",0,0,0,Tiffany C.,"New York, NY",138,137,348
2.0,9/13/2018,The low rating has to do with the fact that the food portions and quality do not exactly align with the prices. Had a chicken salad close to $18 after taxes and was extremely surprised with the small portion. I came out of the restaurant hungrier. I realize that most of what you are paying is probably going into real estate costs instead since it is in Tribeca. There are many other surrounding restaurants in the area that you'll get more bang for your buck.,0,0,0,Stealth Y.,"New Brunswick, NJ",0,7,0

1.0,7/5/2018,"We came here, hoping/thinking it would become one of our favorite steak restaurants.  We were very disappointed.  The steaks were so so.  Services were so so.  My kids kept asking me why would anyone spend $25K in this restaurant (I think if you spend $25K, then they painted your picture on the wall or something).With many people like this restaurant and we live so close to it, I really want to give this restaurant a 2nd chance.  However, my husband and my kids refuse, especially my husband commenting restaurants charging the kind of money they charge do not get a 2nd chance, considering Tribeca Grille, Capital Grill, Morton's and Reserve Cut are all close by.

I was hesitant to come here in the first place, because I know there are better steakhouses in NYC , and plenty of great Italian restaurants nearby in TriBeCa. The service was decent, they forgot to bring bread.. The real problem came with the filet mignon. We ordered it medium. It was served completely rare. We sent it back to be cooked a little more, and they completely burned the outside of the steak. So much so that it was basically inedible with the bitter taste of char. We had to complain. They were nice enough to take it off our bill, and to give us a free dessert. It completely ruined our dining experience. This is coming from a person who never sends anything back.

4.0,2/17/2018,Came here for a special occasion with a group of 30 people in the private room. Excellent service throughout the night.We had a special menu similar to what you may expect from a restaurant week menu. The complimentary bread was great especially the raisin ones. The lobster bisque was good but only found tiny bites of lobster. Most reviews raved about the New York strip which was really juicy. Strange that the waiter actually said the filet mignon was better and it wasn't. It was okay. Had to ask for steak sauce. Was expecting a house sauce but got the A1 bottle. The cheesecake was delicious. The flourless chocolate cake was not bad. Coffee and the tea selection was good.

4.0,1/17/2018,"This is a ""double' review of sorts.  My husband and I had eaten in all The Palms in NYC except this location in Tribeca.  Being a member of the 837 Club, we decided to give this location a try on 12/16.  We were greeted most graciously by Christopher Gilman who directed us to the bar while our table was being prepared.  I really wanted to try to their special Manhattan, made with their own barrel aged bourbon but they unfortunately just ran out.  My husband had a special mulled drink, which while was good, took forever to make.Once seated, our waiter never reviewed any specials.  After ordering, we heard a waiter at another table going over specials.  While the food was Palm worthy, the service was terrible.  Outside of not going over the specials, our waiter was downright neglectful.  Other wait staff noticed his neglect and checked on us.  We ordered a bottle of wine, which my husband wound up pouring through dinner. I'm no snob, but there is a certain expectation of service at The Palm which was a total failure that evening.Upon leaving, Mr. Gilman asked how our experience was and we were honest with him.  Mr. Gilman was very apologetic and insisted we come back and try again at his expense.  Two weeks later, we did just that and what a difference!  This time the service was fantastic.  The staff knew we had issues on our prior visit and made sure the evening was fantastic.  Give this location a chance...you won't be disappointed!",5,0,3,Kathy B.,"Queens, NY",21,6,0

However, the meat patty in the cheeseburger wasn't fresh and tasted awful during our recent dining experience. The salmon entree felt lonely - it would've been more appealing if there were more vegetables or decorated with something.  Hence minus one star.

I asked another waiter if it is a false alarm the waiter said ""yes"". It wasn't. The hostess came over after and told us that they have smoke in the kitchen and water leaks so they can't serve any food. She checked the 58th location and said they could accommodate us and the first round of drinks will be on the house. I almost fell off my chair when I heard the bad news. I told the hostess we need couple of minutes to decide. It was already 7:40pm by the time we drive from the financial district to 58th street that will probably take another 30-40 minutes depending on traffic (our group had just park their cars). The manager, Dominick came and told us they are willing to offer the first round of drinks are on the house at the other location. We told him it is kind of late to drive up to 58th street (we would be traveling in a group of 10 people). Dominick gave us his business card and when we asked if he could write something on it to honor his promise, he shrugged and said he is there all the time just give him a call.Feeling skeptical to go back since Dominick refuse to have it in writing.

I wanted to enjoy some NYC Restaurant Week menus without traveling too far in the rain. I made a reservations for my two children and me. Upon arrival, we were greeted like long-lost friends and settled into a huge booth/ banquette facing the street which was perfect for us. Our waiter and all of the staff were just fantastic- friendly, professional, and kind to the kids. One of the things I love about The Palm is that they have a kids' menu so you don't need to spend $25+ on a dish that will be far too much for a child. I had the Caesar Salad starter, Skirt Steak main, and cheesecake to finish. This was from the $29 Restaurant Week menu. I also had a lovely glass of Malbec and a dessert wine to go with the cheesecake.

4.0,7/16/2017,"This Palm is located on the borderlands between Tribeca and Battery Park City. It's not a bad stop before you go to the movie theater around the corner and... basically that, given that there is nothing really to do in Battery Park City at night. I can't hate on the Palm. It basically obeys the Starbucks principle: reliable, predictable, consistent quality from decades of being in business, slow and steady expansion, and entrenched quality controls and logistics. Like Starbucks vs. some ""chic"" exotic coffee place, you're not going to get a transcendent steak like what you'll find at Keens, but you're not getting stuff from the sandbox that you could cook at home just as easily, either. Warning: get an individual-sized fries, which will be more than enough for the table.

5.0,4/2/2017,"I'm very picky especially about steakhouses, but our meal last night (8:30 Saturday reservation) was really excellent. I got a bad first impression walking in, due to the crowd. There were a ton of underdressed people (tank tops and wrinkly tshirts), and multiple tables with kids. Very suspect. But that's pretty much where my complaints cease. The only other negative is that the brandy peppercorn sauce had a much stronger mustard flavor than I expected - I was thinking that it'd be closer to au poivre, but maybe that's just my own ignorance. My date got then 24 oz bone in ribeye, and I got the 12 oz Wagyu. Both were ordered medium rare, hers was perfect but mine was slightly overdone. Not enough to send back though. Her steak was buttery, flavorful, and tender. Mine was richer, funky (in the good, dry-aged kind of way), and also perfectly tender with a nice crust. One of the best steaks that I've had in a while.We also got the green beans (with pancetta and pepper flakes, but without the pine nuts), which were perfectly cooked. The chunks of pancetta were nice, though the pepper was uneven so the dish had hot spots. Not perfect but not really a problem. I had no expectations so I wasn't disappointed. We also got garlic whipped potatoes, which were what they should be. We shared the flourless chocolate cake for dessert. It was also what it should have been. The cocktails we ordered were properly mixed, no complaints there either. Service was great. Maybe because we were a couple of properly dressed people with no kids, but we were treated with respect and service was very attentive. I didn't get our waiter's name but he was really great. Management was also great. The only complaint about service is the layout of the dining room results in a bit of hustle and bustle around your table occasionally. But we never got bumped or anything.

5.0,5/10/2015,"I have been coming to the Palm for over 7 years. Quality and quantity never depreciates. This is one of the cheaper steak houses in the city. But the amount of food is always the same and they are on point. I often visit this place for the business lunch. Now called something else which is a prefix, 3 course for $25 or so.  There is always a fish, vegetarian and steak dish as an entree. Something for everyone. I signed up for their newsletter and also part of their member club. So I  am notified of specials when ever available. My office often hosts dinners in a private room for a prefix rate. It's pretty classy and spectacular time if your looking to cater to a very large group. Try the lobster Mac And Cheese, not on the menu but they do offer it. It's one of their hidden menu specialties. This is what we call the 3 hr lunch place. Because the ambiance and food is just so good you can never walk out in less than 3 hrs. Try the 3 medallion fillet mignons. Very difficult to find parking here but if you take the train its just a rock stone away. Make reservations for times when it's peak dinner. Otherwise since it's a pretty big place need not worry about one.

3.0,4/18/2015,"I came here for a company function and we ate family style in a private room, so my experience is probably different from other peoples. Our server Samantha was absolutely top notch from start to finish. She remembered everything, including every single persons drink order throughout the night- we were a party of 12. Bravo Sam! Drinks were good: champagne, the Texas Kicker (tequila and Serrano- I got mine sans raspberries), the Rum Fizz. As for the food, if I'm being completely honest, I have to say it was just OK. I prefer Lugers, Delmonico's, or Wolfgang's (in that order). My favorite things were the cocktail sauce, the garlic and onion bread, and the hash brown. I know that sounds ridiculous. The cocktail sauce that came with the shrimp cocktail was off the freakin charts- loaded with horseradish to the point of being a little spicy. I could have drank the stuff. So, so freakin good, they need to bottle it. The hash brown is massive, browned on the outside and soft and perfectly seasoned inside.The fried calamari was good, lobster is always delicious, the baked oysters were great even though the cheese was a little overpowering, french fries were crispy and perfect. All the vegetable sides were solid and straightforwardly presented (brussel sprouts, green beans, mushrooms). The slab bacon was overwhelmingly salty, the lobster mac n cheese was really disappointing. I'm not sure what cheese blend they used, or what seasonings, but it had no flavor whatsoever. There also wasn't much lobster, I think it had fine strips of lobster instead of chunks. Because we had ordered family style, all the appetizers came out together, followed by the entrees. And this is good, but when it came to the entrees we experienced some temperature issues. The chicken parmesan was room temperature...and so was the steak. I know it's hard to cook for so many people ordering so many dishes and have them all come out at once, but the steak at a steakhouse needs to be hot. It was also the filet, to begin with not my favorite piece of meat because while tender, it doesn't have as much flavor as other cuts.

This is where the 3 star review for an otherwise 4 star restaurant comes in - our server.

Arrived early and had amazing glass of wine in bar prior to dinner. Seated within reasonable time but table selection was disappointing based on circumstances. Sat us in far back of house next to bus station. Constant traffic from wait staff was very distracting. Time from seating to drink order was over 15 minutes. Drinks another 10 minutes. Appetizers took another 20 minutes and were good but not spectacular. Had jumbo lump crab cocktail. Horseradish was off color yellow and did not taste fresh. Bread basket was amazing however. Dinner ordered at same time as appetizer but nearly 45 minutes passed until arrival. She ordered filet medium, I ordered special ribeye just shy of medium towards medium rare. Her steak looked way undersized upon arrival and was cooked medium well at best. Mine came burnt to a crisp on the outside and very well done inside. That's being kind. Very disappointing. They brought new steak in 5 minutes done right (makes you wonder) and ended up taking care of my meal in full for issues. Still, not what you're expecting from a place that gets $50 for a plate or more. Desert was underwhelming. Had both flourless chocolate cake and 7 layer chocolate cake. Both dry and not particularly noteworthy. Overall a huge disappointment considering the expectations we had for such a famous namesake in NYC.

2.0,11/1/2014,"Honestly, we chose to come here for arbitrary personal reasons, rather than having any preconceptions about what the food was. I didn't even know the Palm was a steakhouse until cracking open the menu!To that end, the steak (14 oz NY strip) was pretty great, an impressively perfect medium rare. The brandy peppercorn sauce was an interesting surprise, maybe the one thing on our table that was actually worth the additional cost.Nothing else fared (ha, ha) that well. The Chilean sea bass* was decently broiled, but aside from a small, half-hearted bed of fresh corn beneath, the massive hunk of snowy white flesh was too much of the same thing. Four bacon-wrapped scallops were a bit silly for $17, neither particularly sweet nor fresh. The biggest disappointment was the TERRIBLE parmesan/garlic fries - over half the bowl was dried out. At a steakhouse, you'd expect their potato game to be on-point (or at least better than Burger King's).The waitress had recommended a wine when we asked about a rosé, but the taste she brought was really mediocre. So we went with cocktails instead: Rye & Pear, Cucumber Julep, something else with Icelandic vodka and thyme. Our drinks were fine, unnoteworthy.The Palm is pricey, but still a ""casual"" establishment - you see people in t-shirts alongside the rare guy in a jacket. Service was polite, but our waitress seemed to be winging it when we asked anything about the menu.

I expected that for free/comp'd at that point, but no; $24 was on my bill (I wanted the cold lump meat - took the sautéed as i thought it was a gesture to try to make up for his prior screw-up.)  My steak came out way over-cooked.  I had asked for medium rare + which I do at many finer steak houses to avoid it being too rare.  I was told they no longer do pluses so took medium.  What I received was well done; however, we had been waiting forever so I didn't complain.  The glass of Pinot was good but we had not checked the menu and I wasn't expecting $25 a glass or $50 for two.

5.0,8/26/2014,"I had a hankering for lobster. I was searching high and low for a good place to get lobster that wasn't on City Island or in Red Lobster... My parents recently recommended the Palm and their August Special. For $99, two people could feast on a 4lb lobster with 2 starters and 1 large side. I couldn't resist. My fiancé and I made reservations (via the handy dandy yelp site) and walked right into a quiet Palm Tribeca at 6pm on a Friday. The dinner crowd picked up quite a bit by 7pm. While we were there we decided that a 4lb lobster wasn't nearly enough to feed 2 very hungry people* so for an extra $15, we got the 5lb lobster. And if that wasn't enough, we ordered an additional starter of incredibly delicious calamari.We were celebrating a recent anniversary so we ordered some sparkling wine. The waiter was very kind to make a recommendation and even a suggestion to save us some money**. The wines are steep here, so if you can, maybe drink before you get here. Our lobster dinner came with a choice of lobster bisque, Caesar salad, or a mixed green salad. Noting that the Caesar contained a warning about consuming raw ingredients, I opted for it since it was made from scratch. It was quite possibly the most delicious Caesar ever! I requested it to be lightly dressed. It was creamy and just right. The behemoth of a lobster was split in half. We each got half a tail and one lobster claw each. They provided bibs, which they kindly draped over us, and claw crackers...but they also offered to do it for us. And since I am NOTORIOUS for wearing my food, I obliged when they offered to crack our lobster for us. For the side, we got the goat cheese whipped mashed potatoes. Holy hell. Even as I was filled to the brim with protein-packed lobster, I kept shoving spoonfuls of mashed potatoes in my mouth. Loved them. I didn't think we were going to have room for dessert.... however, we made room for the cinnamon sugar donuts that came with 2 dipping sauce; nutella and raspberry. The raspberry was by far my favorite. The service was amazing. I also think had it not been for the very friendly and attentive service, we would probably have declined the 837 membership. Can't wait to come back! ___________________________________*I skipped lunch. And boy were we wrong. ** if you plan on dining here at least once per year, becoming an 837 member is a smart move.

The staff was very helpful with the menu, with specials and even with off the menu specials. I chose the lobster special and it was perfect. A huge lobster with appetizer and a side...ok, so I had the special for 2, but it was my birthday, so what the heck. The salad was perfect, enough to share. The lobster was perfectly cooked, split open . The staff was surprised that I refused their help in extracting the meat, but for me, that's part of the fun of eating a lobster. The fried asparagus were terrific. I would have preferred broiled, but these were seasoned to perfection, even without the breading. The one thing that set The Palm aside from other restaurants was my iced tea. Iced Tea, you wonder...yes..ICED TEA. You see, I never had to ask for a refill. I never had to ask for more ice or sweetener. The glass was magically refilled every time it went down to half full. The staff was completely on the ball. Finally dessert. Now, usually I would not have had anything, what with the huge lobster and all, but it was my birthday and I knew singing was in order...plus I saw my mom whispering to the waitress, so I couldn't disappoint. I chose the cheesecake and it was terrific. Some sweet strawberry sauce drizzled on top gave it just enough of a sugar kick. The staff came over and sang and all was well with the world.

The original manager who we were friendly with, Scott, was a very nice man. He would always come up to us, he knew who we were. Now he's not longer there & the manager who is there now we don't know. He never comes over to our table to see how it's going, not very accommodating. The old time waiters we know & are familiar with are still there but some that we liked had left also. The new staff isn't that great. My husband order a filet mignon and he got a ny strip. We ordered regular mashed potatoes they came out with mashed potatoes with goat cheese. They also forgot to bring out a pasta that was ordered with our friends meal. That all happened when there was a private party going on showing they couldn't handle a party & regular customers. My husband said even the bathroom wasn't cleaned. We complained to the manager but not even the regular manager, we spoke with a manager who was just helping out who was from the palm in the theater district &  he was a lot more nicer than the regular manager. This place just isn't up to par anymore & we don't spend as much time here as we used to. On a positive note, the louie gee salad is my favorite thing on the menu. It's lettuce with oil vinegar, string beans, egg, shrimp, onions & avocado. Very delicious salad!",1,0,0,Alyssa R.,"Staten Island, NY",76,130,66

In most large cities you can usually find a Palm restaurant, but New York City is where the Palm shines.

Found the service a little more a tentative  and a more spacious Palm.  But now I had the pleasure of dinning at the Palm in TriBeCa on West street and Warren Street.

We had a few disappointments and glitches which I want to attribute to how busy the restaurant was that night. We waited ""forever"" for our drink order and when it arrived our waiter had brought my wine (to come with my entree) instead of my cocktail. The said cocktail arrived fairly quickly after that but my Sidecar up had pieces of ice floating in it (I will blame the rush after the mistake).  The salad we ordered seemed to have been prepared much earlier in the day and was a little tired looking, but did taste good. Lobster Bisque was just okay. Shrimp Cocktail was fresh and sauce had a kick. Night was going alright but nothing to make us come back. That changed when the entrees and sides hit the table. Our Ribeye was cooked Rare to perfection and seasoned properly. Our Crab Cakes were delicious and not overly bready. The potatoes au gratin needed a better cheese profile but were good. The creamed spinach was great. The sautéed mushrooms were lovely. Doughnuts for dessert. Will definitely try it again on a regular night.",0,0,0,Tammy J.,"Brooklyn, NY",16,43,0

I'm used to cream-based sauces, so this was a fun alternative, though I only added the sauce for about half the bites. I ordered the beef medium rare, and the steak was prepared as desired. The green beans were on the undercooked side, which I liked because they still had some crunch.

Its not too far from the World Trade Center. I met my friend here for lunch and upon walking in, most of the patrons wore business like attire. I'm sure they work in the area and dined here for lunch. I liked the ambiance and decor. The walls were filled with caricatures of celebrities and diners who are part of the ""837"" club. Thanks to my friend I am also a member ;-) How it works is the more you dine at a Palm Steakhouse, you earn points towards a myriad of cool things. But for 15,000 points you can get a caricature of yourself on their wall. Pretty cool right? I also get emails for promotions exclusive to members.  Ok so what did I order? I had the lobster bisque soup and salmon. Next time I dine at a steakhouse, I'm going to order steak. My friend had the steak and it was delicious. I was underwhelmed with my lobster bisque soup. It was bland, and I didn't see any lobster in my soup. It was a hot, puree'd mess. And my salmon was just ok. I would like to give them another shot.

3.0,12/6/2012,"I was walking home one weekday from work, and passed by The Palm, and thought ""Hey, i'll treat myself.""Walked in wearing jeans, sneakers and a cashmere sweater - which kind of had me concerned because I felt under dressed. They were very nice, took my coat and bag and I sat at the bar, and felt pleasantly welcome.Decent crowd, mostly banker types or older gentlemen with tans as deep as their pockets. Bartenders were friendly and quick. They had a special 'happy hour' discount on apps, and tried the crab cakes. Normally they are $12, but special was $5.50. Three tiny, tasty crabcakes. Worth $5.50 not $12.I ordered 9oz filet mignon and 1/2 lobster surf & turf - per menu: ""add a half lobster to any order from our Steaks & Chops menu at half the whole lobster price"". The lobster claw and tail were perfect. It could have been the biggest lobster claw I have ever seen, it was like something out of a science fiction show, and I have had LOTS of lobsters in my life. The filet was sadly overcooked. I'm normally not one of those ""Send it back!"" types. But they served it medium to medium well when I ordered medium rare. I pointed it out to the bartender and shrugged, and started to eat it anyhow, even if I wasn't really thrilled about that. No more than two bites later the general manager shows up and inquires about my steak. I show him, he agrees and offers to cook one as I requested - medium rare.I reluctantly agree. Again, I really don't want to cause a fuss, but when a steak costs over $40, I think you should get what you paid for. I normally order filet mignon for my home, and can cast iron pan fry them perfectly (learned by watching Alton Brown do it on youtube). Another 10 minutes and the filet was out and yes, perfection. Couldn't ask for it to be done better. I had this with creamed spinach, which is a MUST order. If you go here and order anything, I suggest this. Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200. Order creamed spinach and add another hour to your treadmill the next day.I'm giving my review three stars. I mean it's good. My total cost, with tip was $175. Yes. One hundred seventy five dollars for the following:1/2 bottle of Cabernet from Dynamite Vineyards3 tiny crab cakes9 oz filet mignon1 enormous 1/2 lobster that escaped from a parallel universe of super lobsters only to be caught by fishermen and eaten by me.1 creamed spinach Worth it? Kind of. But there's lots of other places where I can spend the equivalent amount and feel like i'm getting a bit more, like Raoul's on Prince or The Strip House on 12th. This was a nice treat, and something i'd do again maybe in a few years, but i'd rather go elsewhere.

Just last week my family and I went to Palm with my Mom's birthday gift. On top of that, Palm is currently running this great special on Sundays and Mondays for 50% off bottles of wine. I don't think it gets much better than that, but then it does! The night we went, we also had a special for the fillet mignon. I don't know how Palm does it but it's like the gift that keeps on giving. You just don't know when all the amazing perks, service and food stops.

(make sure you ask for a loyalty card!)For lunch, we were fooled into thinking we were getting some great deal - $24 for a 3 course meal?! But alas! They actually offer this lunch special daily for just $26 - awesome, i think I found a new lunch spot.  I had a caesar salad, salmon with red pepper sauce and mashed potatoes, and the chocolate flourless cake for dessert.  Aside from the cake, which was a wonderfully rich chocolate paste that I am craving right now, all of the food was very average (especially the salmon with red pepper sauce, which i didn't particularly care for).  The upside of lunch here is that the service is fantastic, the food comes out quickly, and you can get back to work within an hour and a half, even with three courses - they even have a notepad at the table in case you are doing bid-ness.When I've come for dinner, I have had the steak that they are so famous for, and I will say that the food has been much better than my lunch experience, so yes...stick to the meats.",0,0,0,Christina Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",73,30,9

I assumed this place might be a bit sleepy on the weekends when the bankers aren't at the office.The only reason this meal didn't hit 4 or 5 stars were two surprising mistakes for the Palm.

My boyfriend's steak was supposed to be medium-rare and his looked more like mine should have.Second, I asked for some steak sauce (since my meat was overcooked for my liking) and it never came to the table.

So let's get down to business...first round of gazpacho tasted much like any other gazpacho that I could get from a diner for so much less.  The salmon was a piece of greasy fish, heavily coated with pre-made sauce that really lacked flavor and color outside of the butter and corn starch it was lathered with.  The side of fried onions and chips were bland as ketchup lathering became a common practice as we dug into the dish.  And the key lime pie?  It seems that the pie was not made in-house, but exported from some ordinary facility; it was there not because of its specialty in taste, but as a placeholder to complete the three-course business meal.  And why two stars?

Great service was a huge plus because the waiter provided excellent service throughout our stay. I care about the food but hospitality is also very important. It doesn't have to be like having a person standing next to me the whole time. Ask when customers need something and apologize when the circumstances made the customers feel unsatisfied. It's very simple and you get will get more than 20% of the bill. We had two different 9oz wines to share(total 4 glasses) and the bill came out to $82 which was not bad.

And here goes the third star - after initially offering prime time only on certain days - but then also again later in the evening (believe 9 - midnight) they figured out that many of their customers actually work for a living...and can't get there for the special pricing. This left the late night days very packed and fun..but I guess management frowned upon actually serving food only moderately overpriced so that gravy train had to end real quick fast and in a hurry.

5.0,12/30/2011,"FIVE STARS FOR THE PALM  (for utterly surpassing my expectations)!!  What a way to round out 2011 with an elaborate and hugely rewarding (and delicious) feast at The Palm.  Came here last night with two other friends, and we were all quite blown away with many aspects of The Palm.  What I imagined would be a quick dinner, not lasting more than one hour, actually ran over three hours long!  We didn't even take notice of the time breezing past as we were all having an extremely merry time indulging in the decadent offerings of this esteemed steakhouse.  Firstly, I was really impressed at how contemporary it felt dining in this large and gorgeous restaurant right by the Westside Highway.  The corner location is perfect and prime.  The setting is warmly inviting with kind wait staff, and an atmosphere that is great balance between upscale dining and down-to-earth service.   The walls are lined with a whimsical collage of celeb faces bidding you to enjoy a meal at this restaurant.  Our waiter was a burly man, very big and intimidating, but Angelo was as his name suggests, angelic, well-attentive, and very professional.  He provided all the service we could have needed or anticipated during our dinner which allowed for us to truly enjoy our nearly 6-course meal!We had some amazingly fresh and tasty food last night, in particular, I enjoyed the appetizer of chunky, lump meat crab and jumbo shrimp, along with the very inventive ""lobster bisque cappuccino"" with a frothy and creamy quality to the bisque, and a large morsel of perfectly tender lobster meat as the surprise in the broth.  The arugula salad with bacon, apple and powdered sugar walnuts was a fantastic palate cleanser, very refreshing and crisp.  We then feasted on incredible surf and turf, where my steak was cooked to perfection, with that smoky charred outer crust, and a tender center.  It was simply divine.  Another favorite was the velvety rich and delicious creamed spinach.  It was so decadent and full of flavor, I was afraid I may have gained a few pounds from my small portion, but it was well worth it.  Theirs was probably the best creamed spinach I had ever had before.  To boot, we had gotten an order of their mega-sized hash brown, which is a carbo-laden party on a plate.  The sweet touch to end our meal was another monstrosity of an order. Amongst the three of us we shared a large slice of carrot cake, a large slice of chocolate cake, with fresh berries, whipped cream, and caramel sauce.  And on top of that, we even got a bag of made-to-order donuts.  The carrot cake was phenomenal.  I am a chocolate lover, so it was surprising even to myself that I had taken to the carrot cake much more than to the chocolate cake.  Both were delicious in their own right, but for some reason, that carrot cake was the winner of the dessert round.  And, with the exception of the donuts which, I thought were a little doughy and hard, everything else that I ate at The Palm last night was a true pleasure.We even had the chance to meet the Executive Chef, Luis Nieto, who is an affable man, humble and without an ego, but also an extremely talented chef based off the food I had last night.  Having said that, I cast my vote for The Palm as one of the most unexpected delights of my 2011 year of food and dining.  What a perfect way to bid farewell to a year of super delicious eats, and bid a warm welcome to hopefully another year of similar gastronomic good food fortune!Happy New Year to All!!",6,3,6,Jennifer C.,"Elmhurst, NY",559,645,1350

1.0,11/14/2011,"In general, I'm pretty open-minded and tolerant about service, food quality, etc.  This is the first time I've been compelled to write such a review.  A group of nine of us made a reservation for 9:30 at The Palm on Saturday night to celebrate our dear friend's departure for the navy -- he was disappearing for two years and we wanted it to be a memorable last dinner.   It was only memorable in how terrible the experience was.We arrived at 9:30 and were continuously told that they were clearing off our table, that it would only take another five minutes, etc.  We stood in the lobby and weren't seated until a full 40 minutes later.  This is absurd for a reservation.After sitting down, we waited another 10 minutes before getting any server arrive with menus and glasses of water.  Since most of the people at the table wanted steak, we decided to order 3 strip steaks that were meant to be shared by 2-3 people.  15 minutes after our order, we were told that there was only one of those steaks left, so our entire table had to look at the menus and choose our orders all over again.When the food finally arrived, one strip steak, ordered rare, had bits that were actually raw and completely uncooked.  Two others, ordered medium rare, were so dry and tough and overcooked that one friend sent hers back and the other just put up with it.  My friend's chicken was three tiny, unsavory strips of soggy chicken in an ambiguous thin sauce, and my shrimp salad was wilted and didn't taste very fresh at all.  At this point the entire group was eating the meal in almost silence.  It was an awful atmosphere for what was meant to be a jovial last dinner.I will say that our server tried the best she could -- the quality of food wasn't her fault.  The girl that sent hers back was given a complimentary lobster cocktail while she waited.  At the end of the meal, the manager came up and apologized again, and the server took great care to see if she could offer us anything else and gave us a huge free dessert platter with four types of cake, saying she specially selected it for us.  They also took the most expensive item, the $96 steak that had been shared by three people, off the menu.  However, this still came up to over $70 a person.  At that pricetag, you would expect a relatively nice dining experience.  But the fact that the food was subpar, the wait was 40 minutes long for a reservation, and the restaurant had such a high reputation for steak all combined to make it a massively disappointing experience.  They did the best they could to apologize, but it still will not encourage me ever to return.",0,0,0,Audrey L.,"San Francisco, CA",0,10,0

3.0,8/30/2011,"Once upon a time, Sarah and Steve walk into The Palm Tribeca with a $50 gift card that expires in two days. It's Monday night. So why not make Monday a ""Fun-day"" and eat a good meal with one of their best friends (who also got the same gift card with expiration date).""Hi. My name is Sarah, and I made a reservation for three at 8:30?""""Ahhh, yes. Is your entire party here?"", asks the host. ""I believe our friend is waiting at the bar....my husband will go look."", she explains as Stephen is already trekking over to check. ""Ahhh, yes."", he repeats. ""I know someone arrived about 5 minutes ago. He should be enjoying a drink at the bar. It will just be 5, 10 minutes......Maybe 15 minutes to seat you, yes?""""Oh. Okay."", frowns Sarah, wondering why she made a reservation in the first place. Fast forward 10 minutes later. ""Your table is ready. You might want to settle-up your tab with the bar.""""Nope."", explains Steve. ""We've already paid in cash. We're ready.""""Oh...okay."" Says the host. And he runs away back to the host stand, grabs some menus, and tells they female host to hold us back as we started to follow him. The three chitchat with the female host, amused by this funny circumstance. She does not find it funny. She asks if they want to pay $25.00 to join the 837 club. She seems to be appalled that Sarah has no idea what this club is and that she must be crazy since the pamphlet  she just handed her explains the club. Her eyes seem to say, ""Stupid woman"". And yet she fakes a smile and says as she slips a pen to her, ""You can fill out the form with all of your contact details, pay the $25.00 fee, and join it now if you want. You get the $25.00 back in a gift card anyway.""Still not fully understanding the club, wondering how she was being seated 15 minutes after her reservation, yet suddenly finding herself with a pen in her hand, about to give all her personal information and a check for $25.00 despite the (thus far) bad salesmanship and service, Sarah steps back and declines. Too bad too. She signs-up for lots of reward programs. Luckily, Jeff, the happy, fun, and honest waiter arrives and saves the night. Steve, Chris, and Sarah enjoy delicious appetizers such as sesame encrusted rare tuna with seaweed salad, the lobster bisque, and crab cakes. They each enjoy a delicious steak cooked to the exact temperatures requested, and green beans with pine nuts, bacon and butter were a great side to share at the table. If it weren't for the calories listed in the menu, these three amigos may have endulged into more wine and dessert. But, who knew a dish of potatoes au gratin had 1800 calories before tonight? The menu was such a nanny about listing every dish's caloric consequence. Sheesh! Therefore, the three left a little lighter after their meal than usual......and a little wiser too. The bill for their table was about $220 before tip. The $50 gift cards brought the price down to what they might have typically expected to pay at a fine (chain) steakhouse and then some. The decor is pleasant and entertaining with the walls filled with caricatures of famous faces; some that had been autographed by their visiting owners. The private room, where there was an obviously drunk teenager asking the waiters for a sharpie and pole dancing in the doorway, was an unexpected source of good conversation. As was the bar patron who's football team apparently lost and wanted everyone in the dining section to know about his agony over it for about 3 minutes straight. OTHER THAN THAT!

3.0,8/28/2011,"Nothing about The Palm sets it apart from other high-end chain steakhouses like the Capital Grille, Ruths Chris or Mortons. We went for dinner this past Friday and ordered wine, antipasta (standard), veal marsala (excellent), au gratin potatoes (cheesy, and good), green beans (would order these again), and one of the specials: blackened ribeye topped with lobster meat and cherry peppers. When it was served, the lobster appeared overcooked (and indeed it was) and the cherry peppers were few and scattered carelessly on the plate. The steak, however, was great. I will quibble with the price. It bothers me when servers list specials but do not give prices, and shame on me for not asking, but I believe that a special should not be more than 20 percent more than the most expensive entree on the menu! This steak was $64. There was plenty of food, and we took a decent amount home, including much of my steak. When we opened the containers today, we found that they had mixed them up with another table's. Thanks, Palm. It all went in the trash -- no way am I eating some else's leftovers!

It did take awhile to arrive after the salad course though.  My Caesar salad was lightly dressed as I requested - very fresh and crisp with good croutons.  We had wild mushrooms and the creamed spinach as sides but only had a few bites as the lobster was the main event so took home leftovers.

If it weren't for the$50 gift card we received from amex, we wouldn't have come in all likelihood... I'm sure you could go to town here, but only on an expense account.

The restaurant was about 2/3 full, mostly with an older crowd. We ordered the calamari (surprisingly good), lobster bisque (MUCH too salty), Monday salad (a chopped salad with anchovies! Different, but good), and the bone in rib eye steak (great quality! Slightly charred on the outside, tender on the inside). The lobster bisque was so salty that I only took a few bites before pushing it away. Hubby told me I should just tell the waitress, but I was kind of shy. However, after some encouragement, I mentioned it to the waitress and she brought the manager over who graciously replaced it with the baked clams (which were great!)The entire bill (with tax and tip) ended up being $110. I believe this is the reason for the lower ratings - it's quite pricey for an ok ambience (Though finding all the movie star caricatures on the walls is fun!).

We had the Soup of the Day for appetizer, the steak salad for entree (with half and half on the side, which is fried onion strips and potato chips) and key lime pie for dessert. The Soup of the Day had some kind of short ribs meat with veggies in it; very average and a bit salty. The steak salad was actually very good; meat cooked to medium rare, just the way we like it, and the bacon bites in the salad were just perfect =P  Ironically, the key lime pie was pretty sour for ""dessert"", but was still pretty good when I have it with some whipped cream on the side.

The dining room is ultra-classy with actual cloth on the table instead of paper. The walls have cariticatures and autographs of celebs who have dined there (I was sitting right underneath George Clooney). I went for the $25 business lunch with a large and well-made salad. My pepper steak was cooked perfectly. I cheated slightly from my paleo diet to get the gluten-free chocolate cake. The second visit in the spring was even better, because I mentioned my diet and the waiter told me that he would substitute a bowl of berries.

1.0,1/14/2011,"There's nothing worse than REALLY wanting to enjoy something and simply NOT enjoying the experience.  We had visited this location a handful of times and the service is inconsistent.  I had a small issue with an order that did not have all the listed ingredients on my last visit.  Instead of anyone correcting or even apologizing for it- I was told I was incorrect.  The moment the item was delivered, I asked the waiter if the salad should have cheese.  He insisted the ""cheddar"" should be mixed in.  I was a bit disgusted that he nearly stuck his nose in my plate to check.  I gave him the benefit of the doubt and continued eating.  Seconds later the manager walked by to see how things were and we nodded fine.  But I came to realize there was no cheese on the salad and it tasted bland.The waiter never came back to check how things were.  A third left of my meal, he walked past and I gestured to show him that indeed the cheese was absent from my plate.  He said he looked the menu item up, it should have had ""monterey jack"" in it, and insisted the kitchen told him that they put it on- perhaps insinuating that the person who was eating it was wrong.  He again put his nose close to examine my plate and pointed to a piece of lettuce and tried to convince me that it was cheese, though it clearly was not.  I picked it out to show him that it was indeed lettuce he quickly moved along to the next table.  I was puzzled by this carelessness- I try to be fair, but could not understand why I was ignored.Speaking to the manager resulted in the same inability to acknowledge the error and this time he said the cheese should have been ""manchego"" mixed in.  Seriously- they should know their own menu and at least acknowledge a mistake.  I would have been happy with that much at that point.  I'm never one to send food back and didn't intend to.  Truly, I only wanted SOMEONE to bring the missing item to the table.  It all could have been corrected by bringing a small ramekin of cheese to the table- it was just jaw dropping to me.  However, not a single gesture was made to simply correct the issue, I was just told I was incorrect.  We were celebrating a special occasion, so I didn't want to cause an issue.  The whole experience was VERY, VERY BIZARRE to myself and to my dining guest!  I must say that the waiter's assistant was fabulous and the hostess was lovely.  It bothers me to think these two who are doing a grand job might be cheated on tips, because those who are responsible for good service are simply NOT providing good service.  I can't help, but feel somewhat cheated on a lunch that cost nearly $70 and an item that arrived incomplete to our table.We took our desserts to go and the waiter (NOT the waiter's assistant) who packaged them up made the containers look quite messy & unappealing with sauces of one dessert in the top of the other desserts container and sticky bits around the edges.  It was a crappy ending to a very odd service.Also, if you're body isn't used to eating a good portion of grease, you'll likely end up with a sick stomach when you leave.  I was sick after my visit and I'm not sure if it was simply the grease or food poisoning.  I live conveniently in the neighborhood, yet I insist- NEVER AGAIN.  It's not worth it.  Apparently, the customer is always wrong here, even when they're right.  There are plenty of other consistent establishments to choose from.",1,1,0,R M.,"Manhattan, NY",33,61,9

4.0,12/8/2010,"I think the Palm will end up being my favorite chain steakhouse as well.  I would say they definitely trumped my dining experience at Luger's by leaps and bounds!  First of all, the price was just perfect. For the month of November, they had a special that was $49 and you get steak & lobster with a side, salad and a dessert!  Perfect.  We had a reservation for a Friday night and waited for a bit to be seated. I was getting a little annoyed because we had a reservation, got their kind of early and yet, we were waiting in the lobby at least 10 minutes past our reservation time while other people were getting seated.  I think there might have been some type of mix up or they forgot about us. In any event, we did not get off to a good start. We were finally seated and service kicked off with a smile.  I had seen on their website about this $49 special which the waiter neglected to mention.  Had I not known about it previously, I would have just ordered what was on the menu as it was not listed anywhere on there.  Lucky me for coming prepared.  I asked him about it and went on to order and I got the NY Strip as my steak selection (I could have gone with that or the filet minon) and got the cheese potatoes as my side and went with the flourless chocolate cake for dessert and a Caesar salad to start with.  Our waiter was really friendly and charming.  Food was served promptly and everything was delicious. I was scared about the lobster as it can vary from place to place on taste, but they cooked it perfectly!  It was delicious and so flavorful!  The steak, which was the star was just amazing. Melted on my tongue and so flavorful as well!  I was a happy camper.  It was so much food, I had to take most of it home and it was still delicious the next day!  A sign of a truly great restaurant!I was not a big fan of the flourless cheesecake, though.  I wish they had something else to choose from for dessert like pie or something, but this seemed to be the best choice.  The waiter offered Jim a free slice of cheesecake because he did not order dessert (his did not come with it) and to my dismay and surprise, he got this HUGE chuck of cheesecake that was simply fantastic!!  I was all over his dessert and could care less about mine. I wish it was on the menu for my choice of desserts! Sheesh! Oh well, it was okay, because this was a more than generous size and what a wonderful gesture!  Another thing that impressed me was that during our dining experience, the manager came to our table and introduced himself and asked how we were enjoying our meal. I thought that was a nice touch and he even asked our names.  Now, that's a sign of good service and what I expect from this caliber of a restaurant.Ambiance was nice and typical setting for a steakhouse.  Busy with a bar and cartoon paintings of celebrities that have visited with their autographs covered the walls.  I got a kick out of looking around to see who has come in.  All in all, we had a great time here. So much so that when offered to join their 837 Club (membership rewards club) we went for it.  You get a $50 gift card so it ends up being free and you earn points when you come back and guess what? We'll definitely be back!  They have locations nationally so that won't be hard at all.  Highly recommended!",6,3,6,Natasha U.,"Washington, DC",283,615,413
4.0,12/1/2010,"My go-to steakhouse in New York City begins with the letter ""P"".  No, not that one.  I don't really enjoying thinking weeks in advance whether or not I will be hungry for something as common as a steak, and I certainly don't want to be told what to order either.  No, for me, the Palm Tribeca is where it is at.  At the Palm they easily accommodate walk-ins though we made reservations just to be sure.  The atmosphere is decidedly relaxed, helped considerably by drawings of celebrities and politicians along all of the walls.  The service is friendly and inviting too.  I am pleased to report though that while the dining environment is casual, the food standards are not compromised in the least.  I opted for a porterhouse steak and a side of three cheese potatoes.  The porterhouse weighed in at a commanding 28 ounces and was about 1000 calories all by itself.  This was aged, prime grade meat prepared perfectly at medium rare, and it was absolutely delicious!  I was so pleased that they cooked it properly; often with bone-in steaks, there can be considerable variation in doneness throughout the steak, but that was definitely not the case here.  The steak was so tender and really was a delight to eat.  The potatoes were served family style, which was a treat for my girlfriend and I to work through.  The potatoes were tender and the cheeses came together well -- another delight, since often multiple cheeses can just amount to clunky mounds of salty fat.  Here, I really enjoyed the creaminess of the dish.To drink, I was pleased that they had an extensive number of nice selections of wine by the glass.  I opted for a Super Tuscan that held up well to the demands of the porterhouse.  Better yet, they offered it in quartino size, which was perfect for pairing purposes.  After the main course, I opted to sit out dessert and just have coffee, given the substantial size of my dinner.  However, my girlfriend was taking advantage of a 4-course special that included an appetizer and dessert.  Apparently the staff didn't want me to sit alone while my girlfriend ate her dessert, so they brought me out a slice of cheesecake on the house.  Wow!  I was really impressed by this gesture.  Mind you, this was no sliver of cheesecake.  What was presented to me was a mammoth slice sitting atop a strawberry drizzle with fresh schlag, made in-house, served on the side.  Delectable and wonderful!  It was such a pity that I could not finish it -- literally, too much food in all!The general manager was kind enough to pay his respects at our table and ask us if we enjoyed everything -- we did.  The waiter returned and explained the rewards program they have:  the 837 club.  Basically you receive advance word on monthly specials, receive the $25 membership fee back as a discount on your next visit, and send you coupons for free food on your birthday.  As an 837 card carrying member, might I add, that this is quite the bargain.  Definitely recommend.4.5 stars",21,9,18,Jim U.,"Washington, DC",690,1303,3044

I learned many years ago to never order steak in one of these establishments if Im ever forced to eat here because the cuts are subpar. Consistently.  In fact, over 5+ plus visits, Im not sure I've ever had a decent slab of beef here. Oh well, I go to the midtown locations because they execute one dish very well--the chicken parm. Its pounded thin, sauced generously and covered with melted cheese.  The massive beast spreads over the entire plate, I rarely finish it.  Unfortunately, the downtown location served me a non pounded chicken parm which I could obtain at any crappy pizza joint for a quarter of the price so who knows if this was a fluke or if they take a different approach to the parm downtown. Either way I disappointed. Now, the inferior steaks notwithstanding, this place may be worth the visit because it serves up some of the better cakes and pies I've ever had.  I ordered the carrot cake last time I was here and the thing looked like a quarter of one of those huge wheels of cheese, it was insane, my 4 person table couldnt make a dent and I had to bring it back for the intern to eat for dinner!  The key lime pie and cheesecake are also mighty tasty.",0,0,0,Ryan F.,"New York, NY",5,42,0

4.0,2/14/2010,"What can I say about the Palm? hmmm.  The Palm is prolly the boy and I's favorite of all the NYC steakhouses and a staple for us for special occassions.  The Palm always meets the curve in it's offerings of both great food and great service.The new loation in Tribeca (technically anyway, its more Financial Dist.) very close to the west side highway seems to have had a bumpy start in its short time at this location, however after giving it some time it has definately started to live up to its namesake and get into the game.We started with the calamari appetizer, which as always was very good.  Cooked perfectly, sweet and tender.  A good start to what was to come.For our meal we opted to get a 14oz Strip, which is really the Palm's signiture steak in our opinion (want an amazing porterhouse?  go to Leugers.)but by all means all the steaks here are excellent. We ordered it with a 3# lobster (not stuffed), which they very happily offered to halve and plate for us as a surf and turf.   The steak (med-rare) was cooked perfectly and was the great quality we've come to expect from any Palm regardless of location.  The lobster was GREAT.  The meat was so sweet it didnt really need any lemon or butter and really stood well on its own. So tender, moist, sweet and rich.  We got the half n half (chips/fried onion) and creamed spinach as sides.  Personally, I think the spinach was better here then at the locations we have been to before.  The half n half was right on point...those thin strip fried onions are addictive...try to eat just 1 of them....it doesnt happen. lolLooking around the restaurant here is like looking around an art gallery of foodie porn......everything looks amazing from the seafood to the meat to the deserts.  They DO offer salads....however if you go to a NY Steakhouse for a salad, you should be ashamed.  Friends of PETA? Do yourself a favor and stay home in your bubble....cuz this is the kinda place where the scene shows up wearing one dead animal as a coat to eat another perfectly cooked animal.  This is definately a piece of carnivore heaven.....Vego's need not apply :)For people not into beef, besides the seafood the fish dishes looked amazing (the salmon looked a lil dry, but I only like salmon as sashimi anyway).  There are also some Italian pasta dishes.  The crab legs looked particularly appealing and I'll have to try them on a future visit.  The deserts...well we've yet to have room for one during any visit lol....but they look GREAT.  That chocolate and carrot cake is piled VERY high...I saw whole families unable to finish one piece.  They also offer staples like fruit, creme brulee, cheesecake and molten chocolate cake (even tho the lava cakes are starting to become just a tad cliche)The service at the Palm is great.  There is ALWAYS someone to fill drinks, take away plates, greet and take orders.  Everyone is always friendly.  I've noticed at this location the staff is a little younger and more laid back and not as uptight and stuffy as the mid-town location, which is refreshing to be honest......part of the Palm's appeal is that it is classy and proper but not uptight and pretentious with a sterling spoon up their asses, and I think this location has that on point.  The waitstaff was very laid back and friendly and crackin a few jokes with us, which is always fun....Price-wise....If you are not prepared to drop about $150 a couple....then you might as other reviewers say, want to try this place on your job's dime....it is a pricey place....but if your the type willing to put down good dollar for good food and service, this is the place.  If your a fan of the Palm or a fan of a good steak....definitely check this place out.  They Palm does NOT disapoint....and if by some off chance they do...they MORE then make up for their mistakes on the spot.",2,0,1,Adam M.,"Maywood, NJ",260,259,991

The chive mashed potatoes came out only slightly warm and somewhat dry, so that was a disappointment.The ravioli appetizer was good. And my friend's Ahi Tuna steak (medium rare) was very good (probably the best thing out of everything we ordered). They also had my favorite red wine as a special (Kaiken), which was a bonus.

Pretty much on west side highway.Came here for restaurant week. The selections for the 3 course dinner for $35.00 seemed impressive.I had the crab soup for appetizer - really watered down and couldn't taste any flavor.I ordered the 9oz filet mignon for entree - cooked medium rare perfectly. delicious. The mashed potatoes were not good. My dessert choice was key lime pie - it was decent and thank god not colored green.Additionally I ordered a caesar salad separately - this was disappointing, considering I usually love the caesar salad done by steakhouses. Not enough dressing, leaves weren't ice cold, and not strong enough flavor.One of my other dining companions ordered the NY strip. They must have given her a runt piece. There was a weird piece of fat or muscle tissue going down the center of it. I mean this is hardly Prime quality. It was an okay experience for the price I guess. I've tried Bobby Van's restaurant week menu and the experience was much better. It could be the newness of the restaurant.

I much preferred the steak at Ruth Chris.  The calamari appetizer was delicious as was the chocolate cake/melt dessert.  The steak was definitely edible after all, I ate the entire thing.  But I have had better, juicier steaks for less money.  In all fairness, not all chefs can master the art of a tender well done steak.  My aunt ordered the lobster and raved about it.  This is a nice place to bring your folks or out of town guests to.  Just go with a full wallet...  Expect to pay about $90-$115 per person.",1,0,0,Isis G.,"Bergen County, NJ",57,100,54

4.0,12/8/2009,"I came here for a lunch meeting with a couple of higher-ups today. Of course, I checked out Yelp reviews the night before so I know what to expect. I had high hopes from seeing all the 4- and 5-star reviews. Pros first: I loved the caricatures and they made for great conversation pieces. The menu was fairly extensive for a steakhouse, offering a good number of seafood dishes.Because I knew half of our group was ordering steak dishes, I decided to go for the seafood instead. I started with the lobster bisque which contained chunks of fresh lobster meat, but the bisque itself wasn't flavorful. It was missing that je ne sais quoi. My main dish was the wasabi and panko crusted seared tuna which was absolutely incredible. The proportion was huge and I was only able to eat 1/3 of it. One of my co-workers ordered the pre-fixe lunch menu with a filet. The meat was flavorful and I loved the homemade potato chips on the side.Now the cons: Our waiter kept giving my drinks and orders to the wrong person at the table. He also missed our VP's entree order and only gave him his salad.There were two large private parties going on at lunch time. Our meal was almost 2.5 hours long because of the long pauses between each course. The manager came over each time to apologize for the wait, but we didn't understand why they were serving 2 large parties before taking care of their tables.To make up for the long waits, they gave us dessert on the house (slices of carrot cake and chocolate cake).In spite of the cons, I would go back to the Palm for dinner... unless I see there's more than 1 private party going on.",0,0,0,Amy C.,"Washington, DC",580,958,52
5.0,12/1/2009,"It was cold, I was in a strange area of Manhattan rarely frequented and my appetite was growing with each step.Where was I? Had I crossed the Hudson and landed in Jersey City? Construction, wide sidewalks and empty spaces-- why, that almost describes the harborside area of JC !I digress.What had lured me from the warmth and familiarity of non-West street Manhattan?$44.95. A number alone, a number that promised me a salad, an appetizer, a 9 oz fillet mignon, a lobster tail and dessert.Promise kept.The restaurant was dead. Hardly a soul present as Black Friday and an early market close culled the general population in that area.Which was fine by me as we were treated quite well by the friendly staff, who even accompanied a request for a well done steak. (Heresy, I know. Not that it was my steak order but a tip of the hat for accommodating the request).Sides are family style and I highly recommend the three cheese mashed  potatoes. Calories are posted on the menu due to Palm being a chain and all. Ignore the calorie count and order it.The fillet mignon restored my faith in steak after a previous stomach problem nearly a week ago (prompted by a steak). Medium in preparation , excellent in execution, I relished every bite of my 9 ounces of bovine paradise.The lobster tail was tasty too but on the small side. Given the price I cannot raise a serious complaint. What little there was of it was cooked well.There was a slight sales pitch towards the end of the meal about joining a membership club. A polite ""No thank you"" was enough, much like the one offered to pesky beach vendors in the Caribbean.The Palm is worth to the trip to the nether-west regions of Manhattan.",0,1,0,Tom K.,"Forest Hills, NY",337,820,47

I mean, what's the point of hosting an event at the Palm Tribeca to offer a salad or club sandwich?Ok, ok, so I don't want to penalize the restaurant for the poor choices of an event organizer, so I will say the Palm staff was very friendly and accommodating, while the atmosphere was well-lit and charming, with cartoon characters of famous patrons.

Filet Mignon.  The flavor was somewhat dull.  Also ordered asparagus and french fries for sides (very tasty).  The wine list is extensive and worth pursuing.  The crowd is mostly TriBeCa locals and people that work in FiDi.  Only set-back, the prices are little pretentious.  Kind of steep.  I've had better steaks than this, for a fraction of the price.  But overall worth the dinner - it's a great place to catch up with an old friend (just like I did myself).",0,1,0,Alex S.,"Queens, NY",7,2,0
4.0,9/8/2009,"Nothing entices patrons more than a $39.95 Steak special that consists of the following...Appetizer: Choice of - Lobster Bisque, Caesar Salad, Mixed Green SaladSteak: Choice of - 14 oz. Filet Mignon, 16 oz. New York Strip SteakSide: Choice of - Mashed Potato, Spinach (Sauteed or Steamed), Broccoli (Sauteed or Steamed), Half &amp; Half (Fried Potatoes &amp; Onion)With that in mind, it was off to The Palms - TriBeca for an excessive gluttonous punishment of carnivorous consumption.The Restaurant:  The establishment itself is rather quaint.  Unlike most other Palm Restaurants, the TriBeca establishment stood out through the excessive natural lighting stemming from the floor to ceiling windows.  The natural lighting helped to amplify the natural mahogany wood tones of the furniture, not to mention each individual caricature figure drawings on the walls.  What was also noted was the spaciousness of the interior.  Each table was gracefully separated with enough room where patrons didn't stand on top one another.The Service:  I'll take this time to specially thank our service Thomas Hunter for an uncanny performance!  The illustration of applicable specials, wine decanting, and slight twisting of the arm to order a dessert was simply superb!  On frequent occasions, Thomas would return to our table to ask if things were in order and frequently refilled our wine glasses without a moment's hesitation.  Thomas' attentiveness was also noted due to our many requests when ordering various items on the menu.  Needless to say, the service was simply impeccable.The Food:Appetizer:  Lobster Bisque - A well executed rendition of a classic starter, the Lobster Bisque contained the proper balance in texture and flavor.  From a textural standpoint, the Bisque contained a runny and frothy texture, which is an excellent interpretation as most establishments serve the Lobster Bisque with a creamy consistency.  The flavor profile was amplified as the slight use of a Bourbon reduction gave the Bisque a most welcoming flavor contrasting.  Although the Bisque itself lacked Lobster Meat (as my bowl did not contain a single piece), the flavor profile and texture execution were simply remarkable.Main Course: 16 oz. New York Strip Steak, Medium Rare - Perhaps the review can be summed up in two words...  BUTTER &amp; OVERCOOKED!  Not to take away from the Steak itself, which contained excessive flavoring due to the proper marbling within the Strip Steak, but the burdensome corpulent use of butter and improper cooking temperature took away from what would've been an excellent steak.  The first detection in the flavor profile of the Steak is the excessive use of butter for which the Steak is coated.  Although the initial impression is of a welcoming embracing, further consumption will reveal that the combination of the butter, seasoning, and marbling made the Steak difficult to consume towards its final bites.  Despite the richness of the Steak, patrons will still discover that the flavors of the butter helped to amplify the seasoning, thus creating a complex and savory flavor profile.  The overcooking of the Steak was another technical flaw.  Having requested Medium Rare, the Steak came out Medium, thus allowing for a slightly more coarse texture than what was expected.  Despite the two inherent flaws, the Steak itself was rich and flavorful, which was an great interpretation of a classic gluttonous consumable.Dessert: Chocolate Cake - Although not included in the $39.95 Special, dinner cannot be completed without Dessert.  Needless to say, the cake was more than one should consume.  The excessive renderings of luscious semi-sweet chocolate were presented in the form of frosting, cake, and fudge.  Patrons will find that the chocolate nirvana that comes with the cake's consumption to be embraced at initial consumption but after further bites, the chocolate itself is too immense to handle.  From the bites that were consumed, the luscious flavors derived from the chocolate were bold, strong, and of course excessive.  Needless to say, SHARE THIS CAKE!$90.00 Per Person in the hole after a bottle of Barbera d'Alba and a Dessert and the night was concluded.  Despite the excessive consumption punishment that was bestowed, the entire experience itself was well accepted.  Needless to say, the remarkable embrace in both service and food offerings at The Palm should be experienced on a first hand basis, if not more frequent than once.",2,1,2,C M.,"New York, NY",266,454,791

You know--fancy steak, shrimp cocktail, couple magnums of cab...man food. While J was delicately debating health care reform over a 12 oz filet, I was at home in my sweatpants watching Bravo reality TV, despondently  chopping up a salad for dinner.  Labor Day weekend plans include lots of swimsuit time, and I'm determined to rock it.  Just as I'm settling down on the sofa in front of Flipping Out (_horrible_ show), fork in hand, inwalks J with a giant take-home bag. ""I hope you're still hungry,"" he says.Inside the bag I find at least 4 oz of pink filet, a huge helping of perfectly crisp home fries, and a mound of garlicky sauteed spinach.  I quickly tell my salad to suck it, bid a tearful farewell to my beach body, and dig in.  At that point, my eyes rolled back in my head, all muscle tension released, and a Scarlett O'Hara-calibur sigh escaped my lips.  The steak was melt-in-your-mouth tender, the spinach perfectly wilted, and those potatoes!  What on earth did they put on those potatoes??

When the waiter asked how I wanted my steak cooked, I replied, ""As rare as is legal."" And he said, ""Black and moo?"" I didn't know what he was talking about, and he explained that the meat was basically seared and still mooing inside. It was fantastic, albeit a teensy bit too salty. Still, I loved it.

We arrived at the restaurant at about that time and after checking our coats, we were promptly seated. So, right off the bat, things were going well at the Palm Tribeca and this continued throughout our time there.  Soon after sitting down, the waiter (don't recall his name) came to the table and asked us if we wanted anything to drink.  I decided to order a 40 dollar bottle of wine (Cabernet Sauvignon) that was quite good. I then ordered the three cheese potatoes for our side dish and I ordered the NY strip steak for my entree while my girlfriend ordered the filet mignon. While some Yelp visitors will be aghast by this, I ordered my steak well-done. After a couple of minutes, the waiter informed us that such a preparation would take a little longer to properly carry-out and then gave us a free plate of shoestring fries and chips (the dish was delicious by the way). I was impressed not only by the heads-up (most waiters wouldn't even bother doing this) but also by the nice gesture with the free appetizer.  As for the food, it was delicious. My steak was prepared to my satisfaction while my girlfriend certainly enjoyed her steak as well. And, the three cheese potatoes were extremely good. The ample side dish was one of the best side dishes I've ever had since I moved to NYC three years ago.
