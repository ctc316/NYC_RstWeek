4.0,4/30/2019,"Came here with a party of five for a friend's birthday dinner. The atmosphere is very high class and our server was very attentive to all of our needs. Scarpetta has one of the best free bread baskets I've ever had. The bread alone might be one of the reasons I want to come back. As for my pasta, i do feel like the portion sizes are very small but the pasta itself was very delicious and it was enough to leave me satisfied - but not stuffed. I wouldn't become a regular here but it's a very nice place to go for a special occasion.",0,0,0,Michelle Y.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",359,112,20
4.0,4/28/2019,"Scarpetta was probably the best restaurant I've attended this year so far. From the bread basket to the desserts, the food was delicious. I only gave it a 4 out of 5 because the portions are small, specially for the high prices (you will spend a lot of money).The octopus was beautifully cooked, however the small amount of it left me wanting more (I took 2 bites, looked down and saw I only had 1 bite left). The chicken was cooked exceptionally, with crispy skin and succulent meat, but again, barely a quarter chicken for $33 is a bit steep (yes, it was good and I wanted more). The desserts were the low of the meal. I had the lemon cake with the smallest lemon sorbet scoop in the world. Think of a large marble, and you will get the idea. Still, I would go again.",0,0,0,ty p.,"Staten Island, NY",0,14,0

5.0,4/26/2019,"Decided to grab some brunch figured concrete jungle would be an ideal spot! Needed a new place, so tag this was it! Place is cool! Service is fantastic. Food is really good! They have a prefix brunch menu $55 per person. Some may find it steep, but it's concrete jungle plus food was quite good!!! Wasn't that busy being a religious Holiday. FYI- Getting to the restroom is like being in a maze. Lots of turns & steps. Well it seemed a lot since I have a bladder of an infant. Any who- If you're around the city and want some new spot for brunch, give this place a whirl. Cheers'",3,0,1,Alcohol U.,"New Brunswick, NJ",666,78,96
1.0,4/24/2019,"I wish I could say I had a wonderful experience or even comment on what the food lacked or needed improvement with. But unfortunately we never had the opportunity.  My husband and I were looking forward to celebrating the engagement of a good friend on a Wednesday night but were extremely disappointed. Our 830 reservation which being European meant 845/9 never happened.   At 845 we asked how much longer it would be as we would order another round.  We were told ""we don't like to give specific times"", at 9 When we checked in again  they said not too much longer. But by 915 we were still waiting with not a single apology or update. We decided to leave and instead popped into a neighborhood place in the flatiron area which was fantastic.  So no I can't give a review about the food but what I can say is the hostesses both male and female were extremely rude, the bartender was annoyed BC when they didn't have anymore of a specific beer and we took more than 5 seconds to select something else got upset with us and the decor! If you are going to hang plants from the ceiling foot the bill and pay for real ones or at least buy fake ones that look better than the cheap knockoffs you have hanging. I really was looking forward to liking this place but with so many other great options in the area don't waste your time.

5.0,4/8/2019,"After visiting the location in Las Vegas and falling in love with the amazing spaghetti, couldn't wait to have the same dish while in NYC. However, the dish served at the NYC location did not have that same, mouth watering, to-die-for basil infusion as the version in Las Vegas. Don't get me wrong, it was still good...just missing the same, basil-y goodness I had been dreaming about. Sevice was excellent, though (seated at the bar), and the woman behind the bar was very friendly and accommodating. Also enjoyed my polenta dish.

5.0,3/20/2019,"Went recently for my friends birthday. Our friend wasn't sure it she would make it in time and when calling, said only full parties could be seated so we asked to be seated for 4 instead of 5 . We each ordered one of the pastas and their cocktails. The cocktails came relatively quickly and were delicious. After placing our order our friend said she was nearby and when we asked if we could add another seat our waiter went above and beyond to reorganize and move the table to ensure we'd all be comfortable which was amazing. She arrived and ordered shortly after all our food arrived but after placing her order, her pasta came out in under 10 minutes!  The food itself was fantastic. I think that the bread at Scarpetta is alone enough to make me want to come back. They had 3 kinds paired with olive oil, ricotta, and an eggplant marinara type of sauce. The pasts was also great. I wasnt sure what to order at first because I was stuck between three choices so after this experience I think I'll definitely be back to try the others. We asked the waiter to put a candle on our friends dessert for her birthday and they came out with the espresso dessert and sang for her. I forget the exact name but they said it was their most popular and I could see why.Honestly I have no complaints with our overall experience here. The restaurant itself was decorated beautifully. And thankfully they had expandable tables for my friend . Will definitely be back!",0,0,0,Julia K.,"New York, NY",379,30,34
3.0,3/11/2019,"We had reservations but they kept us waiting for so long that we were seriously considering just leaving and finding another restaurant. Noise level was higher than I expected. The ambience is nice inside though, but I think the tables were kind of squeezed in together. We had a booth so it was okay for us and we had enough room. But I looked around the other tables and some seemed uncomfortable because there was clearly very little room between tables. Service was decent. The server and waiter checked in on us and refilled our waters consistently. The food was very good but I'm not sure if it warrants a repeat visit. I remember the octopus and the pastas were delicious.",0,0,0,Ada C.,"New York, NY",185,139,4
4.0,3/10/2019,"Nice place. Food was good. I wasn't as wowed as I thought I should be from someone who critiques other chefs on TV. The bread basket came with and assortment of bread, all of which were very good. We had the braised octopus and roasted mushrooms as our appetizers to start. Mushrooms were good but the octopus needed seasoning especially some salt.  Main course we opted to try the home made pasta. We had the short rib and bone marrow angolotti which was good but I thought it was a tad sweet and it needed a bit more seasoning and something herby like tyme or dill; but I guess that's just my preference. We also ordered the cavatelli, that sauce was banging. It was so good! I could eat that all day, definitely better then the angolotti. For dessert we had the strawberries and basil granita and the double baked lemon cake, both were delicious. Drinks were good too, nothing amazing. All and all it is as a good dining experience. Our waiter was a little abrupt and not very helpful with the menu, but she was ok. I would come back and try a real main like the beef or the duck.

3.0,3/2/2019,The host was beyond rude when I asked to be seated in the main dining room when we were assured we would have a table in the main dining room when the reservation was made. We were first seated at the bar and I said I made this request. He crossed his arms in a disgusting manner like he didn't have any say in the matter.  We were eventually seated in the main room with a waiter who gave us an attitude as well.  I am a frequent visitor to this restaurant and do not think I will be going back.  The food was great as always but the service was beyond subpar.,0,0,0,Brooke S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0

3.0,2/27/2019,"I had heard a lot of praise about Scarpetta, so I was very excited to learn that they also serve some of their pastas during weekend brunch, for which reservations are easy to find! We arrived to find live music playing, with a singer and very talented sax player up at the front, and this alone made our morning. However, I have mixed reviews about the food itself. The bread basket they serve is pretty yummy, with buttery scones and rolls for the table to share. Their signature tomato and basil spaghetti is also delicious, with a tangy tomato sauce and fresh and chewy pasta. The three other dishes we ordered, though, were all misses for me: the polenta tasted super meaty, the beet mezzaluna was lukewarm and flavorless, and the pancakes felt undercooked, with an almost raw and doughy texture. Would probably come back solely for the spaghetti but am hesitant to be adventurous with the menu here :/",0,0,0,Saloni C.,"Manhattan, NY",367,60,37

1.0,2/15/2019,"Probably the most disappointing meal ever. I ordered the spaghetti as an appetizer (typically a staple at every other location) and it  seemed to have been cooked without any salt or creamy/butteriness that is present. I brought this immediately to the attention of ?manager who nicely comp'd my awful plate of pasta. However I did it only bc 6 other people were ordering it for their main course (it was my wife's birthday). I would've given 3 stars but they doubled down and said that that ""the executive chef of all scarpetta was in the kitchen [along with all the other top brass ]"" which I can only assume to mean he heard there was a problem so he came to try and help (unsuccessfully). I hope this doesn't mean that all the other scarpettas will disappoint. The rest of the team was great ... just don't ask for help navigating the maze to the bathrooms that aren't located in the restaurant....[update] I was sitting here discussing Sandra Oh and out of nowhere they took my water glass. I gave a great tip prior (even with all the food issues bc the waiter was a gem) so i don't know what that was about. Don't plan on a comfortable evening here![2nd update] response from dear friend ""Went to Scarpetta Beach in Montauk when they opened a few yrs. ago.

I've been meaning to check this place out for years but my boyfriend and I finally went as an early v-day date night and we couldn't have had a more perfect meal. Started the evening with great wine + friendly server, and a delicious bread basket! Our server had given great recommendations as we ended up choosing the raw yellowtail crudo (yummy!), braised octopus (perfectly cooked), and cauliflower for appetizers. For the entrees, we shared the Lobster Black Tagliolini and of course, the Signature Spaghetti! Both were delicious but my boyfriend preferred the lobster and I preferred the spaghetti. I loved the decor of the restaurant-- very chic towards the bar area and warmer tones in the dining area. Great for drinks or a date!

5.0,2/12/2019,"One of favorite restaurants of all time.  We have visited Scarpetta in Las Vegas & NYC several times and it is always, literally, spectacular.  The host was super friendly and apologetic for not seating us right away but it was obvious how busy the restaurant was on a Sunday night.  We were seated in a reasonable amount of time and our waiter ( I can't remember his name but he was Romanian) was super!  He got our drinks super quick and we were munching on Scarpetta bread and appetizers right away.  The duck foi gras ravioli with marsala reduction is phenomenal and a one-of-a-kind meal.  I had steak wagyu with a rosemary sauce and there are just no words!  After several glasses of wine with dinner,  we finished off our meal with a fig & sabayon dessert that was pretty amazing also.  We travel all the way from Virginia and plan our entire visit to New York based on visiting this restaurant!  The service and food is worth it every time!",0,1,0,Amy H.,"Chesapeake, VA",1,42,1
5.0,2/12/2019,"Came here with a friend for a catch-up dinner Sunday evening. Located at the crossing of 29th street and Madison Avenue. Cozy and intimate ambiance. The decoration gives you a romantic feeling. Perfect option for date night or a girls night out. The service was very attentive, the waiter explained the menu and apologized that two options were not available that night. The complementary bread was fresh and love the eggplant dip! As me and friend both cut down the meat intake, we chose yellowtail from the crudo menu and picked the black cod and the black bass as our entrees. The portion was perfect, presentation was beautiful. I tried both and I prefer the black cod. The texture of the fish was very tender, and the sauce was perfectly seasoned. The tomato  goes well with the fish, added a little bit sweetness and acidity to increase the freshness. We ended our dinner with the dessert torta sabbiosa (black mission figs, marsala sabayon & fromage blanc sorbet), a great combination of creamy and fruity flavors.It was a great experience dining here, the per person cost (after tips) is approx $93, including one glass of wine.

The salad was refreshing but it was your typical roasted beet salad. The yellowtail was good but meh. The spaghetti was where I was really disappointed since it's what they're known for, right? It was just a blob on the plate and it wasn't even that warm. Super salty but the texture was alright. Hubby got the seared ahi albeit he probably should've ordered the branzino. The ahi must've been seared on quite a bit of oil because the plate was just so greasy and it left such a greasy aftertaste in our mouths. It was pretty salty as well and it was on a bed of garbanzo beans and some other random veggies.

Honestly I don't give such a high recommendation to many restaurants. #Scarpetta has gone above and beyond in service, entertainment and brunch.The waiters are highly trained, they come and can take the dirty silverware without you even knowing. The food was savory. We were a group of 6 and had a few warm up dishes of salads, and the  cauliflower which was okay, it needed a bit more flavor. Than came my pancakes which were soft, with a delicate touch of white sugar powder and warm maple syrup. I also tasted the french toast that could have been a bit less soggy. Nothing is perfect but this sure was close. My drink was a foamy expresso coffee with an orange peel.It was my friend's birthday and they served her a surprise cake with ice cream. What a fun morning. P.S. the bread they serve in the beginning is the sweetest flat scone with Jelly and soft fresh butter. I could eat that with a cup of coffee.

The spaghetti with marinara sauce was good, but undeserving of a cult following. The tagliatelle with crab was good. The best pasta was the agnolotti with short rib and bone marrow.  Very complex flavor that you needed to eat slowly.  The meal was paced quickly.

When we arrived for our 5:30 reservation the restaurant was empty but the bar was packed. After first trying to seat us at the bar, we asked to move to a quieter table in the restaurant, reminding the hostess that it was a special night. She said she needed to check even though the restaurant was completely empty. She then moved us to a tiny horseshoe-shaped table right by the waiter's station where it was incredibly loud and chaotic. Literally the worst seat in this huge EMPTY room. They knew we were there to celebrate and had no interest in helping to make it a special night. We were not impressed by the food at all. Very overpriced and mediocre. We ordered a lot of different things and I can honestly say that the best part of the meal was the breadbasket. Definitely not coming back.

The bread is delicious as others pointed out. And we ordered the famous Spaghetti, and the Truffle Spaghetti, and creamy polenta. What really bothered me is the service we received versus the expectations you would have at a high level restaurant such as this one. We gave 18% tip in the end.

On the food- their signature spaghetti, while simple, is so so good and definitely worth trying. It's also available on both brunch and dinner menus. The mushroom polenta (to share) was also super tasty. Make sure you leave room for the bread baskets here btw- dinner especially. They have a calzone/roll like bread that is addictive and very tasty. Brunch scones are also . Everything else is good but standard...wouldn't say anything really stuck out as being a must have (but definitely still enjoyable). Bf said steak and eggs (on brunch menu) was 3/5 so probably not the thing to get here...Service was not overly friendly but was professional and attentive.

The other two people in my party were running 40 min late because their cab took them to the wrong address. I told the hostess what happened, and there were 5 free tables so I asked if I could be seated while I waited for them so I could order some food .  They told me they would give me a better table if I wait. I said I'd be fine with any table as long as I didn't have to wait. I asked what the less desirable table that was available now would be and the hostess walked away from me.She went to get another host who told me my table wasn't ready but would be ready in 5-10 minutes. I realize that they have a policy that they won't seat a table until everyone has arrived, but to follow that robotically regardless of the circumstances is incredibly irritating. Over 10 minutes later nothing had happened so at that point I was just staring at the hostess stand. Finally the host ended up seating me in one of the tables that had been available for the entire 30+ minutes that I was standing there. So ridiculous. The food was good, but the portions seem to be getting smaller each time I go. Plus the service was EXTREMELY slow. Also, we asked for a second bread basket and the bread our server brought was hard as a rock.

The bartender was so nice and their wine by the glass list is pretty good. I usually find at other places the wine by the glass can be sweet or give me a headache. I saw their spaghetti and that they were charging $26 for it. To be fair I can make my own spaghetti from scratch so charging 26 seemed a little steep especially for such a simple pasta. My boyfriend however said this is the best spaghetti and we have to get it. Honestly, when someone says something is the best I don't know what to think. It's spaghetti. Will it taste better because I'm paying more? Nevertheless we ordered the spaghetti. It came out so theatrical and beautiful.  And trust me it was worth it. I would probably get another if I wasn't already full. It's so simple but so good!

Now the less positive: The food was mediocre at best. Beet salad starter was a child's portion of ordinary ingredients with balsamic drizzled over it. Razor clam starter was almost inedible, like a poorly-prepared ceviche with a very small amount of actual clam, chopped up into little pieces and mixed up with some distinctly-odd spices. The short rib and marrow pasta, on this night and to this reviewer had little taste, no discernible short rib or marrow in it, and had a strange vinegar aftertaste.  One of the three people in our group actually overall liked their dinner.

However, my last experience was just ok. Service and ambiance were very nice as always. We enjoyed our appetizers very much ( mushroom polenta and a short rib app), however, their home made pasta was just a huge disappointment. My husband ordered their famous spaghetti with a red sauce( I believe) and I had a pasta with crab meat. My crabmeat pasta had an overpowering taste of melted butter, in fact,  it was literally swimming in butter and there were very few pieces of crab in it. I couldn't finish it, which rarely happens to me, as I love my pasta. My husband's dish tasted very bland. It definitely needed some salt, and it also had lot of butter in it ( even the sauce was pink instead of red). For desert we ordered strawberries in a whipped cream and some green stuff. That was delicious! Could have eaten 3 of those. Bottom line, I don't go to Italian restaurant for a dessert or and appetizer.

Upstairs at the restaurant is definitely more tolerable then downstairs I would actually say it's not bad the manager made sure I was good both times I visited and the bartender was friendly....The first time I visited I was in the mood for Italian and did not feel like travelling all the way downtown to L'Artusi so I found Scarpetta on yelp and me and my best friend decided to visit. When we arrived we both was a bit apprehensive because I didn't know if it was a dress code I'm always dressed up however my BFF was dressed more ""urban"" not like that determines what you have in your pockets but this is New York! When we got to the hostess we paired in and seen some people dressed up but lots of men in T shirts and jeans which took the worry off a bit.... but unfortunately although others was dressed down I would not recommend dressing down and dining here if you are black you will not be treated the same....The food was actually really good and so was the drinks at the restaurant. I had the duck and Foie Gras ravioli and my friend had the Tagliatelle both rocked in flavor I just wished my ravioli was a little more textured.... I wasn't able to tell if my filling was duck, goat or beef there was to distinction.I missed something so while waiting on a table we decided to visit the bar downstairs as soon as we approached the empty space someone stops us and tells us oh just to let you know you can come in now but you might not be able to come in later.... umm okay this was weird and me nor my friend could understand why this manager or door service person was telling us this and not stopping anyone else... whatever we had 2 drinks each which cost us around 17 bucks a pop which is standard for this type of place. any who the place does have a vibe I just wish the workers and management had better attitudes and maybe diversity training. After we went upstairs and ate we returned to the bar and like clockwork that same manager appeared from the crept and advised us that we could not come back in... we did not argue as we just had a good meal and really didn't give AF anymore....We agreed the vibes was off but I wanted to give them another chance I went to Scarpetta yesterday alone dressed nice as usual and the vibe was a little better than my previous experience with the bestie. The manager was friendly made sure I got a seat at the bar and chatted with me a bit which was nice I ordered the short rib and bone marrow ravioli. flavor was great, I'll order it again I just wish there was some bone marrow on top of the ravioli that would of been amazing! I decided to go downstairs as the manager advised me that they had a live band the crowd this Tuesday night was very artsy and I loved ever eclectic minute of it the band was decent as well... However when I went to check out I had the oddest interaction I just brought a drink at the bar and paid for it with no problem I decided to sit and have a bite so they moved me to seating, I get an appetizer and decide to leave I hand my credit card to the waitress she comes back and tells me my card is declined I look at her crazy because not only did I just use my card but there's no reason for my card to decline I give her another card she then asks me for ID and is whispering to management being a total weirdo I decide to go over and just pay cash especially after I called my card and the card was never even ran! my card did not decline at all There chip system was not working and instead of saying that she said I declined smh this pissed me off I spoke with management who had the most  lackadaisical, nonchalant, douchy approach ever he basically did not care at all offered no explanation or resolution and shrugged his shoulders so I decided my words or concern wasn't worth value in this establishment and decided I'll take my business elsewhere",1,1,0,Tia N.,"New York, NY",14,89,56
3.0,10/3/2018,"I liked the food and our server was cheerful, helpful - also recommended really good wine :) - that is why it retains 3 stars at least - would have been a solid 4 but alas..It looses stars from me because they made us wait over 30 minutes beyond our reservation time and I found the hostess quite abrupt and unattentive. We got a half-hearted apology and a ""we are backed up"" explanation on why we were waiting ONLY AFTER we asked 20minutes later than our original reservation. Even if you are backed up there are better ways with dealing with the situation. I felt we were not valued as customers at all. Also being sat between 2 large groups was not ideal - basically had to leave after the main course because it was getting to a point where the noise of guys talking was hurting both my ears. They should have been more considerate about organizing the seating plan considering we waited so long as well.",0,0,0,Nicole C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,2
2.0,9/29/2018,"I have been a regular at Scarpetta since 2011 and previously considered it to be in the top echelon of Italian restaurants in the country. Countless visits over the years to the Scarpetta in the Montage in Beverly Hills, the Scarpetta in the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas, and the old New York one near Chelsea Market, and I never once had anything less than a stellar experience. Unfortunately, tonight was a huge disappointment.The new location at the James hotel is beautiful and classy. Truly top-notch. We started out with the creamy polenta, which was very good as per usual. However, the pasta courses were a travesty. --SpaghettiThe Spaghetti was severely overcooked and not even close to al dente. When I asked to have it re-made, the manager had the audacity to tell me that this is fresh pasta and it does not have the same texture as dry pasta. Thank you, but I've had this dish over a dozen times and I can tell you definitively that this was not cooked properly. The second time it came out, the spaghetti was properly al dente, but lacked the depth of flavor that it usually does. I wonder if to save time/money Scarpetta stopped infusing their sauce with the garlic, basil, red pepper flake oil blend?--AgnolottiMy date had the agnolotti. I think Scarpetta needs to revisit the definition of agnolotti. The entire problem with this dish was the size and shape of the pasta. What was served was actually what I can only describe as a lumpy dumpling. Because it was improperly sized, by the time the filling was cooked through, the pasta was overcooked. The second time it came out, the center filling was cold, presumably in an effort to properly cook the pasta.At this point we had enough, cancelled the rest of our order, and asked for the check. I will give credit where credit is due. The service was excellent. Our waiter was very attentive, apologetic, and asked if they could bring us anything else instead. Unfortunately, the kitchen that night was far from even decent. We won't be returning.",0,1,0,Jennifer G.,"Manhattan, NY",1,11,0

5.0,9/19/2018,"Just Wow!I visited Scarpetta for a private birthday dinner and I must say, it was a dining experience to rave about. From the service, to the food down to the music.. everything was superb. Location: Scarpetta is located on the corner of 88th and Madison. Unless you are deliberately searching, you will not know the establishment is a restaurant upon first glance. Ambiance: Classy, up-scale and extremely intimate. Your experience starts upon entry. Candles lit up the restaurant, white marble covered the bars..just gorgeous. Service: Excellent! We had a party of about 30 for dinner, with 2 servers. Though there were times it could've been easy for anyone to get overwhelmed.. they handled the large crowd with such poise. As someone who was once a server, I noticed their attention to detail and the efforts they continually made to attend to everyone's needs.. Which they did.Food: The food is veryyyyyyyyy authentic, I have not had authentic Italian food like this since my visit to UVA a few years ago. My favorite items from the menu were: - Of course the bread basket..  (who doesn't love carbs.. assorted carbs at that!)- The cauliflower romanesco- The roasted chicken and my personal favorite...- The spaghetti (made with their signature handmade pasta)- MUST TRY!Overall, this was a divine experience, filled with love.. great food and even better hospitality.

4.0,9/13/2018,"There are a lot of things to say about Scarpetta as a restaurant, but the most important of them is that they serve:1. The best bread basket ever. If they had only given us the fluffy rolls, buttery focaccia, and crusty Italian bread...it would've been enough. If they had only provided us with citrus-infused olive oil, eggplant caponata OR the mascarpone butter...it would've been enough.Surprisingly, Scarpetta lays every one of these items in front of you in a sumptuous, complimentary carby feast, along with the absolute kicker: STROMBOLI. With smoked mozzarella, salami, basil, and cherry tomatoes, this is meaty, cheesey bread, people; it's a meal in itself, and a damn good one. And it's all on the house.2. The best spaghetti ever.They are justifiably famous for the simple perfection of the world's most commonly used pasta cut adorned with the ingredients everyone uses: tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, butter, basil. It's just done better than you've ever had it before. It's a rare place that has two superlatives such as these, so Scarpetta is worth a stop, despite the price tag.It also helps that the room is beautiful, with plants hanging from every inch of the ceiling, and that just about everything you get (the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti!) including dessert will be high quality, the service will be attentive, and if nothing else, you got to eat that stromboli.",14,7,13,Peter D.,"Brooklyn, NY",4675,3022,10464

4.0,9/10/2018,"My friend recommended Scarpetta as the restaurant with ""the tomato & basil pasta that you are willing to pay for and can never make on your own."" Overall, Scarpetta is a hit or miss kind of restaurant - the pasta is either delicious beyond belief or mediocre and not worth ordering next time. For appetizers, I tried both the creamy polenta and seared diver scallops. HIGHLY RECOMMEND the creamy polenta - great portion, flavorful, beautifully plated, unique, and one of a kind in flavors. As for the seared diver scallops, it was delicious but it tasted like any other good seared scallops appetizers I've had. For entree, I found the tomato & basil spaghetti to be as great as my friend mentioned. Usually when I order tomato & basil pasta, it's because I'm at a restaurant that doesn't specialize in Italian flavors but I'm craving pasta and want something safe (i.e. at a pub). However, the flavors of the tomato & basil at Scarpetta was so well absorbed into the spaghetti that I really have to salute to the chef. Although I wouldn't say the tomato & basil was life changing, it was by far the best tomato & basil I've ever had and a dish I know I will be ordering from here again. In addition to the tomato & basil, I also tried the short rib & bone marrow agnolotti since I read a lot about it on Yelp reviews. However, I found the pasta to be meh. It was quite dry and really didn't have the best combination of flavors.",0,0,0,Funglin W.,"New York, NY",847,462,61

4.0,9/2/2018,"This is one of my favorite Italian picks.  The end-to-end experience has always been fantastic and the food is sublime.  I must note that I always end up ordering the pasta dishes as my entrees as they are what set Scarpetta apart  - plus who doesn't love carbs overload.  The service here is always lovely and seating comfortable (recommend a booth for smaller parties).   Some cuisine highlights:1. Braised octopus:  This is my must-order dish with tender and flavorful octopus perfectly braised with a crispy char and served alongside artichokes and potatoes.  The scallion vinaigrette takes the flavor profile to a new level.2.  Short rib and marrow agnoletti: Tender agnoletti with perfectly braised short rib and marrow in a rich and creamy tomato sauce with shredded parmesan.  This is my version of the perfectly decadent comfort food.3.  Pappardelle: Light pasta dish with fresh lump crab, peas, and pancetta, plus a hint of lemon zest.  The sauce is incredibly flavorful and brings out the crab and smokey pancetta but still maintains a refreshing feel.  4.  Duck and foie gras ravioli: Fantastic rich and creamy filling inside tender pasta squares in a decadent marsala sauce.  Each bite is an explosion of flavor and textures.   5. Bread basket: The bread basket alone is reason to come here.  Warm mozzarella and sorpessata rolls with rabe and garlic.  Fresh from the oven.  Fluffy Asiago cheese topped rolls.  Foccacia.  All served with eggplant dip, EVOO, and marscarpone.  This is a meal in and of itself.  I literally have to stop myself from polishing off the entire basket before apps are even served.  Definitely worth a visit for a carb-fest - plus the octopus.",3,1,2,Danan R.,"New York, NY",924,1916,85

4.0,8/15/2018,"One of my new favorite restaurants in NYC! My sister and I came here for the first time for restaurant week. We were also celebrating her birthday so I wanted to go somewhere we hadn't been before and someplace nice with great atmosphere. The morning of I noticed Scarpetta had an 8:30 pm reservation so I snagged us a spot. We arrived very early- almost an hour early and the host told us to grab a drink at the bar downstairs. We had a drink there while we waited for it to be 8:30. They had a live band playing and it was a really nice atmosphere- a great place to meet a date before dinner. Once it was 8:30 we went back to the host and they made us wait another half hour before we could be seated although we already had a reservation. I was a little disappointed that no one from the staff came to update us on what was happening or offer to seat us at the bar or have a drink. At a place with such a good reputation, I expected that at least. At 9 we were seated. We ordered the restaurant week menu. They ran out of the yellowtail and they replaced it with the tuna roll appetizer which was a good substitute. The tuna itself was great. Amazing quality of the fish and very fresh. It also had truffle in it so the flavor of truffle was very present. I liked it but It wasn't something I would order again. For the main course we both ordered the spaghetti. It was incredible! They serve it with a glass dome on top and then removed it. Once that was removed, you instantly see all the steam rise and get a whiff of the amazing pasta you are about to dig into. Great portion of pasta and it was just super flavorful. For dessert I had the chocolate cake and my sister had the olive oil cake. Both were delicious but the chocolate cake was so rich I couldn't eat more than a bite. But it was tasty none the less. For her birthday they brought out mini cakes and chocolates with a candle.

The presentation was on par on par; however, the food was okay. First few bites were amazing, but then we were able to feel the excessive amount of salt in our foods. Later on, we had to ask for more bread because our foods were too salty for us.

Scarpetta is beautiful on the inside, very airy and open. You don't feel like your fellow diners are sitting on top of you. We spent a half an hour at the bar waiting for our friends and the Bartender was lovely and the cocktails were very good.Once our friends arrived, we were quickly shown to our table. Our server was great, very attentive without being overbearing. He brought over a lethal basket of focaccia​, stromboli,​ ​and assorted bread​, along with mascarpone​ cheese and olive oil.We had:- Polenta with Truffled Mushrooms - delicious and I absolutely hate polenta and had no attention of having any.- Yellowtail - tasty and fresh- Short Rib and Bone Marrow​ Agnolotti​ - Absolutely amazing. The heartiness of the short ribs coupled with the creaminess of the bone marrow made it a hit.- Lemon Cake - Delicious Yes, me and my friends all ordered the same food! It was totally delicious​ and we will definitely​ come back.",3,0,8,Jaimee A.,"Manhattan, NY",2283,1635,654
5.0,7/17/2018,"Okay, hands down best spaghetti I've ever put in my mouth.  Last week I came here for a Sunday brunch, and four days later I came back for a dinner because it was that good!  While dinner was just as fabulous food-wise, I really preferred the vibe of Sunday brunch: live jazz band, a more light in the dining room, and an overall more relaxed vibe.  That being said, both times the service was outstanding and everyone who worked in the restaurant, from the host/ hostess to all of the various servers were so kind and warm.Getting right down to the food, because I went for both brunch and dinner, I tasted many different dishes.  To start, the have the most fantastic bread baskets.  For brunch, you get a little ciabatta and a delicious corn scone thing that tastes like a cookie-- wish they gave more of those!  And for dinner, you get an assortment of breads, a few of which are mozzarella & pepperoni rolls!  I've never had a warm pepperoni roll come in a complimentary bread bask and omg, this did not disappoint.  You know the meal is gonna be fantastic when they give you free pepperoni rolls-- like what?!?!?Between the meals, for appetizers, I tried the beet salad, the braised octopus, and the roasted zucchini.  The beet salad was good, but the flavor of the dressing didn't really come through so I wouldn't necessarily order it again.  The zucchini was a similar deal, good enough, but mostly just steamed & buttered zucchini, so nothing too special.  The braised octopus however had a nice crispy char, and a really delicious salty flavor.  You also get quite a bit of octopus so it's a pretty good deal, and I'd definitely order this again if I come back.Now for the pasta dishes!  Between brunch and dinner we ordered: the spaghetti, the cavatelli, the zucchini ravioli, and pappardelle.  Each dish was FABULOUS, but the ultimate standouts were the ravioli and the spaghetti.  The ravioli exploded with a burst of butter, ricotta goodness the minute you bit into them and I've never had such a flavorful ravioli.  The spaghetti though is the ultimate star: cooked to the absolute perfect al dente, and the tomato sauce is slightly creamy.  The basil really shines through and ugh I am just salivating writing this.  We also ordered the black bass at dinner, and this was a very well composed fish dish, but the pasta really outshines everything here so definitely stick with the pasta.Dessert is equally as fantastic.  We ordered the Twice Baked Lemon Cake & the Espresso Budino.  The lemon cake has a beautiful citrus flavor throughout the dish, but the better of the two was definitely the budding.  A rich mousse, with a tasty crumble and delicious ice cream on top-- every piece of the dessert worked really well together.  Don't pass this up!Absolutely amazing overall experience here.  You have to come here!",1,0,1,Alex W.,"Boise, ID",20,252,466
2.0,7/10/2018,"A disappointment all around. In a new location on 29th street, this version of Scarpetta has lost its charm and the quality of the food. The spaghetti which used to be perhaps the best in the city is a small, bland portion for crazy pricing. In fact, bland is the word to describe the entire experience. All of the dishes, from the wagyu strip to the polenta to the pastas needed more seasoning and bolder flavors. The decor is rote obnoxious ""hip."" At least the cocktails were good, and after a slow start the server was quite lovely. But for the price and the type of food, there are dozens upon dozens of far better Italian restaurants to chose from in this city.

I was so impressed at how everyone works as a team at this restaurant! from the busboys to the managers everyone was welcoming, polite, courteous, and I genuinely felt like they wanted you to feel like family. The Ambience was lovely and the music was not loud which is actually important to me because I hate going to restaurants where I feel like I have to scream across the table to be heard. Food: I was torn between the duck + foi gras ravioli and the spaghetti.....so naturally ordered both. Do yourself a favor and get the spaghetti, it's so simple but so well done here you will not be disappointed!! My mom ordered the halibut which was also perfect and delicious.

The service was good, prompt, we really liked the sommelier. The server was a bit pushy for us to order and get out of there. Would've been nice if he slowed down and let us enjoy the celebratory evening.The wine was excellent, 1 red, 1 white that the sommelier chose. And the wine COMPLETELY outshone the food.We had the spaghetti, the lobster pasta, the foie gras pasta. Everyone was disappointed compared to the hype. Desserts were decent, and I will say the bread and butter was delicious. But for a price tag of $100 per person, it's sad that the butter and wine were the highlights of the meal.Did I mention the clientele? We had some douche continuously sitting down at our table trying to get us to get drinks with him. Felt like I was in Meatpacking District. Expect pretentious people here.I wouldn't go back.

4.0,6/18/2018,"The reputation and atmosphere is what attracted me to scarpetta and I was not disappointed. As a vegan I was glad that I had options on the menu including a pasta dish. I definitely wouldn't come here on my own but I was very satisfied with Scarpetta for the group I invited. Everyone was happy with what they ordered too. One complaint: I was shocked by how the server handled the orders for salads. One of the non-vegan diners asked for the market salad which the menu described as containing a mix of seasonal vegetables and the server literally brought a plate of lettuce with no other vegetables on it. When I asked for dressing on the side, the server brought my salad with dressing mixed in and told me I was wrong when I pointed out that it had dressing mixed in. It did-- a vinaigrette that I tasted when I took a bite. He took it back and brought a much smaller salad with tomatoes on it this time-- it was very strange and hard to believe that of all the intricate plates on the menu the server and kitchen failed to successfully create a very simple dish that should have included less than 5 ingredients. Bottom line, still recommend. Hopefully will have a better server next time.",0,0,0,K O.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",105,39,9

3.0,5/25/2018,"TLDR: Ok food, very cute place, kind of hyped spot. Highlight is its bread basket and wine selection!Scarpetta moved from its Meatpacking location to Nomad earlier this year, much nicer location IMO. They are tucked in the James Hotel Nomad (same downtown hotel that houses Jimmy's rooftop) and has a cool lounge downstairs - The Seville.Nice addition to this area of the city that keeps popping new trendy places. Competition here is high, and I think Scarpetta does not come to par. Food was ok, but nothing exceptional or food I kept dreaming of for weeks (e.g. penne vodka from Carbone).We had dinner on a Friday. Bf had spaghetti with tomato and basil ($26), which comes in a cool ball in the center of the dish, very creative presentation considering it is just a plain pasta dish. Pasta was good, handmade, but that's it. The sauce was nothing special, I even like TJ's sauce better. I had the chicken ($29) sicilian spiced, spätzle, orange olivada, vegetables, parsnip. It was ok, I expected more of the Sicilian spices. My nona from south of Rome definitely had more spice in her hands preparing anything like this. Place is very cute, perfect for a special date or parents. Attention was excellent, some servers even have an Italian accent which definitely is a plus to give the place a ""we are truly Italian"" vibe.My favorite thing was the complimentary bread (Stromboli, focaccia with olive oil, eggplant and mascarpone dip). As someone said, you could make a meal out of this lol.Wine service was also great. Sommelier was great providing recs and even decanted our wine.So maybe I will come back for wine and bread.

We will definitely be back, and I'll be tempted to try their other locations in Miami, Philadelphia, Newport and the Hamptons. (My one complaint: the beets in the beet salad. They did not taste fresh. I never liked beets until I had them cooked fresh at Sissinghurst. Now I grow my own and cook them in a variety of ways. No matter how I do them, beets have a distinctly great taste when they are fresh. Maybe it has something to do with sugars and starches and how they convert.

5.0,5/10/2018,"Scarpetta was definitely our most exquisite meal of our recent trip to NYC.  We had been traversing midtown, going to one museum to the next, and it was miserably cold and rainy outside for a May afternoon. We were starved by the time we got to the restaurant, a half hour before our reservation. The hostesses were very accommodating and sat us within a few minutes. Our server was very attentive and super nice. He answered all my oddball questions and made good recommendations when we couldn't narrow down which pastas to choose.  The decor and atmosphere was sleek and romantic, but it all became a bit of a blur once our Italian feast began. Most places, the bread service is an afterthought, but not here. They very wittingly know it sets the tone for the entire meal, and they treat it as such. The focaccia was amazing, the Stromboli was so hearty and delicious you could make a light lunch out of that alone. And even the accompaniments: an orange-scented olive oil, mascarpone butter, and the absolutely fantastic eggplant caponata were executed down to the last delicious detail. We ordered the braised short rib of beef with vegetables and farro, along with the signature polenta with fricasse of truffled mushrooms.  I'd been wanting to try Scott Company's polenta since I saw some random clip of him describing it on the Cooking Channel years ago. Polenta, and maybe even more basically, corn, is one of my favorite things on Earth.  And oh my God, was it worth the wait. I mean it was like devouring a silky dream. It was ethereal; not even of this world. If all I had was that, I would have been happy. But each dish was so lovingly prepared; detailed and just popping with flavor. The braised short rib was so perfectly rectangular, that I was pleasantly surprised at how ridiculously tender it was, and it just melted on the tongue. And the farro and vegetables were so expertly seasoned and cooked, that the short rib accentuated it, instead of the other way round. The burrata and tomato salad was a perfect intermediary between the appetizer course and our pasta entrees. It was fresh, and bright and icy cold. And the burrata was so creamy and pillowy.  Our pasta arrived shortly, and all three were delicate and cerebrally flavored. The zucchini ravioli were light, delicate and the perfect invocation of spring. Their signature spaghetti was deceptively simple and full of sweet/tart tomato flavor. It even got my daughter up and eating after all our traversing. But I think our favorite was the Cavatelli with cherry tomatoes, favas, guanciale, mint and goat cheese crema. It was a dish full of seemingly disparate ingredients that somehow created such a harmonious and surprisingly elevated dish. Even after finishing every single plate, we opted for dessert, because I just had to see what the chefs here could do with the sweet side of things. It was worth every calorie. Sigh. The desserts were not only plated imaginatively, but all the flavors and layers were perfectly executed. The twice-baked lemon cake was sunny and tart. The crostata di ricotta with caramelized pears and the a burnt honey gelato (that they could jar and sell on its own) was an airy cheesecake that was nicely complex. And the Valrhona chocolate cake with butterscotch and caramel gelato, was deeply rich, but somehow not bitter, which elevated what could be a pretty standard dessert. All the dishes were prepared with such care, and such soul-satisfying flavors, that I came away not only completely sated, but dually impressed.",2,1,2,Cesca T.,"Detroit, MI",10,74,226

The tuna sashimi dish was a bit bland. Then for main course I had the spaghetti-was not cooked al dente at all and was lacking in flavor. My sister had the fish and she said that it was just not well cooked and fishy. The server looked a bit lost when we asked him about the specialities of the restaurant.

The bar area was crowded, but nothing beyond what you'd expect for a Saturday night in New York City.THE GOOD: The people who handle drinks (water) at this place are on point! The water glasses were always filled and when I was finally able to order a bottle of wine, my glass was refilled without me ever having to pick up the bottle.THE BAD (well maybe mediocre): Besides the water and wine, the food service was not good. It was a solid 15-20 minutes before anyone greeted the table. When the waiter finally arrived there was no greeting or introduction of any sort. Instead, the waiter just asked everyone if we were ready to order. After that, we didn't really see the waiter again, except when it was time to either order dessert or get the check.THE FOOD: This place is known for its pasta, so, I ordered pasta. Specifically, I ordered squid-colored pasta and lobster. A grilled octopus appetizer was ordered for the table. The food was good, but not great. The food wasn't so good that I would excuse the service issue, nor was it so bad that I'd say ""don't ever go here."" All in all the atmosphere is what you'd expect from a NYC hot-spot on a Saturday night. It's possible the restaurant was just having an off-night.

2.0,4/28/2018,"I want to start the review by saying I have been a huge advocate of Scarpetta for years as one of the best Italian places in the city. The vibe, the food, the service and even the bread have always been unique and special. We actually managed to go on the last day in their west village location and boy do I wish I could go back.We have been waiting for the new location to open up and decided to do a little family celebration there. I think for better or for worse the new place is definitely more spacious and has some resemblance to the old vibes of their west village restaurant but with a slightly dimmer feel. It didn't help that the hostess seating us was rude, unwelcoming, and rolled her eyes at us on multiple occasions. First when when we asked to be seated while we waited for our last guest to arrive and second when we were shuffling around the table trying to figure out where everyone should sit. It definitely put a sour taste in our mouth's for the rest of the night as it was the first person we saw coming into the restaurant.While the bread was still phenomenal it felt like the portion sizes on the appetizers had been downsized from the last location. Still recommend the burrata as well as the polenta with mushrooms - both are phenom but you def need at least 3 things to spit between 4. For dinner we got cod (dry and bland), Black Tagliolini (solid but nothing special), spaghetti (great but something was different about it - not sure what), and short rib & bone marrow Agnolotti (very good flavor, cooked perfectly). Finally, for the dessert we did a Budino (amazing) and gelatos.The highlight of the dinner was definitely our sommelier, who recently moved from a different restaurant (can't remember his name sorry!). Extremely helpful and knowledgeable, got us the perfect wine and champagne exactly at our price point. The last thing I will mention, which was more of a headache than anything else, was getting a gift certificate we had redeemed. It took over thirty minutes and they clearly were not equipped to accommodate them from their own group. We expected a lot more especially at their price point, hope they step it up soon!Rich and Sophie",2,0,0,Richard J.,"Manhattan, NY",157,24,35
4.0,4/26/2018,"Love Scarpetta who also just started a lunch seating which is amazing. They have a variety of dishes for you to sample, paired with their bread basket that is gluten free. One of the few restaurants that asks you what your allergies and preferences are with food items prior to giving you the menu so that the chef can tweak their choices. This is the only place that has a signature spaghetti dish with a presentation that is surely unforgettable. Can't ruin the surprise so you'll have to order it yourself.Love the variety of appetizers that Scarpetta offers. The fish dishes are light in flavor while incorporating other ingredients. Also got the tuna as an entree which was cooked to perfect and paired with a great selection of chickpeas and sauces. Definitely would recommend it and their bar for dinner and drinks!",1,0,0,Cindy U.,"New York, NY",310,498,849
4.0,4/24/2018,"Scarpetta has some of the best pasta I've ever had and would easily be a 5 star rating if it wasn't for the fact their wine program is just an atrociously bad value.  I don't remember the exact prices of the old location near Chelsea Market, but it looks like the food prices have gone up 10-15% while the wine has just left the stratosphere.  Expect a markup of at least 300% on wine bottles and a ridiculous $40 corkage fee.  The cheapest bottles Scarpetta offers are mediocre $40 wines that are marked up to $150 with the average hovering around north of $300Advice is to stick to the pastas as they are way better than the meat dishes.  The cocktails are fantastic, but if you insist on wine bring your own bottles.  The $40 corkage fee is an absolute bargain compared to the joke that is their wine list.",0,0,0,Matthew C.,"New York, NY",105,30,0

The Bad: *You have to trek to the restroom by walking through the hotel and then downstairs.*The food was disappointing, especially the spaghetti. We chalked it up to maybe being an off night...

2.0,4/22/2018,"I used to go to the old 14th Street location and it was always an amazing experience. However, we had a terrible experience at this location. Our brunch began with the host tackling my friend out of the way to yell at the hostess. There was live jazz playing in the main room. The music itself was okay, though rather unusual for brunch, but we were seated right next to the drums and the drummer kept playing louder and louder. We, and a few surrounding tables, asked to be seated elsewhere and the waiters were very nice about arranging that. After being re-seated to the cafe area, it took over 30 minutes before the waiter came over and took our order. We asked for a bread basket in the meantime and he said he'll put in a special request since they don't normally serve bread during brunch. He never came back. My coffee was only filled 1/3 of the way and my friend's was filled 1/2 of the way. Soon, we asked for refills but they forgot 3 times. There was only 1 waiter, the tall guy with curly hair, who was on his game. He asked us if we wanted more coffee and actually came back with some. Our food came, and still no bread. My friend checked with a different waiter and he said they don't serve bread at all. Our original waiter didn't even have the courtesy to tell us or most likely, he forgot. This new waiter did offer to double check and later came back with a sad plate with 2 pieces of white toast. It was almost insulting. The French toast was good, despite being borderline cold. It had toasted almonds, which was a nice touch. After they cleared the table, we had to request the check twice. Overall, the service really ruined the experience. Also, there was a ridiculous woman sitting next to us snapping 100 pics of each dish in the same position, sometimes with minor changes, with a DSLR camera. She would take the plates and walk around, and spent at least 10 minutes taking pictures of each dish. If she's a professional photographer, she's the most incompetent one I've ever seen. Do you really need 1,000 pictures of avocado toast? Her table ordered quite a lot, and the waiters fawned over them, but for the entire meal, we heard ""click, click,... click, click, click, click,... click, click, click...""",0,0,1,Cyrene Y.,"Manhattan, NY",1,25,10

4.0,4/19/2018,"*UPDATE*I have been to the first location, in the meatpacking district a handful of times and I must say their move is an upgrade. Keep in mind, it is inside the James Hotel hence looking for the entrance can be tricky.  AMBIANCEThis location is classically beautiful.  As soon as you walk in you're greeted by hanging plants from the ceiling, candle lit tables, and a marble countered bar. Perfect for date night or a birthday dinner with friends.  They also have a private dining room that can accommodate larger parties (25-30ppl). FOODThe bread basket is amazing here.  It's served with soft butter, eggplant sauce, and olive oil.  I must admit it was difficult to save room for my actual meal.My friends and I tried all their pasta options and hands down the best dish was the Black Tagliolini. It is pricey but worth every penny! I know their spaghetti is pretty popular here but with a hefty price of $26 it was too simple/bland for me.  Two other dishes I highly recommend are the creamy polenta and their raw yellowtail.  SERVICEThe waitress we had that evening was great.  Kind, knowledgable, and attentive.  TIPS*It gets pretty busy after 6:30pm 7 days a week so I would advise my fellow yelpers to make a reservation.",5,4,5,Bina S.,"Brooklyn, NY",428,150,260

4.0,4/8/2018,"There's a stigma attached to restaurants inside hotels, so when I learned that Scarpetta had moved from its previous location in the Meatpacking District to the James Hotel in NoMad, I was a little suspicious. My doubts were assuaged, however, upon entering the restaurant. The smaller dining room is like a bar and lounge: sophisticated, but laid-back.Others have mentioned the discrepancy between portions and pricing. They're right - the plates are noticeably barer than those at similar establishments, but the quality of the food makes up for it.We started with the roasted beet salad. To be honest, I'm not crazy about beets, so I was surprised that I really liked this salad. In terms of presentation, it's very colorful, and the vinaigrette enhances the root vegetable's flavor.The cauliflower Romanesco's presentation is just as colorful as the beet salad's. The contents of this dish are pretty simple; the cauliflower is roasted and dressed with a salmoriglio sauce. I think I also spotted a few capers thrown in there as well. In general, the cauliflower is good, but nothing to write home about.Of course, I couldn't leave without trying their famous spaghetti. Although tomato and basil sauce is a common pairing, Scarpetta's version is exceptional; I wouldn't go so far as to say that their spaghetti is ""to die for,"" but it's certainly not your average plate of pasta either.We concluded with the twice baked lemon cake, served alongside a scoop of lemon sorbet. The dessert strikes a balance between tartness and sweetness, incorporating ingredients such as ivory lime cream, milk jam, and macerated blackberries. There's also a layer of what appears to be caramelized sugar on top.All in all, we enjoyed our meal. Pasta is obviously Scarpetta's strong suit, so make sure to order at least one from their selection!",3,0,2,Daniela L.,"New York, NY",374,155,37

3.0,4/3/2018,"The food and atmosphere here are both excellent.  Why, then, only three stars? First, the prices for the pastas are outrageously high. Second, and more important -- I ordered a glass of wine and was given a very short pour, and when I noted this and asked the waiter the waiter to top it off to a reasonable size, he refused, saying that it was a standard 5 oz pour. Now, there is no chance that the pour was 5 oz.  But even if it was, at a place like this customer service should come first -- add a splash more when a customer complains! That is what the outrageous prices should be covering at a minimum. Is it worth alienating the customer to withhold a splash more wine?",0,0,0,Steve Z.,"Manhattan, NY",0,25,0
3.0,3/30/2018,"Scarpetta is very good, and if money is no object perhaps it's four stars. But for the money, I can't give it more than three.Our dinner started out with a wait of over a half an hour for a reservation that was already quite late in the evening. Scheduling isn't entirely the fault of a restaurant, but it seemed that everyone was waiting just as long as we were. We were advised to ""enjoy the bar"" and perhaps this is part of their strategy.We shared an excellent Manhattan, which started to just somewhat justify its price of $21.50. But not quite.Once seated, Service was relatively good although we had to ask each time to be provided with serving utensils, when dishes were left without them. Waiters also don't bring attention to the fact that some items are much more expensive than others. For example, one glass of wine that I ordered at a waiter's recommendation was $30 for the glass, while another was half the price and the waiter didn't mention that the $30 glass was particularly expensive. The bread basket at Scarpetta is particularly epic, containing a cheese roll that's really great, and a cheese bread with melted cheese and prosciutto. It would be easy to fill up on them since they bring more without them being requested.Food was generally quite good and I'm not going to go into details here other than to say that the pasta dish we had was almost overdone and certainly not al dente. Flavors were uniformly delicious, however.The somewhat uneven service, and the almost over cooked pasta, as well as the expense of the place limit it to three stars in my view. To get to four, they could improve the service, reduce waittimes, and instruct the waiters to mention the price of extremely expensive items. To get to five, they need to fix that al dente issue and not let a dish leave the kitchen if it isn't cooked perfectly.",0,0,0,Jacob L.,"San Francisco, CA",17,169,0

Not really sure why this is a try before you die dish. Short rib pasta was on point and the brussel sprouts were cooked perfectly and seasoned well. The entree portions are pretty small, but that can be nice to have more courses on a special date.Star in terms of food was the lemon cake dessert.

If you're a vegetarian - make sure to tell them as the bread has meat, and other dishes are made with stock. Started with the polenta which everyone enjoyed. Also had the spaghetti - one of their signature dishes which certainly did not disappoint. I had the lobster tagalini as my main. The portion of lobster I thought was very generous given the price.

Nice atmosphere and quite the ""it"" spot. Cons: Oh boy, where do I start... First, it is quite pricey. Now I admit this is a fine dining establishment so the portions are expectedly small. But the portions and quality of the dishes are not up to par with the prices. The cauliflower was bland and really meh. The miniature strachetella app was also not very memorable, and came with two tiny scoops. Then we waited and waited for the entrees. Minimally it was a thirty to forty minutes wait. The server did not check on us at all. I flagged the runner to grab our server, who had another hilarity later on. Finally we grabbed him and he came back about ten minutes later, letting me know it will be another ten minutes. So clearly the kitchen forgot to fire the entrees. No apologies, no nothing. Anyways, pasta was fine like I said but that duck was just two measly pieces and it tastes rather forgettable. $34 for two, roughly 4 inch by 1 by 1 inch of duck breasts is unforgivable in my book. Then we waited again for the server to come back and give us the dessert menu. That took some time. Then he never came back to ask us if we want desserts. I basically flagged him down as he walked by and asked for the check. If we had dessert, we wouldn't have left till they closed. But the main entertainment of the night was the server losing the credit card of the table next to us. Oh boy. That does not put the restaurant in a good light.

We are used to great food in LA and we're excited to experience the wonderful food of NYC. We had heard wonderful things about Scott Conant's restaurant but the experience was pretty horrible. The only good part of the meal was the bread in the beginning. We then ordered the beet salad which was extremely bland and lack luster. We decided to let it go since it was only a beet salad and move onto the main course. I ordered the roasted chicken and my boyfriend ordered the cavatelli. Both meals came out cold and seemed as though they had been sitting for 10 minutes before being brought to us. The chicken was also overdone and dry. I kindly talked to the server and didn't have the heart to tell him both meals were bad(which at this point I should have done and just asked for the check and walked out) so I told him about my chicken and he said that the kitchen was not allowed to cook it any less due to ""safety standards"". I tried to stay positive and ordered another dish, the veal which came out not only cold but fatty as well. It was as though no one had bothered to trim the meat. I have had better meals in a diner.

4.0,1/21/2018,"Scarpetta is one of my restaurants of choice for special occassionas like birthdays. I know it's technically part of a chain, and some people might find it a boring choice, BUT go try for yourself - I think you'll find the food genuinely delicious. This was also one of the first dinners I had when I first moved to NY, so I have a special fondness for the place as well.  Scarpetta does a great job of what I would describe as, luxe comfort-food items. They take dishes which could be quite ordinary and incorporate a beautiful filling or finish that makes it extraordinary. My favorite dish there: the duck & foie gras ravioli.

4.0,12/12/2017,"Terrific food and good table service saved a special occasion farewell dinner that started off with rude treatment - on the phone and in person - from the hostess stand. Both hostesses were unwelcoming and smileless, nor in the holiday spirit or accommodating (one person in our party is pregnant and we also called from the train to say we'd be 15 minutes late because the MTA was running especially slowly due to an attempted terrorist incident in Times Square earlier in the day).Once seated, all was good. Team service with a lead waiter was professional and efficient, if a bit quick on the draw to take away plates or drinks before they were completely done. We were a table of eight and ordered five appetizers, eight entrees, and six desserts. Dishes are Manhattan pricey, think of entrees in the high 20s to mid 30s, and portions are on the smedium (small to medium) side, which leaves room for dessert.For appetizers, the Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, stracciatella, lentils, and polenta with truffled mushrooms were all quite good, with the very creamy polenta and wonderful tasting lentils - I don't use that phrase often - seemingly the winners. I went basic with my entree, choosing the house made spaghetti with tomato and basil, basically the most luxe spaghetti you can get and it was indeed terrific, balanced, and presented nicely. I sampled from others' plates and the duck and foie gras ravioli was memorable, if a bit on the too rich side of the spectrum.Desserts were all stellar, with the twice baked lemon cake my favorite. It was a smallish portion, extremely tasty, and was complemented by ivory lime cream, milk jam, macerated blackberries, and lemon sorbet. Other favorites were the coconut panna cotta, with caramelized pineapple and guava soup, as well as the espresso budino. My least favorite was the creme fraiche cheesecake. Others loved it, but cheesecake in general for me is meh.Overall, this was a 4.5 star experience rounded down to 4 for the unwelcoming welcome, which left a bad taste in our mouth until the kitchen and table service could change it.",2,0,0,Will V.,"Jersey City, NJ",35,263,85

Reservations were made well in advance yet we got one of the worst tables in this place (by the window in the front where there was a serious draft). While the placement of the tables would normally not be a huge factor for me, we told the person on the phone that it was for a birthday celebration so I do not think it was unreasonable to expect a table in the main room. The cake we brought for my friend's birthday was cut into slices - of which we only saw 4 (one for each person at the table). Mind you, this was a 8-inch cake so where did the rest go? There was also a large piece of chocolate on this cake that spelled out ""Happy Birthday *NameHere* that was never brought out with the cake slices. FYI - this place charges $7/person ""plating fee"" for you to bring a cake and they can't even do it right. This place was very well-staffed and the restaurant is not that big so I find the terrible quality of the service inexcusable. I counted about 10+ staff members all standing around the back of the room so perhaps maybe that's why it was impossible to get ahold of our waiter? Even with such terrible service, we left a little over a 15% tip for a table of 4 and the waiter has the nerve to ask ""was everything ok?"" whilst looking intently at our signed receipts.

I waited forever to order, get my food, have the table cleared, get wine refill, the list goes on. Now what upset me the most was the cake cutting part. My friend was quoted $4 per person for bringing a cake which we were fine with. Afterall it was a birthday. When the bill came, it ended up being $7 per person.

3.0,11/18/2017,"I truly wanted to be able to give a 5 star review, but alas, I cannot. We had a reservation for 9pm on a Thursday night. We arrived around 8:30 and checked in with the hostess, before grabbing some drinks at the bar until our table was ready. At one point, a manager walked through the bar area with a nicely presented truffle to be shaved on a dish, and he saw us looking and brought it over for us to smell - definitely a great salesman as we considered​ adding some truffle to our meal after the interaction. At 9:20 we inquired into how much longer our wait would be, as there had been no seats available at the bar since our arrival and I wasn't wearing the most comfortable heels (my shoe choice obviously isn't the fault of the restaurant, just throwing that in so no one else makes the same mistake as I did), and were told it would be a few more minutes. We were seated about 25 minutes after our reservation time. This takes off a portion of a star for me.Upon being greeted by our server, my fiance and I both requested sparkling water, to which we instead received tap. Minor error, and we were too excited by the menu to make a second request for sparkling. We ordered the yellowtail crudo, which was to die for, and immediately ordered another because it was that delicious. For entrees, my fiance ordered the steak, which, considering Scarpetta isn't a steakhouse, was incredible. It was cooked perfectly and was tender and full of flavor. I ordered the duck foie gras ravioli. It was presented beautifully ​and was very good, but for some reason I was expecting it to be a bit more memorable. I was still really enjoying it, until the end. One of the last pieces had a very long hair wrapped around it, in a way that the only explanation was that the hair had gotten wrapped around it before it had been plated. I had finished almost the entire dish by then and so I decided pointing it out to our server would be pointless. I was a couple of glasses of wine deep so I wasn't too upset about it anyway, but it was creepy enough to knock off a star. For dessert we ordered the chocolate cake, and coffee. I would give the cake 5/5 stars, but our coffee didn't arrive until a few minutes after we finished dessert, which was disappointing. It may have been a confusion as our server seemed to have gone home around the time we ordered dessert (without mention to us) and a new server finished us off. Last thing: on our reservation it was mentioned that we were celebrating an anniversary, and there was no mention of it at all throughout the night. It's not that big of a deal, but as someone in the industry I typically expect reservation notes to be passed on to the server and at least some sort of mention or greeting.

5.0,10/7/2017,"First Yelp review ever! So why not start it off with something top-notch like Scarpetta.About the place: In the heart of the Meatpacking district. Unless you know where you're going, you probably would walk right past it. I say this because its nested between two other places with HUGE awnings and signs, so Scarpetta's clean and simple exterior is easy to be overlooked. Once you're inside, you'll notice its dim. VERY dim. Which of course, can be exactly what you like (if it's a date-night) or might be too dark for your liking (and then you're using your phone to read the menu).Menu: Not a large menu, I'd say 4-5 options of pasta, same for meats, and about 8 appetizers. If you're visiting the restaurant after someone recommended it to you, chances are you know about their spaghetti pomodoro. BEST.SPAGHETTI.EVER. Yes, it sounds bizarre to say that about a spaghetti dish that has just tomato sauce, but it ISN'T just tomato sauce. I don't know what magic they sprinkle in that sauce when cooking it, but the flavors in your mouth are unreal. The in-house pasta adds to this deliciousness, of course.I ordered the spaghetti dish, along with a dinner special (don't remember the name but it was ravioli-like pasta stuffed with ricotta and mascarpone, drizzled with black truffle oil and mushrooms) DELICIOUS. My date and I kept swapping plates so we could each have a little bit of both.Price range is $15 and up. I'd say overpriced IF the food wasn't as delicious as it is. Therefore, it's totally worth every penny.Drinks: I had their mowscow mule and it was probably the best one I've ever had. Dessert: Espresso Budino which was SO rich and decadent, tasted just like a frozen espresso but creamier.I had been told about this place being a 10 out of 10, and I AGREE.

We were a party of 2 and were squeezed fairly tightly in between other tables. Service was quick and friendly.I ordered the duck foie gras ravioli and he ordered the spaghetti. Both blew each of us away. The ravioli hit me with so much flavor, and each piece was filled with the perfect amount of savory goodness. Although the bit of sauce on top didn't add too much flavor, it did provide the necessary moisture/oiliness to the dish. The spaghetti lived up to the hype. Loved the creamy tomato sauce that coated each strand of pasta. The spaghetti was cooked al dente but still twirled easily onto a fork for a perfect bite. Oh and I have to add that the presentation of each dish was exquisite. They bring the pasta to you in a covered plate and uncover the work of art before your eyes :DOverall I say 4.5/5. I definitely want to come back and try more of their pasta. Hopefully will be seat d in a less cramped space next time.",0,0,0,Diane W.,"Manhattan, NY",110,162,333
4.0,10/5/2017,"Very nice. Walked right in with no reservation or wait on a Wednesday evening. The waiter was very attentive and food was delicious. The food earned five stars - deducted one star for experience. This is the sort of place where they expect you to spend plenty of money. We were on a business trip and were limited in what we could expense (and also simply weren't that hungry, having snacked that afternoon). After the waiter realized we wouldn't be ordering bottles of wine or multiple courses, it was obvious he was disappointed (even though, in the end, we tipped healthily). It lessens the experience overall if you feel too much pressure to (or worse, feel guilty for not) spend more money than you want. It's not like we walked in and ordered water and appetizers - but you would have thought it. He was kind, but never waivers in his attempts or recommendations (which, I understand, is his job) and couldn't completely hide his snobbery. I'd go back, but would try not to let it bother me next time.",0,0,0,Kelsi O.,"Frisco, TX",0,16,12

4.0,9/29/2017,"This restaurant is amazing, it is a little hard to find as it's nested in between a resident and another restaurant. The restaurant name isn't very easy to spot either, but the easiest way to find it is to find a big bush, that's basically the restaurant entrance.The bar is super pretty with a lot of cocktails offered. The service was alright, I find the server a little awkward as he mumbles his way through today's special. We came here for dinner, at around 7:30 pm and the store was nicely lit - well, a bit too dark for my liking. It's so dark to the point that we had to use our phones to shine on the menu to see what's there. Anyway, this is a perfect setting for a nice, romantic dinner. We ordered a few dishes and here's the review:1) The restaurant provided us with a basket of bread: there's a variety of bread to choose from, 3 kinds and unfortunately I don't know it's name. The bread came with 3 sauces to choose from - my favorite is the tomato based sauce with what I think is eggplant. It's very flavorful and goes well with every type of bread offered. You can also ask for a refill!2) Duck Foie Gras Ravioli - (10/10) this dish is my favorite, it's very very flavorful. The first bite gives you an explosion of taste, you can taste the foie gras and the sauce compliments it really well. The ravioli is cooked nicely, it has the right texture. However, I wouldn't eat this whole dish alone as it can get a bit too creamy, I'de recommend that you share this with someone3)  Short rib and bone marrow agnolotti - (10/10) Amazing dish. I can eat this whole plate myself, the bone marrow isn't too overpowering and is not too fatty to the point that it gets too much. There's some sauce inside that compliments it really well, I would say it's slightly sour but it just compliments the dish well. I can't really taste the short rib though. I have no complaints, amazing dish and you should definitely order this4) Sea bass - (5/10) The fish was cooked nicely, but it is definitely my least favorite dish in this restaurant. Nothing really special about it. The sauce was not as flavorful as I would like it to be. I would say, it's even a bit too bland for my liking.",1,0,2,Nicky F.,"New York, NY",314,148,505

That's it. It's the spaghetti. It is perfectly al dente. It is perfectly salted. It's perfectly flavored. The basil is fresh. The tomato is sweet. You have to order the spaghetti- Sirloin of Beef: The beef literally dissolves in your mouth.

Order this and split it. - Burrata: Yep. - BONUS: Bread basket - it's FREE and it's not just any type of regular bread. In the bread basket you have warm and fresh stromboli (stuffed with mozzarella, salami, and tomatoes). There's other bread in there that's also delicious that has rosemary and sea salt on it but save your appetite for the MF'in stromboli.

5.0,8/17/2017,"Wow....just wow. Came for summer restaurant week with a friend and we were both blown away. First I decided to try the mushroom polenta. Granted I don't like polenta because its usually dull and lacking flavor but this dish was superb. The mushroom and sauce all mixed together was great. My friend decided to get raw yellowtail since the salad didn't sound that pleasing to him. He mainly got it so I can eat it because he doesn't eat raw fish and seafood but he had one bite and fell in love. He actually finished his whole plate I was so surprised. I got to sneak a piece and it was really darn good. Now entree course my friend got the roasted chicken and I got the spaghetti. I hesitated getting the spaghetti just for the sole fact it sounded so plain. THANK YOU BABY JESUS I picked the right dish!! It was soooooooooo delicious. The basil, sauce, and the noodle itself was so well put together. I want to go back just solely for that. The roasted chicken my friend was very good. The skin was crunchy flavorful just the chicken was a bit dry for my taste. Onto dessert! Unfortunately I was so full from my appetizer and entree that I could only take a bite of my dessert. Still Scarpetta kills it all the way through. By the end of my meal I was fully satisfied and very happy! The service was great as well but all my attention was on the food so the server could have been breaking dancing in the background for all I know.",1,0,1,Vanneza B.,"Bayside, NY",7,13,37
5.0,8/17/2017,"First things first. You know the food is outstanding when I not only stop talking but also refrain from snapping pictures of my meal like the obnoxious millennial I am. Being that millennial, I first heard of Scarpetta through my borderline creepy obsession with Chopped's Scott Conant. While there were no Scott sightings at my recent Scarpetta visit, it was still a 5-star experience.Ambiance - Surpassed my expectations. My boyfriend took me here for my birthday dinner last Saturday night. Despite it being a full restaurant with a lively crowd, the back dining area still maintained a very intimate and serene atmosphere. And its proximity to the Whitney, Chelsea Market and the High Line makes it a convenient spot for a night out.Service - Staff wasn't the least bit snooty. I'm a Midwestern/Southern girl so manners are a huge deal for me! Our water was always filled, empty plates were cleared promptly, we were given ample time to review the menu, and we weren't pestered to place drink orders (a big dining pet peeve). Polenta (first course) - I have nothing to compare it to, but it was rich, earthy and filling. I loved the texture contrast between the creaminess of the polenta and the rubberiness of the mushrooms on top. Big fan! Spaghetti (main): - I know, it seems ""basic"" to order spaghetti at such a nice place, but you won't regret it. The noodles are thick, fresh (clearly made in-house), and topped with literally the best marinara sauce I've ever had. It has ruined me for other marinara sauce. ALSO...it may look like a small portion when they bring it to you, but I assure you it is not.  Bonus - at the end of meal, I was brought out almond biscotti as a birthday treat!

4.0,8/15/2017,"This place is very good, and I enjoyed the restaurant week menu, but I don't think I would return for the full price menu. The much adored spaghetti dish here was very good, it is clearly house made pasta with a refreshing tomato basil sauce, but it's over priced. I would recommend Uva on the upper east side for a better housemade pasta value. Their table bread and accompanying (orange flavored) olive oil, butter, and eggplant and tomato salad we're exemplary, and I hate eggplant. They even had a bread with cheese and veggies inside, loved the idea, but the execution isn't quite there. All of their other bread was great though.  The hamachi starter was also good but was another example of a dish that's probably 30% overpriced. On the other hand the polenta with truffled mushrooms was the best thing I had all night.The bronzini was cooked perfectly, with a nice crispy skin and flakey, moist meat but I absolutely hated the asparagus vinaigrette it came with. It totally distracted from the taste of the fish. Dessert was another bright spot. We ordered the Coconut Panna Cotta, (which had beef gelatin) it was very nice and light and guava soup was a great compliment. We also ordered the olive oil cake but the waiter accidentally brought out the chocolate cake. When we told him about the error he insisted that we have both. The chocolate cake was decadent, and the subtle caramel gelato that came with it was great. The olive oil cake came recommended by the server, but I think it was just okay. The least put together of the three options, in my opinion.Service and atmosphere were great. It's strange that I must have walked by this place 100 times before actually noticing it, all the while knowing the restaurant was sort of a big deal.I probably won't return here, but I don't regret going.

5.0,8/6/2017,"A luxurious restaurant in a luxurious part of town for your luxurious palate. My family took me here for my 21st birthday and was beyond spoiled. We sat at the bar because we didn't want to wait for a table and my aunt and uncle have their favorite bartender, such a cutie. We started off with some cokes, my uncle has a beer and I had a glass of prosecco. For appetizers, we had the scallops, yellowtail, and beet salad. I'm usually not a fan of raw fish as they're slimy and not much chew to them but how they prepared the scallop and yellowtail was wonderful. They still had a good chew to them and was garnished with beautiful micro greens and the yellowtail had such sweet mandarin oranges on top. For entrees, my aunt and the spaghetti, my mom and I had the short rib and bone marrow pasta, and my uncle had goat. The short rib and bone marrow pasta was so savory. All the pasta is house made and it just melted in my mouth. The short rib and bone marrow were in these small ravioli (not really) type pouches of pasta and just melted/popped when you put them in your mouth. The short rib flavor wasn't too overpowering and the sauce they had on it was just right. We didn't order dessert but our fav bartender surprised me with a birthday lava cake and salted caramel ice cream. A luxurious experience for a hefty price but was worth every penny.

For example, I remember my sister-in-law being in town and we settled on a Mexican place across the street that resulted in cold food an hour after we ordered it. I was a little hesitant when my friend suggested Scarpetta for dinner thinking it was going to be a tourist trap. The atmosphere was instantly calming in the bustling Chelsea/Meatpacking area. I loved the skylight in the dining room-- excellent touch. I'm usually a bolognese or gnocchi kinda girl but on the urging of my friend ordered the spaghetti and meatballs.

5.0,7/31/2017,"4.5 stars.I was somewhat skeptical of coming here even though it's been on the pasta scene for many years. The price is steep and in NYC, there are a group of restaurants generally considered the best of the Italian bunch, of which Scarpetta isn't usually part. I debated for years whether it would be worth it, but I finally decided to give it a go. What tipped the scale in favor of trying it is that I'm a pasta classicist and to me, there's no better dish than a good spaghetti pomodoro. Pasta has taken off in the last decade and nowadays there are all kinds of more complex versions - all types of sauces, flavors, and ingredients that would never have normally been used in a pasta dish have made their way to the mainstream and are now on every upscale, good quality pasta menu around. While that's exciting and provides the diner with a more robust set of options, the most simple dishes like the spaghetti pomodoro have somewhat fallen by the wayside as restaurants turn their attention to more innovative offerings.Here, the spaghetti reigns supreme and Scarpetta not only doesn't shy away from it, it encourages its prominence. Review after review of Scarpetta will tell you that the spaghetti is the best offering on their menu, an association that many restaurants these days wouldn't want. Many lists tout Scarpetta as having the best spaghetti with tomato sauce in the city and Scarpetta not only agrees, but makes sure that diners are aware that the spaghetti is, in fact, what they are known for. So, given my love for the classic dish and Scarpetta's reverence of it, I went. And that's exactly what I ordered.We were lucky enough to go when the weather was conducive to sit outside and those most of the outdoor tables were taken, there happened to be a spot for two. Otherwise, the interior seating is also quite nice, with an initial smaller, more intimate bar and seating area leading to a much larger, more open, and lighter dining room. The service is quite good, wait staff is very attentive, though too formal for my taste. The first question you're asked aside from what type of water you'd like for the table is whether there are any food allergies that the kitchen should be aware of. You're then given a bread basket of rosemary foccacia, a white bread roll, and two types of stromboli: one a broccoli rabe and the other a porchetta. The bread basket is served with three accompaniments: mascarpone butter, a tomato and eggplant puree, and olive oil. The tomato and eggplant is the star of the three, though I will say I wasn't particularly impressed by the breads themselves. Good, but nothing spectacular in my opinion.Our server answered any questions we had and gave recommendations for what to order other than the spaghetti. We decided on the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti, which would be a nice contrast to the spaghetti as they're quite polar opposite pasta dishes.Words can't really do justice to the spaghetti. It's cooked slightly al dente and served with a tomato and basil sauce. It's divine and neither one of us wanted to eat anything other than the spaghetti. Those there are chunks of tomato, the sauce is so smooth and coats every strand of spaghetti so perfectly. The flavor is deep and complex, not acidic, not sweet, just very well balanced. The dish appears very light, as though you could eat plate after plate without ever feeling too stuffed, yet the sauce rich and well-oiled. It's amazing and there's no sense in describing it further. You've got to go eat it. Period.The short rib and bone marrow agnolotti was served in a butter sauce with garlic chips and horseradish. The bone marrow is used to cook down the short rib, which is then used as the filling for the agnolotti. Though it is a butter sauce, it doesn't feel as heavy as those tend to do. The portion is perfect.The short rib filling is quite sweet, which is balanced by the rich butter sauce, but I do wish it were a little less sweet. The dish is delicious, but cannot compare to the spaghetti. It isn't a star that you'd travel hours to eat, but it's a dish that you'd still be happy to order any time. I can't say that I'd fall in love with all of the pasta dishes or entrees on Scarpetta's menu (though maybe I would, I'd love to try more eventually), so I don't know that I'd recommend it as the singular best place to eat pasta in the city. But I would absolutely say it's the best spaghetti with tomato sauce I've come across, so if that's what you're going to order, then I would say Scarpetta is the best choice you have.",1,0,0,Laura P.,"Manhattan, NY",4,342,0
4.0,7/29/2017,"Came here for the Restaurant Week dinner. It was prix-fixe 42 for the dinner. FYI they request that the whole table participate, although one of my friends did get something off the regular menu. I tried the raw red snapper appetizer, the branzino main, and the chocolate cake. One of my friends had the creme fraiche cheesecake, which I tried of course. And another friend had  duck & foie gras ravioli, of course I tried this as well. The star of course was the complimentary bread basket. It included stars like stromboli bread, cheese and meat cooked inside a turnover yumm. The bread also came with dips; including eggplant, mascapone butter, and oil. This really helped fill us up since the rest of the dishes were not as starch heavy. Raw red snapper= light, overall okay but nothing mind blowing. Branzino= I really liked that the skin was crispy, that really added to the flavor. It seemed like maybe something was missing in the sauce, overall good but could have been better. Chocolate cake (with salted caramel gelato, chocolate butterscotch)= I really liked this. It wasn't too overwhelmingly sweet like some chocolate cakes can be. The mix with gelato really balanced out the sweetness. Creme fraiche cheesecake ( with pear compote, praline gelato, and crispy meringue)= the crispy meringue were really tasty and the praline gelato was good as well. Otherwise the actual cheesecake was just okay. Duck & foie gras ravioli= this was tasty and I liked the duck and foie gras, however I couldn't really separate out those tastes from the whole dish. Honestly I would have had a hard time noticing that this ravioli had foie gras in it if it wasn't listed in the ingredients. Service= very attentive and friendly.

4.0,7/28/2017,"My friends and I decided to check this place out after learning that it was going to be participating in restaurant week. We were seeing a play earlier in the night, so we had a later reservation at 9:30pm and were able to be seated right away.Since we were all pretty hungry and wanted to try as many dishes on the menu that we could, we decided to order almost every dish on the restaurant week menu and share them:Bread basket (5 stars): That bread is some of the best I've ever had--so tasty and cooked perfectly and even had some warmth still on the table. AppetizerRaw red snapper (3.5 stars): Good, but not amazing. The touch of citrus was nice, but otherwise was a pretty plain dish.Creamy polenta (4 stars): Easily the most exciting of the app options, but still not as amazing as I was hoping it would be. I felt like the polenta and the mushrooms did not quite come together in the dish and seemed like two independent ingredients.Spring salad (3 stars): About as plain as a salad can be. Don't bother ordering this unless you really can't select the first two options.EntreeSpaghetti (4.5 stars): So simple, yet so delicious. You'll be hard pressed to find another pasta like this one in the city.Zucchini mezzaluna (4 stars): I really enjoyed this dish as well as the pasta was super fresh and delicious. The only critique of this dish was that we couldn't quite understand the anchovy butter as a sauce as it did not really complement the flavors of the pasta very well.Roasted chicken (4 stars): Another solid dish, though I liked the same plate at Chefs Club better for their restaurant week. This one was a bit smaller and the skin not as crispy, though the veggies were decent.DessertCoconut panna cotta (4.5 stars): I really enjoyed this dessert, especially on a warm summer night. The flavors really popped (especially the guava) and the texture was perfect.Creme fraiche cheesecake (4 stars): The cheesecake was pretty good, but the star of the plate was easily the granita--damn was that tasty.Chocolate cake (5 stars): I feel like they undersell this dessert by calling it a cake because it is absolutely delicious. It is so soft and creamy and practically melts in your mouth and the combination of butterscotch and caramel ice cream is divine.Overall, this place serves up a solid menu for restaurant week with the courses getting progressively better as it went along. The ambiance and service were both top notch and the food was exceptional. Definitely worth checking out.",2,0,1,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",746,1843,225
5.0,7/28/2017,"Go here for restaurant week! There were no tables available online, but I called the restaurant the day-of and lucked out with a cancellation for 7pm. The restaurant was crowded and has a lovely outdoor area that I'd ask to sit in next time. I started with the mushroom polenta which finally convinced me that I do love polenta... I've had some subpar polenta lately that's put me squarely on fence. It came in an adorable white ceramic pot, the lid of which was whisked away by a waiter the moment I set eyes on the it. Everything is in pots, the signature spaghetti - which tasted like the pasta was made that afternoon - was in a larger pot, the momma pot. I would warn against the zucchini option, which had a noticeable anchovy aftertaste after the first few bites. We were told this was included, but it ended up being stronger than the average caesar-salad enthusiast would expect. The desert was another highlight of the meal. The cheesecake was remarkable, as was the chocolate flourless cake with sea salt gelato. We added Americano's and cappuccinos to the dessert round and had a great experience.

4.0,7/7/2017,"Arrived moments before our reservation, and would have preferred to sit at the bar for a cocktail, but we were seated immediately. Had the champagne cocktail and invecchiato, which were perfect and refreshing. We made the mistake of ordering right away, should have paced it out - though it was not pressed upon us, the polenta appetizer was out within moments and we were barely through our drinks. The waiter sensed this and subtly paced out the entrees, which was appreciated. We went with pasta of course - black farfalle, and short rib agnolotti. They were perfect and amazed those seated on either side of us, who seemed to be waiting on what we got ;), and so they ordered the same (for the most part). The agnolotti was amazing - I enjoy when the meat/sauce is tucked into folds of pasta. The farfalle was a bit salty, but bold seafood flavors were predominant. We asked for recommendations on wine pairings based on our tastes - a pinot noir and a balanced red (sorry cannot recall it!) were on spot. For her birthday they put a candle and 'Happy Birthday' on her Espresso Budino,which tasted amazing. The chocolate cake was just as decadent. The second half of dinner was a much more comfortable pace, and we appreciated it - will a full room or with a couple empty tables, we were not herded in and out.  Sometimes got a bit boisterous, but not consistently so.All in all a wonderful time.",0,0,0,Peter D.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",125,270,4
4.0,7/6/2017,"Came here on a Friday night with a girlfriend of mine and got seated in the back terrace with the skylight. Love the interior design of this place - the lights right below the skylight makes the atmosphere of the restaurant a lot more intimate.After we got seated, the waiter brought over a basket of bread and some spreads. The bread was so nice and warm - the butter that they gave us reminded me of the Icelandic butter i had in Iceland, in which it was so good that the proportion of the butter to bread averaged out to be 10:1. Anyways, we both ordered a glass of wine to pair with our dish. I got a sea bass and my friend got a pasta. They were both very delicious. The fish I got had a really crispy skin but the sauce was a bit on the salty side. The presentation was good and the side veggies that came with the fish made the dish very summer appropriate.I am not sure how they made their pasta, but I always say I can't tell the difference between the $2/box of pasta I get from Trader Joe's and the restaurant kind - well, this place certainly proved me wrong! You can still smell and taste a little bit of the freshness of the pasta and I loved it!

4.0,6/19/2017,"Came here for dinner on a Saturday. We were seated near the front window which has a nice view. The service is top notch here and attentive.They started us off with a selection of home made bread. I really liked the soppressata lined bread and I probably should've asked for another. They served the breads with mascarpone, eggplant puree and citrus olive oil. All of the options were great for dipping/spreading. For an appetizer we ordered the Burrata which comes with fresh tomatoes, eggplant puree, black garlic and basil oil. The burrata was delicious but the fresh tomatoes were the star of the dish for me.For my main course I had the Veal Tenderloin. If you're looking for a rich, hearty dish, then go with the veal. I requested it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. The veal is served with a gnocchi alla romana which is in a form of a small patty. It was especially cheesy in the best possible way. The veal also comes with sweetbreads. I'm a huge fan of sweetbreads so that was a nice addition to the dish for me.My wife had the Black Farfalle which is served with a seafood ragout. It's a much lighter dish than the veal but the flavors are spot on. The pasta is hand made in house. Overall this place is a solid dinner option in the Meatpacking district. The food, service and environment is great. The prices are fair for the neighborhood and the quality/quantity of food served.",2,0,0,Kevin C.,"New York, NY",288,574,317

3.0,6/19/2017,"Im torn on giving this place 3 or 4 stars, and should probably fall in the 3.5 range. First off, the place is nice looking, when you walk in, you kind of go, hmm...  We were a few minutes early so sat at the bar and grabbed a drink. The bartender was super nice. While at the bar a hostess came to just tell us to close our tab, kind of rudely, but, whatever. We were seated at a four-top, with 5 people. Our waiter at first seemed great, but we'll get back to that.  Food:  the bread to start was tasty, as was the eggplant concoction that was given to us. My family seemed mixed on the citrus olive oil, but it was spot on for me. We started with the braised short ribs (very good), roasted beet salad (just good), and the farro risotto (i did not like this at all). One BIG problem was, one of the main courses came out with the starters, and we said something, but our waiter never did anything about it.  For the mains, we did the spaghetti (good), tagliettel (good), black farfalle (meh), branzino (meh), and the veal tenderloin (yes, hands down best dish of the night). We were completely let down with the food. Restaurants like this survive, because theyre good, and we all said it was not worth it, at all. The other issue, back to the waiter. Besides my dads meal coming with the starters, which should have been comped or taken back after the discussion we had when it came out, our waiter disappeared most of the night. We rarely got water filled, and whenever we placed a drink (alcohol) order, we had to ask twice for it. Overall, insanely disappointed.  I actually would not recommend wasting your time here, specially with so many other good places to go in the city. Even if you went and just had the braised short rib and veal tenderloin, which were damn good, the bad taste this place left with me and my family holds me back from saying better things.",3,0,0,Justin C.,"New York, NY",121,462,87

4.0,6/16/2017,"A third-wheeled it here with my friend and his fiance who had a gift certificate they decided not to share. That being said, it's an absolutely beautiful restaurant with phenomenal service exceeded only by its fantastic food. They do take reservations, but it's tough to snag one even if you go on Open Table at midnight (trust me, I've tried many-a-time). I know they also participate in Restaurant Week if you want the opportunity to get something more reasonably-priced.To start, the bread is absolutely amazing. It's both soft and warm and it comes with three dipping sauces, all of which are carefully presented and described. I think one of them was eggplant puree (I've read about it in other reviews as well), and we absolutely loved it so much so that we needed a second serving. As should be the case, it was on the house.All of the crudos are incredible, I honestly don't think I can recommend just one. The scallop with a hint of truffle tickled my palette while the tuna with marinated vegetables danced on my tongue in an elegant, well-orchestrated waltz.For the primi piatti, you can't go wrong the the burrata or short rib. The short rib comes with this farro risotto that, by itself, is something I'd order in a heartbeat. There's also a large vegetable selection, but we didn't want to fill up on anything except pasta and meat. They're known for one of the most simple dishes that every 12 year old can make - spaghetti with tomato sauce. Words can't possibly describe why or how it's worth $24, but I assure you ,it most certainly is.If you're going entrees, the branzino is sure to please, as is the veal tenderloin.Definitely worth making this a destination.",1,1,1,Rachael F.,"Manhattan, NY",93,236,46

Just dark enough to be moody and I would imagine pretty romantic with a partner, but still light enough that we could appreciate everything. The drinks were so good, I wish I could have one of the bartenders in my home. I had the fois gras and duck ravioli and my mom had a tagliatelle (or pappardelle) with wild mushrooms. This was the first time I'd had fois gras and it was incredible. I wanted to cry it was so good. My mom's pasta was delicious as well, but this ravioli is something else.

The pasta has a perfect texture, and there's something about the simplicity of it that really makes you appreciate the fresh flavors of the dish. - We also tried the octopus, scallops, and braised beef as appetizers. All 3 were cooked perfectly, and  all had delicious unique flavors. - The duck and foie gras ravioli is also a must! Its rich and creamy, bursting with flavor. - There is no better way to end the meal than the rich flavors of their valrhona chocolate cake. The cake is so rich and moist, and pairs perfectly with their caramel gelato. I also don't usually gravitate towards cheesecake, but their mascarpone cheesecake also caught my eye. It was very light, and I love the poached pear and verbana gelato it paired with!The service was excellent every step of the way.

We had a drink at the bar while we waited for our table on a busy night. We loved the drink and wine selection. When we sat down , we were greeted by our server Martin, who asked if we had dined there before. Our friends had, and we had not. We asked what his favorite dishes were. He took the time to run through the menu, tell us the classic dishes and his favorites. We left it up to our server to order for us. It was the best decision we made all night. We started with the burrata, and seared scallops. They were cooked to perfection. Then the pastas. The best spaghetti, but everyone has heard about that. It was the short rib agnolotti and duck ravioli that knocked my socks off. There also was a clam gnochetti that was delicious. I would have been content there, but there was more. He brought us the veal tenderloin and branzino to share. Yet again we were thrilled, just enough for everyone to enjoy. I loved that branzino was filet.We only had enough room for us to share one dessert , we left it up to Martin, and he brought us the espresso bundino an espresso custard concoction to rival tiramisu. We finished the dinner with Vin Santo and cappuccino that looked like they could be in an advertisement.This was one of the best meals I have ever had, from the Italian maître d', to the support staff.

We asked to see the sommelier to get a wine recommendation and the sommelier, busy with another table completely blew our waiter off.

Once our server took our order we didn't see him for the rest of the time until we were finishing dessert. He asked if everything was good and when we said ""yes"" he said ""good"" and dropped the bill to our table.

THE bread basket, as with my reviews it's clearly a trend that I'm a gluten-fiend, but it's so unique and incomparable to other bread baskets... currently drooling as I try and describe how good it is.Anyways, my go-to is typically their Raw Yellowtail appetizer (light + fresh), Branzino main (perfect crunch on the skin), and Valrhona Chocolate Cake (duh). You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu, but the restaurant is literally known for not only their bread basket but also their signature Spaghetti dish.If I'm being honest I've never been here outside of Restaurant Week so I'm not familiar with other menu options or the pricing, but it's totally worth the $ during RW if you want to be full and have quality dining experience.",3,0,0,Veronica B.,"Manhattan, NY",603,41,90

The bread they give you to begin with is so so so good - my boyfriend and I ordered 3 baskets. We opted for the polenta with mushrooms as an appetizer and it was everything I expected - rich and creamy with the mushrooms cutting the heaviness just perfectly. For our main courses we got the spaghetti and tagliatelle with mushrooms. Pasta was, expectedly, cooked perfectly and the portion sizes were actually pretty large.

Not here.The Polenta was remarkably creamy, but that was not enough here. A rich broth of wild mushrooms was poured over the top. Had I been sitting in a quiet corner rather than the center of the bar, I might have licked the bowl!The course I will remember for a long time is the Capretto. They called this a ""wet roasted"" preparations, but the key to this dish was the assembly. The ultra-tender goat was heaped upon a formed disk of chopped rapini and a handful of baby potatoes. The result was the bitter greens arm wrestling the subtle gaminess to deliver a perfect mouthful of flavor. Potatoes serving as the coda. Not much more could be expected. The Lemon Cake dessert featured the right blend of tartness and sweet. Prior to service, a wonderful basket of focaccia was delivered. With just a touch less restrain, that could have been a distant memory. A few years ago I dined at the Las Vegas arm of this place. It was very good.

5.0,3/10/2017,"Superb. After a couple of disappointing meals in NY that didn't live up to the Yelp/IG hype this place has re-instilled my faith in popular restaurants. Another restaurant that had been on my to-do list for almost a year finally got round to taking my better half here for our anniversary. The place itself is very cute and unassuming (you could walk past the outside without having a clue about what's going on inside). Perfect amount of ambient light - not too dark so you're fumbling around for cutlery but not too bright as yo make you self-conscious if you were on a first date. Similar comment re noise levels - you can have a conversation without needing to yell.It was the spaghetti that had caught my eye all those months ago on other reviews so i knew what i was ordering. Ended up ordering 1 spaghetti each and the black farfalle and a special (ravioli with ricotta, mascarpone and truffle) to share. The spaghetti was the winner hands down but the other two were also perfectly nice. But that spaghetti...it really is something special. As a wop i've eaten my fair share of spaghetti with tomato (based) sauce but without a doubt this is the best i've had outside of italy (and indeed better than most i've had in italy). Don't get me wrong paying $25 for a medium size plate of spaghetti and salsa is not cheap but it's unequivocally worth it here. Besides it's cheaper than flying back to naples / palermo.For desert we had one of their signature chocolate cakes and the espresso budino. The cake was good, very rich and was paired well with the salted caramel ice cream...but the budino...holy cr@p! I'm not generally a dessert fan aside from my recent cookie/doughnut fetish but Jesus, Mary and all the saints this was spectacular. The combination of the espresso custard with salted caramel and chocolate crushed biscuit and the hazelnut ice cream atop... i'm still shocked at how nice it was. Waitering staff were great, and more than happy to offer recommendations and endure other inane questions. Also (and apparently this is becoming a novelty in NY) it was refreshing to come somewhere who understood the functionality and meaning of the ""reservation"" *cough* pig bleecker *cough*.Thank you for a great evening and a superb feed.",1,1,1,Tommaso S.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",19,110,126

The butter, oil and eggplant dip that comes with the bread was absolutely delicious. I tried the two items I've heard about mot before: mushroom polenta and the spaghetti.

Sad!Still, I had to try the tomato basil spaghetti. So I heavily suggested to my lady that she order it while I ordered the duck foie gras ravioli. Yeah. That's how I roll. HOLY RAVIOLI it was so good. Actually, I take back what I said earlier about calling the restaurant Gina. I would like to change it to HOLY RAVIOLI.

4.0,2/20/2017,"I've read in a number of places that NYC's Scarpetta has been mediocre since its expansion to other cities and the departure of its celebrity chef Scott Conant. That may be, but the famous Tomato & Basil Spaghetti is still delicious and the service at a recent visit during Restaurant Week was top-notch, so LDV Hospitality is at least doing something right.We took advantage of Scarpetta's $35 corkage fee (note that a second bottle would be $50) and ordered from the Restaurant Week menu. There were only three choices for each course, but the menu included all the hits, so it didn't actually feel limited. You're ordering the Tomato & Basil Spaghetti for your entree, so it's a matter of deciding if you want to start with a lighter dish (go with the Raw Yellowtail) or a heavier dish (go with the Creamy Polenta). The polenta is quite rich, though, and is probably a bit much to combine with the spaghetti unless you want to split appetizers with someone else at the table, which was our approach. Dessert was solid but not spectacular; I preferred my Coconut Panna Cotta to the bite of Chocolate Cake I tasted.I can't entirely refute claims that the restaurant has declined, but if you order the right dishes at Scarpetta you can have a fine meal.

4.0,1/29/2017,All I have to say is that the duck & foie gras ravioli is so yummyy!! It's a bit salty but so good! OH and that complimentary bread basket!! I think they have the best bread basket I've ever had! There were some spinach stuffed bread and meat stuffed bread + plain rolls. And the dipping sauces..so good! Enjoyed my time here! Cute place!

2.0,1/28/2017,"We made reservations for a 9:30pm table for 4 and we actually arrived early to pir reservation. We figured we would have to wait for our table to be ready at 9:30, but we did not anticipate having to wait almost 20 minutes past our reservation time to be seated. We were not escorted to your table until 9:48pm.The host staff was attentive to our need (and expectation) to get seated, however, never once apologized for the wait. Once we sat down we felt a bit ignored by our server. Tables that had sat down after us received their menus and bread before we did. Maybe we were just placed in a poor location in the main dining room. The food was very good and arrived quickly. We ordered the branzino and the spaghetti as well as the tuna appetizer, the beet salad, and the creamy polenta. All were solid choices. After we had perused the dessert menu, to our dismay, the waiter informed us they were out of two desserts including the banana cake, which - of course - was the one we wanted! Wah wah I must say, I was a fan of the beautiful, chic ambience of the restaurant. Definitely enhanced the dining experience! Unfortunately, I feel the level of service left more to be desired.",2,0,0,Joseph F.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",13,20,3
2.0,1/28/2017,"TL;DR: Food was great, service was terrible - have had better at Tasty Hand Pulled Noodles, honestly. The atmosphere was also pretty conservative - not a place for young people.I went with my SO for his birthday. My first thought upon walking in was how dark it was; the whole place looked like it was lit by one single candle. The second, as we sat down, was the noise level; throughout dinner, I had to lean halfway across the table to hear what my SO was saying. Scarpetta's clientele on this particular Saturday night was mostly parties of older, white banker types who can afford to spend a ton on multiple rounds of food and wine. Our waiter was fawning over them like they were long lost cousins. Scarpetta seems to cater to an older audience, rather than a young, ""hip"" diner.This gets me to my second point: our service was so, so bad. We sat between two larger parties, and the different levels of service we were getting was very apparent. Our waiter spent tons of time chatting with both other tables, offering them suggestions, whereas I could probably count the number of sentences we spoke to our waiter on one hand. I definitely felt very ignored, and we'd sit with empty plates at our table for long stretches of time before anyone came by again. I know we weren't spending as much money, but we did drop $200 on a meal, which is, in the grand scheme of things, a lot of money. It's hard to not feel bad when there's a clear contrast right next to you.Onto the food. The bread basket was nice, but they didn't have olives. My SO, who's lived in Italy, was peeved; ""what self respecting Italian restaurant doesn't have olives?!"" he grumbled. I had the polenta to start and a vegetarian ravioli special as my main; my SO got the chestnut soup and the tagliatelle, and we split the espresso budino and he had a grappa to finish. Polenta amazing as reported, but so rich and creamy that I couldn't finish. Chestnut soup fine - not remarkable - tagliatelle much lighter than my mushroom ravioli and pasta noodles so perfectly cooked.All in all, 5/5 for the food, but I hate feeling like a second class citizen while dining so I wouldn't recommend unless you're coming to drop major $.",4,1,1,Hui C.,"Manhattan, NY",326,291,131

4.0,1/24/2017,"We had a slightly modified tasting menu (as I eat seafood but not meat, but my friend eats everything), and the kitchen was extremely accommodating. The tasting menu is definitely worth it for the variety of dishes you get to try, and the portions are quite generous. The service was attentive, if a little soulless. My friend got the wine pairing, and for her first drink, they literally poured it and walked away without a word. After asking, they were much better on letting us know what was being poured. Now on to the food!- Yellowtail: Good, but the salt was distributed unevenly. I got an extremely salty first bite that threw me off. The fish also could have been a little colder- Mushroom polenta: AMAZING. Neither my friend nor I are typically polenta fans, but the texture was extremely smooth and creamy, and the mushrooms were a perfect combination- Short rib: I didn't have this, but my friend said it was her favorite bite of the evening- Beet mezzaluna: Tasted exactly how you would imagine beet ravioli to taste like, and very nicely seasoned- Spaghetti: The texture of the spaghetti was perfect. It had a nice bite to it, and the tomato sauce was very fresh- Black cod with fennel and tomato: not a fan of the fish itself, but loved the deep roasted flavor of the tomato and fennel- Dessert: Flourless chocolate cake and coconut panna cotta. Not a chocolate cake person, but the butterscotch ice cream was very refreshing. The panna cotta was also delicious and light.",0,0,0,Stephanie C.,"San Francisco, CA",21,86,1
5.0,1/21/2017,Scarpetta is one of my favorite Italian spots in the city. My go-to is their homemade spaghetti. It is freshly made and cooked to the perfect texture. They also serve a complimentary bread basket with three awesome spreads. The ambience is pretty romantic (although I've only ever been here with girlfriends). The lighting is dim and the walls and floor are dark so it is perfect for a date night. The service is also pretty quick and the servers are very friendly.

5.0,1/4/2017,"I was in Chelsea on a Wednesday night and I opened the Yelp app to find a place for dinner. Yelp said I was 500 feet from Scarpetta. I asked myself why that name sounded familiar. It didn't register with me but I set off to find it anyway. I walked almost half a block past it because there is no signage on the outside. That's when you know you're somewhere good! I found it and asked the hostess if she had room for one and she said she could seat me at the bar or a high top table in the bar. I chose the high top table. The bartender waited on me. I ordered a Peroni and the Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti with garlic chip & horseradish. Out came the bread basket with a 3 compartment sauce dish with butter, caponata, and extra virgin olive oil. Some of the bread was plain and some of it was like a Stromboli with salami layered in it. The Stromboli bread was perfect, the butter was room temperature and rich and the caponata was sweet, sour, and savory. The chef brought my pasta out with a cloche on it. He set it down in front of me and removed the cloche. Very nice touch! This is a beautiful dish of pasta. The pasta dough was so thin and delicate. The short rib and bone marrow filling was very flavorful. I ate every bite of this. I used a piece of the plain bread to sop up every last drop of the sauce. Amazing dish. The drawback of eating alone was that I only got to try one thing. Service was impeccable. Can I come back to New York really soon so I can come back to Scarpetta? Later I realized this was a Scott Conant restaurant and that's why it sounded familiar. Loved it!",1,0,1,Michelle L.,"Saint Louis, MO",180,1359,2398

Spaghetti (really looked / tasted more like Bucatini), which they did so well, was not that much better than ones I've had elsewhere. Certainly not the $24 price tag it commands. The Polenta too was a disappointment, nothing to the one served at L'apicio. The Farro Risotto (vegetarian version) was just awful. Flavors were completely unbalanced and it almost seemed that the vegetables in the dish were an after thought. I left the restaurant rather disappointed and down right upset at the amount I had spent for the quality of food. Service as always was competent, helpful and knowledgeable.

The bar section is great with a good choice of cocktails and a good spot to kill time while you wait for your table. Service: The servers were extremely helpful and knowledgeable. Their recommendations were thoughtful and made the overall experience great! Drinks: They have a good selection of cocktials but I personally found them a little pricey. I really didnt think the cocktails were worth the $20 price tag. But apart from that, they had a good selection of wines at affordable prices. Food: Almost every other review recommend the spaghetti, which definitely lived up the hype. My friends got the foie-gras ravioli while I went for the fish. I loved the fish and would highly recommend it. Desserts: I personally had really high expectations after the great entree, but definitely didnt live up.

I've dined at countless Italian restaurants on both coasts, and I have to place Scarpetta among the top of the list.It really goes without saying that a place this popular unofficially requires a reservation. Do it and guarantee yourself a table. Also, dress to impress. Gents that means suit or a dress shirt with black pants, and ladies whatever makes you feel comfortable with a nice pair of shoes.For my appetizer, I started off with the seared sea scallops. It wasn't much, just two pieces, but they were so plump and succulent and it was bathe in this decadent creamy sauce. For my main pasta I had the Tagliatelle with mushrooms. The pasta was served in this really buttery garlic sauce, and the mushrooms along with the leeks and shallots added a distinct flavor to the dish.For dessert, I had the crème fraîche cheesecake with a side of gelato.  Literally tasted as beautiful as it looks.

I thought maybe it was mixed in - tried it - only tasted like butter and pasta. Takes me about 10 mins to get a waiters attention to ask if my pasta has truffle. He sends out main waiter over and just looks at it and says okay. He takes it and comes back and says he's gonna make a new one since they forgot the truffle.....However at this point takes another 10-15 minutes to come out and my boyfriend has already finished his pasta. The truffle pasta comes out with very little truffle and not as amazing as I thought it was going to be as butter still tasted like the main ingredient. Then we order the panna cotta for dessert. 35 minutes later I was able to wave down a waiter to ask where the dessert is bc it's been so long. He asked me if I wanted my dessert now........ (when do you think people want dessert??)  Finally at the 45 min mark another person comes over with our dessert saying they misplaced our ticket.  Meanwhile we would have been happier to leave without dessert if they told us they forgot instead of waiting 45 mins for nothing.Finally we get the check and we aren't charged for the dessert (which I assume that should have happened since they messed up my dinner but thinking it only happened because they made us wait so long for it). They charged us $31 just for plain tagliatelle (the first one they messed up with just butter) and $45 for the truffle pasta. I call the waiter over to tell him it's wrong. However he said the plain butter pasta is $31 and it's $45 for the truffle shaved on top. THAT WAS NOT HOW IT WAS ADVERTISED IN THE BEGINNING. Who would charge $31 for just plain tagliatelle with butter?? They also have tagliatelle dishes with seafood on the menu for $31. My tagliatelle just had butter. I still think the check is wrong but at this point this dinning experience was so terrible and I will never come back again.  Terrible service all night and mediocre expensive white truffle pasta.

We began with a Negroni Invecchiato Cocktail $18 (plymouth, tangerine-infused campari & carpano antica) - the most amazing balance I've ever had with Campari. We started the meal with the house made Burrata Cheese $17, which was so delicate and soft. But it was a touch plain, and needed some contrast of the flavors to avoid getting monotonous. We still had some of the wonderful crusty house made breads, which worked well as a counterpoint. Next was their signature Spaghetti $24. It was very good and perfectly seasoned, but again we felt it could use more contrast, especially if it were you're only main dish. We had only one misfire: The Ravioli $30. It gets so many rave reviews, but it was sadly under-cooked. Tried to eat our way thru, but finally gave up. The server was super polite and understanding about it, and immediately urged us to get us something else (this to me is mark of a quality restaurant.) We opted for the Agnoloti that was filled with Short Ribs & Bone Marrow $27. It came out quickly and OMFG... it was cooked perfectly, and literally melted in our mouths. For dessert, they surprised us with a special Anniversary Dessert of Petit fours and Sparkling Wine (see photo.) What a wonderful meal for our last night in NYC! We would definitely visit again.NOTE: the ambiance is very sophisticated, but it can get a bit dark. I wish they could turn the lights up a bit more to avoid cell phone flashlight usage.

I chose to come back to Scarpetta because the ambiance is stellar and we had vegetarians in our party and the restaurant has a dedicated vegetarian menu. The waiter was also mindful to only bring out the savory breads that didn't have meat in them and the creamy polenta appetizer we ordered was made using mushroom rather than chicken broth. Everything we ordered was great- the vegetarians enjoyed the farfalle and farro risotto, and the rest of us shared the agnolotti, black cod and branzino. We also shared the rhubarb napolean and Valrhona chocolate cake and polished everything off with a couple of bottles of red wine.

We ordered off the restaurant week menu and since neither of us is big on desserts, we asked if we can trade in one of the desserts for a primi. Not only did we get our request granted but we also got a second dessert, and some chocolates and truffles for the table. But first things first! The yellow tail was fresh and yummy, and the straccitella was perfectly rustic and comforting. It was the polenta that stole the primi show for me. Creamy goodness topped with amazingly flavorful mushrooms, I could eat it every day! We also got the branzino which was flaky and moist on the inside with a crispy skin- perfection!

1.0,8/11/2016,"I'm usually not one to complain about the cost of food.  $24 for a delicious (albeit simple and small) plate of tomato spaghetti is totally reasonable to me. $18 for a half cup of creamy polenta is also worth it (so good)!But $18 for 2 glasses of soda (each refilled once) was really absurd.  I don't recall ever being charged for soda refills at any fine dining establishment.  And when I asked for a refill, it didn't come until 30 minutes later when we were almost done with dinner.  At $4.50 a glass filled mostly of ice, it's just a rip-off. My previous visit to Scarpetta wasn't flawless either.  We ordered off the restaurant week menu, and our waitress suggested a squid ink pasta substitution for a surcharge of $9.  Another Italian waiter stopped by to take our order and refused our order of the squid ink pasta as an entree substitution on the RW menu.  He said there was no such offer on the RW menu, and that we'd have to purchase a separate entree if we wanted the squid ink pasta IN ADDITION to our 3-course from the RW menu.  I was confused and didn't want to argue with this fellow, so we politely asked to speak to our previous waitress who apologized on his behalf and took our order of squid ink pasta (which wasn't that great).  I was very annoyed until the waiter kindly came back to apologize for his lack of knowledge of the offerings that day.These little things just irk me for some reason!",2,0,2,Anvy A.,"Manhattan, NY",51,357,165

When my parents asked her to take away the extra utensils in table (it's a narrow table for 4ppl's food btw), she got really edgy and replied she's going to remove them anyways...Several waitstaff couldn't wait to empty our wine carafe such that we can leave as early as possible.

4.0,6/26/2016,"Going to shift things up and write about a particular dish, rather than a restaurant review. An ode to savory greatness, I should say. After all, much can be found online easily, from Yelp to blogs to the media, about Scarpetta. It is an institution; and the tomato and basil spaghetti is arguably its crown jewel, a combination flavors that I simply cannot find elsewhere. Needlessly to say, it is love at first bite. Competition in the food industry in New York is tough. It is an environment where eaters are inundated, if not spoilt, with fancier, more complex choices. Red-wine braised octopus fusilli. Sea urchin cream spaghetti. Or even agnolottis or raviolis that come in all shapes and all types of filling. These all scream of posh; and when this plain looking tomato basil spaghetti is juxtaposed with them, its austerity is all the more apparent. Perhaps it is the harmonious simplicity that lets it stand out from the rest. And so over the years, I find myself coming back time and time again, just to order this plate of carbs adorned with a viscous red sauce and basil ribbons. Where do I even begin? The pasta itself is tubular in shape and is of just the right thickness. Not too thin to be considered vermicelli, and not too thick either to be considered bucatini. Giusto. The pasta is cooked al dente with a delicate chewiness to it. It is just so incredibly fresh. The sauce - unctuous, rich but not overly cloying. The deep flavors surely highlight the ripeness of those in-season plum tomatoes (or maybe even some San Marzano ones in the base?). I also get spice from the pepperoncino flakes, woodiness from the basil and astringency from the garlic. Combined together, the sauce is a smattering of uplifting acidity, fruity sweetness and sharp spice. All parts are in harmonious balance. It is simple, yet so complex at the same time. And this makes every bite such pleasurable joy. Scarpetta's spaghetti is a pure and unpretentious dish, yet it is one that is executed flawlessly and cooked with soul. And that, to me, is what cooking should be about.",1,0,0,Michael C.,"New York, NY",291,22,285
5.0,6/25/2016,"when deciding on a place to go for my husband's birthday in city I had a whole list but I settled on this one after seeing the duck raviolis. I'm sort of crazy I know exactly what I want to eat before I go a place lol. my husband pretty much has no say :) except in his drink. but lucky for me he loves everything. anyway the creamy polenta I have to say is one of the best things I've ever eaten in my life. just order it and don't ask questions lol. everything was just perfect. also it's so easy to get to from penn station on the subway that it's a huge excuse to come back since it's so easy :) the duck ravioli was probably my favorite along with the spaghetti of course. I also really liked the agnolotti. I'm on a mission for all the best pasta dishes and this was definitely one of them. you will not be disappointed.

4.0,6/24/2016,"If you're looking for a delicious, upscale Italian experience, I wholeheartedly recommend Scarpetta.  Hubby and I came here for our last fine dining meal in NYC, and it was definitely an awesome way to end our trip.We were going to do the tasting menu but decided against it, then proceeded to pretty much order everything that was on the tasting menu .. Oh well, we were so happy with our food, that it didn't really matter.Started with the Polenta with Wild Mushroom Fricassee and the Short Rib Farro Risotto.  Oh. My. Goodness.  Talk about fancy comfort food.  This had all the decadence and indulgence you could ever ask for, but it wasn't overwhelming or overpowering at the least.  It was straight heaven plain and simple.Hubby ended up with the Branzino for his entrée which I did not try.  He loved it, but I can't really attest to it.  However, I went for classic Italian - the Spaghetti with Basil.  I can't imagine coming here and not trying something like this.  Perfectly made pasta, delicious robust sauce.  Not too much on the plate (because who wants to get miserably full this early on?); it was the right amount.  It was just delicious and I'm very happy I ordered it.On dessert, my husband was just okay about it.  He got the Limoncello Semifreddo.  It came with a basil berry gelato and pistachio cake.  I took a bite and I liked it just fine, so It was probably just a preference issue for him.  I had the crème fraiche cheesecake with a praline gelato and pear compote and I absolutely loved it.  Perfect ending to what I consider a perfect meal.We would definitely go back to Scarpetta.  The only thing we'd do is request a table in the restaurant itself, as we were seated in the bar area up front which was rather crowded.  My seat was right next to the water station, so it wasn't the most ideal.  But there were so many delicious things I wanted to try on the menu, that I'd do this again for sure.",0,0,0,Dianna S.,"Joplin, MO",255,443,59

I really really liked the bone marrow agnolotti; they were basically little raviolis with creamy bone marrow and short rib goodness wrapped inside.

If you can, try to get a table in the back-the lighting and environment is worth it.I've been here a handful of times, one of which was for my birthday. Comparing my recent meal here to when I came for my birthday, I would say the service was impeccable, if not better. My mom was incredibly impressed. We had the classic spaghetti with tomato and basil ($24), the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti ($27), creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms ($19), black cod ($36) and last but not least a MUST TRY and FAVOURITE coconut panna cotta with caramelized pineapple and guave ""soup"" ($12). Everything was delicious. The spaghetti was the perfect texture and gave the perfect bite. The sauce was not too acidic and nicely complemented the pasta. Each piece of the agnolotti was rich and scrumptious. It's like a flavor explosion with each bite. This dish is quite rich and filling, but worth it. The mushrooms acted as a great side, it was the best it could be and the cod was flaky and tasted as if it was poached in butter-yum. Lastly, the panna cotta was light and the highlight of the dish is definitely the amazing guava flavor from the ""soup"". If you are feeling full but want to share a light dessert, you will not regret this decision. I don't think you can go wrong with any of these dishes, however the spaghetti, agnolotti and coconut panna cotta are definitely must try's. I've had other dishes on different occasions.

This restaurant is very pricey and the size of the portions are almost comical. Most of the menu items we tried were good, but once you realize how much you're paying for ~a bite each for a dish, the enjoyment factor goes down.Ambiance - nice. Fine.Drinks - fine.As other reviewers have said, the polenta is good and the short rib/risotto dish is amazing but again -- split between two people, it's a bite or two each. For ~$20 per dish, it's kind of ludicrous.  The beef tenderloin was not cooked to our preference and not very tasty. The spaghetti is definitely amazing. But again, $35 for a small bowl of spaghetti?

2.0,6/4/2016,"It was explained to me that the reason that some restaurants serve a tasting rather than a meal is that the chef is creating a painting and the white space on the plate is needed to frame it. Be prepared for a lot of white space here and to leave hungry. You will also pay an arm and a leg for good service in an average venue. We ordered the tuna and beef apps. The tuna was served as four paper thin 1 1/2 inch long by 3/4 inch wide pieces. $18. Similar to size and thickness of one of those breath strips. Not much taste either. The short rib was good, but merely enough to be able to taste it for $20+. Ridiculous. We ordered three entrees and I ordered the $28 spaghetti as well to share. Although it was a small little ball of it that you see in the pictures, it was needed as the meals are tiny and much smaller. The Bronzino was served as two thin small pieces and the ""Zuppa de pesce"" part consisted of literally - I kid you not- one clam and one mussel! The wines by the glass are cheaply poured in little carafes so I ordered a bottle of Jack London, one of the cheapest bottles on the list at $80. Total with tip for three - $420.

4.0,5/12/2016,"Nothing tops fresh made pasta at an Italian restaurant. Scarpetta definitely met my needs of al dente pasta, blasting with flavor. When we arrived, we were seated right away. The restaurant itself is beautiful and the service was super nice and attentive. As for the food, it was great quality and execution of the meals.We started with the complimentary bread, which were three types of bread, accompanied by three different things to spread/tip the bread in: olive oil, an eggplant tomato sauce and mascarpone butter. Everything was delicious. The bread was fresh and the dips/spreads just made everything more delicious.We then moved to the appetizer of the creamy polenta which came highly recommended from a friend. She was right. It was great. The polenta was cooked perfectly, super creamy. The mix of the mushroom sauce just elevated the dish to another level. I could have eaten a full bowl of that polenta. Although polenta is typically heavy, it felt light and delicate from the mushroom sauce.As for the entrees, we ordered a side of wild mushrooms and two pasta dishes, the spaghetti and duck and foie gras ravioli. The wild mushrooms was a great side. You can easily split between 3-4 people. The mushrooms were cooked nicely, slightly chewy and had an acidity to it, maybe balsamic olive oil. The pastas were delicious. Scarpetta is really well known for their spaghetti. Although one might just think, spaghetti, what is so special, it really is special because of its simplicity elevated to an eloquent level. The pasta itself was al dente but what made it shine was the tomato and basil sauce. It just had the right balance of everything. It was creamy yet not overly creamy. The flavors all just popped. It was also a good big portion. As for the foie gras and duck ravioli, that was cooked perfectly as well. The ravioli pasta was just as al dente and the filling was full of flavor. It was not overwhelmed by any one flavor profile but instead mixed perfectly well with each other, into a creamy filling.We ended the meal with the espresso bundido which was also executed beautifully. The hazelnut ice cream and espresso mousse was smooth, countered by these chocolate cookie crisps of some sort. Very yummy and big enough to split between two people easy. One thing I feel the need to add though is the extra charge of a scoop of ice cream for my boyfriend's birthday they gave. I had mentioned while getting seated that it was his birthday due to a situation that was happening, not really expecting anything from the restaurant. I thought maybe they would add a candle to the dessert since we ordered something but it didn't come with it, which was fine because I didn't specify for it. What did come though was a nice plate that said happy birthday with a scoop of what seemed to be coconut gelato. It was delicious! And I appreciated the thought and that they remembered it was his birthday. I think what caught me off guard was they charged me $4 for the ice cream thatI didn't really ask for. $4 is nothing to cry over and I didn't feel the need to challenge the charge but in case anyone is taking someone for their birthday here, fair warning you could be charged for something you didn't necessarily ask for.",7,4,6,Michelle L.,"New York, NY",890,585,2091

We arrived 15 minutes earlier than our reservation and we were seated a couple minutes upon arrival. The staff was very nice and my date didn't pull out my seat (since I was struggling a bit with my dress and swanky heels) so our waitress did. Our waitress waited for us to settle in before handing out menus. We were able to ask questions about the dishes and we were answered with thoughtful commentary. The bread was beyond any bread I've had served to me pre-meal. There were three different kinds. One was a cheesy, flaky, herby bread. So delicious and the most delicious out of the three. There was a warm bread roll that had a beautiful crust and a slice of focaccia. It came with olive oil, an eggplant spread (extremely delicious) and a butter spread. I ordered the black bass and my date ordered the homemade duck and foie gras ravioli. Duck and foie gras ravioli (A)Omg this is absolutely amazing. It's buttery and creamy and the flavored are intense and bold but work so well. The pasta is perfectly al dente. Highly recommended. Black Bass (B+)This dish was really good. They worked with the fish beautifully. The skin could have been crispier. Some parts of the fish were a little slimy and I could feel some of the scales. The cauliflower was a little crunchy but cooked perfectly. However I wish there was more flavor in the purée. The capers added a perfect acidity though. The interior of the restaurant is very lovely. Nicely spaced tables and large mirrors that are held by just as large belts. The place mats were leather and there is a nice sky light. However, there are a couple tables in the front of the restaurant near the bar, but they felt disconnected to the rest and a little out of place.Overall, good service. Good food. I would go again definitely. I wouldn't order the black bass again but I would try another dish. A very nice restaurant that isn't going to burn a hole through your piggy bank.",0,0,0,Ruby S.,"Manhattan, NY",458,173,371
5.0,3/24/2016,"Divine. From the moment you walk in and grab a drink at the bar, to the minute you leave; it's a great experience. The creamy polenta with mushrooms and truffles, itself was worth the trip from California to New York. We tried about 6 different dishes and four desserts : the beet salad, braised short ribs over risotto, chicken, steak, and the daily special of ricotta, Parmesan and truffle stuffed ravioli were absolutely delicious.

3.0,3/21/2016,"It saddens me to have to downgrade my original review at one of my favorite NY restaurants. We recently ate there with our friends who hail from Europe and we were expecting it to wow them. Unfortunately, the menu changes reflect less creativity and the service was just mediocre. I had the Bronzino which was fine but nothing particularly special. My husband's octopus was good but paled in comparison to the appetizer version we devoured at Toqueville the following evening. The Brussels sprout side was quite good and the ""seared asparagus"" side also yummy. I tasted my husband's seafood tagliatelle and it was quite tasty with elements that worked well. But there was just something missing from the cuisine both in presentation and flavor. Kudos to the bar tender who did recommend some delicious savory cocktails that were on point.

Ambience was very nice--fun Friday NYC night, dim lights, etc.--would be great for a bachelorette party.We ordered the spaghetti, the mushroom polenta, the chicken and the ravioli special that night. The spaghetti was a disappointment and was over-hyped in my opinion--the sauce didn't do it for me, no flavor, and you should order something else. Everything else was very very good--and I am not a huge pasta fan, but even I would come back here just for the ravioli and the mushroom polenta.

5.0,3/15/2016,"I am fairly certain that the appropriate words will fail me, but I am going to give it a shot anyhow.  Scarpetta is amazing!  That probably says it all, but I will elaborate for sake of a review.  I wanted to take my wife out for our Anniversary to a place that would live up to my feelings for her, and I found it in Scarpetta. This was a hard reservation for me to make, as I was not a fan of Scott Conant, as a judge on Chopped, but I do admire his perfectionist attitude toward pasta, and boy does he do it right!  I am now a fan Mr. Conant.  From the moment you enter, until it is time to go, you will be welcomed warmly, and treated to a spectacular experience. We went for their signature dish, the Spaghetti Pomodoro, it was sublime, and it was still not the high point of the evening.  We always like to do a tasting menu when an option, and Scarpetta knows how to line up a tasting menu.  Cocktails - My wife had ""The Mule"" and I had the ""San Remo"", both were wonderful, as well as perfectly prepared.  Yellowtail appetizer - Scarpetta has a way with fish, and they kicked off the evening in flying colors with this dish.  Not sure what was in the sauce, but we will die trying to figure it out.  Smoked Himalayan salt & ?? Braised Short Rib over Risotto - such a simple dish, and not at the same time.  Risotto was perfect and Short rib was tender beyond description . Polenta w/Mushrooms - Not sure how they got the polenta so silky, but it was definitely worth the trip all by itself. Spaghetti - As I said earlier, sublime.  And yet it just gets better as the evening progresses.  Agnolotti with Short Rib/Bone Marrow - one earlier review claimed it was the best thing they had ever eaten, they weren't kidding, or wrong. I can't think of a single thing I have ever eaten that was so satisfying.  Nothing.  Ever.  Wow! Black Cod - Skin crispy and flesh tender to an extreme.  Wonderful.  Perfect execution.  They treat fish VERY nicely at Scarpetta. Desert - The coconut panna cotta with the guava soup was a perfect ending to the meal.  It was light, yet rich and sweet, and I wouldn't change a thing.  It is a pretty rare thing to have an entire evening work out so well, this one surely did!",3,0,0,Don P.,"Peoria, AZ",14,33,0

3.0,3/4/2016,"One of the many restaurants that I've been dying to visit (and haven't, because the price point is way out of my budget save the rare, treat-yourself meal). What I loved:  - The spaghetti. Crazy how something that I normally associate with Chef Boyardee can be this crazy good. I wasn't wowed by the first bite but it's definitely something that stays with you the more you eat it - the richness of the underlying butter, the bright pop of the tomatoes, how the noodles retained their chew. It's something I didn't mind paying $24 for, but now that I know the secret ingredients are butter and a small cup of the pasta water, I'd like to try making it at home.  - The agnolotti. The better pasta dish of the night, of which I unabashedly ate half of. If I were to visit again, I'd order this over the spaghetti. What I didn't really love:  - The bread basket. Yes, I know. There's a part of me who freely admits 90% of my excitement of finally getting to try Scarpetta is their famed bread basket of stromboli. My obvious test for how good a bread basket is how desperate I am for a second basket and how stuffed I am by the time the entree rolls around. I think I'm really sensitive to too much sodium but I moved my first piece of meat stromboli to my boyfriend's plate after crunching through salt crystals. The spinach and cheese stromboli fared better but I didn't feel crushing desire to eat more. Which almost never happens.  - The service. We were set on ordering two drinks, two pastas, and a side (and that was already hovering around $100, not including tip), but the waiter kept insisting on how delicious the appetizers were (yes, I know that's his job) and then never came back to see how the food was.

The service was top notch; our waiters were incredibly attentive, patient and charming. We started with a truffle mushroom polenta for the appetizer. It was akin to a really light and upscale plate of mash potatoes but I enjoyed it nonetheless. Then, we all had the spaghetti and it was everything I wanted and more from a plate of pasta. The noodles were so thick, chewy and perfectly al dente; it was like eating handpulled noodles drenched in a perfect tomato sauce. SO GOOD! I would come back to Scarpetta just to have this dish.

5.0,2/18/2016,"I first had Scott Conant's acclaimed spaghetti at the Los Angeles location years ago, and was enamored with how simple yet complete a dish it was - the quintessential spaghetti. When I was invited to dinner with friends at the location here in New York, I was excited to try something a little more adventurous this time.The ambience at Scarpetta is subdued and intimate, with dim mood lighting that's still bright enough to see what you're eating, and a subtle soundtrack so you can still have a conversation with the table without shouting or trying to read lips. Service was impeccable, as expected, and they were so gracious when two of my friends (who ordered the same dish) mentioned that their pasta was slightly underseasoned. Not only did our server apologize profusely, but he also presented a few options as a solution before ultimately offering to replace it. A light dusting of fresh parmesan cheese ended up doing the trick.The bread baskets at restaurants that serve them are in some ways my favorite part of the meal. There's always a part of me that thinks, ""Ok just one more piece of bread, I need to save room for the main dishes... Oh, what's another piece... Fuck it, I'm eating all the bread, bringing the food home for later."" That almost happened here. The basket of warm stromboli and foccacia was a meal in itself. The accompanying trio of olive oil, eggplant caponata, and mascarpone butter complemented the bread in different but fantastic ways. The mascarpone butter on the foccacia blew me away, like to the point where I was thinking, what is this and how can I make tons of it at home for myself? The butter I have at home is like a stick of wax next to this creaminess.The roasted octopus (a menu item that I order anywhere I see it) was uber tender, but I like a little char on my cephalopods. By the way, the roasted octopus at Rubirosa is the gold standard against which I measure all roasted octopuses... octopi? My friend's creamy polenta with fricasee of truffled mushrooms made me jealous that I hadn't ordered it. I usually hate the graininess of polenta but this app was so creamy and indulgent, I may have taken more bites than I was offered. I ordered the shortrib and bone marrow agnolotti, and gave myself an A+ for my choice. The only other pasta dish we tried that night that I would've traded for was the duck and foie gras ravioli. Both pastas were superbly cooked, perfect texture, perfect amount of filling, just perfect little pockets of decadent flavor. In case you're wondering, the farfalle with mushrooms was the underseasoned dish. Again, nothing a little parmesan cheese couldn't fix.By the time the meat courses came out, I was so full I could only muster a taste of the moist roasted capretto, which I ordered mainly out of curiosity. Turns out baby goat meat is super tender. While the capretto was good, the dry aged sirloin I tried off a friend's plate was amazing. Nothing like an expertly cooked steak.Desserts were probably overkill, but we were fully committed at this point. The coconut panna cotta with caramelized pineapple and guava 'soup' was my favorite. Friends all raved about the olive oil cake and espresso budino but I was in a fruity, not chocolatey, mood. Food coma hit me like a wall after the bill, so the rest of the experience was a blur for me, but there are few greater feelings in life than going home to your bed after a long day, belly full and appetite satiated.",5,4,3,June P.,"Brooklyn, NY",101,140,78

It's the only dish I order from here and the dish that I compare all squid ink pastas to; t's either too bland or briny when made at other restaurants. Scarpetta also excels in their bread basket offerings and their spaghetti. I would also order the polenta at least once as it is rich and creamy. However, it's a bit too creamy to eat alone, despite its small size since it's an appetizer. Scarpetta's a nice date spot that I always recommend to my friends. Definitely make reservations, so you won't be kept waiting or eat at the high top tables near the bar (although eating at those tables isn't a bad option as a last minute decision either).

5.0,2/8/2016,"This review is for the pre-fixed $38 dinner during restaurant week. I visited this fine Italian restaurant with my significant other, and as she ordered the heralded spaghetti, I ended up ordering the chicken (don't judge me.. I am a chicken fanatic) so we don't duplicate dinner items. To start, I ordered the creamy polenta, which was excellent, and my girlfriend ordered the beet salad, which was excellent as well. You cannot go wrong with either of the two.The spaghetti: none that I have ever tried before, and it delivered. I will say that I do not eat a lot of spaghetti to begin with, so it wasn't rather difficult to please my simple palate. But the spaghetti was cooked to perfection. The sauce was unique and very different than what I am used to. I highly recommend the spaghetti and for the most part, it lived up to its hype. The chicken was fantastic as well. Not dry, as most chicken is, and full of flavor. One of the better chickens I have tried at fine restaurants.For dessert, I ordered the coconut panna cotta, which was out of this world. The different flavors really work well together. My girlfriend ordered the espresso budino, which was dark and heavy as was expected.

4.0,2/5/2016,"Food Grade: 90%This review is only for the hyped spaghetti.$26 for a spun al dente home-made spaghetti with a garlicky, deep and tangy tomato basil sauce. Did it live up to the hype? Mostly yes. There's something about it that makes me want to eat more. It's true that someone somewhere at home can remake this sauce and probably make their own pasta that rivals Conant's. But I can't. So I will eat this again and again. It's not overpowering and the flavors may be somewhat subdued but that's not necessarily bad. The initial taste starts savory with the highlights of the tomato. Then as the sauce spreads throughout your tongue, the hint of tanginess cuts through the sharpness of the garlic and you end up with a double sting. Then comes the saltiness that rounds the flavors together. While it might seem from the description that the dish is an assault to the palate, it really isn't. The amount of control over the ingredients shines through resulting in a flavorful yet ironically one-tone dish. I wish it was a larger portion. It was definitely a tease. Excellent job Scarpetta.

My appetizer of chestnut soup was rich and creamy, but the diced vegetables in my opinion didn't need to be so tart. Entree of branzino was a success - crispy skin, big flavor, and well-cooked side vegetables. I had a taste of the spaghetti too. No way this is the best spaghetti I've had, but the strong flavor of basil floored me.

5.0,2/2/2016,"Our evening at Scarpetta started out terribly -- we had a reservation for 8:00 pm, but didn't get seated until 8:45 pm. Our completed party waited very patiently, only asking for an update once every 10-15 minutes and doing so politely. The host/hostesses up front were incredibly rude, showing us attitude even though we were being firm, but polite. At least twice, they were actively rude to us, rolling their eyes and being unhelpful on the whole. We were not happy. 40 minutes into our wait, our displeasure must have shown, because the manager came over and gave us free drinks, accommodating those of us who don't drink by kindly making us virgin drinks. We were seated 45 minutes later and everyone we interacted with after the initial host/hostesses were gracious and falling over themselves to better our experience. The food itself was incredible. To begin, the bread -- particularly the foccacia -- from the complimentary bread basket was incredible. Our party almost filled up on the bread immediately, it was so good. Two of our party didn't eat pork and the server kindly gave us bread without the pork, upon request. The manager also gave us a complimentary roasted root vegetable salad for our wait, which was delicious and unanimously loved by everyone at the table.I ordered from the restaurant week menu, choosing the mushroom polenta, spaghetti, and chocolate cake with sea salt caramel gelato. I'm not a huge fan of polenta, but this polenta was smooth, creamy, and decadent. The mushrooms and glaze were absolutely delicious and I had no problem with the texture. The spaghetti I was hesitant about to begin with -- everyone's been raving about it, but how good could spaghetti really be? I was, delightfully, proven wrong. Spaghetti really can be that good -- it was rich, tart, flavorful, and got better with every bite. I did not regret getting it in the least; the rave reviews are really, truly deserved. The chocolate cake with sea salt caramel gelato was the perfect end -- the gelato by itself would have been too salty and the chocolate cake by itself would have been too dense, but together they balanced each other remarkably. A spoonful of both the cake and gelato were honestly to die for. My friends got the olive oil cake with blood orange sorbet, which I tried, and that dessert too was incredible. We each ended up spending about $50, with tip, for the meal and while I do not go out of my way to spend that much on a meal, I can say with certainty that -- disaster on the front end and all -- the meal was worth every penny. It is a testament to the food and the manager and server's generosity and graciousness that each member of my party said unanimously we would come back, even though the host and hostesses up front had been so unacceptably rude.

5.0,2/1/2016,"What an absolutely divine experience at Scarpetta for our Restaurant Week dinner. Everything from the perfectly warm bread to the dessert created an irreplaceably, heartwarming experience.I am an avid fan of the bread that a restaurant provides at the start of the meal and this was not your usual start. A wonderful assortment of warm, soft bread accompanied by three great dipping sauces were gracefully explained and presented. The eggplant puree was the perfect addition to any of their breads. We had to ask for a second round.I ordered the branzino, which was cooked with absolute care from the crunchy, tasteful skin of the fish to a moist, flavorful meat. A fantastic tomato sautee of brussel sprouts and onions came below the branzino, adding even more flavor to the dish. Generous portions were provided for all entrees, but we were left sitting wanting so much more.I can not begin to describe the heavenly experience of the chocolate cake. An orgasmic creation of a decadent, perfectly cooked, warm chocolate cake with a stunning presentation and well balanced accompaniment of gelato and chocolate crisp. Wish this was the end to all of meals.Can not wait to relive this experience another time soon. The Restaurant Week deal was phenomenal for the experience as is, but an additional ""$20 off $100 spent Amex promotion at Scarpetta"" made the total far lower than what I would have paid for the meal.",1,0,0,Jane R.,"Boston, MA",538,51,36

They gave us a basket of this awesome crispy potatoes chips. Once our table was ready (only a few minutes) They served us with this stuffed bread that was delicious! We started with the creamy polenta, amazing. The entrees we had were the short rib agnolotti, organic chicken and spaghetti with basil. We loved it all, but the spaghetti was the best pasta I've ever had. I get it, it's sounds simple but it was so fresh and al dente and the sauce was delicious and the perfect amount of basil. I seriously would go back just for this dish and then take an extra dish of it home for the nest day!!!",0,0,0,Christina L.,"Iselin, NJ",6,54,0

Nothing boring about that basket!First course, Stracciatella, a creamy cheese and vegetable plate. Vinaigrette added nice acidity. Just the right amount of salt. All together a solid, light first course. Second, Branzino, my favorite fish. Masterfully cooked with crispy skin. Enough said. I should mention I tried my husbands spaghetti and yes, it's on the money too. Finally, Coconut Pana Cotta... Quoting my girlfriend, reminds me of summer!

It was the best polenta/grits dish I've ever had, and I make a point of trying them all. Just be sure to specify if you're vegetarian, as Scarpetta normally makes it with chicken stock. For my entrée they went off-menu to provide a very flavorful vegan lentil dish; so filling I could only finish half, and took the rest home. For dessert I had the sorbet trio, of which the blackberry basil was off the charts in terms of creamy texture and incredible flavor. I don't ordinarily like sorbet, but I scarfed this one down.

Ordered the Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti which was like a tortellini = amazing. Highly recommend this dish. Paired with a Sauv Blanc, my meal was delicious. An A for food quality.What made this experience lacking though was the customer service. Maybe the waiter was on the young side, or just overeager, he kept trying to upsell us from the very beginning and was very pushy, kept clearing our plates right away making us feel very rushed, and overall, made us feel like we were wasting his time for not ordering enough. He even made a snarky comment at the end about perhaps getting another glass of wine - but to split between the 4 of us! That is just incredibly snobby and ridiculous. At the end, he also tried to rush us with the bill until we had to admonish him to chillThis is unacceptable in a relatively upscale place - the restaurant needs to retrain their staff to treat every single customer who walks in with respect and dignity, regardless of who they are and how much they spend. Customers are guests who have walked in the door and need to be made comfortable and not feel like they aren't deserving of being there.

Scarpetta's self-proclaimed pasta is worth all the hype, it's bathed in yummy sauces and cooked to perfection: not too mushy, not too aldente. The restaurant is sleek and modern, but you're coming here to get your carb on first and foremost.

5.0,1/21/2016,"We came to this restaurant because I saw Ted Allen on Food Network describing the tomato basil spaghetti as ""transcendental"".  Well now that I must try!So we dipped into Scarpetta.  There is no sign anywhere.  When you enter the door its a bit disappointing.  Its pretty but quite simple.  Theres a wood and brown theme going on and its dim and a bit romantic.  We sat in the front near the window so maybe theres more to see in the main dining room.I had the speghetti and my best road dog had the steak. When they arrived I was skeptical.  My portion was like an appetizer size and his was laughable compared to the slabs of meat Ive seen him eat at your typical steakhouse.  Let the snark begin!But no.  One bite in and Scott Conant had me!  Theres something going on in this plain old simple dish.  The taste gets better the more you eat and the texture!  The texture of the noodles and the silky sauce are what makes it.  In fact I learned a lot about food texture in that meal.  My mates steak came with a sauce of spinach and truffle oil and I dont remember what else.  There was not much of it but the absolutely creamy yet frothy texture and the wow of taste made the steak spectacular!But wait...theres more.  The chocolate cake.  Oh my damn yes!  The chocolate cake!  Have that please.  I dont care if its your last $20 bucks.  Trust me.  Its worth it.Every aspect is sheer perfection.  And again, the salted ice cream scoop sat on top of some sort of hard chocolate cookie type crumbs.  The feel and taste was out of this world.To top it all off our server was perfect.  He was the epitome of what a waiter should be.  We felt welcomed, attended to, suggested great dishes, and knew everything about the menu.Plus one of the best lemon drop martinis I ever had,Its not often that I think about a meal a week later and tell everyone how great it was.  This place is definitely worth a try.",2,1,2,Allie P.,"Evanston, IL",219,194,192

5.0,1/13/2016,"Long before I dined here for the first time, I fell in love with Scott Conant's famous Tomato Sauce after seeing the recipe in a magazine and giving it a shot at home. I was so intrigued by the technique he uses, which is carefully thought out, and yet so simple. The result was an incredibly flavorful sauce that in one word could be described as luxurious.  How many sauces can you say that about? I knew that I would love Scarpetta before I even stepped foot in the door. When I finally went it was for Restaurant Week. I always appreciate when a Restaurant Week menu actually features standard menu items, which was the case here. Even better was the fact that despite how busy the restaurant was, the quality of the food and the service did not suffer in the slightest. To me that says a lot about a dining establishment.  I would describe the decor at Scarpetta as slightly modern with a polished elegance. Our server was fantastic -- warm, knowledgeable and attentive. To start they gave us a lovely assortment of fresh breads and delicious spreads to go with them. The highlight for me was the one with prosciutto and cheese baked into the dough. If it was on the menu I would order it. I tried the Creamy Polenta, the famed Spaghetti, and the Valrhona Chocolate Cake for dessert. It was easily one of the best meals I have had. The hallmark of Italian cuisine is the simplicity of it; quality over quantity. That comes through in every one of these dishes. Nothing is overdone, which allows for perfect balance and the complexity of the flavors to really come through. I'll echo my same sentiments from earlier, there is a luxurious quality to this food, that leaves you feeling wonderfully satisfied. It's definitely one of my favorite upscale Italian restaurants here in New York.",7,2,6,Christina G.,"New York, NY",401,474,103

Even their tomato and basic spaghetti stands out as something special. I generally shrug my shoulders at a risotto, but again, theirs is a head above the crowd in terms of flavor and technique.

A fatass journey at the very least...because Scarpetta left me speechless. I wish I lived next door that is how much love I have for this place. Let me start by saying this place is dark and I almost tripped over my own foot if not for the dim lights to guide my way. But I digress because the food gave me a foodgasm. If that is a word, if not it should be. This is the fatass list my girlfriend and I had:(Served complimentary of the Scarpetta: Bread Basket with stromboli and Focaccia Bread w/ three dipping sauces: Eggplant Marinara (AMAZING), Citrus Olive Oil, Butter)Braised Short Ribs w/ vegetable & farro risotto (Portion is small but short ribs were extremely tender and compliments the risotto really well)Creamy Polenta w/ fricassee of truffled mushrooms (Silky and smooth is the best way to describe this dish as the polenta is filled with flavor and the truffled mushrooms accentuates the dish.)Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti w/ garlic chip & horseradish (By far the winner of the night as it had a crunch from the garlic chips only to get hit with the succulent taste of the short rib and bone marrow all warp up. This left me speechless and I almost did not want to finish it.)Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli w/ marsala reduction (Creamy and just delightful. The dish is on the heavy side due to the Foie Gras but it just fits so well and a great lead to the entrees)Veal Tenderloin w/ sweetbreads, root vegetables & gnocchi alla romana (Soft and tender when cooked to medium rare. I could not ask for a better entree well unless they gave me two of these dishes)Limoncello Semifreddo w/ pistachio cake, macerated berries & basil-blackberry sorbet (Amazing and beautiful. Each one of the components are there to compliment the other and is meant to be eaten together. Hitting every single dessert note on my tongue)Valrhona Chocolate Cake w/ chocolate, butterscotch & caramel gelato (Sweet and bitter at the same time which left a great sensation considering we got this will the Limoncello. Layer after layer of flavor hit my tongue and I could not end this journey any other way)My girlfriend brought me to this place for my birthday and it was magical.

Service was impeccable. Let me start with the wine, I had a great glass of Chianti and I'm always impressed when a restaurant has good Chianti, which can be hard to find outside of Italy. We ordered the braised short ribs appetizer, which was delicious! I had their famous spaghetti, which was good, but not blow-your-mind good. Had a taste of my friend's short rib and bone marrow agnolotti, which was creamy and delicious. The coconut panna cotta was a miss - they're not kidding when they say it's served in a guava soup, while it sounds amazing on paper, it didn't translate well on the actual plate. It felt like I was eating something very gelatinous...not what you want for dessert.Great attention to detail, we were waited on attentively, not just by our server but the bus boy as well. Decor and ambiance is dark and romantic, this is a great spot to catch up with an old friend or bring a date. And here's an important tip if you're like me and can't find the place, there's no sign outside, not that I saw anyway - look for a white brick facade that says 355 on it, it's next to the really loud (as in colorful) diner next door on the corner.",5,3,2,Mahsa T.,"New York, NY",992,902,770

The wines were fantastic- you can't go wrong with the Pinot Nero. As for our main course I ordered the spaghetti. Oh. My. Gawd. Pasta fatta a casa- they make their own pasta. It's aldente. It's not drowning in sauce like a soup. This place highly exceeded my expectations. Oh and the farfalle nere is so bomb.

We were a party of 6, and every single person mentioned that they felt anxiety towards the beginning of the dinner prior to and while ordering for some reason. Not sure what it was exactly but a mix of multiple staff approaching asking what you would like or if you have any questions, but without giving you a minute, literally a minute to look through the menu. The bread basket  may be the best part of the meal, but only problem is, takes a while to arrive table side as its apparently being baked per table. So if you want more, expect to wait too long for it.Food is good, not amazing. Had much of the menu so won't list out everything but will try to mention a few. Spaghetti was good (they're known for this, although a bit too much basil).  Cod was sub par, Branzino was a nice dish (recommend). Short Rib and Bone Marrow Agnolotti (recommend).  Octopus was OK. Tuna ""Susci"" was not good.  All in all, if you order the dishes I recommend and get as much of the bread basket as possible, you may enjoy this place, but I will most likely not return.

3.0,11/5/2015,"Ah, if only the meal ended after the appetizers...I had been wanting to try Scarpetta for a long time as part of my tour of classy Italian places in NYC. After a walk down the High Line, we ended our evening at Scarpetta. We had reservations for a Saturday evening so getting a table wasn't an issue.Ambience: The restaurant is very well designed and trendy, making it feel right at home in Meatpacking. However, I felt the tables were extremely close to each other, and the noise level was pretty loud soI couldn't have a reasonable conversation at my own table. Additionally, the tables are very small and cramped. There literally wasn't enough space for our drinks and the appetizer plate, so we had to play a game of tetris to get the few items on our table to fit appropriately.Appetizers: as I alluded to, the beginning of the meal was exquisite. We went with the polenta as many before have recommended, and weren't disappointed. It was creamy, highly concentrated with flavor, and disappeared quickly. Additionally, the bread basket was enjoyable.Entrees: Maybe we went safe with the Duck/Foie Gras Ravioli and Spaghetti, but for the prices we paid they were more than underwhelming. The intensity of flavor I expected after the Polenta was lacking, and while the pastas were cooked well, the sauces did not have much flavor and I definitely have experienced much better at various places throughout the city at the same price point or less.Overall my experience was ok, but not what I expected for a place of their reputation, location, and cost.",1,0,0,Neha P.,"Manhattan, NY",47,160,232

For the main course I got the spaghetti, which was perfectly cooked and had a lovely tomato sauce. My wife got the foie gras ravioli. It was rich and flavorful without being overwhelming. Our dessert was the coconut panna cotta, which had a nice flavor to it but was a bit overpowered by the sweetness of the guava soup it came with. A great meal overall, but I'll have to dock one star for the service.

Best service ever and I mean that.The food was excellent as well, most notably the braised short ribs and duck/foie gras ravioli. The braised short ribs was so tender, melt in your mouth with every bite. I could eat 2 or 3 orders of that. The duck and foie gras ravioli was the other highlight of the night, rich and creamy, hint of sweetness, yum!Now the famous spaghetti, I'm sad that I didn't like as much as my friends did. I love spaghetti, was super excited about it. Yes, it was perfectly cooked, the pasta and the sauce, it was good spaghetti, but didn't get the same satisfying feeling as the short ribs. I wanted to like the grilled octopus because I'm a huge octopus lover, but it was just alright, wasn't as tender as I would have liked. I am definitely a big fan.Tip: the sign for the restaurant is tiny (yellowish color), can be easily missed. Restrooms are downstairs and the sink is shared betweent the men and women's restrooms.

The polenta was presented beautifully where the broth was ladled table-side. The farfalle with wild mushrooms ($25) was wonderfully light and balanced, particularly after a heavy polenta starter.

Tasty slices of something similar to Stromboli or my moms pepperoni bread along with focaccia and rolls served with a great trio of butter, pepper/ tomato spread and olive oil to dip. Seriously a carb lovers dream. Yum! For apps we got the short ribs over risotto and fritto misto. Short rib was so tender, as was the calamari in the fritto. I also appreciated how the fritto misto was perfectly salted. Entrees we had an order of the famous spaghetti and duck foie gras ravioli. Wow these were both amazing! Clean plate club here.

I usually would not even think about ordering short ribs because I don't eat too much beef but both of those dishes made my taste buds tingle! The famous spaghetti met my expectations. That's also something I wouldn't get elsewhere because it's just spaghetti. BUT THIS was creamy, flavored perfectly, and made me want more. We also tried a pasta dish with black and white truffles. Just the right amount of truffle zing, it couldn't get better! Everything we got for dessert was perfect. There was a basil raspberry sorbet that blew my mind. I would definitely buy that at a supermarket if they ever sold it! Recommended for a really fancy dinner, date, or outing.

It's one of those pretty dim & nice, fine restaurants, so I advise dressing up.The scallops were delicious! My friends and I loved it a lot. The only bad part is that there are only 2 scallops for $21. Spaghetti ($24) was also delicious! I just had to try it after reading the reviews on here. My friends and I agreed that it was refreshing. The halibut ($37) was a bit salty, but cooked well. The outer edge was crispy and delicious. I wasn't a huge fan of the duck froie gras ravioli ($20 something) but my friends loved it. I guess it's a hit or miss depending on your taste buds. The taste reminds of chinese sausages but with a mushy texture inside. Service was quite good.

I don't know why we didn't go sooner and am very glad she found this place to take me for my birthday!Everything about this place is just fantastic. Ambiance, decor, lighting, front of house staff was very friendly and inviting.We started with the Creamy Polenta and Crispy Fritto Misto. The polenta was like velvet, so smooth, rich and flavorful. The Fritto Misto was cooked perfectly. It was light battered and fried, wasn't greasy at all and just the right amount of crunch while keeping the delicious seafood moist and flavorful (versus other calamari type appetizers where its either too greasy or has no flavor but the breading).For the main course, we got the Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti which was absolutely delicious. Little pillows of just the right amount of short rib meat and pasta. I ordered the Black tagliolini which was also absolutely delicious. I love the squid pasta and order it whenever I see it on the menu, which is not very often. Extremely flavorful and delicious with the right balance of garlic, spices, delicious bits of seafood ragout and both were portioned just perfectly. Of course I wanted more but if I had just a few more forkfuls, I would of been too stuffed.They also have a very impressive wine list from wine's all over Italy and France. I am a big drinker of Pinot Noir and I usually order a glass (or bottle depending on the night) from the Oregon or Washington region but because these are all Italian wines, the waiter, Ben W (who was extremely friendly, polite and attentive) recommended a wonderful comparable of an Italian Pinot Noir and it was so delicious, I asked him to write down the name of it. He not only wrote it down for me, but brought the bottle so we could take a picture.

This place deserves to have you dress up. When my fiance and I showed up for our reservations, they told us the kitchen was having problems and they were shutting down for the night. The lovely hostess offered to Uber us over to their sister restaurant but it was steak and I wasn't into it. We sat at the bar for a minute, which is beautiful and not to be missed, and decided to go somewhere else. We asked the hostess if we could get in the next night, an even busier night for them, at the same time, 8 p.m. The manager came over and took care of us right away and said no problem. The next night we arrived and it was just wonderful. No problems with the kitchen, and the managers and staff did everything to make it such a special night.

Maybe I'm just used to sushi tasting menus where they give you things that are unique and not on the menu but that wasn't the case at Scarpetta. I'm going to go down the list of things we had.Yellow tail: they put salt on it. I was very turned off by this. The fish would have been fine without salt. Short rib with risotto: I'm not kidding it looked, smelled, and tasted like dog food. I'm pretty sure they fed us fancy feast.Short rib ravioli: also tasted like fancy feast dog food. So grossCreamy polenta: this was ok but way too rich for me.The spaghetti: Probably the best thing we had that night. It was very simple.Cod (my main dish): the cod was cooked perfectly but the flavors with it were seriously lacking. Goat: my boyfriend had the goat as his main dish and he said it was ok but over-salted and the veggies with the goat had a strange chemical taste to them. The deserts were fine. Nothing to write home about, but nothing to complain about. The wine we had was good but if you want a bottle under 70$ this is not the place to go.Overall, we did not enjoy this meal. I was very disappointed and felt bad since it was his birthday! I usually don't complain about the price of food but we spent over 300$ here and were far from satisfied.

When I was a young deer in headlights at 18 years old, a little baby fawn in my first year of ever living in Manhattan, I came here for dinner with some friends. There is no sign in front of the restaurant and I completely forgot the name/where this restaurant was. I always did remember it as the best spaghetti I ever had.Fast forward to when I moved to Miami and dined at Scarpetta where this glorious spaghetti again touched my mouth. I instantly remembered the flavors as being from the same restaurant in NYC. I finally realized that it was Scarpetta that I had dined with that lovely evening.Ever since then, I have been to the Scarpetta in LA, Vegas, Miami, and back in NYC. I have never had a negative experience at all in this restaurant, ever. That is pretty hard to pull off! The food is extremely consistent and absolutely delicious.+ Raw yellowtail - Light and refreshing although I wish there was some ponzu sauce or a bit more flavor to it (that's just my opinion, a lot of people like it the more traditional way with less sauces)+++ Chilled corn soup - I was never a fan of cold soup until having this dish at Scarpetta. It changed the game and now I love chilled soups. It has the perfect texture and flavor. It's not too heavy but not too light either. + Scallops - Amazing but you only get 2 so be prepared it is a smaller dish. ++++++++++++ SPAGHETTI +++++++++++++++ TO. DIE. FOR.

I had the rosé and it was one of the best I've had. My colleagues had cocktails and thought they were all divine.We were seated a few minutes later, and a server generously took our drinks on a tray so we didn't have to carry them to our table. Um, I guess I'm not that fancy so this is new for me but that was amazing.Upon sitting our waitress promptly informed us about each menu and had a very friendly and approachable vibe. I started with the polenta, which may have been one of the most delicious bites I've had in a long time. The polenta was super rich and creamy and the mushrooms added the meaty texture and umami flavors. A+ on that!I followed that with the spaghetti. I had heard that this was the best plate of pasta in NYC, but honestly my hopes weren't that high. I'm not really a pasta person so it definitely wouldn't change my life. Boy was I wrong! I'm not sure what they do in the kitchen, but the pasta was al dente, the sauce was creamy, and the basil added the perfect hint of freshness. YuuummmmI finished the meal with the coconut panna cotta based on a recommendation I had seen online. I typically would've gone with one of the chocolate or more traditionally decadent options, but this was absolutely fantastic! The panna cotta was perfectly creamy and coconutty and the little cookie added the necessary crunch.Service was top notch. When meals arrived, the servers were coordinated to carry all the plates to the table at the same time and then remove the ""lids"" all at once. Again, maybe this is 'normal' for some, but I was certainly impressed. I am already planning my next visit to Scarpetta!!!",4,0,2,Alyssa B.,"Salem, MA",186,279,442
5.0,9/3/2015,"4.75Scarpetta really exceeded my expectations.  I figured it was a more casual Italian joint but it turned out to be classy, upscale, and quite cozy at the same time.  I started with the burrata tomato salad.  The tomatoes were wonderfully ripe and the burrata was just divine.  The plate was a perfectly executed seasonal dish.For my meal, I was leaning away from the richer decadent dishes and decided to go with the spaghetti.  Is it a simple dish?  Yes, it is spaghetti with a tomato and basil sauce but it was executed perfectly.  Each bite left me wanting more.  It was probably the best spaghetti with tomato sauce I've ever had.  Service was friendly and timely but mainly invisible.  We were a chatty 4 top but I don't even remember her introducing herself.  Scarpetta killed it in the Italian department.  I hope to return for their spaghetti!",3,0,3,Sylvie S.,"Washington, DC",168,197,224

Was. AMAZING.  Not just your plain old, it was bread stuffed with meats cheese, and some with spinach.  It was SOOOOO delicious especially the eggplant/red pepper? side.  I wonder if I can just have a drink at the bar and eat bread....???  Next, we had the burrata to start which was very tasty and creamy, not the biggest portion i've ever had.  This was fine since we had three main courses coming.  The main dishes were the highlight for sure.  The Duck foie gras ravioli - is a MUST TRY, it was the most delicious ravioli I have ever had.  So rich, I ate the entire plate.  The tagliatelle pasta with goat cheese asparagus and peas was another highlight along with the sea bass.  Everything tasted so fresh and home made.  I recommend sticking with the pasta although the fish was quite delicious itself.  I will 100% be back and can't wait to try something else on the menu !!",2,0,1,Lauren A.,"New York, NY",237,239,442

5.0,8/24/2015,"It was the first night of my Spring Break 15. Our tourguide Patch had given us a few options for meals, and per recommendation from a friend, I chose Scarpetta. It also happened to be restaurant week, which couldn't have worked out better for our timing! As well as our bill. The atmosphere is chic NYC, with a fancy bar, hidden booths in the back, cool skylight windows separated with wooden beams, almost like a pallet on the whole ceiling, with strings of lights, as well as big glass boxes with lights in them. It is refreshing, fancy, elegant and feels just ""classic"". For resturaunt week, we ordered -Let me also add, that the bread basket was 10 out of 5 stars. As we all know, I am a tough critic on bread. It tells a lot about a restaurant. It is their first impression with food, and can really make or break my attitude about how I will feel about the rest of my food. Well make me batt my eyelashes, the bread flirted with me the idea that this would be the best meal ever. Little did I know what was to come. Apps: 1. tuna (which I surprisingly liked!)- very fresh, with loads of flavor 2. Polenta- again, something I never thought I would like, but it was creamy, smooth and warming.Meal:  The spaghetti. The famous spahgeti with tomato/basil. While this sounds so ""plain"" and so ""unsophisticated"", it introduced new flavors, feelings, sensations in my first bite. After savoring the flavor, I didn't want to eat anymore. I wanted this feeling to last forever. I wanted this dish to last forever. Spaghetti would never be the same anymore, and it was almost spoiling that anything I had after this would be crap. The elegance and simplicity of the meal, is overpowered by the unique, homemade, fresh flavors, textures, and allure of the dish. Dessert: we tried all the desserts that were offered for restaurant week. If I hadn't already been seduced by the spaghetti, I would have swooned for the Mousse. Given that the hearts were already in my eyes, the dopamine and adrenaline rushing through my blood, the dessert was the last piece that needed to seal the deal that this was by far, the best meal, that I probably had ever had. We did have one bad experience with the dinner. The server was refilling Gster's wine glass, and knocked it into his lap, as well as almost all of the wine. He had a on kahki pants, and didn't bring many others to change for the rest of the week. The staff rushed over with club soda, a new bottle of wine, and continued to deliver us with a bottle of champagne, more entrees and more desserts than we ordered. While it could have been fatal to my rating, my experience, my seduction... they totally redeemed themselves and proved to be the classy restaurateurs that they were.",3,3,2,Kim B.,"New York, NY",340,769,144

You could tell everything was made with care and while seemingly small, was very filling.

After multiple failed attempts to dine in Scarpetta, I was excited to learn that they were participating in restaurant week! After scouting through the menu and learning that they were offering items from their regular menu (including their signature dishes), i jumped the opportunity and snatched one of their few Friday reservations. That was probably my wisest decision of all summer! Scarpetta topped the best Restaurant Week dining experience in the city. You can't possibly go wrong with any item off their restaurant week menu! Burrata - so light yet creamy. Mushroom polenta - a bowl of heaven on earth, possibly one of my fav dishes of all restaurants! Branzino - beautifully pan seared. Goat cheese cream pasta - the gold standard of how all pasta should be! Coconut panna cotta - I finally learned what the perfect texture should be, soaked in guava soup? Genius! Nutella mousse - a giant ferro Roche bar, delish! Service - nothing short of a 5 stars restaurant. The bread basket - as dreamy as I expected it to be. 3 refills later, I only wanted more!

4.0,7/23/2015,"Scarpetta, which literally translates to little shoe, is a metaphor for the shape bread takes after soaking up the remnants of a meal.  The owners should consider renaming the restaurant to Scarpone (big shoe) because the flavors here pack a serious punch.  The interior is a nouveaux rustic setting with a front bar and a killer dining room in the back.  The atrium provides a spotlight for the star of the show, the food.Rather than the standard old fashion, I went with a negroni, because you know, when in Rome.  Also because the city was approximately 1,000°.  It was a great replacement for my go-to drink.The meal starts with table bread accompanied by olive oil, bruschetta, and something similar to burrata.  Then you should knock out a couple apps and pastas.  I had the yellowtail crudo, served with zenzero oil, sea salt and micro-oregano.  This is spectacular.  I also had the calamari (great), the short rib agnolotti (great), and ostensibly the best pasta dish I have ever had, the duck & foie gras ravioli.  The richness of the foie gras pairs nicely with the sweetness of the duck meat and has a perfect contrast with the balsamic reduction drizzled on top.  I knocked out three fish dishes for entrees, the cod, the branzino, and the halibut.  I normally don't get fish at an Italian place, but I wanted to try something new.  Of the three, I recommend getting the cod, but you should go with something more traditional.Come prepared to spend $80-100 on dinner.",1,2,0,Chris P.,"Manhattan, NY",42,59,0

From the top: Seated, menus handed, bread delivered, Sommelier circled by to see if it would be a bottle or by the glass, appetizers, main course and dessert served with such perfect synchronicity (in order to maximize table turns) that it would make SwissRail jealous. Desserts were removed from the table as quickly as they were served, and check delivered without even a prompt. When the credit card slip came back, attendants removed the napkins from the table, leaving us sitting uncomfortably and feeling naked in their restaurant. Talk about being rushed -- this is not fine dining; it is speed dining. Kind of a shame because the food is decent and has potential, but the ambiance is seriously lacking and the management's crass obsession with profit maximization leaves this diner with a very bad taste in her mouth.

4.0,7/20/2015,"Came here for a birthday dinner with a party of 8. I was disappointed with the way the staff had seated us especially when my friend had made the reservation a month in advance. Our table was small and could've probably only seated 6 people comfortably. We were squeezed in together with the neighboring tables literally just inches away from us. For a more intimate and comfortable dining experience, request for a booth seat in the main dining area and AVOID the middle section! As for the ambience, the restaurant has a modern feel to it with their dimly-lit skylight dining room.  Now on to the food...we started of with their complimentary focaccia & stromboli bread basket. This was accompanied with 3 spreads: buttered marscapone, olive oil, and eggplant caponata. I felt that it was just mediocre. It certainly doesn't fall into the category of best bread baskets I've had in the city. RAW YELLOWTAIL -- Started off with this raw seafood appetizer. The thinly sliced yellowtail sprinkled with sea-salt was a nice way to begin. It was light and refreshing. TUNA SUCI -- Essentially marinated vegetables and preserved truffle wrapped with tuna. The micro-greens masked the delicate tuna flavor in my opinion. CREAMY POLENTA -- Tastes just as good as it looks. The polenta had a good consistency and texture. It was super creamy, silky, and flavorful especially with the combination of the truffled mushrooms. The sauce they poured onto the polenta was simply to die for! SPAGHETTI -- This is supposed to be their ""specialty dish"" but I think not. It was so bland and tasteless even my boyfriend cooks better spaghetti. The red sauce had no tangy hit to it and the basil flavor was practically non existent. Definitely not a ""must have"" nor worth the $24 price tag. Not memorable. Not outstanding. Biggest disappointment the whole night.DUCK & FOIE GRA RAVIOLI -- Good and rich. It had the perfect amount of foie gras and duck without being too fatty and overbearing. Brilliant dish.SHORT RIB & BONE MARROW AGNOLOTTI -- Loved the crispy texture that the garlic chips provided. It worked well with the savory flavors within the agnolotti. Overall, I enjoyed majority of the dishes here. The restaurant seemed extremely busy during our visit but the service still managed to be composed.

5.0,7/19/2015,"Best meal I've had in a long time! From start to finish all the dishes were cooked perfectly. So, my boyfriend made reservations for this highly rated Italian restaurant for my birthday. We were 15 minutes late and they already gave away a table my boyfriend had to book weeks in advance. They still accommodated us but at the bar. It's really nice of them but it definitely wouldn't give me the full main dining room experience I was hoping for at a place of such nice decor and ambience. Regardless, we opted to wait for a table to open up bc it was just that important to us. Now about the food.. It was allllll so amazing bc there was a lot of care into not over seasoning the food with salt. The taste of the seafoods' natural flavors were brought forward. The proteins were cooked to perfection and paired perfectly with the bed of vegetables that it came on. Ahhhh!! Listen, it was an epic meal. Please dine inThe main Dining room!

2.0,7/17/2015,"So ironic a writer wrote to beware of gift card.  We had the same problem. We received a 150 gift card from our children and when I used it with my credit card for the balance of bill they said the gift card was for  75 not 150.  They told me to pay the difference and then if they made a mistake they would credit my card.  I said I was in no rush to leave and would text my daughter.  She emailed me her order  and receipt for 150.   After some hesitation , they apologized and said whoever made the card must have done it wrong.    Now for the food.  The dishes were well prepared but overpriced and very small portions.  Certainly satisfying but I had room for more.  Service was good.  And the breadbasket was great with broccoli rabe filled and a salami filled bread with an assortment of butter, olive oil and caponata.  My husband got the spaghetti, I was amused as it looked like it was emptied from a can.  Looked mushy and swimming in sauce.  He said the sauce tasted like it had butter in it.   He loves butter so that's ok.  We had a good time despite the gift card fiasco.  I had the Bronzino and it was a bit over cooked and dry on the edges and a few slivers of asparagus came with it.   The food is well prepared but this is one of those places you may go home a little hungry after a large bill.  But that is Typical NYC experience.  Points off for no table linens.  Tiny table for 2 with plastic placemats.  A nice white tablecloth would have gone a long way for the food price.  I know rents are high.  But 24 dollars for spaghetti with tomato basil sauce  that cost  maybe less than 1 dollar for the portion size to make is INSANE to me .  Not even a meatball lol and it was a small ,small plate of it .

It's a polished place where the waiters literally do ""dinner is served"". Was told that the Spagetti was the best in NYC by everyone at the table, so I had to try it, and indeed it was excellent. You won't fill up here, that's for sure.The ladies were well dressed and you were hard pressed to find too many guys even in jeans. The atmosphere was a bit more formal than most; however with a progressive feel and none of that stodgy old timeness.The menu is limited; however everything on there is a treat. The bread in the beginning is variable combination of different styles and by itself worth the trip. The truffle mushrooms were excellent as an appetizer (this coming from a person who doesn't much care for truffles, oh no!).The spaghetti plate was small as to be expected; however the taste was just smooth and exquisite. The perfect noodles with the perfect sauce. Feel to indulge.

5.0,6/28/2015,"This was probably our 9th or 10th time dining at Scarpetta, and even though it is aways absolutely delicious, last night was the best experience we have ever had. It was absolutely flawless, from cocktails at the bar all the way through coffee and tartufo for dessert. We started with the polenta with fricassee of truffled mushrooms, which is one of the greatest dishes we have ever had ANYWHERE. We followed up with the short rib and farro risotto, which seems to have been slightly reinvented at the restaurant but is still just as delicious as ever. We then split two pastas. First, the classic spaghetti with tomato and basil, which has such incredible depth of flavor and such freshness that lets its simple ingredients shine,. Second, the tagliatelle with goat cheese crema and spring vegetables, which was just the perfect amount of creaminess without being overly rich. It had the perfect bite of spring vegetables and mushrooms paired with (as always) flawlessly cooked pasta. Service was impeccable: our request for staggered dishes was followed without question, and a dropped knife we replaced in mere seconds. Scarpetta is truly a gem of a restaurant, and people who complain that the spaghetti with tomato and basil is ""too expensive"" or ""boring/too simple"" simply just don't get it.",4,0,0,Brendan T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0

Just walked in off the street for dinner and were seated immediately (in the café though because my coworker was wearing jeans and they probably found this too casual).

The variety of breads with spreads and sauces were to die for. My dinner guests and I all ordered something different and each really enjoyed it-- tomato and basil spaghetti, halibut, bass, and goat cheese pasta. All perfect. The only thing I would add is some freshly grated Parmesan or black pepper to the pasta. Dessert followed with mascarpone cheesecake and coffee. I can't say perfect enough.

My Branzino was good but slightly dry and my male colleague complained his portion was too small. The complimentary bread basket more than made up for the small (by Texas standards) portions.

4.0,6/9/2015,"I finally got around to trying Scarpetta after hearing one of my friends rave about this place for years. My only regret is NOT COMING HERE SOONER!Here is what we feasted on:- Creamy Polenta with MushroomsLet me just say that I have never ever ever liked mushrooms. I just can't get over the taste and texture. But since we were ordering to share, I had nothing to lose by trying - and instantly I was HOOKED. The blend of mushrooms with the creamy polenta below works so well, the perfect balance of saltiness and creaminess. It's almost like a really creamy mushroom soup, and I think the creaminess of the polenta is what made this dish bearable for me. A great ""introduction"" for me to start liking mushrooms, perhaps?- Scallops with asparagus and peasExcellent tenderness and freshness in the scallops and paired nicely with green peas and asparagus. - Beef short rib & bone marrow pastaI was expecting this to be similar to bolognese pasta, but the dish was actually more of a ravioli. No complains here - nice and flavorful but personally this dish did not stand out in particular for me. Still very good though!- Pineapple and guava ""soup"" panna cottaTo finish, we shared the panna cotta as recommended by my friend. To my surprise, the pineapple and guava ""soup"" was extremely refreshing, and the panna cotta was light and creamy.

5.0,6/2/2015,"This restaurant is owned by Scott Conant (one of the judges on Food Network's Chopped)  This is probably one of the best places I've ever eaten at and gives credence to the opinions he provides on the show.  I was first introduced to Scarpetta when I went out for a birthday dinner for my cousin. The restaurant doesn't have a flashy exterior but the inside is very modern and allows for private seating for an intimate dinner or a larger area if you have a large party.  The staff was very friendly, informative  about the dishes and most importantly very polite!I came back a year later for an anniversary dinner and was again very pleased with all the food.  We were promptly seated and the server offered great wine suggestions based on our taste and preferences.  We ordered the spaghetti (definitely must try) and the duck foie gras ravioli that night.  Everything was deliciously prepared and we ate to our hearts delight and left that night with full bellies and happy hearts.  It was a bit pricy but definitely worth it!I try to come back to eat here whenever I'm back in NYC. Just a few tips:1. Definitely make a reservation for this place early, it fills up quickly. You can try your luck to stop in and see if you can be seated, but be prepared for the possibility of a long wait.2.Try to share your dishes that way you can get a taste of everything.  The appetizers big enough to split between 2.  The first time I came here we ordered 3 appetizers and 1 main dish to split between 4 people which was still plenty of food.3.

Part of me was worried they'd cut back on portion sizes or quality or options but it was absolutely phenomenal. To start we had the Raw Yellowtail and Creamy polenta. Both were amazing but I much preferred the polenta. It was divine. The pasta course was the spaghetti and duck and foie gras ravioli. Good god who knew just plain spaghetti could be so rich and luscious and then don't even get me started on the ravioli. Yes it was a bit salty but that is expected and damn it was good!For the main course we both had the black cod. Definitely the least impressive dish of the night but still good. For dessert we had the chocolate cake with salted caramel gelato and the panna cotta. Chocolate cake wins by a landslide. The panna cotta was bland and nothing special. The chocolate cake was epic! almost a molten like cake but not and the gelato was a great companion.

They just need to adjust their server's or servers' training on attitude in the consumer world. 1) server:give up your rude attitude and telling your patron about drinking their wine 2) host: don't ever kick a patron off their table even if you needed it after 1 1/2 hours. I still had my glass of wine and the maître d came over and asked us to leave!! If you don't do it to celebrities, don't do it period...no restaurant would do that in Italian culture. - food was great: duck and foie gras ravioli and short rib were decadently tasty and presented. -Spaghetti was a take or leave it for flavor relative to the modern Italian cuisine-but still was really good overall. -The black cod was a well executed dish, but the fish itself could have been more fresh. -lamb was perfect...combined with that rapini it was very different.

I loved the pea sauce so much that I dipped my bread in it so I could savor every last bit! )-Buratta & Heirloom Tomatoes (can one ever go wrong with this classic combination? no. the answer is no.)For our entrees I enjoyed the Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli. Hubby had the Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti. Both were rich & flavorful homemade pasta dishes... heavenly. All pastas are made in house & you can taste the difference! I would highly recommend both of these dishes, though I suspect that the Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli is not for everyone. If you are on the fence, go for the Agnolotti. It's a sweet & savory dish, filling but not quite as heavy as the ravioli. Last but not least we split the Cherry Tartufo for dessert on recommendation from our server... it was out of this world. My husband loves Tartufo & he was raving about it being the best he has ever had! Highly recommend Scarpetta... fabulous dining experience!",1,0,0,Colby T.,"New York, NY",12,49,1
3.0,5/1/2015,"This place gets a 1 for service and a 5 for management.Went here with a group of 5 for a bachelorette party. We had a reservation but had to wait a half hour after our reservation time. Eventually the manager came over with delicious wine for our group to make up for the wait. Then we sat down and were brought complimentary calamari. I don't eat that but the other people in the group said it was very good. We ordered and when our dinner was finally brought to us, 2 people were sitting without food for about 15 minutes. When the last two people got their food, one of the orders was wrong, but they swiftly brought out the right order not even 5 minutes after we mentioned it to them. I got the spaghetti, which is supposed to be their signature. I honestly didn't think it was the best thing I've ever put in my mouth for $25, but it was tasty. Everyone else like what they ordered. When the check was brought out there was a mistake on the check which turned out to be a staffcommunication issue.It wasn't a horrible experience but I would not go here again.

2.0,4/26/2015,"So sad.  Scarpetta would be our go-to spot to celebrate - birthdays, new jobs, etc and we've been regulars for at least 4 years now.Unfortunately, with a lot of restaurants in the area, it's become a tourist trap.And they're more concerned with turning the table over and it's no longer about a dining experience.  We ordered a $200 bottle of wine, dessert and various different people brought us the check 4 different times.  Our entire dinner wasn't more than 2 hours.  On the third time, the manager insisted that he wasn't rushing us - and left us the check anyway.  Our actual waiter was very attentive and wasn't rushing us.Food was just ok.I hear that Scott Conant is no longer involved in this Scarpetta.  Not sure if that's true - but it's clearly suffered as a result if it is true.Don't bother - too many wonderful restaurants to go to in NYC.",3,0,1,Amy L.,"Manhattan, NY",11,18,3

The service was polite and friendly. We ordered the short rib appetizer (I believe it was about $20) and it came with about 1/4 cup of Farro and 3 very thin slices of short rib. The portion felt more like a tasting portion. I ordered the spaghetti after hearing such amazing things about it. It was just okay. I've had better homemade pasta, not even sure if it was homemade. And it was almost $30. For about 1 cup of pasta, just pasta. No meat whatsoever. Hubby got the veal and while it was good, it was lukewarm and again the portion left more to be desired.

When it became time to pay, I handed the server a $250 gift card.  A few minutes later the manager came over and said they wouldn't accept the card because of the previously stated computer issue and new management.  He displayed absolutely no sympathy and when my wife asked if he could check with corporate on Monday, he said he would but that he would only get back to us if they told him something different.  That response was so totally wrong...get back to us either way.  And, as we were walking out after paying, we realized he did not have our contact info and when we went back to give it to him, he again seemed totally disinterested...as we gave him our email address, he kept writing it down wrong...maybe it wasn't intentional but it sure felt that way.  I won't even go into detail about the other stupid things he said such as we could try to use it at the other Scarpettas in Beverly Hills or Fla.    Anyway, this happened on a Sunday and I gave it a day for him to get back to us.  On Tuesday I called LDV Hospitality, the owner of the restaurant and many others.  I told my story to the lady who answered the phone and she told me she would credit my credit card for the full amount...she had no questions or doubts after hearing my story.Despite the fact they made me whole again and the food was really good, my experience there was definitely a 1.",6,0,0,Lenny K.,"Edison, NJ",303,768,394

As other yelpers suggested that I try the spaghetti, I didn't fail to and it's really that good. Though I think the secret is to make is a little dry and more oily so the sauce sticks to the pasta rather than a watery mess that other places make.I also had the short rib agnolotti which was very nice but too much for one person since I was the only non veg person there.

5.0,4/13/2015,Excellent. Food and service were great. The bread basket alone set the tone for a stellar meal. The creamy mushroom polenta is divine. The short rib past is very good but not as good as the foie gras ravioli. Those were really special. Both were very fresh and light. The Halibut wrapped in lardo was really tasty. The coconut panna cotta with guava sauce was really refreshing and light. The espresso budino had so many layers of flavor. I loved it. On top of that the service was really attentive and warm without being over the top/all over you or snooty. I honestly don't get the few reviews talking about bad service. I did go at a early and less busy hour but I am a guy with full sleeve tattoos and a mohawk. They treated my gf and I incredibly well. For an upscale/modern Italian restaurant it still had the gracious and warm qualities of a family run place. I lived in Italy for 8 years and this was as good as any meal I had in Tuscany.

3.0,4/6/2015,"Still a three star to me.Came with a group and we shared a good number of dishes. If you're trying to decide between the tasting menu or just ordering a bunch of dishes to make your own tasting menu, I would recommend the latter.The polenta with mushrooms was probably one of the stars of the night -- creamy and balanced with the delicate mushrooms.The sweetbreads and short rib appetizers were both ok, feel free to skip. The halibut was wrapped in bacon and cooked rare. It wasn't anything special though.Skip the black farfalle, agnolotti, and ravioli. They were all fine, but the descriptions sound better than it actually tastes.The cappellacci was the other dish that we really liked. The mascarpone just melts in your mouth and the truffle adds that subtle pop that makes it taste special.The cheesecake was delicate and tasty. The semifreddo was ok, but not as good.If you want a four star meal, get the polenta, cappellacci, and cheesecake. So why three stars? We were seated about 45 minutes after our reservation because the party before us was not done yet. It just felt off that they would make the reservations so close together, especially for large groups. I also felt like we were being rushed during our meal. Our food was served very quickly and the plates were placed forcefully and loudly. And the dishes were taken before our last bite was even finished.

I normally bring friends and family who are visiting in town to Scarpetta, given the great quality food and wonderful ambiance. The bread is to die for! There is this one roll with cheese and salami, it is amazing. Although it used to be better 2 years ago, not sure what happened to the quality of it, but hey - it's free so I can't complain.My go to dish are the Raw Yellow tail for the appetizer, and the spaghetti for my primi. The Spaghetti is a beautiful dish, perfect amount of sauce, cooked al dente. I don't normally get order a secondi, I normally stick with just the pasta.

4.0,3/30/2015,"My first impression was I loved how much natural light was let in through their high vaulted ceilings with windows. It made for a relaxing and open atmosphere. Our waiter was friendly and joked with us through the whole meal. He also gave us good recommendations on what to order. I originally wanted to order the polenta along with our four pastas, but he suggested different appetizers to make our meal less carb heavy.Bread Basket - Best bread basket ever. Get extras of the stromboli bread which has mozzarella and salami baked into it. The kale and pesto bread was also delicious. The bread comes with dips of eggplant, marscapone butter, and citrus oil. Btw, the recipe for the stromboli bread and dips is online on FoodNetwork.Appetizers:Crispy Sweetbreads, swiss chard, baby turnip and radish & ceci bean tonnato - Great choice by my friend (and backed by the waiter). The sweetbreads were fried but not oily at all. Paired with the bean tonnato, it wasn't a heavy dish at all.Braised Short Ribs of Beef, vegetable & farro risotto - I wish they offered this as a full entree. The short rib was so tender, and the risotto was cheesy with a soft texture. It savory without being too heavy too.EntreesShort Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti, garlic chips & horseradish - I wasn't expecting to love this dish, just because I find short rib kind of boring, but this was so delicious. The meat mixed with the bone marrow provided such a savory, meaty taste. Probably my favorite pasta of the night.Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli - Also wasn't expecting to like this dish because not a fan of liver, but the duck and foie gras filling was perfect savoriness. Would order again 10 out of 10.Spaghetti Tomato & Basil - I guess I am one of the few unimpressed by their famous dish. The noodles were thicker, but $24 for pasta with sauce just isn't worth it to me. The taste wasn't anything special, but the texture of the spaghetti was better because it was hand pulled and thicker. Still I was disappointed, especially by the tiny quantity.Black Farfalle, seafood ragout, pancetta & herbed bread crumbs - Compared to the other pasta dishes, this one was a little bit lack luster, even to the spaghetti. Still, it was tasty. All of the pastas were good, but of course some I liked better than others.",4,2,2,Jocelyn K.,"Jersey City, NJ",479,885,4955

When our friends arrived the hostess immediately sat us at our table and from here on out we were literally like royalty. The staff here is very well trained and you will feel the sense that there is a team of people trying their best for you to enjoy your evening. I won't get to much into it...Our waiter said the the spaghetti is the best in manhattan. We ordered one for the table and it was delicious. I'm glad we ordered it as an appetizer as we discovered that none of the entrees are very large. It seems that almost everything we ordered was appetizer size. Regardless I will not take away from the fact that everything was delicious.We had the seared scallops, which were fresh and perfectly garnished. Seared on one side and decorated with a wonderful array of spices. The filet mignon was the star of the show. It was very flavorful and expertly cooked. The side of tiny-potatoes was cute. I felt like a giant at this restaurant :)All and all I had an incredible experience.

The Spaghetti is the star of the show - al dente noodles with rich tomatoes and basil and add some grated parmesan...mmmmmm. It was simple yet so sophisticated and it really is possibly the best spaghetti I ever had! I would seriously just stick to this dish. Some other items:Tuna Susci - very light and crisp.

5.0,3/4/2015,"I came here for their restaurant week menu and especially their spaghetti, rumored to be one of the must-eat dishes in NYC. It was the dish I was most looking forward to as spaghetti happens to be my #1 favorite food. Needless to say, I had extremely high expectations and boy were they met! The portion was small, but filling. The house made noodles were cooked to perfection with the familiar crisp and firmness that comes with the consistency that is al dente. In the past, I have had many tomato sauces that tended to have a stronger acidic kick at the end of a bite but the sauce in this dish had the perfect amount of sugar infused which balanced out the tangy tomato. To top it off, you are left with a mildly spicy aftertaste which is a flavor not normally added to the average plate of spaghetti. So, I did not have to add additional red pepper flakes. The subtle hint of basil was also refreshing. Lastly, the minute amount of cheese worked well to bring the pasta together as a whole so you were always left with the perfect ratio of sauce to pasta in every bite. With that said, everyone should try this dish once while in NYC. Bon Appetit!",3,2,3,Sheena Y.,"Manhattan, NY",241,3,1
4.0,3/3/2015,"For years I've been wanting to visit Scarpetta because of the numerous great reviews they had, including the James Beard award nomination for best new restaurant in 2009, and also being a huge fan of Chopped and having the utmost respect for Scott Conant. Unfortunately, he cut ties with the restaurant recently, but that didn't stop me from wanting to visit this NYC staple for Restaurant Week Winter 2015.The exterior of the restaurant is rather inconspicuous towards the West Side of 14th Street, but once I walked in I noticed how classy-looking it was inside. The lighting was very dim and the noise level was moderate. There's a bar to the right of the entrance and some seats and tables next to the windows. For those seeking a more intimate dining experience, the dining room is straight to the back.As for the Restaurant Week menu, I felt there was a good selection to choose from. For the appetizer, I ordered the Raw Yellowtail. The Yellowtail was extremely fresh and I devoured that dish quite quickly since it was a very small serving. For the entrée, I HAD to order the Spaghetti since they were known for their pasta. The Spaghetti came in a nice presentation centered on a big plate. Although simple, the Spaghetti was soft and very flavorful. It was perfectly simple. For the dessert round, I ordered the Varlhona Chocolate Cake. I'm not a huge sweets fan, but the cake combined with the salted caramel gelato just melted in my mouth. It was DELICIOUS with the chocolate butterscotch cream on the plate.As for the service, the food came out very quickly. Considering how crowded it was, that was a pleasant surprise. Despite losing Scott Conant to other ventures, the food for Restaurant Week was still excellent and worth every cent!",1,0,0,Chris E.,"Brooklyn, NY",530,1118,9624
3.0,3/3/2015,"My review is based on attending as part of the ""Restaurant  week"" crowd. I went here last night for dinner with a few coworkers. The assorted bread basket that was brought to the table was delicious. I enjoyed the option with salami the best. As part of the meals available for this special RW menu I had polenta (appetizer), organic chicken (main course) and panna cotta (dessert). The food was good but I was not fond of the service. Members of staff seemed too rushed even though there was a steady flow of customers throughout the evening. There were several times when either our plates were almost taken away in the middle of eating or they began cleaning the table while we were talking without as much as an ""excuse me"". At one point the bus boy picked up my friends phone from in front of her and moved it to the other side of the table without saying anything to her. It was just rude.

I personally had the short rib appetizer, which literally melts in your mouth, I was upset it was going to eventually be gone (LOL) the polenta, the yellowtail app were also fantastic. I had the black farfale for dinner, it was gone as quick as it came. I'd say the entire table finished their plates in 10 minutes or less. Not one word was spoken that's when you know the food is fantastic. As for the dessert the cheesecake was delicious! Overall, 5 stars I will be back.",0,0,0,Francesca A.,"Cedar Grove, NJ",480,10,3

Don't be deterred by seeing spaghetti as an entree, it's literally the work of the gods. Their bread deserves it's own paragraph entirely and the yellow tail (seasoned with only salt) was unreal.

We were seated almost immediately however, by the time we left at 8, the bar was packed & there was a wait for a table. The restaurant is dark and a bit on the heavy side. The tables are very close. In fact, in the middle of our dinner, an adjacent table was seated with a very large man. He was uncomfortably close to me to the point of being claustrophobic. It was also very loud. The food was excellent. I had the polenta  with truffled mushrooms which was like silk but it was definitely made with a meat stock. My friend is a strict vegetarian & they were happy to accommodate her with a large, beautiful salad which she raved about. We both had the signature pasta with tomato and basil. The homemade spaghetti was  al dente. The sauce tasted a bit raw but you absolutely got the hit of basil which I love. The cheese was said to be mixed in but I didn't taste it. I also thought the sauce was too starchy. The highlight was the warm chocolate lava cake with salted carmel gelato. Outrageously delicious!

4.0,2/26/2015,"Holy Cannoli (in my best Chris Farley voice)!  This place is good.  Very good.  You'll pay for it but definitely one of those TREAT YASELF kind of meals.  The vibe is romantic and trendy with dim lighting and music loud enough where you can't hear your neighbors but you can hear the conversation with your date.  If you're a party greater than two, you may be straining to hear people a few people.  Thankfully it was just two of us and I didn't have to find out.Obviously we started with the polenta which lived up to the hype.  Incredibly creamy and flavorful, this was a perfect dish to start with letting you know that you are in good hands for the night.  Clearly the chefs have a good handle on flavors and textures.  I would definitely order this again and I am going to strive to make polenta like this at home.  I love it when vegetarian dishes can make me feel this good.  Being that Scarpetta is known for it's pasta dishes we opted for two of these and then split a main.  We were very happy with them, especially the Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli, however we both felt that the chef had a heavy hand with the salt.  My mom always cooked with a lot of salt and butter so for me to say that means that there was truly an excess.  That didn't change the fact that I would 100% order that ravioli if I come back.  I just hope they dial it down a tad on the salt next time.  I've never had a pasta like that before and it delivered big time.  Not to mention, they do not skimp on the portions.  We probably got 10-12 ravioli which seemed pretty generous.  A high end place like this can easily get away charging $30 and giving you half as many.  Kudos to that.  On the other end of the spectrum, our entree was quite small for the price tag.  Luckily we were quite full at this point so the portion size worked for us but $50+ for two small pieces of meat was a little over the top.  The wagyu melted in your mouth though and the fatty cheeks were delicious.  Scarpetta finished strong in the dessert round with a wonderful layered coffee mousse with caramel and whipped cream.  A delightfully light way to close out a great meal.Service was very friendly and attentive and we never felt rushed.  I would definitely come back here, hopefully on somebody else's dime next time.",0,0,0,John D.,"San Francisco, CA",127,218,34

5.0,2/23/2015,"So happy I've finally got to try my #1 Italian restaurant on my list! Even a better pleasure that it's during restaurant week. From the beginning to the very end, everything was absolutely phenomenal. Creamy Polenta - their most popular appetizer. This was probably one of the very excellent polentas that I've had. It was indeed creamy and smooth, barely grainy like some polentas at other places. Also you'll catch a good taste of the truffle with mushrooms on it.Raw Yellowtail - another popular appetizer. Dabbed with smooth fine oil with pink Himalayan sea salt and red onions, delicious with the raw fish.Tomato & Basil Spaghetti - Scarpetta is highly known for this famous spaghetti dish. Was it ""whoa"" mind-blowing? No, don't expect it to be. Atleast to me it wasn't, because I was never one who's a fan of spaghetti or any tomato base pastas at all. But was it tasty regardless? HELL YEA IT WAS TASTY. For spaghetti, it's definately one of the best spaghettis I've had. Everything was fresh and divine, the sauce, herbs and even the spaghetti pasta noodles. Their spaghetti is different than others, it's a bit thicker but I enjoyed it.Duck & Foie gras Ravioli - this is the main reason why I always wanted to come here. It wasn't on the RW menu so we ordered that as our extra entree. It was rich and heavenly in each bite. I did imagine to taste a better chunk of foie gras though.Desserts - Nutella mousse tasted like a Ferrero Rocher. Coconut Panna Cotta, again was one of the better panna cottas I've had... And I literally order panna cottas every time I see it on the menu because I'm a fan of good panna cotta.. Somehow restaurants always F this sh*t up. But the grapefruit ""soup"" was not too tarty at all plus the coconut panna cotta was a delightful coconut taste with the perfect custard texture.For god sakes, even their complimentary bread basket they give you in the beginning is bomb! It's accompanied with olive oil, mascarpone butter, and tomato with eggplants on the side... One of the bread was fused with like salami and some sort of butter/cheese..? We licked every single plate clean between me and my date. I'll be back again. Excellent choice for restaurant week, but we were very full since we had 3 main entrees with two appetizers and the bread basket... I'm not sure if you'll be full not ordering extra, so just order that duck & foie gras ravioli too anyways to try like I did! :P",6,0,5,Monica P.,"Brooklyn, NY",432,222,440

We split a bottle of fruity white wine, for 40 bucks, pretty good for the price, but not buttery as the waiter described it. The complimentary bread was very good. To start we got the hamachi (amazing. Perfectly seasoned. Delicate and delicious) and we got the chickpea and sauasage soup (also delicious. Veggies were still firm in the soup and it was a perfect dish for a winter day) Then we got the famous spaghetti (pretty good but not the best ever. A bit of a disappointment) and the chicken with winter veggies (good flavor and tender, but a bit boring). For dessert we had the panna cotta (very good texture and a nice coconut flavor that isn't overpowering) and the chocolate cake (above average. A nice hint of salt.).I must mention that when we asked for the check they brought us one without the wine on the bill. We returned the check with (payment inside) as good citizens and the manager was acting like he was doing us a favor. Then the manager gave us our check but with 3 restaurant week price fixe orders instead of two. Plus my money magically disappeared. I said it was wrong again and sent it back, and asked for my money so then the waiter came over and gave us the same check with money bit still with the 3 price fixes.

Our server told us that he suggested that we order our entree with out appetizers because there would be a long wait in between if we did not.  The scallops came and they were a bit chewey and not so good.  The polenta was was very good.  Also we really liked the bread basket.  For our entrees we got the spaghetti and the gnocchi and the Seabass. All of this was very good as well. The menu was relatively limited and order based on yelp reviews as our server just said the spaghetti was very good.  The only problem with spaghetti is it had no meat.  Bottom line was good was good but felt like we were not welcomed there and was being pushed out.  The check came we signed it and he quickly came over to take his signed copy before we left.,1,0,0,Melissa K.,"New York, NY",118,5,2

The polenta was one of the creamiest I've had, and was quite delicious, but the sirloin, spaghetti, and brisket were generic and uninspired. They could have been interchangeable for any other restaurant's and certainly not the caliber of what I'd expect from Scarpetta. Portions are tiny and expensive, ranging from mid-20s to mid-40s. I'd say the entrees are boring. The desserts were quite awesome. Coconut panna cotta with guava soup: the perfect tropical and summer dessert. The banana bread and molten cake were great too.

Although it may not look like much when it arrives (because polenta literally is a bowl of mush), it is a savory and umami-filled stand-out on the menu. Don't miss the polenta - it's not overhyped at all. Other than the polenta though, the rest of the dining experience at Scarpetta just felt a little off. Maybe it's that hushed whisper that Scott Conant no longer owns the NY Scarpetta or maybe it has nothing to do with that at all but everything else about the night was just OK. I never thought I cared much for atmosphere in a restaurant but I surprisingly found myself thinking the atmosphere lacked in mood. At least it does if you end up sitting in the front of the restaurant - maybe it's better in the back. Service was prompt, food and water was brought out in lightning speed, and there are no complaints about the waiters who did their job well but I found myself thinking service lacked that personal touch. This doesn't sound like a big deal for most but in my humble opinion, sometimes you just have a better dining experience when you have a memorable waiter. Most of all though, this rating really comes down to not being blown away by our food. We got the duck foie gras ravioli and the short rib & bone marrow agnolotti. While both dishes were cooked perfectly and there were some really nice flavor components going on within each dish that I won't get into (because no one frankly cares lol), I didn't like that both the outside of both pasta dishes were coated in butter and took away from the real highlights of the respective dishes.  If you're a paula dean fan and it is yes to butter on everything for you including pasta, by all means, carry on. For me, I think there's a fine line to tread with butter, and after a while the butter sauce flavor got tiring and overpowering. The bread appetizer in the beginning rocks though. It comes with a mini trio of eggplant caponata, citrus and herb-infused olive oil and (yes) mascarpone butter - but this time the butter here is great because it tastes more mascarpone than butter.",5,0,2,Mich L.,"Edgewater, NJ",195,227,33

4.0,1/5/2015,"Made a reservation for 4 people @7pm still had to wait 15mins before being seated. Our waiter John however did a really good job explaining the menu. When we ordered he suggested to break up the primi and the pastas. So including dessert we had a four course meal set up. For primi we had the braised short ribs w/farrow risotto and creamy polenta. 2Nd course was more of the short ribs becuase they were amazing, spaghetti tomato basil(this will rock your world becuase it isnt like just any spaghetti) and duck foie gras ravioli (a bit gamey but If you like go get it). 3Rd courses were the turbofish, cavetelli pasta, lamb porterhouse, and beef wagu & cheek meat special. Dessert was the warm banana bread, coconut pannacotta, chocolate cake, and orange olive cake. Overall our waiter's service was wonderful, ambiance was perfect, food came in perfect timing. The only negative thing is anyone who wasnt the table waiter kept bombarding our table. We were asked if we would like still or sparking 3 times in a row. One girl who asked and we said just tap will be fine gave us an eye roll. Also the people clearing the tables were rushing, coming at the most horrible times.

We also told them we had to see Kinky Boots at 8pm and they served us at a hastened paste so we were on time. We loved the focaccia and flatbread that they served us. The short ribs appetizer was so tender and flavorful. The parents both had the snapper which they found delicately savory and cooked perfectly. The significant other had the sirloin which he thought was a little under cooked but accompanied by great sauces. I loved the duck foie gras ravioli which was perfectly balanced and rich.

We were given complementary champagne to celebrate which was so sweet of the staff.Started with the Creamy Polenta - there are no words for how smooth and perfect it was. Ordered a round of cocktails and I must say the Buona Pera is hands down one of the best cocktails I've ever had the privilege of drinking. Went with the Short Rib and Bone Marrow Agnolotti and Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli for our meals. Both were excellent, full of flavor, and mouth-watering. The Foie Gras was really incredible and (as per all Foie Gras) filled with strong flavors so I don't recommend it if you aren't comfortable with that.Ultimately we couldn't decide on a single dessert so we split the Coconut Panna Cotta and the Warm Banana Bread. Both were wonderful, but I was most fond of the Panna Cotta because it was unique and not easily found elsewhere! I'll be honest and say I was worried about being disappointing since so many places in New York are hyped up for no good reason but I was so happy with our experience!

2.0,12/24/2014,"I had reservations here for December 17th and was very excited based on multiple rave reviews for their vegetarian menu (my wife is vegetarian). I got there on time and was immediately seated on the table closest to the server station. The waiter was very polite and immediately got us the food and alcohol menus. We had to specifically ask for the vegetarian menu which was ok because I don't think many vegetarians go to Italian restaurants. The restaurant progressively got noisy and crowded and I joked with my wife about it being more like a bar than a restaurant as there were people standing all around with no apparent crowd control. People including the servers started bumping into me while I was seated which annoyed the crap out of me. I even said excuse me to a few of the servers which was funny because I was the one seated and they were bumping into me!Our server got us the bread and didn't pay attention to my earlier ask of the vegetarian menu.. There was bread with salami in it on the basket which shows they didn't care. We asked to change it and another server came by and referred to us as 'friends' while placing the basket in front of us (that's rather informal for an Italian restaurant, any who). I couldn't bear to sit where we were anymore so I asked for a table change. Our server said he would check for us and five minutes later got us our entrées...and didn't even heed to my request. He comes back midway through our meal and said that he checked and there is no table available (impeccable timing). We were in the midst of a subway like atmosphere mixed with a feeling of a cheap bar and the terrible service, the only saving grace was the incredible food. I finally asked for the check and I wanted to get out of there as fast as possible. While I was waiting we were sorrounded by servers gathering for some chitchat and banter about the girl sitting on the table next to me. And then came the final nail in the coffin..one of the servers dropped a wine glass and the glass flew about and pierced my wife's leg. And much to my surprise no one even asked if she was OK and went about cleaning it in a lackadaisical fashion (ok I understand you are trying to recreate a tiny Italian village, but you went too far)So yeah it was terrible..oh did I mention that the server was selling cocktails to us much like in a fish market",0,0,0,Aditya N.,"New York, NY",51,11,0

4.0,12/22/2014,"My girlfriend took me here one evening when I was in a terrible mood from work. The waitress was relatively accommodating and nice given that I was on the phone the whole time stressed out and did her best to serve us given we were probably one of the last tables for the evening and the kitchen was closing. The food was great but I don't think it was necessarily worth all of the hype. Atmosphere is perfect for a romantic evening and service was decent. I think they also have a pretty extensive drink selection that can make for nice get together with friends.Food:1. First, the complimentary bread was amazing. There were different kinds of breads in the basket and even one that had bacon(?) embedded within the roll. In addition, they provide three kinds of condiments with the bread: butter, olive oil, and a type of tomato and meat sauce in the middle. The bread and condiments both taste extremely fresh.2. For a starter, we ordered the Stracciatella which is roasted autumn root vegetables with truffle vinaigrette. It was something both of us had never tasted before, but was quite pleasant with a rich creamy flavor. 3. My girlfriend ordered the Spaghetti which comes with tomato and basil. Many have proclaimed this the best Spaghetti in Manhattan? I wasn't that impressed to be honest; it was balanced, but the noodles in my opinion were a little bit too thick, didn't have an al dente feel, and also the dish was somewhat lukewarm by the time it reached our table. Perhaps it was a bad run, and I'll have to get a second take, but I don't know what the hype is about their spaghetti. 4. I ordered the Short Rib and Bone Marrow Agnolotti. The mixing of both crispy texture on the top and thick, rich flavors within the agnolotti was quite interesting. I definitely enjoyed this dish. Similarly though, the dish came across a little lukewarm when I started on it, and I wonder if it might have been because we were one of the last tables of the evening. Regardless though, I still enjoyed the rich smokey flavors of the meat inside coupled with the al dente agnolotti exterior and the touch of crisp garlic chips on top. Unique dish that I would recommend! All in all, a great dining experience, but perhaps not lived up to the hype as proclaimed.",2,0,0,Kevin J.,"Manhattan, NY",712,246,1045

Scarpetta's isn't the type of bread you pick at while you wait for your server. It is the kind you savor and enjoy slowly along with a glass of wine. It's worthy of a pre-pasta carbo-load, especially because it's complimentary.Our meal was simple: spaghetti with tomato and basil and creamy polenta with fricassee of truffled mushrooms. The spaghetti was full of flavor. Conant infuses olive oil with basil, garlic and chili then adds the oil to the sauce near the end of cooking; the flavors are prominent but the ingredients don't interfere with the dish's texture. This is the only way I want to eat spaghetti. The polenta was warm, earthy and incredibly comforting. You'll feel full once you finish it, but you'll enjoy each bite along the way.We were at Scarpetta to celebrate our anniversary, and at the end of our meal, they brought out a plate with mini desserts and ""Happy Anniversary"" written in chocolate.

4.0,10/26/2014,"It's a Friday night. Kaliq (my husband) and I just left Top of the Standard (amazing) for drinks and had a late dinner at Scarpetta. We saw all the excellent reviews and decided, hey, why not? As soon as we walked in, the service was impeccable. It was packed, but our table was waiting in the main dining room. We can't comment on the cocktails, since we opted for straight scotch. We both ordered a macallan 12 neat, and they lost half a star for giving mine on the rocks and my husband's neat. (Who doesn't love a girl who drinks her whiskey straight?)For appetizers, Kaliq had braised short ribs of beef- have had better, this wasn't anything special. I had seared diver scallops- they lost half a star here because it was so salty! Our server was nice enough to ask us if we would like to order something else or if they can make the scallops again to our liking. We had to have the creamy polenta based on everyone else's glowing reviews - SO AMAZING, who doesnt love truffle? I would give this place 5 stars just for this 1 dish alone. Four our main course, Kaliq had the spaghetti - since everyone keeps raving about this dish. It was definitely a good spaghetti, pasta was perfect, just enough basil...not sure if I LOVE it. I had the short rib agnolotti- it was almost as good as the polenta! It was a burst flavor in every bite. Definitely try this place out!",1,1,1,Katherine C.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",57,27,0

The stromboli was absolutely delicious, especially with the marscapone butter spread. The olive sauce was great too. I didn't try the broccoli rabe bread, but my friends seemed to enjoy it. For dinner I ordered the spaghetti that I heard so many great things about. The pasta was very fresh, so the texture of the spaghetti was great. The sauce was simple but still yummy.

5.0,10/17/2014,"Bar none, the best place I have been to in New York City.  Been here twice. First, you need to secure a reservation well in advance, especially during the peak hours. The decor is exceptional, very modern and a great view anywhere you are seated. The service is equally as wonderful. Both times, our waitress was charming, likeable, kind and cheerful. The first time I went, had a bottle and we had the sommelier help us with choosing a bottle of wine. We pointed to a bottle that caught our eye, and he recommended an even better bottle, within our price range. It was amazing. It was a Venetian wine, Villa Spinosa, Jago Valpolicella Ripasso. The second time, had a glass of the pinot grigio, this was inexpensive (for the place), and very good as well. Both times, we chose the polenta with mushrooms and truffle as an appetizer. This was the greatest thing I have ever tasted in my life. There are really no words. The polenta is separated from the truffle infused mushrooms, and the waitress merges all the ingredients into a round dish. The taste is exceptional, you'll never eat anything as soft and great tasting. This was definitely the highlight and a must-order. I had to taste the infamous spaghetti. I ordered it both times and it is fabulous. Definitely lived up to the hype. While it is not as wonderful as the polenta, it is extremely fresh and very simply tasty. I thought it wouldn't fill me up, but it did. The second time, ordered the baby goat with broccoli rabe and pancetta. This was excellent. The goat melts in your mouth and the broccoli compliments it wonderfully. Overall, an excellent dining experience and I would definitely recommend.",0,0,0,M H.,"New York, NY",1,47,38

As I ordered the bartender asked me if I wanted a lime or a cucumber. Now that, my friends, is someone who knows their stuff. After light drinks we sat down for their taste testing chefs menu.

4.0,10/14/2014,"A girls night out with Carmen G. and Betty R. brought me here and though the evening started off on a low note, we left content and ridiculously full. We had an 8PM reso on a Thursday evening and upon entrance you can see that the place was popping! Al fresco dining was packed as was the bar. I was first to arrive and checked in with the hostess at approximately 745PM. We waited for a good hour or so before getting seated but seemed like that was the case with all patrons regardless of having reservations that evening. The front of the restaurant was packed with hungry diners waiting to be seated. As we waited patiently and a bit aggravated at the long wait, the manager came by to apologize and offered us a complimentary drink from the bar to help pass the time.  The gesture helped make up for the poor service and we were happy knowing at the very least they acknowledged the long wait and appreciated our business.Once seated, the dinner moved along just fine as we enjoyed each other's company over great eats. We started off with the Burrata, which was pure silky smooth and creamy and the Braised Octopus, which was cooked so tenderly, it could've easily melted in your mouth. The flavors were right on point as it was just right - not overly salty or sweet on either dish.For mains, I highly recommend their famous Spaghetti if you are a fan of simple, yet delicious, pasta. It was dressed perfectly with the right amount of sauce and the pasta was cooked al dente. It offered a nice bite and the perfect tang to make your taste buds go wild. For the meat eaters, definitely go for their pork chop! It was served in a very generous portion and was probably the most tender chop I've ever had. We also tried the Duck Foie Gras Ravioli which was a bit on the heavier side but a must-try if you are a serious fan of foie gras.If you do opt for one thing and one thing only, however, DO NOT LEAVE UNTIL YOU TRY THE PANNA COTTA!  This was by far the winner of the evening and was so divine, I could make a meal out of it on my own (some things are just not worth sharing!). Picture this: a creamy coconut goodness mixed with a guava puree and made into a gelatinous custard topped with fresh coconut sorbet that easily melts in your mouth and leaving you yearning for more! OMG!!! SERIOUSLY ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!!!!!Excuse me now as I salivate and reminisce over the yumminess of Scarpetta.",2,1,1,Diana P.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",51,263,1003
4.0,10/12/2014,"They lost a star, if only because the food was great, but didn't quite explode my brain (or taste buds) like other places have. We made reservations for four on the morning of, but there were only a couple of slots left (6pm and 8:30pm), so it's a good idea to plan ahead for this place. It was fairly empty when we got there, but filled up by 7pm. First - the bread. I'm not usually a bread basket hoarder, but holy cow, we crushed two full baskets. There was some nice and toasty focaccia and cibatta bread - but the real winner was the magical bread with the smoked mozz and broccoli rabe. I think Ryan ate the equivalent of a full loaf of those. ;)Started off with the polenta and burrata - both were great, but the polenta was especially tasty. Creamy, with the mushrooms giving it that savory allllmost-meaty flavor. I had the spaghetti, since I saw it on about a thousand previous reviews. It was fresh and delicious, but nothing to write home about. Ryan had the vegetarian mushroom dish - which was also good, but nothing too special. Dessert was the banana bread and lemon olive oil cake, both pretty amazing, soft and just the right amount of sweet.

Though the menu is quite worth it.The foie gras ravioli is something that can not be find everywhere -i think there are similar pasta dishes like that but this one was different- it is juicy and fresh and delicious. But the portion will be small anyhow. Apart from the pasta they have great braised short rib appetizer. If you are not a meat person though the polenta could be nicer. Octopus is another dish i would recommend which is quite crispy.As a main. the chicken is great. (said to be organic too.)Scarpetta has a vegeterian option as well which makes it even more praiseworthy.For dessert three options are really good. The light coconut panna cotta, the chocolate cake and the chocolate ganache bar. People say cheeses are also good.Wine menu is not so shabby. They have nice offerings of red wine and include a wide range from many countries -such as slovenia etc. which are rare to find elsewhere if you are adventurous.

My girlfriends and I came on a Thursday night for our 8pm ressie and this place was packed! Who knew so many people would be out on a Thursday night? We checked in at 745pm and waited... and waited. By 820pm, we inquired when we'll be seated and the hostess told us that our table was ""just finishing up dessert"". They probably noticed that we were annoyed at this point so the manager came over and bought us a round of cocktails. I'm glad they were able to recognize the problem and tried to rectify it by boozing us up. It worked. Less annoyed and appreciated that they extended the gesture to help smooth things out. After 40 mins, we were finally seated in a comfy corner by the kitchen. Our waiter apologized for the wait and made sure we were well taken care of. Very polite, humorous and pleasant. Now, onto the food!Burrata - fresh Italian cheese (outer shell is solid mozzarella while the inside is soft mozzarella and cheese) with slices of tomato. Really authentic and delish. The cheese just melts in your mouth. Braised octopus - ceci beans, olives, pancetta and smoked paprika vinaigrette. Love the tenderness from this dish.Duck & foie gras ravioli - marsala reduction. This was the least favorite amongst the table. The reduction overpowered the dish and couldn't really enjoy the other ingredients. Very rich and unfortunately, not our cup of tea. I wouldn't order this again.Speghetti - was it worth $24 for spaghetti, tomato and basil? Hell yes! I wish we ordered two of these and minus the ravioli. Now, everyone must be asking, how you can justify and what makes it so good? The handmade pasta was cooked perfectly. Al dente. It has the right amount of tomato sauce and sweetness. Basil was a nice touch to marry all the flavors together. Delicious and I literally can eat two bowls myself. Pork chop - huge! Super tender, flavorful and you would not be disappointed. Coconut panna cotta - with caramelized pineapple and guava ""soup"". Mmmm... was the first word that comes to mind and tongue. At first glance, you would assume the coconut gelato was sitting on top of guava sauce but looks can be so deceiving. Under the guava sauce, was the panna cotta. Nice surprice. No wonder it says ""soup"". You scoop everything together along with the gelato and chunks of pineapple and pop it into your mouth. Then be prepared to be transported to a tropical island and enjoying this delicate dessert on the beach. Who knew food can trigger so many senses.

After trying it,  I agree with Ted - this is amazing spaghetti.  It has just the right balance of sauce coating the noodles without drowning them, and a surprising depth of flavor for what is seemingly a simple sauce. It makes me sad I don't live in New York to get it more often. I also tried the chocolate cake with salted caramel gelato at the recommendation of both bartenders.  If you like molten chocolate cake, don't leave Scarpetta without having this dessert.  I was seriously tempted to lick the plate when I was finished.  The combination of intense chocolate in the cake,  the gelato,  and sweet / salty sauce on the plate was heavenly.I ate at the bar and was very pleased with the service from the bartenders.  They were friendly and attentive without being over bearing.

5.0,9/1/2014,"Fancy Schmancy restaurant in the Meatpacking District. I couldn't get a reservation on a Saturday night so I decided to walk over and hope for the best. It was packed. I asked if they had a tiny seat for a single diner and they found one for me. Thank goodness I didn't check out the menu before I asked to be seated because this was way out of my price range. What the hell! I've got a credit card! So, I went all out.I started with a cocktail called Il bandito which was a spicy mixture of peperoncini-infused montelobos mezcal, cointreau, lime, pink & black lava salt. It was pefect. I don't usually indulge in bread and butter, but the basket that was placed before me contained an unusual array of stramboli, rolls and baguettes. (My favorite was made with broccoli rabe) The tray of butter contained 3 spreads; a lemon infused olive oil, an eggplant caponata, and a mascarpone & butter mixture.  For dinner I choose the creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms as my primi piatti and capretto with broccoli rabe, pancetta & potatoes for my piatti.

3.0,9/1/2014,"Scott Conant should probably stop spending so much time in The Hamptons and more of it in the kitchen of his restaurant. While I don't think Scarpetta is a 'must try' place [unless you're a tourist and/or a Food Network fan], I would say it's worth a shot if you're in the area. Ultimately, it's just alright [3.5 stars] and not worth coming back to a second time. Scarpetta is a beautiful restaurant, the main dining room is very airy and lit mostly with natural light from a skylight in the ceiling. The dark woods of the furniture balance the rest of the space well. Honestly, I could have done without the table [and my left arm] up against the faux-wooden wall.Bread Basket [complimentary] with marscapone butter, grilled tomatoes, and olive oil: After reading so many rave reviews, I had very high expectations. Did the bread live up to the hype? No. Was the bread excellent? Yes. The Stromboli was nice, perfectly salted and the right size. The other pieces of bread were exactly as how they should be, either soft or hard depending on the type.  Polenta [$19]: I've had a similar dish at Boulud Sud, and while it's not entirely fair to compare the two, this was not the better of them. The polenta was creamy and the truffled mushrooms were tender, adding an earthy element to the dish. The sauce ribboned the polenta beautifully. It was good, but fell short of amazing. Like the rest of the meal, it could have used a little oomph and something more to cut  the richness of it. The waiter spooning the mushrooms onto the polenta for me- I'm an adult, I could have done this myself, thanks. Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli [$26]: You could tell that the pasta was homemade or at least in-house. It was soft and delicate, like a squishy pillow. The foie gras was only pronounced through the umami of the dish, otherwise you probably wouldn't have known this was a main ingredient unless you were told. The marsala reduction was suppose to temper the heavy pasta, but, again, needed more acid. A pinch of salt and pepper would've helped too. We skipped dessert as we weren't entirely thrilled with the first two courses. Il Bandito [$16]: The cocktail was probably the highlight of the meal and at an appetizer price, it better be. It was very spicy and in a good way! I enjoy a good mezcal drink and liked the black and pink salted that rimmed the cup. My friend ordered an additional appetizer, the Mozzarella in Carrozza [$16], the breading was crisp and the mozzarella inside was melted goodness. If anything, it resembled an upscale mozzarella stick. The tomatoes were somewhat of an after thought.Service was a little rushed, more noticeably from when we sat down to the time we got our appetizers.

3.0,8/18/2014,"This is your typical Meatpacking District restaurant. A little overpriced, mediocre food, trendy setting, decent service.Starter: Started with farmer's salad. It was extremely small. It tasted ok, was nothing special. The bread basket was very good, it's not just your standard rolls. There were rolls with meat and veggie toppings.Pastas: Came here to try the famous spaghetti. I seriously don't understand what was so special about it. It was fine, it was fresh, it was presented nicely. It was plain. Nothing to talk about. Also had the black farfalle - again, nothing special. This was slightly fishy but totally edible. What did stand out to me was the duck & foie gras ravioli. It had a wonderful flavor that just surprised me after the boring dishes I had before it. The texture was perfect. The balance of the foie gras to duck was perfect. This is definitely the dish to try here.Main: Had the pancetta wrapped pork loin. The pork loin was dry, probably because it was overcooked. Not impressed.The service was good. The hostess was friendly and offered to check in a large bag that I was carrying. She also brought me to the other members of my party who were having a drink. The waiter was attentive and gave a good recommendation on the wine. Overall, this place is just ok. If you're coming for the food, you may be a bit disappointed.",2,0,0,Amy Y.,"New York, NY",24,99,0

4.0,8/17/2014,"Honestly, only giving this a 4 because I like Scott Conant.  Was the food good?  Yes.  Was it memorable, not really except for the Duck & Foie Ravioli but I will get to that later.  Super crowded and vibrant on a Monday night but would you expect less being it is the Meatpacking.  With this being said, this restaurant epitomizes that area, sexy atmospherr and beautiful people translating to subpar overpriced food.To start, we ordered the fricasse of mushrooms w. creamy polenta and the burrata salad.  I only ordered the salad to complement the decadence of the mushroom/polenta dish.  Besides the average salad, I'm not sure where the hype of the polenta dish comes from.  Was it good?  Yes, but def not amazing.  At least for me, it was a bit underseasoned and tasteless.  For the pasta course, we ordered the lobster tagliolini & the duck & foie gras ravioli.  The squid ink taglioni was disappointing as a I found the dish very ""fisfhy.""  Albeit the lobster was cooked perfectly, I couldn't find myself finishing the pasta because of the fishy taste.  As for the ravioli, it was excellent.  The ravioli itself was delicate and the filling had a decadent foie gras flavor but without the over richness one normally gets from eating foie.  This dish is near and dear to my heart because I along w. Anita Lo and Scott Conant might be the only 3 people to create a dumpling/pasta filled dish w. foie gras.  It's nice to see other chef's interpretation and how beautifully executed the dish comes out.  Finally, as for entrees, we ordered the veal tenderloin and red snapper.  The veal was ok.  I honestly can't remember much of the dish.  As for the red snapper, I didn't try much of it so can't really grade.  Overall, food was ok, wine was great, service was speedy and hence the 4 stars.",0,0,0,Ricky C.,"San Francisco, CA",49,221,4

All pasta dishes were very reach and of good amount. Our server was very professional and friendly. Someone, I assumed a manager, came to our table for a recommendation of wine, and recommended us a very interesting and delicious sicilian wine which went very well with the food we ordered.FOOD - absolutely the best italian place we've ever been to. Not many things on the menu, but it has good amount of variety. Even the pre appetizer bread they give out was great great great.SERVICE - great service suiting to the restaurant. Loved our server, manager, everyone we met. Food and wine were presented very nicely.ENVIRONMENT - outdoor and indoor were both nice. Maybe not suitable for little kids.

5.0,8/15/2014,"When I first walked in, I was excited and I told the hostess that we were making a tour  of the cities best restaurants including several Chopped Judges restaurants, ""Last night we ate at Alex Guarnaschelli's BUTTER.""  The hostess said, ""He's great.""  I laughed inside but didn't correct her.  Not everyone working in the food business is a food network fan.  (see my review BUTTER for the details...Geoffrey Zakarian's The National is coming soon).Scarpetta has an understated atmosphere.  The staff are all dressed impeccably in their orange ties (which matched the leather straps on the walls holding up giant mirrors, which gives the room a larger feel).  Unfortunately, I was seated in the worst seat in the house, all the way in the back facing the glass wine storage room.  I spent more than a few minutes trying to read the congratulatory inscription on the double magnum (or jeroboam) in the window.  The staff knows their job and everything from the water glasses being filled to the pacing of the meal was perfect.Our waitress was amazing.  She was patient, knowledgeable and super friendly.  We could tell she was feeding off of our positive excitement.  We started with the creamy polenta and wild mushrooms.  It was delicious.  The portion size was big enough for my wife and I to share but that meant about 5 mouthfuls each.  None of the portions are huge at Scarpetta but it's not about the quantity here, it's all about the quality.  Our next course, at the suggestion of our waitress, was the spaghetti everyone mentions in their reviews.  It's pretty amazing.  The pasta itself is just a wonderful homemade noodle and the sauce is light and fresh.  The portion was the size of a baseball.  And at a price of $25, we felt is was easily worth it.  So delicious.When the main courses arrived, we hit ""next level"" territory.  I had the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti (like small ravioli) and it was terrific.  But my wife's Foie Gras and Duck ravioli was stellar.  Brilliant.  Amazing.  Fantastic.  I can't decide if it's the absolute best thing I've ever eaten, because I've had some pretty amazing meals but this dish was hands-down the best thing we ate all weekend and easily the best pasta dish I've ever had.  My wife heard the noises I was making while tasting her dish and she offered to switch plates half way through the meal.  I was in heaven.  Maybe it's because I love foie gras but the flavor was overwhelming.  Desert was a delicious but after the orgasmic pasta in the previous course, we were spent.  We shared the Amedei Chocolate Cake with salted caramel ice-cream and chocolate/butterscotch sauce.  A lovely sweet finish to an amazing meal.Cost Summary: One Maker's Mark, one polenta appetizer, one entree order of spaghetti shared as an appetizer, two pasta entrees and one desert came to a total of about $130 before tip.   Not inexpensive but we truly felt it was worth the money for such an amazing experience.Edited to add: Our amazing server was named Lauren.  She was terrific!",1,0,1,Alex R.,"Evanston, IL",0,16,3

The special was a (Australian) truffle risotto. No meat, and the secret price of the rissoto came to $50 when the bill appeared. Even worse, the portion was about 3/4 of a cup.

He seemed to get nicer after I insisted on showing him the opentable confirmation email stating 8:30.The service was quite slow and while I understand that being the case for the entrees given how full the place was, even getting our water seemed to take quite some time.And finally the food, rather bland and underwhelming.  We got the spaghetti and a calamari and vegetable dish to start.  The veggies were quite tasty but I cannot say the same about the spaghetti.  Now this spaghetti's sauce has been the golden standard in my kitchen ever since Anthony Bourdain prepared Scott Contant's recipe on one of his television shows. The sauce you get at scarpetta now is a phantom of that glorious sauce: you might as well make it home yourself.Others: - the cavitelli was okay and the lamb neck although was barely there, it was flavorful.- dinner mate barely touched her steak as it ""just did not taste good""- the bass was blan- as for desserts, the olive oil cake was so incredibly tasteless and lacking in that richness one seeks I.

4.0,7/14/2014,"I hate Italian food. But I loved Scarpetta. Let me clarify-- I hate the bastardized version of Italian food that you find here in the US, often made worse by places like Little Italy (in NYC at least) and families who slap together some spaghetti & meatballs or lasagna and call that quality Italian cooking. Most of the time, it's extremely fatty and extremely healthy, and in many ways the complete opposite of what Mediterranean Italian cooking really is. Scarpetta differs from these bastardized conceptualizations by providing more rustic and traditional fare (lob Perla into this new wave as well) by offering things that many would automatically discount had it not been offered by an upscale restaurant like Scarpetta. Case in point: the Veal Tenderloin. I'm told it's a recent addition to the menu, and it's not the veal that would scare your average everyday diner away, it's that there are sweetbreads on the plate. I gotta say though-- the veal came out room temperature, even a little bit cold, which was hard to eat and stomach. The sweetbread came out fantastic, along with the other veggies on this dish. My girlfriend had the foie gras ravioli, which, not surprisingly, was rich and decadent. We also figured we couldn't miss out on the spaghetti, so we ordered that as our app and split it. This spaghetti is spot on and exactly how spaghetti should be. Is it worth $24? Definitely not. Definitely, definitely, definitely not. There's no meat and it's just pasta with some sauce on it. So at the end of the day, I'd say if you were in the mood for fancy Italian and didn't mind splurging a bit, then try out Scarpetta. Otherwise, it's not a place I'll be going back to again.",3,2,2,Henry Y.,"New York, NY",376,801,1

However, I'm glad I didn't, because the amazing appetizers, main course, and dessert were still to come.  We first ordered the mozzerella in carozza, which was flavorful while still light enough to be a pleasant appetizer. For the main course, I ordered the spaghetti, which our server had claimed was the house speciality. I understand why--it was hands down the best spaghetti I've ever had. I don't know how I'll ever go back to eating regular pasta! For dessert, we ordered both a carrot and chocolate cake. Both were spectacular.

It's kind of an oxymoron but the decor is like a modern antique. I loved the natural light filtering through the ceiling, and the cute light bulbs too.Appetizers:I highly recommend the creamy polenta. Since I recently came back from SC, it reminded me instantly of gourmet grits! The waiter poured the truffle oil over the polenta and garnished with mushrooms. The cornmeal was super creamy, and the mushrooms and truffle oil provided an earthy balance. It was excellent! We also got the braised octopus, and while it was good, it wasn't as tender as the one from Taverna Kyclades.Entrees:Spaghetti. Such a simple pasta, but Scott Conant sure knows how to work his magic. I think the best way to describe this is ""simple elegance."" The first few bites are mediocre, but I slowly realized just how good this was. I never order spaghetti with tomato sauce because I've never had a good experience but this was, without question, the best spaghetti I have ever had. The tomato sauce was not overpowering, but rather complementing the pasta, and the basil added a nice pop of flavor. It's Scarpetta's famous dish for a reason!

While the food was definitely tasty, the overall experience was lacking. It felt... industrialized. As if no one really cared about me as a customer; as if these plates had been prepared a zillion times exactly to specifications; as if the food lacked heart and soul. There were also staff running around counting people in the dining room and hastily turning over tables. I know, it was NYC and we were there on a Friday night, but for the price you want to feel as if you are having an indulgent meal, not a rushed one. Having lived in NYC, Philadelphia, Boston, and DC, as well as traveled around the US and in Italy, I have to say don't waste your time at Scarpetta. Comparable food exists for much cheaper in many places, in restaurants where the waitstaff smile, welcome you warmly, and make you feel as if you are a valued guest, not just another customer.

5.0,6/21/2014,"IN SHORT: Pasta as good as it gets. Don't ignore the spaghetti or you'll miss out on a meal that deserves the highest praise, for any price, but luckily, Scarpetta falls within an indulgently comfortable zone.THE STORY: I would literally marry Scott Conant for his spaghetti. Never has any chef so deftly coaxed flavor out of simple Roma tomatoes, and I doubt any pasta dish henceforth will be able to live up to this. While the menu just describes the dish as ""Spaghetti, tomato and basil,"" the signature sauce also hits notes of red pepper, Parmesan, and salt that contribute to an elegant complexity that complements the rustic bite of the pasta itself.Scarpetta also impresses, though, because the other dishes manage to hold their own in the midst of expertly crafted pasta. The Raw Yellowtail is a favorite appetizer to share, with ginger oil, pickled red onion, and black lava salt that adds a fresh bite to the overall meal, while the Roasted Capretto with brocoli rabe, pancetta, and tomatoes also attests to Scott Conant's expert impulses in crafting nuanced, yet simply rustic dishes.The space itself is full of natural light casting in from the skylight-filled ceiling, and the service is as impeccable as much more expensive tasting menus across the city. While any restaurant that will synchronize the presentation of the meal by removing the lids of the dishes at the same time tends to automatically win my heart, Scarpetta's elegance, friendliness, and creatively thoughtful menu wins me over again and again.",10,3,5,Ali M.,"New York, NY",31,234,245

5.0,6/17/2014,"We went here for Fathers day and thoroughly enjoyed our meal.  Scott Conant is a great guy and really knows his stuff.  We ordered the markets salad and raw yellowtail apps.  The salad was exceptional and vibrant.  The yellowtail was good but had too much black lava salt on it, kind of over powered the fish.  The famed spaghetti came next and it is truly out of this world.  Home made spaghetti is awesome but it's the sauce that really makes the dish...sort of like the shoes make the outfit.  The spaghetti is a little pricey at $24 bucks but they use the finest ingredients and you won't care after eating it.  I have no problem paying top dollar for quality.  My main was the snapper, cooked perfectly and delicious.  For dessert we ordered the warm banana bread, ridiculous.  We will be back very soon!",1,0,0,Christopher P.,"Portland, ME",39,92,11

3.0,6/11/2014,"Came here to celebrate my birthday with my boyfriend after reading all the great reviews on this place. We had made reservations and were running a little late but were seated as soon as we got the restaurant. Luckily, there's a parking garage on the same block.For drinks, we started with a glass of white wine and a glass of whiskey neat. Wine and drink list were a bit overpriced for my liking but I guess that's what you would expect in a nice Italian restaurant in Chelsea.For our appetizer, we ordered the braised short ribs of beef as our starter. Definitely on the small side but the meat fell right off and the whole thing was delicious.For our entrees, I had the duck & foir gras ravioli and my boyfriend had the spaghetti that everyone raved about. I would give the duck ravioli about a 7 out or 10 and the spaghetti a 4 our of 10. I'm not sure what the rave was about for the spaghetti but I could make better spaghetti at home. The duck ravioli was amazing but so rich in flavor that it got a little hard to finish towards the end.For dessert, our server brought out a plate of different small desserts and a candle for my birthday which was a nice surprise and wrote happy birthday on top of the plate. This probably made my night more than the food did.Our server was great and attentive and the service throughout the restaurant was exceptional. Never was our water running low and if we stood up to go somewhere, our napkin was always folded by the time we got back.

3.0,6/11/2014,"3.5 stars.Came here for my fiancee's birthday dinner and had the tasting menu.Food was not groundbreaking but the spaghetti was pretty delightful. What I didn't like about the tasting menu was that some of the items were brought out at the same time. We'd each have our little tasting portion of a dish and then there'd be a totally different item placed between us to share. This didn't make sense to me cause I wasn't sure if I was suppose to finish my dish first and then eat the shared one (which would have turned cold) or if I was suppose to eat them interchangeably (which would have mixed flavors). I felt like on the courses where this happened, I didn't enjoy them as much.3 months later after having dined here, the only thing I can remember is the spaghetti which is not a bad thing. I'd come back specifically for that.The environment is what you would expect from a place in Chelsea. It's packed with loud-talking people and loud music.

5.0,6/9/2014,"Seriously P-A-R-T-Y in the mouth!First, whenever I'm in a restaurant I've never been to before, I like to ask to try something new, like a cocktail I've never had before. Our waiter suggested the San Remo, made with carpano antica, campari, st. germain, michter's bourbon. The carpano antica is a sweet vermouth that is good enough to sip on its own. The drink was dark orange in color, the campari bitter mixing with the St. Germain, which has neither passionfruit nor pear, grapefruit nor lemon flavor, yet provides a sublime taste that hints at each of these and yet none of them exactly (I borrowed this this description off the Internet - what a great description! drinkstraightup.com). Orange and grapefruit were what stood out. Clear geometrically square ice cubes - the perfect cocktail! A GREAT start to dinner!Started with the Braised Short Ribs Of Beef over vegetable & farro risotto - melt in your mouth mouthwateringly delicious! Batting 1000 so far!For dinner I read that the spaghetti was ""perfect"" in other reviews - so I ordered it, and concur. Wow! Elegant & simple - it was perfect!For dessert, the carrott cake -  robiola mousse, spicy pecans & roasted pineapple gelato - perhaps the ABSOLUTE BEST DESSERT I HAVE EVER EATEN! Seriously. The cake was served wrapped in a paper thin cylinder that had a chilli pepper spice, just a little heat to match the creamy goodness of the frosting on the cake.

5.0,6/6/2014,"When I look for a restaurant I make sure they have a great menu, a great chef, and great reviews. I also really wanted to go somewhere that had fresh made pasta and was elegant  and this restaurant def didn't disappoint.  When we walked in our table was waiting for us. This place is beautiful exactly what I expected. When you looked up at the ceiling it was glass and lit up with soft lighting just really romantic.  A lot of beautiful mirrors with leather holding it on the walls which I thought was really cool. Also there is a visible wine room in the back which is pretty impressive.I started off with a cocktail I had the Bolla Bacca its prosecco and wild strawberry liqueur it was delicious. Refreshing and not to sweet.  The bread basket was just amazing. I was at odds ordering apps because we ate so much bread. There were so many different types of bread Stromboli, Broccoli rabe, plain. They had the best eggplant tapenade along with butter and oil. Everything was seasoned so good I was so excited to eat more!  I order for an app the short rib with faro risotto. I never seen faro as a risotto before but I thought to myself OMG. Could this be healthy? Yea right lol.. I do know that it was so delicious i wish that there was more on my plate the short rib was falling a part and the risotto was creamy. I loved it. We also got fritto misto. That was just as delicious crunchy and lemony it was excellent.For dinner I decided to get the saffron cavatelli with oxtail. This is all new to me since I dont eat oxtail but I think it was just like short rib just a tad fattier. The dish had great depth in flavor the macaroni was perfectly cooked al dente there was tons of meat and the portion was perfect. It was beautifully prepared. We also had capretto (goat) with broccoli rabe and roasted potatoes. The bf said it was delicious. I didnt try it. I stick with trying one unique thing at a time :) For dessert we had to try two desserts and we settled on warm banana bread pudding which was the best take on it that I have tasted. It was moist and the the stout ice cream was creamy. The second choice was the Amedei chocolate cake and my god it was the best chocolate cake. It wasn't even sweet pure chocolate heaven. It had salted caramel gelato which went great with the cake and butter scotch AMAZING!

5.0,6/2/2014,"The five stars apply to every aspect of the restaurant. The food, the decor, the service, the food, the ambience, the food. It's true what everyone says about the spaghetti here. Impossibly perfect al dente, and the tomato sauce is so simple, but bursting with flavor. Conant and team do something different about the tomatoes for sure, as they have the slightest hint of sweetness, but you can barely tell because the basil stands out, just the right amount. While it's a small portion for its price tag, I promise you it's completely worth it. The other dishes were just as amazing. The short rib and bone marrow agnolotti is creamy but not heavy and a little sweet but not overpowering. The savoriness of the ribs and bone marrow pair so well with that sweetness, elevating the average pasta dish. We also got the creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms, which we scraped clean in less than 5 minutes. It bursts with such warm and rich flavors, and everything is just so creamy and smooth that we craved another order. We decided to try to add a little  To offset the carbs, we also ordered the crispy frito misto, which was basically a plate of lightly fried cauliflower, calamari, and eggplant. Everything tasted great together, and they seasoned it perfectly. Fail at trying to be a little healthier though; this is not your average veggie dish, but it explodes with flavor, so fuhgettabout eating healthy for the night. In addition to all that, we had our fill of seafood with a fluke crudo appetizer and the fennel dusted black cod. The fluke crudo was fresh and the accompanying oranges added a tangy twist to the entire dish. The entree we ordered was a perfectly cooked black cod - the meat tender and juicy, and the skin crispy and smoky. I'm almost embarrassed to say I'm not done yet :X The finale was the chocolate cake, but we replaced the salted caramel gelato with vanilla. My bf and I are a bit obsessed with the combo, but no doubt the original is just as delicious. So - that was a meal for just 2, but I'm sure that was on the heavier end.

For my main dish, I had the foie grais ravioli which was rich but so delicious. The three other people I was with had the spaghetti (sweet and simple), the linguini with lobster (light and creamy), and the short rib pasta (amazing). Everything was fresh and absolutely delicious.

The only complaint was that our table was near the front (by the bar) so it was pretty loud.Other than that, the night was almost flawless. The server was amicable. The bread service was delicious with the 3 dipping sauces. We 1st shared the fluke crudo. This was the only downfall of the dinner. The food was just mediocre here. I mean the fish was okay; it was just plain forgettable. You definitely need that orange and salt to brighten up the fluke.We ordered the Spaghetti and Duck Foie Gras Ravioli. We asked if we can create two portions of each so we each have 1/2 of the plates. However, the waiter kindly indicated that the kitchen doesn't do that. It's fine.THe spaghetti came in a cool dish with a glass cover on top to help finish the cooking. It was cooked to an al dente perfection. You can tell the spaghetti was freshly made because of its imperfections on the feel. It wasn't too tubular. The sauce was delicate and the basil leaves helped raise the dish to another level. It was simplicity at a perfection.The duck and foie gras ravioli was pillowy goodness. One delicate pressure made the raviloi explode in your mouth. It was salty goodness. Again the pasta was cooked to perfection.Honestly, the main dishes (meat & seafood) looked spectacular too.

Plating was very gorgeous and the arrive was very professional. Our waitress was very helpful in introducing the menu. My group was pretty biased though, having been at the restaurant a few times now and even at chain locations in Vegas. We ordered the sea bass, duck breast and the famous spaghetti. I have to say, the duck breast was my favorite, at medium, it was cooked to perfect tenderness, layover squash sauce with radish on the side. The portion size of all the dishes looked small, but it was surprising very filling.Somehow we were able to stomach in dessert, but had to split between 4 people. For dessert, we had the raspberry Napoleon cake, it was delicious. The cake had a lemony, sorbet taste to it that was light and refreshing. It was paired with wafer and cheese cake ice cream.Very much enjoyed my time there, but definitely go back again.

The braised short ribs were nice and tender and quite delish.We also has the saffron cavatelli and the gnoccetti as the second course.

1.0,5/8/2014,"A New Yorker who cherishes the staples of the typically overrated New York dining scene should revel in the mediocrity of this food and rudeness of the service. Yes, a true New Yorker will adore how some dishes are over-salted while others are unbelievably bland (my dessert was a ghost of a former dessert, haunting my plate with its insipidness and dry texture). They will be grateful for the service rushing their entire experience: thieving unfinished dishes out from under you, bringing out the next course before the previous is removed, and even removing your water from you to get you to leave after dessert. They have to turn those tables, you know. It's New York! The true New Yorker will love convincing themselves aloud in conversation that the food was excellent (a method to rid their impressionable mind of the unbearable cognitive dissonance such a highly-rated establishment has caused them). They will also appreciate spending $300+ in a matter of two hours and being treated as if they had spent $25 over the course of five hours, because that makes us true New Yorkers believe that a restaurant is ""important,"" like we believe jerks are cool in high school.Sarcasm aside, Scarpetta is a fetid shit of a restaurant; if aesthetics are Batman, it is Bane.

I've been here several times over the past few years and the food has always been nothing short of excellent. Yes, the bread basket is great and the creamy Polenta with mushrooms is out of this world, but I found the Spaghetti to be only ok. I've had this dish many times before and it wasn't as delicious as I've come to expect. My fiancé ordered the steamed Branzino and he didn't like it. I tried a small piece and it was tasteless and the sauce was rather dreadful. I would not recommend this dish. The bread basket is amazing. It's accompanied by three spreads with the olive oil being the best. I think it's imported from Italy. The eggplant caponata is great as well. The cocktails are really good here. I ordered a margarita Italiano and it was good. I ordered a limoncello for dessert and it was not imported from Italy.I was surprised to discover that Scarpetta has become a chain of sorts. They've branched out to other locations and it shows. The understudy at this location managed to botch the signature pasta to a shocking degree. Chef Scott Conant needs to drop by to see what's happening in the kitchen. Maybe they had an off night. I don't know. I've recommended this place to people over the years due to the great food and consistency of quality and service.

Scarpetta is a great place to go that's a little pricier than an average dinner but doesn't break the bank. I did have to make a reservation a month in advance but it was worth it. One minor negative is that we were seated in the front of the restaurant. Honestly, I think front of the restaurant should only be for bar areas and walk-ins.The staff is very attentive and our waitress was very helpful in deciding on our dishes. I do recommend going during the week to get the tasting menu, but we went on a Saturday night and were able to make our own ""tasting menu."" One of the main reasons I wanted to go to Scarpetta is for their infamous Creamy polenta. Until coming to Scarpetta, I have not been a fan of polenta. Scarpetta has definitely changed my mind and it was delicious! We also had the beautiful spaghetti and duck and fois gras ravioli.

5.0,3/29/2014,"I did my research before coming here so I had pretty high expectations, since many of my friends have raved about this place for a while now. I came here for my birthday (we made reservations about 2 weeks before) and when we got there the staff was friendly, and there was a coat check. We got seated 5 minutes later. The wait staff is extremely friendly and helpful. We started off with wine and since I'm no expert, I just said I wanted something similar to a Merlot and not too dry. I forgot what I ended up getting but it was delicious nonetheless. My friend and I went with the Mushroom Polenta for appetizer, tomato basil spaghetti and short rib agnolotti. The Mushroom Polenta was really delicious but a bit on the heavy side. We dipped the bread from their AMAZING bread basket into the sauce and it was really delicious.The Tomato Basil Spaghetti...where do I begin? Before coming here, I was expecting this pasta to literally take off my shoes and blow my socks off. I was not going to pay $24 for a little ass bowl of spaghetti. It was worth EVERY penny. The sauce is heavy on the parsley side but what makes the dish amazing is that their noodles aren't plain, it's almost like the noodles are a bit chewy and thick and seems as if it's been boiled with broth instead of normal water. The Short Rib Agnolotti was pretty good as well. The stuffing is wrapped in this extremely thin wrap and its a bit sweet. There's crunchy things sprinkled on top that makes for an added touch.Overall, my experience was amazing, and I will definitely be dragging my parents here when they visit so I can order 10 more things and not have to dent my wallet.

3.0,3/29/2014,"I love their food, especially their standout pasta. It's amongst the best, and their bread basket is pretty darn amazing and was really looking forward to treating my out of town parents and my husband for his birthday here.  But the stellar food was really dulled by the terrible service we received upon arrival. I had changed my original 6pm reservation to 6:30 to accommodate my husband's work schedule, had the email evidence, and Scarpetta called me the day of the reservation to confirm my 6:30 res.  When I get there at 6:30, they tell me that my 6:30 is not in their system, and the man and his three flanking ladies give me a hard time about the reservation time change like I'm the one who screwed up - opentable obviously lets you modify reservations and I did that a couple days ago so I don't know how I was at fault here. I showed them the email confirmation and my opentable reservation for 6:30 but still - no apologies on their part, just withering looks and blame on me, all as my visiting parents and birthday husband look on much to my embarrassment.  We end up getting seated not in the dining area but next to the bar where I think people without reservations get seated because otherwise, we'd apparently have to wait at least 40 minutes for a reserved table.  Despite the initial anger, as the dinner passed, I felt more disappointed than anything. I thought Scarpetta was a first and high class restaurant, somewhere I'd repeat and frequent for special occasions as I had only had really great experiences there before. But shame on the hosts for making us feel like we were second class. I really expected more.

4.0,3/25/2014,"I only knew about this place due to my once obsession of ""Best thing I ever ate"" where Tim Allen raved about the spaghetti. Before we get there lets just get right to it and skip past the creative journalism. If you are a fan of bread baskets, look no further. Scarpetta serves the best baskets of bread ever. Mainly because of its Stromboli bread which includes salami and mozzarella.Once you're past that, be sure to order THE BEST Polenta on Planet Earth. Creamy, buttery, topped with savory mushrooms. You'll question if you died and went to polenta heaven. Braised short ribs of beef. Very good and a worthy appetizer. If you're sticking to just one app, skip this and just have the polenta. The black tagliolini was good. Fresh seafood including shrimp, mussels and calamari. Special? Not so much. Spiced duck breast. Cooked perfectly on a bed of cabbage and other farmers market vegetables. The spaghetti. At first glance, I swear it looks just like Chef Boyardee. However, once you twirl it around your spoon and take a bite, you'll understand why this simple spaghetti is one of the best. San Marino tomatoes slow simmered with cloves and cloves of garlic. The texture of the spaghetti is perfect. Savory and hefty. Perfect noodles. Be sure to take your time with each bite because you'll be finished in 6 bites. Duck foie gra ravioli. These tiny little suckers pack a punch. Tasty but nothing to rave about. Coconut panna cotta is amazing. This is by far one of the best desserts on their menu.

5.0,3/21/2014,"I'm not messing around with this review. I came here for the $24 plate of spaghetti. Worth.It.I'm a huge fan of the Food Network's ""Best Thing I Ever Ate,"" and when Ted Allen told me about Scott Conant's $24 spaghetti, I was immediately intrigued and had to have it. I mean, it's one thing to make something awesome with a bunch of bells and whistles, fancy ingredients or throwing a truffle on it; it's quite another to take a simple dish and transform it into something transcendent.We walked in early, and who should we see looming (he's big!) over the hostess stand? Scott Conant himself!! I live in LA and see random celebrities somewhat frequently, but I almost fangirled all over my favorite ""Chopped"" judge. He's dreamy. Enough about him. We started our meal with a good but forgettable sashimi appetizer. Truthfully, we were just killing time until the main event.This is how you know you're The Man: Conant posts his recipe online, and yet it's still impossible to duplicate. Some say it's the quality of ingredients he gets, others say it's his technique of flipping the spaghetti in a pan with the sauce which allows each noodle to get thoroughly coated. Anyway, the spaghetti arrives (and by the way, just about every table is having the same thing), and the plate is beautiful in its simplicity. The best way I can describe the dish is that it has the feeling of spaghetti that has spent the night soaking up sauce so that it's been thoroughly infused with tomato basil goodness, yet has the freshness of having just been made. How does he do that?!?I would give this more 4.5 stars because the appetizer wasn't on par with the spaghetti, but we didn't come here for the appetizer, so I'm rounding up.Put this on your bucket list.",1,0,0,Mary H.,"Los Angeles, CA",268,147,187

4.0,3/10/2014,"I love Italian food and often find it difficult to order an exceptional pasta that can't be replicated at home - Scarpetta, was the exception! The ambiance was quite nice with a beautiful restaurant area and a great location in the Meat Packing District. Upon arrival, our table of four were seated promptly and offered an explanation of the wine menu and cocktail selection. One great thing about NYC - or the US in general, is that they offer a wide range of bottles from $30-1000+. This makes it nice to find some great value that isn't always available in Canadian fine dining for those who do appreciate a nice wine.  We started with the Maculan Brentino, a blend from Italy with a focus on Cab Sauv - nice and bold for the dishes to follow. We skipped appetizers, and to our luck we received a complementary dish of bread to start - something that I had been looking for on the menu, but was not apparent. The bread consisted of four different types, some with spinach and meat and others plain - absolutely delicious! As for dinner, the entrees included Gnocchetti and Black Tagliolini. My impression of the Tagliolini was unique and memorable - it is black in colour, from the dye of squid ink. It's truly something special that I have never experienced before, and the flavour is exquisite. To contrast, the Gnocchetti was good - but tasted of typical Gnocchi which is always rich and comforting in flavour (nothing new). Dessert, we tried the chocolate cake with Moscato - it was nice. Overall, great experience. Our service was excellent and the food was affordable. The only reason why I don't give this 5-stars is because some of the main entrees (fish and meat), did not appear to look that appealing and there was no classic Italian salad - caprese, or burrata - on the menu.",1,0,0,Tamara B.,"Vancouver, Canada",42,105,5

It opened in 2008 to countless awards and accolades under the watchful gaze of Scott Conant, a chef who many consider ""the king of pasta"". It took me almost an entire year before I was able to visit this restaurant, until I finally gave in and decided that it wasn't necessary to have a reason or excuse to make a visit here. Reservations were thus made for a Sunday evening, which is where the four of us found ourselves at the end of the weekend.The venue itself is gorgeous; elegant, modern, and spacious, the bar and a scattering of smaller tables are located towards the front, but our seats were thankfully located in the main dining area, underneath a beautiful glass ceiling criss-crossed by wooden beams. We were able to catch the last few rays of sun before it became completely dark, which set the ambiance throughout the rest of our meal. Although the menu isn't extensive, we spent a great deal of time going back and forth between our options, unable to choose between the tempting pastas and starters. Thankfully, our waitress was very patient and knowledgeable about the dishes, and was able to offer recommendations for all of us.To start off with: Scarpetta offers one of the most amazing bread baskets that I've yet to find in the city. Not only is the bread fresh and warm upon serving, but they have the famed stromboli bread, which is generously layered with slices of salami and mozzarella. The spreads we were provided were delicious as well; we had a good variety between the mascarpone, the olive oil, and a tomato-based spread that was studded with slices of eggplant. It's truly one of the best bread baskets you'll find in NYC.As for the actual meal, I decided to begin with the famed polenta. The dish sounds simple: a base of Bramata Polenta is topped with a fricassée of truffled mushrooms. The polenta is unbelievably creamy, almost bordering on silky texture, and is complimented even more with hints of parmesan folded in. Topped off with an aromatic serving of truffled mushrooms that add some earthiness and richness to the dish, each spoonful is just as delightful as the one before it.Thankfully, though, we still had one more course ahead of us. I had wavered a great deal between the pastas and the mains, but finally decided on the Agnolotti with Short Rib and Bone Marrow. The agnolotti itself was flawless: the skin is just the right thickness, neatly folded, and cooked to the perfect al dente. The pasta is finished off with a horseradish-based brown butter sauce and a handful of garlic chips. The first bite was an eye-opening experience, causing me to stare at my plate in complete silence as I tried to process all the tastes. Each agnolotti is filled with a savory, rich mixture of short rib and bone marrow and somehow manages to hold a small amount of jus. The slight kick from the horseradish adds some much needed balance to the plate and the texture from the garlic chips rounds out one of the best pastas I have yet to try.I had high expectations coming to Scarpetta, since ""the king of pasta"" is quite a reputation to live up to. I can happily say that Scarpetta met them; a combination of nearly flawless food, warm and professional service, and a beautiful ambiance contributed to a memorable dining experience. If at all possible: go here immediately. I can guarantee you won't regret it.",15,3,6,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827
5.0,3/3/2014,"This place is a real treat, if you've got the money this is the place to go for some real amazing food & service. The decor is stunning, the outside is so welcoming yet it really doesn't do itself justice once you get inside. The staff was very friendly and accommodating, they even got us the owners signature on his cookbook which was pretty awesome :). Food is definitely 5 stars worthy! Not that anyone would be surprised but still worth mentioning. You know your going to have a fabulous meal when your already in heaven with the bread basket and it's toppings ;). For an appetizer we split the raw yellowtail sashimi, it was amazingly fresh and melts in your mouth. For my meal I had the black pasta with seafood- it was very interesting, took my tastebuds some getting used too but it was really tasty & worth a try. I'm sure their spaghetti or meats would be a safer choice if your undecided.",1,0,2,Melissa L.,"Camarillo, CA",314,428,658
3.0,3/3/2014,"The food was really good.  I had the vegetarian risotto which was a tad salty but overall very tasty.  The creamy polenta with mushrooms was also really great.  Nice variety bread basket.  Nice selection of wine...one of my favorites Barbera D'Alba.  The low three star rating is due to the service.  We had Jean (?) as our server and he was extremely pushy and made it clear that he wanted to turn our table as soon as he could.  It was so obnoxious and definitely  put a damper on our dining experience.  Even after communicating to him that he was being way too pushy and to back off a bit he continued.  We expressed our disappointment to the manager on our way out and he could obviously care less.  He used the 'ol ""I'm sorry you feel that way"" line!  What a dweeb.",1,0,0,R C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1,8,0

4.0,2/20/2014,"Came randomly on a snowy day when everyone else was hiding in their homes. Coincidentally I got a window seat and watching the snow falling outside while feeling cozy and content with delicious food never felt so romantic before.The staffs are friendly and did a good job at recommending the dishes. I must say though it was a little overwhelming and my server tried too hard to sell. Kinda irritated me so I cut him off and said ""Sure, I know what I want, can we just order?"".I had the yellow tail and black pasta (check out the pics I posted) they are both wonderful and well cooked. Didn't get to snap a pic of my friend's food but in general I was very happy with quality, taste, and looks of all the dishes.I would def recommend this place for people who like Italian food. The decor here is classy and somewhat trending towards a more ""mature"" vibe. Wine menu is huge and comprehensive. Good for couples or small groups of people.",3,3,3,Vinci Z.,"Manhattan, NY",179,91,96
4.0,2/18/2014,"I was very excited to come here after seeing the reviews. Came here on a Monday night with reservations and the restaurant was pretty packed. From outside, it was an dark unlabeled restaurant. Only if you look very closely, will you notice the tiny sign that says ""Scarpetta."" It's a pretty long and narrow restaurant, a bar in the front, additional seating in the back. Inside it is dimly lit, soft music, a huge display of their wine cellar behind the back wall. Their staff is extremely friendly and maybe even overly attentive. I ordered a glass of wine, which was brought out in a small carafe. After every sip, they would run over to refill my glass from the carafe (same with my water). Ahh give me a little bit of space. Presentation of food 3/5For a restaurant of this status, I was looking forward to better presentationMy orders:Raw Yellowtail 4/5Fresh sashimi, very simple dish, the garnish adds a perfect touch. Polenta 5/5This was delicious. If you like mushrooms, you must order this. Creamy, lightly cheesy with an explosion of truffled mushrooms. GET IT!Short Rib and Bone Marrow Agnolotti 3.5/5Heavy, rich, not much bone marrow. Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli 3.5/5Heavy, rich, tasty, a little salty.For both the short rib and duck foie gras, I was a little disappointed. I don't think it goes well in an agnolotti/ravioli. Everything is pureed and it really destroys the texture of foie gras, short rib, and bone marrow. I personally prefer them separately so that I can appreciate the texture. Black Sea Bass 4.5/5Fish was flaky and buttery. Brussel sprouts, capers, and pancetta were perfectly cooked. Probably my favorite out of the 4 main dishes.Red Snapper 3.5/5In a sea-urchin-mussel emulsion. When I read this, I had a mindgasm. When the dish came, it was a little disappointing. Again the sea urchin was a liquid. I guess I should've known...""emulsion."" You still taste the sea urchin, but the best part of sea urchin is the texture, which you will not get to experience. The fish itself was not as good as the sea bass. A little drier. The skin was very crispy and perfectly cook. It's not fair to compare two different types of fish. Food overall was close to a 3.75. I was extra critical given its reputation. Service was superb, but some might feel a little smothered. They waitors and waitresses also speak very low, so don't come here after a loud concert.",0,0,0,Wilson D.,"Manhattan, NY",441,75,1
5.0,2/18/2014,"We had an excellent dinner at Scarpetta tonight, the service was attentive without being intrusive and the food was amazing.  We started with the braised octopus and the crispy frito misto which could not have been executed any better.  For the entrée we had the duck and foie gras ravioli, the short rib and bone marrow pasta, and the classic spaghetti and everything was perfect and exactly what we expected.  To finish the evening we had the sticky toffee tart and the chocolate cake both of which were just enough to cap off a great dining experience.",0,0,0,Justin N.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,17,0
4.0,2/16/2014,"I was visiting NYC to watch the Seahawks totally decimate the Broncos.  It had been awhile since my friend and I had been in NYC and we were both agnostic as to where to go for dinner.  I popped open my Yelp application and took a look at the highly rated restaurants within walking distance.  The result was finding this gem.  I started with the raw yellow tail.  Being from Seattle, I have a high bar when it comes to to seafood.  The yellow tail delivered.  The pickled red onion was subtle as not to overpower the taste of the fish and the dish was well presented.  Simple, yet wonderful.  For my main course I had the oxtail.  This was well seasoned and was well complemented with the bottle of red wine my friend and I shared.  I would visit Scarpetta again.",0,0,0,Brad Y.,"Seattle, WA",71,113,53

And I don't even like pasta much and I am dreaming of having this again); the calamari appetizer; and the branzino...AMAZING.  Even the fresh bread they bring to the table with this AMAZING caponata and olive oil.  Did I mention this place is AMAZING? :-)",0,0,0,Nicole M.,"San Francisco, CA",174,71,1
3.0,2/15/2014,"Solid negronis and amicable, attentive service - but sorry, I still like Michael White's pasta better.We started off our meal with the octopus and creamy polenta: the former was beautifully executed, perfectly tender to the tooth, whereas the latter was ""creamy"" as advertised, and likely a popular hit due to the essence of truffles oozing out from the mushrooms atop.The pasta, however, is what I came for.  The short rib and bone marrow agnolotti was deep and savoury, but lacking the sort of luscious decadence I was expecting from a dish made up of said components.  It was rescued nicely, however, by the contrasting textures and flavours of the horseradish and garlic chips, but still left me wondering if I should have ordered the duck and foie gras ravioli instead.The highly touted spaghetti, in all its glorious simplicity, was good, but not outstanding. I'm not exactly sure why this dish, as opposed to our other pasta dish, necessitated a cloche and table-side unveiling.  The spaghetti itself was nicely done and I can appreciate keeping the flavour profile simple and balanced - but I think all in all, the dish just suffered from under seasoning; the simple paucity of salt did not allow the few yet lovely ingredients from really singing out as they should have.  Would I come back?  Sure, if I was in the neighbourhood.  But if I was expressly making plans to enjoy some pasta?  I think it's clear that I have a few other options in mind I'd rather hit up first...",2,1,0,Dan T.,"New York, NY",111,430,157

Since I was a repeat customer, I went with the Black Taglioni with seafood and breadcrumbs this time...Delicious with the garlic, fresh herbs, fresh seafood, and breadcrumbs...the pasta is cooked just right, and will leave you wanting more.Side note, the duck & foie gras ravioli are also AMAZING but the dish is on the smaller / lighter side (if you are hungry).",0,0,0,Chris C.,"Jersey City, NJ",127,64,0

We started with the mushroom palenta which was so soft and delicious. The spaghetti with tomato and basil sauce made me rethink if my grandfather made the best spaghetti sauce I have ever tried.  The portion was more than I expected. Being a college student, I am used to large portions and these are far from large but big enough. Pricey, but worth it.  Only negative comment was due to the overly aggressive plate pulling servers. Clearly I did not finish my palenta so why would you clear it off?  It was a race to the end of the meal it seemed, but I guess they wanted to turn the table over.  I get I am not ordering 40$ a glass wine but don't treat me differently because of it.

I was glad I called because they actually had availability! So call if you can't book online!***I liked the look of the bar. The lighting was very dim.

I thought it was innovative and unique. My mom said it was the best snapper she's ever had!Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli: My bf got this. It was delicious. Had I been in a different mood, maybe it would have taken the top. I haven't had duck in a loooong time. I totally forgot what it tastes like.

To be completely and immaturely honest, this kind of pasta looks like maggots. But hey, aren't the weird foods always the delicacies! Spaghetti (tomato & basil): We ordered this for the whole table so everyone got a taste. One of the best spaghetti dishes I've ever had! I'm glad that I didn't get it as my main course though. Everything else was so much more interesting! But it was delightful. Very good.-------------------Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti (garlic chips & horseradish): Yeahhh, even though he was hesitant about the bone marrow, my dad ate this one all up on his own too... lol I'm sure it was good. *dolce*Chocolate Ganache Tart (sweet & salty cashews, peppermint marshmallow & earl grey gelato) ...I was intrigued by this description, but was worried about the peppermint marshmallows..

3.0,1/19/2014,"Could not be more ordinary, even writing this review makes me bored with how far off the mark the meal was from my expectations. The flaws were inane - calloused service from waiters who try to maintain airs, fanciful dishes which were merely fine and ordinary. The pastas were blah, at this price point I'd rather go to Babbo or Ai Fiori. Please, for the love of god, if you're a simpleton stop contributing. In what world is the attire here considered dressy? Maybe the main dining area is a bit more deserving of its fine dining aspirations but the front portion and the outdoor patio style tin furniture are just bizarre and leaves much to be desired. Ie so ugly.  Decent range of wines by the glass, capped out at $28 for a glass of Brunello which is about 40 euros a bottle at retail (haven't tried to cop stateside because my day to day choices max out at $15 a bottle.)The bread basket was fantastic and seriously blew expectations out of proportion. What's the rule for just having wine and the bread basket with spread at the bar? Because I would be all over that. Mascarpone butter is ace.We had the mozzarella and short rib risotto as starters. Still pretty happy at this point although the dishes were lukewarm upon the first bite and frozen before we finished. The cheese was fresh and paired well with the tomatoes. The short ribs and risotto is the winner of the two. My enthusiasm began to wane when the waiter came to check on us after the first course. He stayed for the praise but when we mentioned that it was strange that dishes were cold he was gone after just a grunt. Two from my party ordered gin and tonics; one was served with the tonic poured at the table the other was just served the made drink. Careless inconsistency. The entrees were dropped off by the back waiter without the waiter being present to present the dishes, which I think is a pretty minimal requirement for service. Typically I ordered the black tagliolini which was represented as seafood ragout and crispy breadcrumbs. Served with a plastic dome which I suppose had some function when it was conceived but just was ugly because plastic never classes up anything.not a crunch was had in the entire dish I kept looking for them however subtle they may have been maybe I was too clumsy to have detected the texture. Seafood ragout was absent save for some strands of squid. This is no match for Ai Fioris version. The red snapper over black rice was great if a little unsalted and i found the mussels to be kind of a pointless addition (what have mussels ever enhanced except frites). Bathroom situation was also pretty shabby considering. The faux gold faucets, while not the tackiest fixtures in the place (hello, mepa clientele) certainly didn't help any argument against Scarpetta as being kind of a classless place.",4,2,2,Jae Z.,"New York, NY",181,360,31

4.0,1/6/2014,"Brava Scarpetta for having an entire vegetarian menu and acknowledging that they can accommodate vegans. While you'd think this was a given in most New York City restaurants these days, that's not really true, especially not true in Italian restaurants. San Francisco is leaps and bounds ahead of New York when it comes to accommodating less conventional diets (meaning in ways that allow for you to still get amazing things on the menu that are not plain or yucked down versions of the so-called ""real thing."")I'll start with the bread basket. You should, too. Really! OK, so others have said it already and I'm not even going to pretend I wasn't a damn slave to that damn bread basket (nice of them to put the meaty bread in a separate vessel!) I mean... broccoli rabe bread. Have you ever????? Let it be known that I normally avoid bread baskets like the plague. I will say that I was not wowed by either item I ordered. Why still four stars? Because I take responsibility for making my choices despite my initial instinct to go with slightly more adventurous choices. Crispy vegetables app is a pile of deep fried zucchini, onion and possibly eggplant straws. It just wasn't anything special and I should have ordered the chestnut soup instead. If you're like me and prefer a more exciting option than plain old spaghetti with marinara sauce, don't believe the hype and go with a far more interesting option. I'm disappointed that I didn't take advantage of ANY of the menu items that weren't the typical thing you'd be offered in a restaurant WITHOUT a dedicated vegetarian menu. I feel bad saying this (and blame it on the fact that I expected to be reduced to a puddle of wanton desire over this dish), but that bowl of homemade spaghetti with marinara sauce is not all that special. And at that price - $22 - I was left scratching my head wondering what the hell I was missing and/or if most of the reviewers had never had a good bowl of macaroni and sauce before.The ambiance: dim lights that make everyone look beautiful... a restrained elegance without screaming trendy trendy trendy... romantic without being cliché or cloying. Yes, you deserve to be eating here. No privilege necessary. (In case you didn't know, this *is* the Meat Packing District, an area I rarely visit these days because I prefer yesterday's tranny hookers to today's desperately hip that flood the area). I daresay this is most likely the only restaurant I'd attempt in the area. The important thing to take away from this is, I loved everything else so much about the experience that I look forward to returning and trying menu items that promise to be as delicious as described.

4.0,1/1/2014,"Delicious food (vegetarian friendly), attentive service and a good collection of wines and scotch. We were a group of 4 friends there for an NYE dinner. Had a very good experience. Started off with the bread basket, the star of which was the cheese filled prosciutto bread. This is something I have not had anywhere else before, and I cannot recommend it enough!Appetizers: I believe they had a scallops special for NYE with pistachios (added a nice crunch to each bite) with a pink sauce base - very well cooked and presented. Tasty.We had the Crispy Fritto Misto, and the Creamy Polenta with truffle mushrooms as well, which were also big hits.Entrees: I had the Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli - easily the best part of my meal! Perfectly cooked, flavored, creamy. Highly recommend.My friends who ordered the Pork chops and the Spaghetti (with tomato and basil) were  also very impressed with their food!Dessert: The selection of desserts was 'interesting'. Not the typical plan vanilla desserts here. We shared the Amedei chocolate cake, which was nice. Overall, a nice place for some fine dining. Drinks and a full meal will cost you approximately $75 a head, but the food and the service is worth it!",1,0,0,Ankur B.,"Jersey City, NJ",5,2,0
4.0,12/31/2013,"KenScale: 8.5/10Scarpetta is a high-end Italian restaurant from chef Scott Conant. It is one of the few Italian restaurants in the city I visit every once in a while largely thanks to their incredible spaghetti with tomato and basil dish (more on that later). Aside from the spaghetti, however, I've had mixed experiences. On my last restaurant tour of 2013, I decided to go all out and see what the restaurant's signature tasting menu would offer. While the tasting menu at $89 per head didn't come cheap, I'm glad I went through this and discovered that Scarpetta is not all about the spaghetti.Scarpetta probably has one of the best bread baskets to start the meal so make sure you dig in first. The tasting menu started with raw yellowtail crudo, which was pretty tasty and refreshing without being overcome by flaked sea salt. Then came two hot appetizers, creamy polenta and braised short ribs of beef. Creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms was absolutely delicious, with great flavor and texture. Short ribs were also solid. Two pastas followed next: the aforementioned spaghetti and short rib agnolotti. Scarpetta's spaghetti has long been one of my top five pasta dishes in the city. I've never encountered a simple-looking yet so refined dish that could create so much pleasure to my tastebud. Agnolotti was also pretty good, not too buttery and having pleasant texture. The tasting menu had red snapper or capretto (moist roasted baby goat) options. I decided to go with the latter. The goat was so tender and worked harmoniously with broccoli rabe, pancetta and crispy potatoes. The tasting menu ended with chef's selection of desserts, which included an assortment of cheesecake and chocolate tart/cake with various flavors of gelato. Each dish was delightful, and capped an outstanding last meal of the year.As long as you book in advance, getting a reservation isn't particularly challenge, especially during weekdays. The restaurant is certainly not an everyday casual Italian joint offering food at affordable prices, so I definitely recommend this place for a special occasion to splurge. I liked the vibe of the dining room (elegant yet not stuffy) and the service was professional and attentive. Now that I've discovered which dishes are the strong points of this restaurant aside from the spaghetti, I'll certainly come back for more Italian delight.",3,0,2,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738
2.0,12/29/2013,"Oh, I wanted to love this place.  I really did.  My best friend and I were dreaming about coming for weeks, and I was over-the-moon excited about tasting the world's best spaghetti.So I will say up front: the spaghetti was wonderful.  It really was.  So was the duck fois gras ravioli--creamy but still with a hint of meat--and the roasted vegetable and burrata appetizer was light and delicious.  Our waiter was terrific in terms of steering us towards fantastic options while making sure we didn't order too much, and the stromboli breads were yummy; the rest of the bread was, well, bread.  The dipping sauces that came with them, though, were all fabulous.My downgraded rating doesn't have to do with the meal but does have to do with the service.  As some others have experienced, we had horrible service.  The food all came out too quickly (they brought our entrees literally while removing our appetizer plates), and the servers came over four times during our meal to ask if we were done when we weren't.  At one point, my friend had a forkful of the appetizer on her way to her mouth when the guy came over.  When she said she wasn't done, he just waited there, even though she still had several other bites left on her plate.  The same thing happened during the main course, when a server came over three times.  (I should say we were out of the restaurant in about an hour--even though we had apps, entrees, and a dessert--so it's not like we were just eating ridiculously slowly.)When we complained, both the waiter and the manager apologized profusely and genuinely, and the manager reduced our bill, which was really lovely.  I do appreciate the effort, and that was a nice gesture, but if you were asking me where you should have dinner, hands down I would tell you to go to Babbo instead for a combo of an incredible meal, ambiance, and service.",0,0,0,Elizabeth B.,"Watertown, MA",0,10,0

4.0,11/25/2013,"After discovering via online reviews that this place offered unique and delicious complimentary bread baskets approximately one year prior, I noted Scarpetta as a must-go place for a special occasion.  The opportunity arose for my significant other's birthday.  I made a reservation two weeks in advance, but still could not score the coveted 7:30 dinner reservation time.  Instead, we got there on a Saturday night for a 9:30 dinner.  Unfortunately, we were also stuck in traffic crosstown; please note that Scarpetta does not hold reservations for more than 10 minutes for those running late.  Luckily, although we arrived 15 mins. after our reservation (which they could not honor because we were late), they had another table open for 2. :)  From the outside, Scarpetta looks like another typical restaurant, but upon entrance the decor is quite welcoming.  Situated near the front is a bar to the right.  After the hostess greeted us and offered us coat check, she escorted us to our table.  I was really cold that day in my dress and didn't want to check in my coat, but she assured me it gets quite warm in the dining room.  Sadly for me, we were seated on the edge of the dining room and it was still quite chilly.  To compensate for the environmental temperature, I ordered earl grey tea (yes, before my meal), which definitely warmed me up quite well :)The main dining room of scarpetta has a glass ceiling that permits a lovely view, even at night time.  The sides of the dining room are lined with seats with booths, and the center are filled with tables.  I loved how they arranged four tables in a rectangular form for this party of 8 guests, and after that group finished their dinner, the staff rearranged the tables so that they were placed in diamond shapes (from my point of view)Food: Please note: the tasting menu is NOT offered on weekends (which I didn't realize)The bread basket assortment was as amazing as advertised.  My significant other loved the bacon and ham rolls. The restaurant also provides four different toppings for the bread -- our favorite from the night was the eggplant one hands down.For appetizers, we ordered the raw yellowtail and the creamy polenta.  They complemented each other very well. The yellowtail was freshly refreshing with its delicately balanced seasoning that just melted in our mouths.  The polenta was quite rich, but it was very warm and the mushrooms were a delight.  For our pasta, we ordered the short rib & bone marrow agnolotti.  It was quite good on the first bite, but the aftertaste wasn't as delicious.  The texture of the filling inside was smooth on the tongue, but it was too sweet for my taste. I wouldn't recommend this specific pasta for those who don't like overly sweet things.  We also ordered the cod as our fish dish and the goat as our meat dish (I forgot what the goat dish was called though).  They were both quite good -- I liked the cod more.  Sadly, we were rushed for time since we had other plans post-dinner.  For dessert, we ordered the coconut panna cotta. I would NOT recommend this dessert; it was delicious, but a little too ""soupy."" There were many other enticing options on the menu we unfortunately didn't get to experience this time.  Service: absolutely stellar!  Our waitress (I think her name was Anastasia), was very lovely and attentive.  When she was busy at one point with another table, another staff member came over to attend our needs. The restaurant also has candles to stick onto dessert plates and write ""happy birthday"" with chocolate syrup etc.  We had a very enjoyable dinner.Scarpetta is definitely a place to immerse oneself in the dining experience.  We definitely need to come back some time to better appreciate everything that this gem has to offer!",0,0,0,Jing Jing G.,"Manhattan, NY",88,65,12

5.0,11/10/2013,"A completely flawless experience from start to finish. Had reservations on a Saturday night at 5:30, coats were checked and we were seated promptly. The atmosphere was cozy but sexy. Modern furnishings with recurring browns and corals in the decor and staff attire. The place smells amazing. Like a savory holiday bakery. I kept smelling the candle on the table and the walls around me to try and see where it was coming from. I probably looked nuts but I would do anything to make my house smell like that. Did not order any wines, just sparkling water which was constantly refilled by the staff. Seriously, my glass was never less than half full. For appetizers we had the braised shirt ribs and the famous tomato and basil spaghetti. I myself walked in this place thinking 'how epic could spaghetti possibly be?'  Well Scarpetta and Scott Conant go beyond epic spaghetti! Tender, fresh, cooked to perfection, and full of light and sweet flavors. The braised short ribs also delivered, tasted wonderful and was just falling apart on the fork. For entrees we had the duck foie gras ravioli, perfect pasta with a rich filling. And the roasted chicken with spaetzle. Chicken was moist and had a crisp skin or crust. I ate it so fast I never bothered to figure out what it was. It was served over this sweet orange sauce, which again I never bothered to find out what was in it, I just keep going back to the bread basket to mop it up. Speaking of the bread basket, we devoured the first one before the appetizers came out. A crunchy crust with a light and fluffy sourdough was a highlight. But of curse I could not forget the Stromboli. It was a perfect blend of meat, cheese, and bread. Our waitress was kind enough to bring us a second basket to accompany our entrees  My favorite spread was the olive oil, which had citrus and floral notes in it. We saved room for dessert, which was equal perfection. I will dream about the chocolate cake and ricotta cheesecake for weeks. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the coffee - a little bit strong and bitter, and had an almost burnt taste to it.

5.0,11/5/2013,"I was beyond floored with the service and spectacular meal I received here.  This was one of the best experiences I have ever had in my life.  My server was fantastic.  Beyond friendly, bubbly, and kindly sent over the sommelier to recommend a bottle of wine.  He picked probably one of the most delicious wines I have ever tasted and was EXACTLY what I was looking for - and the perfect compliment to my meal.I started with the braised short ribs.  They were MOUTH WATERINGLY delicious.  It tasted like it had been cooking to perfection for YEARS and was plated beautifully.Next course we ordered the pumpkin seasonal dish and the spaghetti.  Both were delectable.  The pasta was obviously made with such care and was one of the most delicious things that has ever passed my lips.The chocolate cake with salted caramel ice cream was so delicious at the close of the meal I wanted to lick my plate clean-and I don't even like chocolate!  I wish I could have spent every meal for the weekend I was there here.",0,1,2,Hailey B.,"Vienna, VA",344,108,35
5.0,11/3/2013,"I got engaged here!  It was a magical evening!Now, even though you may not get engaged here it should still be a fairly magical experience.  Especially if you try the divine spaghetti.  I swear Scott Conant is some kind of pasta deity.At first we were a bit torn because there were so many amazing-looking dishes on the menu, and the prix-fixe tasting menu looked like a fantastic option.  In the end we settled on splitting two appetizers and two pasta dishes.  And dessert.  Plus cocktails, a bottle of wine, and two glasses of prosecco.We started with the arctic char tartare and roasted root vegetables.  Both were outstanding--the char was delicate and complimented perfectly with the creme fraîche and fish roe (although tip to Scott: maybe mix in a little finger lime--it'd add a wonderful zest and would be a play on the texture of the roe).  The roasted root vegetables were delicious and the truffle vinaigrette was a perfect dressing.For our main courses we ordered the tagliatelle with guanciale, vegetables and zabaglione and the simple but perfect spaghetti with tomato and basil.  Both pastas were perfectly cooked, and the tagliatelle was so rich and savory.  One of the stars of the evening was the spaghetti.  It sounds so simple, but I have never had a tomato sauce so rich and flavorful.For dessert we had a real conundrum--everything on the menu looked amazing.  However, our server steered us toward the chocolate cake and we did not regret it.  Nor will you.At this point in the evening I excused myself, went to the bar, ordered two glasses of prosecco and returned to our table.  I opened my heart to my wonderful, amazing girlfriend and presented her with a ring--right as the prosecco showed up.  She said yes (duh, I'm kind of a big deal--as Ron Burgundy would say) and then our server delivered an unexpected plate of assorted cookies and treats with ""congratulations"" spelled out in chocolate.All in all an amazing evening.  Go visit the pasta shrine.  You will thank me.  My only regret is that I didn't get to try the duck.  Or black cod.  Or pancetta-wrapped pork chop.  But hey, we'll come back for our anniversary.  Thanks Mr. Conant!",4,2,4,Nick H.,"Seattle, WA",150,467,81
5.0,11/3/2013,"Like this place needs another yelp review? It gets one anyway!Come here and get the pasta and red sauce at least once in your life. Its divine. My cousin got the beef with pasta, that was my favorite though. YUM! Everything is good, you cant go wrong. OH YA and the bread basket......#1 for sure! My husband got the rabbit and loved it. I couldn't quite get past the fact that it was rabbit, but I still tried it and it wasn't bad. The way they served us was like a dance, they brought all 8 of our plates at once an then in unison, lifted up the plate covers to reveal our beautiful dishes. I wish I was recording it. We ordered some great wine that they made sure we never ran low on. Service was top notch. Only thing I'd say is it was a little crowded for all of our tastes. The restaurant was jam packed and the servers had to squeeze by some areas, and our table for 8 ppl was a little short on space, but not enough to take away a star!

3.0,11/3/2013,"Came here for dinner one Sunday night for an early dinner with my boss and his family. We were seated around 5:30 with no reservations and the server was very professional explaining the specials and suggesting a bottle of wine off the list. The four of us decided to split the creamy polenta with mushroom ragu as an app, it was very good and was the highlight of the meal. The bread is baked in house and is also very good especially the Stromboli type and my favorite dip for the butter was the eggplant dip, very smoky. Onto the main courses My bosses mother had the goat and loved it, his wife had the rabbit pasta and it was very good, he had the short rib and duck fat stuffed pasta and really liked it except it was served warm and not hot.  I ordered the house specialty the spaghetti with tomato, after all this was the dish that put Scott Conant the owner/ of all Scarpetta on the map.  My spaghetti was very good, good texture and just enough sauce to cover the pasta.  My only complaint is I would have liked someone to ask if I would like fresh grated parm cheese. Overall good meal, service very polished, wine list impressive, but to many bottles over our spending limit. Would I go back?  Probably not, so many great dining choices in Manhattan.",0,0,1,Bill E.,"Bloomsburg, PA",176,474,1144
5.0,11/3/2013,"My fiancee had told me about having a good work dinner at Scarpetta, so a couple weeks back we came here on our own so that I could try it out. While I hear the back dining room is pretty cool - you're sitting under a glass skylight - we sat out front, which is a little more cramped in terms of space, but it doesn't feel like you're butting into the conversations of others. Service was solid overall, with water refills and food being brought out at the times you'd expect for a restaurant of this caliber. As an Italian restaurant, there's a very extensive wine selection; I stuck with a Lagunitas IPA, one of a couple of crafts that they have on hand for those who aren't going for the wine.Talking about the food, one has to start with the bread basket, in particular the with salami wrapped inside it. It's got a great taste, and with the other variations of bread, along with the various choices of what to put on the bread (tomato spread, mascarpone, or olive oil). For the appetizer, we went with roasted root vegetables, which seemed appropriate given the season. The truffle vinaigrette works well with the burrata to give the softened veggies a texture that mixes the heavy and the light, as well as a very homey, hearty flavor. We both ended up going for the heavier pastas (I went with the short rib and marrow agnolotti, while my fiancee had the duck and foie gras ravioli). I think the most unique part about both of these dishes - aside from tasting fantastic (of note is the marsala reduction in the ravioli, which adds really rich depth to the flavor of the ravioli) - was the texture. Given the meaty nature of these, the texture instead seemed to mainly be driven by the fattier parts of each dish, with strands of meat woven into the pasta. It wasn't at all what I was expecting, but it was delicious nonetheless. To balance out the richness of the pasta, we went with fish for the main course. The fennel-dusted cod had a very nice flavor and crispness to it on the outside, with flaky pieces of filet that fell apart when you took a bite. For dessert, we ended up going light with the panna cotta, which was covered in guava 'soup' (or syrup)...it's a flavor that works really well with the creamy cleanness of the panna cotta. Paired with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream, and you have a very simple, yet elegant, dessert to finish off a spectacular meal.I'd definitely recommend coming here to get an updated take on Italian food. It's not as classically driven as a place like Lupa, but it's extremely good in its own right and worth a visit. I'd love to come back and try more of the other dishes, in particular the pastas.",1,0,0,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",371,1653,169
4.0,11/1/2013,"Excuse the bullet points.- Came here on two separate occasions: graduation celebration lunch with my sister and a random dinner. Seated in the bar/dining area the first time, and seated in the back dining room the second. I actually prefer the first one, especially if you're just coming over after a day in the city and are dressed casually.- The food is very well portioned and the sauce to pasta ratio has been consistently good in my opinion. The portions are right, which I think is essential with pasta. It is so easy to have too much pasta.- I've had the house spaghetti on both occasions and while it's heavy with the basil, I think it is worth the attention. The sauce really is what makes it special. I wish the noodles themselves were closer to al dente, but they've been close to what I would consider 'bloated' on both occasions. Perhaps they don't take in the sauce as well if they're al dente?- The bread basket. I've only had one bread basket that trumped Scarpetta's and that restaurant is closed (Upstairs at Bouley). They give you three different dips/toppings, including the essential olive oil. It's tempting to just gorge on the bread basket, but please don't..- Scarpetta offers half bottles of wine, served in small glass decanters, which was a nice aesthetic addition to the table. I appreciated having the half-bottle option, for when one glass doesn't feel like enough but you're purposefully out to get tipsy/drunk.- The service was great both times. Patient, easy-going, and very helpful if we had questions. Not pushy, which is a huge plus in my book.",0,0,0,Audrey K.,"Oakland, CA",20,22,2

3.0,10/21/2013,"I had a hazy memory of an excellent dinner at Scarpetta years ago... but a sad attempt by me to recreate this memory led to a diminished experience.The warning signs happened right away, when after calling the restaurant to inform them we were running 15 late (a common courtesy most restaurants appreciate), a surly-tempered hostess hissed at me that they would give away our table if we were a minute over. When we arrived the same hostess then sat us at a table by the bar and not in the main dining room. It's the table I assume they hold for walk-ins (and other societal rejects). Whatever. I swallowed the snub although it discolored the rest of my experience. I was looking forward to the bread basket, but now even the stromboli tasted like ordinary Hot Pockets to me.We went with the mushroom polenta to begin (I concede this was good), and then I order the much-lauded spaghetti. So this $24, holy-grail-of-spaghetti arrives at my table with much fanfare, several runners, and a ceramic salver and dish cover. And it tastes like... SPAGHETTI! Sure its homemade and its got the right proportion of sauce to noodle. But we're talking flour, eggs, tomato, and basil, folks. This is not a $24-worthy feat of alchemy.Dessert was so unmemorable I don't even remember what we got. I will say that service was terribly bad in our little corner of DINING SIBERIA. We sat with empty plates in front of us for 20 minutes before the busboys remembered our table, and I don't think our espresso orders were brought out until we were halfway through the dessert course. The waitress must've sensed my growing frustration throughout the course of the night, because as she came by with our bill, she gave us a complimentary plate of biscottini. Or BRIBERY BISCOTTI, you might say.""Dog treats,"" my friend commented of the little plate of shortbreads and macaroons.

4.0,10/11/2013,"The food was all spot-on. We ordered the fried mozzarella app, spiced duck, tagliatelle with guanciale and seasonal veggies, and the banana bread. To start, the bread basket was great - I love how it's really a production and not a mere afterthough. Although a bit salty, the stromboli was SUCH a fun way to start a meal. The eggplante tapenade was my coworker's favorite along with the mascarpone butter. I was a huge fan of the citrus-infused olive oil so something for everyone. The mozzarella was clean, crisp, and light. This is not your TGI Friday's cheese sticks - it's an elevated and refined take (so TRUE fried cheesestick lovers beware). The duck was a perfect medium rare and the sweetness was an interesting yet great complement. I loved my tagliatelle although I would've preferred the pasta a bit more al dente. It was a little overcooked for my taste and I was a teensy bit disappointed, when the pasta here is the star. But the veggies and sauce were all so good I couldn't bear to send it back. The banana bread was good and the butterscotch pudding was AMAZING but altogether the plate didn't blow me away (gorgeous presentation, though). I wish I'd tried the coconut panna cotta. So many things were done well - and yet I'm missing the ""I LOVE IT"" factor here. I definitely would love to come back and give it another whirl - but just no spark (similar to how I felt about A Voce Columbus - great food, great execution, great service - but no spark).",1,0,0,Christine L.,"New York, NY",90,134,212
5.0,10/8/2013,"Simply one word to describe Scarpetta...amazing! First off the waiter was kind enough to tell us that one of the breads had salami in it which we politely declined and he said that instead he has a wonderful vegetarian bread. He wasn't lying when he said delicious. Stuffed with veggies (forget which one but was leafy) and mozzarella. Then to accompany the bread was a sweet and soft butter, eggplant in tomato sauce and of course olive oil. Now time for the main course. I had the black taglioni with seafood and he had the seared salmon over a bed of cous cous like black pasta. Everything was divine! The reduction sauce in my pasta literally melted in your mouth and the noodles were so soft. The seafood tasted like it had been caught the same day. After we got the chocolate cake with salted caramel ice  cream and it was just an explosion of flavors. All together  the meal was $100 which was a steal for such delectable food.

Speaking of butter knife--the butter and tapenade was amazing. I just wish the bread that came with it was better. But then again that would mean I would have filled up on bread and wouldn't have room for the amazing pasta. The 4 of us ladies ordered the: Pumpkin Ravioli--tasted more like a dessert. Good thing I was the last to try it in our rotation so I had low expectations. Black Tagliolini--this was really yummy with fresh seafood and didn't turn our teeth black!Short Rib & Marrow Agnolotti--(my order) This was yummy as well, but could get a little rich. I wish had some hot tea to go with it. My gf called it ""little pockets of yumminess""Classic Spaghetti--The fresh made pasta had just the right amount of bite and the sauce was divine. It was a simple dish yes, but still so complex. Dessert: We were going to be good and order the chocolate cake and raspberry torte, but our server advised us against the torte and get the banana bread pudding instead. I'm eternally grateful for his recommendation. Both desserts were divine and fighting for the #1 spot, but the chocolate cake was top down the winner for me.Was the place mind-blowingly good?

Yes, you can. Scarpetta was truly an amazing experience. First off, the space is amazing. Tables outside, few more tables at the front of the restaurant, followed by a very decent sized bar, and a huge dining room towards the back. The entire place is gorgeously lit. Dim enough for the lovers and bright enough so the regular folks dining don't feel awkward. I'm curious to see the space during the day because the back room has a gorgeous skylight that fills the entire room. Our server was extremely helpful. Though not the sommelier, he recommended a delicious full-bodied red which catered to my preference (dry) and my friend's preference (fruity). After ordering our apps, they brought us the bread basket - which was a meal in itself. Tip - skip the sourdough and immediately go for the meat bread! This bread was stuffed with salami, mozzerella, and tomato. Amazing!! Not that it needs anything else, but it was even more heavenly when topped with the egglant & tomato tapenade. If Scarpetta will allow me to order a glass of wine and eat that bread for an entire meal, I would be happy. For apps, we shared the raw yellowtail, braised octopus, and creamy polenta. The yellowtail was simple and fresh. The oil and coarse sea salt added a touch of the ocean, which complimented the fish nicely. The octopus was yums - loved the combination of the beans, olives, and pancetta. The dish that stole the show for me was definitely the polenta. The polenta was sweet from the corn and was soooo creamy. The accompanied truffled mushrooms were amazing - provided great texture contrast with the creamy polenta and the woodiness of the mushrooms were just perfect. Once the servers cleared our table, the entrees came. Didn't know when we'll be visiting Scarpetta again, so naturally, we over ordered. Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti, Spaghetti, Black Farfalle, and the Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli. Not gonna go into details, but Oh-Em-Gee... definitely the BEST spaghetti I've ever had in my life. The pasta was springy, the tomato sauce was perfect and buttery. As if that wasn't enough food, we also shared 2 desserts - the Ricotta Cheesecake and the Coconut Panna Cotta. The Panna Cotta was heaven! Layered on the bottom on the plate and scooped on the top, the panna cotta was creamy and bouncy. The guava soup was not overly sweet. Definitely one of the best desserts I've ever had. Must visit again!",7,2,4,Lily C.,"Manhattan, NY",166,257,274
4.0,9/13/2013,"Ate too much and felt like a fat pig walking out of this place, but I left wondering why it took me over a year to come back to this place after the awesome meal I had the first time.  We ordered too much and we ate too much.  Between the three of us we had two appetizers - the raw yellowtail which was probably the weakest dish out of the meal, the crispy frito misto which ranks up there as one of the best I've ever had and will likely serve as the gold standard in my head.  This was followed by three pasta dishes - black farfalle, taglioni, and the spaghetti - which I honestly have to say is one of the best versions of this humble dish that I have ever had.  (I am really gushing here)  Followed by one entree - fennel dusted black cod, which was neither here nor there.  Followed by two desserts - warm banana bread and the coconut panna cotta.  The food was superb and the sommelier recommended a great wine, but I do have to ding this place one star.  Why the F do you have to use these giant plates when you are trying to squeeze in so many diners into a cramped space and tiny tables?  Hey management - think about the fact that you are asking your patrons to juggle dishes at the table or have the food arrive at a different cadence versus what they would otherwise want.  I get that you want to have great presentation and all that, but seriously the food is so f'n good that you can put it on a paper plate and it won't make a difference.  The wait staff was absolutely phenomenal.  And by the way - don't even think about ordering the il bandito cocktail.  Just don't.  It's undrinkable.",1,0,0,Stephen J.,"Manhattan, NY",79,233,4060

5.0,9/3/2013,"Scarpetta was as good as it gets. My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary, and left very satisfied. First off, their (free!) bread basket is PHENOMENAL. Not your average basket of plain bread and olive oil, but stromboli with mozzarella, salami and tomatoes and other warm breads served with marscapone and butter, eggplant and tomato tapenade, and citrus oil. I got the duck and foie gras ravioli, which was excellent. Silky smooth and delicious filling, very rich. My boyfriend got the black farfalle with lobster and basil breadcrumbs, and we shared both. We liked the ravioli more, but the lobster also was succulent and fresh.For dessert, we had a hard time choosing between the warm banana bread and the amedei chocolate cake (I am a huge chocoholic). The waitress recommended the former and we went with it. It came with butterscotch pudding and chocolate stout ice cream and was divine, with a perfect mix of textures. Overall, a wonderful meal.

But oh the flavors.  We had the yellowtail sashimi and the polenta and mushroom appetizer. The sashimi tasted so buttery and fresh, the polenta a creamy earthy concoction, the free bread basket was delicious, cheese and meat bread was a bit much but the plain bread with the eggplant spread was amazing.For the 4 entrees, we each ordered and then took a turn at each dish and rotated.  The plain spaghetti and tomato was surprising; toothy pasta with a fresh tasting tomato sauce, by far the best if you wanted to eat the whole dish by yourself.  The lobster and black farfelle was very fishy tasting. The duck and foie gras ravioli was incredibly rich but flavorful; I could not have eaten a whole serving but a few bites was memorable. Finally, a fish dish which was good but unremarkable.Wine was incredibly expensive. $90 a bottle times two.The chocolate cake with sea salt caramel gelato was a winner, very deep dense rich and not too sweet. The raspberry cake was our guest's favorite, but I found it too sugary.Service was fast and not hovering although they did request that we order all at once when we tried to order the appetizers before deciding on entrees.

Taking a friend to dinner here will ensure fond memories of delectable Italian bites, top notch service, and some extra sweets to mark the occasion. For our gal's 30th, we had 2 rounds of prosecco and the braised octopus, special of the day burrata and heirloom, braised short ribs, and tagliolini to share. As we are 3 petite ladies and 1 vegetarian, the plates were more than sufficient given the richness of the plates. The bread basket, which I had seen reviewed well, was not all that interesting save for the bacon strips in some pieces. Otherwise they were actually a bit tough to chew. The octopus was perfectly tender and wonderfully smoky with excellent texture points for the bed of ceci beans and olives. Burrata was creamy goodness but the heirloom was poorly cut, merely prepared in eighths, which is hardly elegant, and the one stain on an otherwise gorgeous presentation. The short ribs were thoroughly braised and unbelievably soft on a stage of farro risotto, and the tagliolini was a star amongst overlooked calarmari, artichokes, and olives. The pasta here is not to be missed. We topped off the birthday girl's fete with the amedei chocolate cake which turned me onto butterscotch like I'd never known.

What's up with that? Did we not look rich enough? I couldn't help feeling segregated.- Service was uneven. They forgot one of our drinks and we had to ask for it. Also, there were two servers simultaneously trying to clear our table and serve our entrees, which caused some confusion and an awkward dance of arms and dishes nearly colliding.

I briefly saw that other Yelpers are also obsessed with this ravioli dish and it really is a must try!

4.0,7/22/2013,"I had the pleasure of coming to Scarpetta for a very special 25th birthday dinner with lovely company... which to clarify was in October!On a Saturday night this hip Italian restaurant bordering on the Meat Packing District/Chelsea/West Village line is very crowded and bustling! Despite one star off for the hostess in the beginning, I had a great experience overall. My aunt had called ahead and surprised me with a really lovely bottle of champagne for our table. What a personal touch!The bread basket given to every table is insane. It's filled with all different types of delectable bread and most importantly, the ""meat bread."" Yes a bread filled with delicious thin slices of meat freshly baked and still warm from the oven when it arrives. Ahhhhhh... that's good stuff.After you've finished off the bread basket, your attention should be diverted back to the menu so you can make some difficult decisions. For my appetizer I started off with the Raw Yellowtail (olio di zenzero & pickled red onion) as I knew I would be eating pasta later. That was my attempt at trying to keep it a tad light before succumbing into a food coma. The sashimi was light and the flavors were clean. For my main I had the Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli. If you love foie gras, you MUST order this dish. It is heaven wrapped up in house made ravioli drizzled with finger-licking-good Marsala reduction sauce on a plate.As birthday girl I requested a bite of everyone else's dish of course, which led us to order ANOTHER plate of the Spaghetti as it was just that damn good, haha. Other dishes that I stuck my fork/spoon/appendages into were the Creamy Polenta (fricassee of truffled mushrooms), the Braised Short Ribs of Beef (vegetable & farro risotto) and the Spiced Duck Breast (fava beans, wild mushrooms, radishes & foie gras emulsion). For the record, the Polenta is everything rave about and more.Now for dessert my friends brought cupcakes and cookies because they're awesome but we also ordered from their menu as well. The staff also brought me out a special plate of assorted sweet bites with ""Happy Birthday"" written in liquid chocolate (mmm liquid chocolate) and a candle to blow out. The macarons were perfection as were the rest of sugary morsels.Overall: loved the food, loved the scenery, loved the mood and I loved this establishment for my special dinner!Now straight up, Scarpetta is expensive BUT you are definitely getting your money's worth in terms of quality.

The duck ravioli, as I've already said, was very rich tasting and each bite was a little bit of heaven.  Of course, for me, the highlight of every meal is dessert and Scarpetta was no different.  The finishing touch was the amedei chocolate cake.  Not only did you get a rich chocolate case, but with salted caramel gelato, it appeased all the tastebuds.",1,0,0,Jacob K.,"Vancouver, Canada",68,82,1

5.0,7/6/2013,"We met up with some friends for dinner at Scarpetta. I didn't realize it was owned by Scott Conant who always seems to be on Food Network until after the meal, but any reservations I had about a NY ""celebrity"" chef were quickly put to rest by the fantastic food. The ambiance was nice, but nothing fantastic, it was very simple yet nice. The wait staff's attire reminded me of a cruise ship staff. Service was pretty good with what seemed like an army of waiters bringing out all the dishes simultaneously which I really appreciated. The only issue we had the whole night was our waitress forgetting someone's drink and bringing me a second drink I hadn't yet ordered. Or maybe I just looked thirsty to her, it was after all, super humid outside.I had two of the il Bandito cocktails which were a mezcal drink that was ""spicy spicy"" and it did not disappoint. It was indeed spicier than Geri Haliwell but still refreshing on a hot day.The food was of course the reason for going. From the outset it was fantastic, starting with a bread bowl which contained delicious stromboli and eggplant tomato spread. We then split some of the appetizers including the highly recommended polenta, frito misto, and the octopus that looked like something from 10,000 leagues under the sea or a sci-fi original movie, but was delicious. The polenta was also great, I hardly had any as I was so busy pretending the tentacle was attacking my submarine I missed out while everyone else grabbed it all. The frito misto was also very good, nice and crispy with a good amount of calamari in it.For the main course I got the duck breast and my wife ordered the duck and foie gras ravioli. My duck was nice and tender and went very well with the fois gras foam. I can see why he is hailed as the pasta king after trying my wife's ravioli. Tutti Bueno! So simple yet delicious. I'd go back for either for sure.All in all a fantastic meal and surprisingly not as overpriced as I would have imagined from a celeb.",0,0,0,Tyler L.,"Wanaque, NJ",195,1631,1308
5.0,7/2/2013,"A lot of celebrity chef restaurants are overrated, but this is the real deal. Perfect for a date night or business meeting, Scarpetta is all class with superb ambiance. If you love wine, you'll have a book to peruse but a sommelier will be happy to help you. If you prefer a cocktail, the bartender will make it just right. The high marks are for ambiance, staff and food. The bread basket is amazing, especially the stromboli. It's just the right portion for mouth watering satisfaction but not too much to fill you up. Scarpetta has some of the best appetizers I've eaten. The polenta is ridiculously good and easily my favorite. The braised short ribs, yellowtail sushi and beet salad are also served to perfection.Unfortunately, I can't offer any entree options outside of the Spaghetti because it's all I ever eat there.

5.0,7/1/2013,"I was in NYC for pleasure and I literally had a check list of places to see and experience.  This place was first on my list because I saw it featured on the Food Network on one of the ""Best Thing I Ever Ate"" programs. Corny that I saw them on tv? Maybe, but I'm SUPER STOKED I went there.I could have eaten my food and all of my friends' food by myself.  It was that good.(ps. I took my friend who was visiting from Italy - and even HE said it was amazing!)I had the DUCK & FOIE GRAS RAVIOLI!!

2.0,6/30/2013,"I have been to Scarpetta 4 times over the past 4 years and the food is as good as ever. If grading exclusively on the food then I would have given Scarpetta 4 stars. Unfortunately the service was quite bad during my past visit. Specifically, the maître d' did not seat us when 4 out of 5 people had arrived, and she conveyed the refusal in a most unpleasant manner. Then, after we had spent quite a bit of money at their restaurant, they employed increasingly ridiculous strategies to push us out. First they took all silverware (fine), then our water glasses (rude), and then finally they removed our placemats (seriously?!). This all happened in the span of 5-10 minutes so it's not as if we were lingering around for hours. I'm assuming the next step would have been to start cleaning the table in front of us but at this point my dining experience had been adequately tarnished that I just wanted to escape.If you want great Italian food then I'd advise you to go to Babbo instead; Babbo has better food and substantially friendlier staff.",0,0,0,Haakon R.,"New York, NY",4,11,0

4.0,6/24/2013,"Review #300!!After seeing Scott Conant on countless episodes of Chopped being hailed as the king of pasta, I've been dying to come to Scarpetta. I was afraid all the hype would leave me disappointed but I've actually never been more wrong in my life! The food was perfect!Between 3 girls, we split creamy polenta, the spaghetti, the duck and foie gras ravioli and black cod.Although I am not a fan of mushrooms at all, I forced myself to try the creamy polenta. Unsurprisingly I still did not enjoy the taste of the mushroom sauce, but the polenta was very creamy.The spaghetti was my absolute favorite of the night. I know you're probably thinking ""how good can plain ol' spaghetti really be'? I for sure thought that as well,  but this spaghetti was perfectly al dente, wrapped in a light blanket of spicy tomato sauce with fresh bits of basil mixed in. Apparently this is the pasta Scott Conant made to woo his lady friends in college. Consider me wooed.Not to dote on just the spaghetti, the duck and foie gras raviolis were equally delightful - smooth, rich and perfectly salty.I cannot rave more about this place...except that the service was ridiculous fast...perhaps a bit toooo fast. I felt it lacked that Italian homey feel where you're welcomed to stay for longer than you should.All in all, a perfect place for some ridiculously good pasta!!

Our fist course was the octopus. Cooked to perfection, not chewy. The short rib and bone marrow angliotte will be on both our lists for our last meal on earth, it was that good!

5.0,6/18/2013,"We will definitely come back if we're in the 'hood!  We showed up on a nice Wednesday night in the early summer without a reservation and snagged the last two-top in the bar area (which was fine with us, as we were dressed rather casually).  Love the bread basket.  It's amazing.  It's almost like a meal in itself, particularly the pressed panini sandwich thing (which has pork in it, and the server tells you when he sets down the basket, a nice touch for my non-pork eating friend).  And they serve it with three toppings -- the marscapone butter was so rich and light and buttery, I almost ate it straight, and the olive oil was super fresh and flavorful, some of the best I've ever had.  And the best part:  The bread basket kept on coming!  Whooo.  We shared 3 courses between us.  The first was fried mozz with tomatoes and basil = delish.  The second was the foie ravioli = some of the best pasta I've had in my life!  You can really tell that they not only made the dough by hand (and rolled it thin, so it was almost like a really good Chinese dumpling), but formed the ravioli by hand too.  Each ravioli is tiny, but they give you a whole plateful (like, literally, covering the whole plate), so you feel like it's a reasonable price (unlike other places were the ""ravioli"" is really just 2 ravioli).  The filling was luscious and rich, and decadent in the mouth.  Our last course was a fish (branzino, I think, but I forget) and it was also really good.  We had cupcakes already back at home, otherwise, I would have definitely wanted to try some of their desserts, which looked like super inventive combinations.  Service was excellent!  We weren't drinking, and we were sharing courses (e.g., low margin table) -- but they treated us really well!  The servers all know the food, even the bus boys.  Overall damage:  $75 for 3 courses, before tax and tip.  Totally worth it.",0,0,0,Olivia L.,"Palo Alto, CA",41,518,152

3.0,6/14/2013,"My low rating for this restaurant has nothing to do with the quality of the restaurant. I think it is a fine restaurant that serves fine food, but after going to Scarpetta on the strong recommendation of a friend, I was a little disappointed.Scarpetta has such a nice feel and mood. We were seated next to the window, which provided the perfect amount of light to an intimately lit space. The service was absolutely exceptional! Before you can want for anything, there is someone at your table ready to assist you. My waitress was incredibly helpful in selecting a wine and a entree. The bread basket is nicely done, as well. You're provided with several different types of breads that are warmed to perfection. While I intended to try the black cod, my friend strongly recommended the tomato basil spaghetti, for which he claimed Scarpetta is famous. In all honesty, while I think it is possible, Scarpetta failed in reinventing and complicating this simple dish, which is what I was expecting it to do for its ""famous"" dish. Sure, it was good, but at the end of the day it was just spaghetti. I will say, though, that the pasta was well done as the dough Scarpetta used is apparently made in house. The pasta is thick and tasty, and I enjoyed it. But if you're going to go to Scarpetta you're willing to spend a bit of money, so I suggest that you just go all out and try something more original and complex than the spaghetti.My rating is also low because I was served a serviette that had someone's hair on it. Absolutely unacceptable. It's all about presentation and quality when you're going to places like Scarpetta, so I wanted my rating to be reflective of this experience.I think that had I ordered the cod, as I had intended, my rating would have been a 4, so I definitely plan to go again and I suggest that you give it a try as well!",0,6,0,Brandon H.,"New York, NY",620,30,6

As others have mentioned, the bread is pretty exciting.I had: soft shell crab, which was beautiful, crisp, and cooked perfectly. The sauce was fine, but like I said, not amazing - just good. To follow: I had black farfalle with lobster. The pasta was a perfect texture, as was the lobster. The dish overall though was a little drab - not texture, flavor. I know most people don't agree, but this is what I found - buttery yes, but what else is going on here? My spouse had lamb ceci, and that did seem to be really excellent. Kind of kicked myself for ordering lobster just because it was there. Good.

5.0,6/10/2013,"Yay!Hands down, best dining experience I've ever had in NYC. I've wanted to come here for a while because on Chopped, Scott Conant is always so critical of the contestants' pasta dishes and I wanted to see if he could justify his critical pasta palate.I thought the ambiance of the restaurant was nice and homey and the chairs were quite comfortable, which I really appreciated. We were seated promptly, right next to the window, which I loved because I could people watch and my food photos came out much prettier (yeah, obviously I'm one of those people who won't let the rest of the table eat until I've taken copious amounts of photos; duh, I'm on Yelp).I was there with my sister and we decided to go all out for our meal. We started with cocktails; she got the bolla bacca, which was a strawberry flavored fizzy cocktail and I got the dimmi pesca, which was a peachy vodka-based drink. Once our drinks were on the table, we were brought a bread basket with three spreads: fruity olive oil, tomato eggplant spread, and mascarpone mixed with butter. The bread basket had a few different types of rolls, including a salami and cheese stromboli; all of it tasted fresh-baked and delicious.For our appetizer (primi piatti), we got the crispy fritto misto, which was like calamari 2.0; it had squid but it also had shrimp, veggies, and bits of fried sage and rosemary. The breading was really light and crisp.For our pasta course (paste), we shared the black farfalle. My sister said it was the best pasta she's ever had. Personally, I've been to Italy, so I couldn't say that exactly, but it was the best pasta I've had in the States. The pasta itself had an amazing texture - chewy and delicate - and the sauce was flavorful. The portion was generous with lots of lobster meat. And the basil breadcrumbs prevented the dish from being too heavy.For our main course (piatti), we had the red snapper in brodetto. The dish was brought to our table and then a tomato broth was poured around the fish. The snapper was cooked really well and the skin was nice and crisp. It was served over a bed of fregula (which reminded me of Israeli couscous) that had bits of crab and clams and mussels mixed in. It was really delicious.And then for dessert, we got the amadei chocolate cake. It was a flourless chocolate cake served with salted caramel gelato. It was so good. The cake itself was so rich and decadent. The gelato was amazing. The texture was smooth and creamy and it was quite salty, which made an amazing combination with the cake.As far as service, it was impeccable. Perhaps it's because we were there early (at 6pm) so the staff to customer ratio was quite large (mind you, there were still plenty of people in the restaurant that early). Our water glasses were constantly being refilled, our waiter was attentive enough to make us feel catered to without being overbearing, and the food came out promptly and at the perfect temperature.It was a pricey place, so keep that in mind, but I don't mind splurging on food every now and again. But if you have the budget for it, I definitely recommend it. Plus, after you eat, you can pop over to the High Line and walk off all of those calories.",4,0,0,Rach K.,"New York, NY",245,1067,853
3.0,6/9/2013,"I was looking forward to finally finding time to try Scarpetta after seeing all the positive reviews by fellow yelpers.  4 Stars for the ambiance & location in meat packing, but if you're actually there for the quality of food, I couldn't find myself giving anything but 3 stars.  First off, our table received the appetizer Soft Shell Crab and I had to ask the wait staff if we were going to get their ""famous bread basket"" that I've seen raved on yelp.  The Soft Shell Crab was by far the biggest let down, over priced even factoring in the ambiance and location, the crab was teeny tiny.  Most venues in the city would offer the same for 2/3 the cost and still be profiting.  Nothing special in flavor only plated beautifully.  I regret not trying their polenta dish.We tried the Foie Gras ravioli & Lobster Farfalle.  The lobster was not fresh.  The Foie Gras ravioli was too salty.  The portions as others mentioned were tiny, but the Foie Gras ravioli due to the heavyness of the dish was more than enough.  After our plates were cleared incredibly fast by the wait staff we waited over 15 min for a dessert menu to be served.  Needless to say I was completely disappointed with Scarpetta.",0,0,0,Stace C.,"New York, NY",651,303,2146

The head waiter wouldn't take our order until everybody was seated.  The waiters did not know how to handle a child's request for special food, the kid being allergic to a lot of food.  Because the line was full of waiting customers, we felt we were being rushed to leave our table, despite consuming 2 bottles of expensive Italian wine , expensive entrees and a total tab of close to $600.  I give it a 5 for food and a 2 for service.  I would not recommend the place to my friends.

4.0,5/14/2013,"I'm not sure if Scarpetta in Beverly Hills or Vegas are anything like this location - but Scarpetta in the city is surprisingly pretty casual and undeniably trendy. Not what I was expecting from a semi-fine dining establishment... That said, the food at Scarpetta is leaps and bounds better than restaurants in the surrounding Meatpacking/Chelsea area.Came here during their 5th anniversary celebration, as the restaurant was offering a special 4 course tasting. I liked that the special prix-fixe menu featured many of their most popular and renowned dishes, such as the polenta with mushrooms and chef Conant's spaghetti dish. Our courses were also paired with a complimentary wine flight / tasting pours, starting off with a crisp white with our starters, a fruity rose with the pasta course, a medium-bodied red with our protein entrees and a moscato with our dessert.Highlights of our meal included the luscious and creamy polenta served with that rich mushroom broth with just the perfect hint of truffle essence. My raw yellowtail starter occupied the opposite of that flavor spectrum, light and simple with just flakes of sea salt and some sort of a tangy relish on top. My only complaint would be that the fish was served slightly warm (or warmer than room temp) which made the texture of the flesh a little bit weird. Both pasta dishes we tried, the spaghetti and short rib & bone marrow agnolotti were good, albeit not exactly life-changing like the pasta at Marea. I liked the freshness of the tomato sauce in my spaghetti, with a pronounced basil flavor unadulterated by anything superfluous. The fennel dusted black cod was good as well, perfectly cooked to just a hair above medium and nicely seasoned. The bf enjoyed his duck breast as well, though I'm not sure I picked up on much of the foie gras emulsion. Unfortunately, neither of us had a choice for the dessert course - we both received the chocolate cake with salted caramel gelato and butterscotch at the chef's discretion. I personally liked the warm chocolate cake, but then again you can't really screw up a warm chocolate cake. As far as being a mini-franchise from a celebrity TV chef, Scarpetta certainly delivers. Although I won't be running back here anytime soon, I would be more than happy to come back to try some of the other things on their a la carte menu, such as the short ribs starter and the duck and foie gras ravioli.",2,1,1,Cecilia Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",762,644,43
5.0,5/14/2013,"There is no doubt, this place was one my highlights of my gastrotrip to NYC. I really enjoyed everything about it from the food to the decor to the attentive yet casual service. I ordered the scallops for apps and it was two huge scallops that were succulent and sat upon a green minty pea sauce. I also ordered the spaghetti. Do yourself a favor, just order the spaghetti. You won't regret it. Yes, there is a reason why Scott Contant is revered as the pasta guy. It is unctuous and delicious. I shared spaghetti plate with my guy. And for my main course, I ordered the duck breast with foie gras reduction? Three for three! The service was really spot on, very casual, friendly and did not give you that snooty atmosphere. I enjoyed everything and would go back there in a heartbeat.",1,0,0,Chee K.,"Portland, OR",82,313,298
4.0,5/9/2013,"Finally, after 2 other attempts, we got to dine at Scarpetta. We came in celebration of my lady's birthday, and bc she ""wants"" Scott Conant lol. The only downside to the evening was the the Chef's Tasting wasn't available. They were having a special Pre fixe in celebration of Scarpetta's 5th year. We started with the creamy polenta in a delicious sauce of truffled mushrooms. This was delicious!! Not the light start to a meal one might think of, but i feel it was the perfect app. Next, i had the tajarin with sweetbreads. I wanted to try the spaghetti with basil and  sauce, but i feel this was the way to go. I saw sweetbreads and was instantly sold. However, next time it's duck & foie grois raviolini. My girl had the black farfalle. i tried it, but definitely preferred my tajarin. For entrees i had the pancetta wrapped pork chop, which was cooked perfectly and tasted great. She had the lardo wrapped halibut with the smoked potato puree. I ate half of that bc she was full. lol. Not as good as my chop ;) her dessert wast the chocolate cake with the salted caramel gelatto (her favorite dish of the night). I had the warm apple crostata. ahhhh. The polenta and the pasta are tied for best dish definitely. I have to say, the bread basket was great too. i loved the stromboli!! One complaint i have is the amount of servers. You don't really get a chance to have one person personalize your experience. We had about 5 people, which was a bit much. Not a deal breaker, but 1 or 2 should be enough. It definitely was not cheap, but overall a good experience. I will most certainly be coming back for the chef's tasting next time. ENJOY!!!",1,0,2,Sebastian H.,"Kearny, NJ",740,297,398

None of the entrees really stood out to us, so my friend and I did a tasting of 3 pastas and split an entree instead- Spaghetti: sounds so simple but it was one of the best spaghetti I've ever had; the pasta was perfect'y al dente and the sauce was delicious. - Black Farfalle with lobster and pesto breadcrumbs: Anything with lobster is pretty much amazing, so they couldn't really mess it up. - Duck foie gras in ravioli: Great flavors but very salty and rich. I would not have been able to eat this as an entree on my own; thankfully we shared it- Spiced Duck breast  with foie gras emulsion: Tasty but the pastas were definitely the starI'd recommend skipping the entrees and going straight to the pastas and trying a range of them.",2,1,1,Jocelyn L.,"San Francisco, CA",507,1711,691

4.0,4/30/2013,"This place is very good, but very pricey. Good luck getting out for under $100 per person. Granted, we did enjoy appetizers, entrees, and a bottle of wine...but still.Here are my thoughts:Bread basket: Awesome. They bring fresh bread--ciabatta, focaccia, and something that had salami wrapped into it (so be careful if you're vegetarian). They bring good dipping options, too.Tuna ""susci"": If you get one appetizer, get this. It's really light and fresh and unique. Spaghetti: We couldn't bring ourselves to order ""just spaghetti"" as an appetizer, but we'd heard such good things about this dish, so we shared it as an appetizer. It IS amazing for ""just spaghetti."" The noodles are perfectly cooked and the basil is...zesty (and I never use the word ""zesty"").Branzino: I didn't even know this was sea bass. Glad I asked, and glad I got it. This was probably the most delicious fish I've had in ages. The crispy skin was amazing. My friend got the halibut and loved that, too. It's richer, wrapped in bacon (so be careful if you're pescetarian).Black farfalle with lobster: My fiance got this dish and I may have snagged a bite...or two...or three. If I ever come back to this restaurant, I'll order this.For dessert, they'll bring you a plate of mini tarts and whatnot. If you're not that hungry, this totally suffices to satisfy the sweet tooth. I'm not sure they always bring it though. We had already ordered desserts before we got this. We got the chocolate cake and some raspberry thing that I barely remember...or maybe it was lemon. The wine had hit me by this point. It was good. I remember that much.",1,0,0,Kim H.,"Capistrano Beach, CA",256,574,2
1.0,4/30/2013,"I think this dining experience was horrible.  It should be comparable to speed dating instead it was speed dining.  As soon as your folk went down somebody tried to pick up your plate.  And because there was so much help you had 5 different people try for the same plate or folk despite your protest with person 1.   So for spending over 350.00 dollars for two people (granted it included a good bottle of wine) one would expect more etiquette from the staff.Imagine ordering an extra dessert so you can spend more time relishing in some birthday experience with your partner.To be fair the food was excellent.  However the waiter did not listen to my partner who asked for well cooked duck and brought it raw.  Naturally, I sent my dinner back so that we could eat together.  When they both came out, hers was perfect and they forgot to warm my halibut. The desserts were scrumptious.  However, in spite of the fine taste, will not return.  Perhaps there should be a color card on the table and patrons can turn it over when plates should be taken back to the kitchen....",0,0,1,Maria S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0
4.0,4/30/2013,"Scarpetta, redux: Went twice in one night to Scarpetta's. How'd that happen? Simple. We made a pre-show reservation for 5:30 and decided to have the tasting menu with wine pairings ($145/pp) before seeing The Book Of Mormon. Finished all but the dessert course/wine when curtain time started to get discomfortingly close and so agreed with the server and captain that we would taxi up to the theatre and come back after the show to have our dessert course. What a great idea! It was like we'd already paid for the after-party.When we returned to Scarpetta's we were greeted enthusiastically by the waitstaff and front of the house folks and we were very excited to finish what had been a truly great meal with truly great service.But kerploooof.  Dessert failure. A total surprise. Total surprise because the numerous courses before the show were so spectacular. I mean really stellar. Let's start with the 4 kinds of house-made breads: an outrageously delicious selection that included, as our favorite, a stuffed foccacia (stuffed with house cured salami and cheese) that seriously rocked our world and could have served as the meal, itself, if accompanied by the luscious Barolo that was paired with a later dish. The bread was served with a trio of spreads that were incredible, from the mascarpone butter, to the simple lemon infused olive oil (my fave), to the Conant standout version of caponata. They were all mouthgasmic triumphs.The first official course was a combination of hamachi gingered sashimi with sea salt and a tuna sushi roll slice with mini-mushrooms, super finely diced veggies, and truffle oil. They were fantastic; the flavors perfectly balanced, and the fish jumpingly fresh. The wine pairing was a very serviceable prosecco.What followed was an amazing trio of dishes served with a wonderful Nebbiolo: Coming out together were small servings of delicately fried smoked mozzarella with roasted cherry tomatoes and basil; melt in your mouth slices of the best braised short ribs we've ever had, sitting over a mouth tingling bed of faro (!), and a dish of creamilicious polenta accompanied with a wild mushroom and delicate truffle sauce. All three, absolutely rave-worthy.The next course was a duo of house-made pastas, both of which were out of this world good.  While they called the swirl of spaghetti with a stunningly simple tomato and garden fresh basil sauce their signature dish, we were totally were blown away by the agnolotti with pate stuffing, which was topped with garlic bread crumbs.  And we loved the incredible Tuscan Rosso di Montalcino wine pairing. The main course was next: My honey chose the Black Cod served with Soave Classico. She couldn't stop talking about how superb the fish was. But I thought I won the ""whose entree was best"" contest when I ordered what I always will order when I see it on the menu: the duck dish. This one was grilled medium rare and prepared with black trumpet mushrooms, fava beans, radishes and a foie gras emulsion. Cut-able with my fork, it was probably the best duck I've ever tasted in my whole duck-tasting life. It was matched perfectly with a Barolo by Massolino. And in retrospect, we should have shot ourselves then. We would have died the happiest people in the world. . . . But we didn't.Instead, as I said, lo, these many paragraphs ago, we came back for what was described as a ""Chef's Selection of Desserts"" which was served with a nice Moscato wine. And the wine was fine. The chef's selection of desserts, however, was not at all fine.Both the desserts were failures, my panna cotta with mango sauce more a failure then the creative, but not-really-working together black pepper ice cream sitting in what you'd probably call a strained fruit brodo with chopped rhubarb, celery and berries of some kind (no one told us what kind, exactly, and frankly after a few tastes we didn't want to know). Also incorporated within the dish were a few dollups of  whip cream or creme fraiche or something white and puffy. My panna cotta didn't work because the thick mango sauce was blah but overwhelming of every other taste in the dish. It was like drinking a cup of thickened melted mango lollipop that had some indistinguishable pudding lumps in it. Not something you'd want to taste again.So what to do, and how to rate such a dinner. For 90% of the meal it was absolutely and positively the quality of a 2 star Michelin restaurant. But it ended, while we were so pumped up for what we thought was going to be an earth-shattering finish, in a way that T.S. Eliot perfectly described in The Hollow Men, ""not with a bang but a whimper.""Given that, the correct rating is probably 4 stars, but 4 stars with a footnote that the meal could have been oh so unspeakably wonderful, but sadly turned out to have ended badly.  That said, otherwise the meal was so outrageously good, that we will indeed return to Scarpetta's, whether in NYC or at one of his other restaurants.",3,3,4,David M.,"Denver, CO",504,851,165

There's nothing to pick on from seating to ordering to serving. Just enough accommodation and friendly service without being over-the-top. Food- Incredible! Who would think of duck & foie gras for ravioli? Creativity aside, the taste was not like anything I have ever had. The bbq-like sauce adds an interesting kick  to the buttery ravioli filling. The dish is slightly too rich for my taste, but it is definitely the best ravioli I've ever had! My friend ordered the signature spaghetti in tomato & basil sauce. I expected it would be as plain as it sounded. Not the case at all! I have no idea what it is about the secret sauce, Scott Conant must had some magic touch on this simple spaghetti dish. Dessert- The hazelnut mille foglie is on par with Lady M's green tea mile crepe. And you just can't go wrong with espresso gelato.

The servers are over enthusiastic and almost trying to create theatre .... it was not an occasion where there was a sense of natural interaction and personalised input....it was mechanical communication along the lines of 'the chef recommends this, the chef thinks that....' The creamy polenta was really good, probably the stand out dish of the night, and the pancetta wrapped pork loin was good. The duck and foie gras was tasty.

After reading the reviews for Scarpetta, I knew I had to take a chance and try the Creamy Polenta fricassee of truffled mushrooms. OH MY GOD. It was one of the most delicious things I have ever had the pleasure of tasting in my life. The polenta is served hot and a server pours the truffled mushrooms over the polenta. Had I not been in public, I would have licked the bowl. It was that good. Then I moved onto the Branzino with sunchokes, cotechino, leeks & bottarga breadcrumbs.

The duck was prepared at a perfect medium-rare but I wasn't a huge fan of the spices. My SO started with the yellowtail sushi and then ended with the pork wrapped in prosciutto. Both courses were very small and unfortunately, he left the restaurant a little hungry. If you're looking for more food, I'd recommend the pasta dishes.

5.0,3/15/2013,"This was the best meal I've had in a really long time, too long in fact. I think a lot of the time there is a lot of hype surrounding certain restaurants, and many times the actual restaurant does not live up to it. This restaurant goes above and beyond. Despite the fact that one of the maitre d's, was incredibly rude and obnoxious, in a holier than though kind of way the service at Scarpetta is warm and friendly. I loved our server greeted us by saying, ""Welcome home."" If this place were my home I would never leave.We were presented with an inventive and delicious bread basket filled with focaccia, strombolli, crusty Italian bread, and a crusty white roll. The focaccia was fluffy on the inside with crisp exterior seasoned faintly with herbs. The strombolli was warm and soft, filled with mozzarella and salami. The Italian bread was hearty with chewy fluffy insides, and nice outer crust. Served with these assorted breads came a trio of different sauces and spreads. Among these included soft airy whipped butter, eggplant and tomato spread, and really good olive oil. The eggplant spread was redolent with umami rich tomato flavor, and just delicious. The olive oil was the best I've ever had. It was lightly flavored with lemon, and had a flavor depth that made me want more. For my appetizer I ordered the Mozzarella in Corozza. Picture your childhood favorite, the mozzarella stick, just five times better. The creamy gooey mozzarella, real fresh mozzarella, is surrounded by a thin crispy crunchy coating. Halved stewed baby tomatoes are artfully arranged around. These tomatoes are robust in flavor, and lend flavor depth to the dish. I also got to sample my dinner companion's Braised Octopus, which was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I had heard about the pastas here, and was bone set and determined to try their housemade pasta. Our server recommended the Raviolini filled with ricotta and topped with parmesan foam. The dish was light, and simply perfect. The ricotta was creamy while the pasta was rich and eggy, just the way I like my pasta. The parmesan foam was airy, just as foam should be, and added a touch of whimsy to the meal. I also got to try the Spiced Duck Breast, which was cooked to juicy tender perfection and seasoned well. Then we finished our meal with two desserts. One was the Warm Banana Bread, and the other was the Chocolate Cake. The banana bread was denser than your average banana bread, but was much better for it. I loved the contrasting textures and flavors. Atop the banana bread rested a piece of dark chocolate, and beneath this chocolate was rich butterscotch pudding, salted caramel sauce was spread out on the plate. This dessert was just heavenly. I definitely could have eaten it over and over again. When we were eating this dessert it was almost like we were fighting over it with our spoons rushing to the plate to prevent the other from eating the most. The Chocolate cake was like a rich molten chocolate lava cake served with salted caramel ice cream. The ice cream was creamy and smooth, and had just the right amount of salt, enough so that it was present bu not overpowering. The pools of fudge sauce were amazing. While the chocolate cake was good the favorite of the night was by far the Banana Bread. I can't even pick a favorite dish of the night, because everything was fantastic.

I didn't order any meat entrée myself but the people at the table around us looked pretty happy with what they had.The real upside here is the wine. The wine list is quite extensive and the waiter (and the friendly barman!) will be very useful when helping you to choose. They are knowledgeable about all their wines and will be able to find exactly what you need. I still feel it is pricey for ""just"" a trendy Italian place, but this is sadly the case of any trendy place in Nyc...Also the bread they bring to the table is really fantastic - especially the meat bread.",0,0,0,Josh R.,"Boston, MA",60,174,0
5.0,3/5/2013,"$24 for a plate of tomato and basil spaghetti sounds a tad overpriced, I know... But this is one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. The Tomato Basil pasta at Scarpetta is the definition of simplicity, executed perfectly. It is so flavorful, luxurious and comforting that you are left wanting another plate immediately after your last bite. I also recently saw this pasta featured on NY Eater's 12 Epic Pasta Dishes To Eat Before You Die (rightfully so).Owned by Scott Contant, Scarpetta is located in the Meatpacking District, on 14th and 9th. Scarpetta is open for dinner only and is great for a date or special occasion. Scarpetta serves sophisticated Italian cuisine, sure to impress anyone. They also serves the best complimentary bread basket in all of New York. A stromboli is included in this little bread basket heaven, stuffed and served with salami, smoked mozzerella, basil and sweet cherry tomatoes. Need I say more? Alongside the stromboli is a variety of other fresh, hot bread, served with three dipping sauces: a butter mascarpone, a citrus herb infused extra virgin olive oil (so green in color that you know it's going to be good before eating it) and an eggplant caponata with eggplant, capers, tomato sauce and anchovy... I would be thoroughly satisfied with this bread basket and a glass of wine alone... And then comes the phenomenal appetizers and main entrees. For the first time at Scarpetta, be sure to try the Tomato-Basil Spaghetti.",0,0,0,Alissar T.,"New York, NY",69,104,0
4.0,3/5/2013,"I went here for a birthday dinner in early February.  I tend to avoid celebrity chef restaurants, but Scott is my favorite judge on Chopped and my best friend has been raving about the polenta dish here for so long that I couldn't resist.The ambiance was a little more casual than I had expected (in a good way).  You could get away with a suit here or just a good shirt a nice pair of dark jeans.  The service was helpful without being obtrusive.We started with the polenta with truffled mushrooms ($19), and it was as advertised.  Rich and creamy.  It was the kind of dish you really had to force yourself to slow down and savor or else it would be gone in a flash.  I liked the presentation too.  The polenta comes out alone.  Then the mushrooms and sauce, which come in a tiny cast iron pot, are poured over the top at the table.I wasn't particularly in the mood for a protein, so I went with the tomato and basil spaghetti ($24).  Now I know this sounds like a pretty lame order.  But it was FANTASTIC.  One of my favorite things I've had in a while.  I really can't believe how someone could make such a simple dish like this explode with flavor.  I tried a few bites of the black farfalle with lobster ($28).  It was fine, but I wasn't the biggest fan.And we finished with some sort of chocolate dessert that I liked, but didn't love.And that's all I got...",0,0,0,H.

3.0,2/28/2013,"Came here for my birthday last night and it was one of the most richest meals I've ever eaten. My table chose the tasting menu as every good soul should do on their celebratory meal day. With the homemade bread basket, we were off to a naughty start. The olive oil, the caponata, mascapone butter, all were beautiful notes on top of the warm focaccia and stromboli. My favorite part of the meal could have been the first course's yellowtail. The perfectly temped ginger-cured slice of meat with crunchy sea salt and spicy chili flakes made me feel like I was at Bondst and not at a celebrity chef's Italian restaurant.I didn't personally care for the fried chunks of mozzarella and tomatoes, or the risotto and carrot blend that sat under the tender, sweet short rib all star bites. But I DID indulge in the creamiest, cheesiest, most decadent polenta that was drenched in fricassee of truffled mushrooms. PANTY DROPPER alert.  After the pants were down, I was vulnerable and was ready to call it a night after the most honest dish of the meal, the spaghetti with tomato and basil. It had a bite, it was al dente and I should've put my fork down after that. I didn't care for the short rib agnolotti, yes, what's wrong with me? It was rich and the short rib was tenderly cooked, but I felt like Scarpetta blew their load too soon and had lost steam. I was ready to roll out of the bed and brush my hair but the main course was coming.I thought the fennel usage in the crispy cod was pleasant and not too medicinal, as it was combined with garlic, tomatoes and black olive oil. And the pork loin was salty (as pork just is) but the pancetta should've been crispier. HOLY chocolate cake, Batman! The rich, dense cake was highlighted with lip smackin' salted gelato and as the birthday girl naturally gets her way, I had asked for the warm banana bread with butterscotch pudding and Brooklyn Lager gelato. That was the five star, reverse cowgirl legs behind the head over the moon ending. It was a nice touch to give a happy birthday plate with random cookie bites that I continuously asked myself, ""why am I eating these? They're not worth it.""

My wife had the black farfalle with lobster.  It was outstanding.  The pasta was perfectly cooked, seasoned well, just a little spicy which set off the lobster.  I had the short rib agnolotti.  These were little pillows of cheesy love.  If I have a complaint, it would be that the agnolotti were a little too sweet and so rich that halfway through I was craving a vegetable with something acidic.  That leads me to my only real criticism - there is a lack of greenery on the menu.  With all the pasta and pretty heavy appetizers, I felt like something like a lighter salad, or even something as simple as shaved fennel with lemon would have been a great counterpoint to the rest.THe wine list is long and heavy on Italian.  There are some options at the $60 and under level, but not a large number.  Still, we left full and happy.",0,1,0,Rob B.,"New York, NY",6,174,25

Extremely fresh and full of flavor, it was definitely a good choice (although the duck and foie gras ravioli looked very appetizing). There was a delicious bread basket that I never really touched because I was afraid I would inhale it all. I had the hazelnut millie foglie, accompanied by a poached pear with white expresso gelato. Dessert completely bowled me over (I usually don't eat all of my desserts for fear of diabetes) and when I left, I wasn't stuffed.

The meat was perfectly pink and tender, and as duck tends to go well with fruity emulsions, this was no exception. Expect the fat trimmings to add aromaticity to the flavor. I had a dry and robust red wine to pair. My senses were tickled.I sat in the more quiet area of the restaurant, and therefore it was a fitting venue for an intimate dinner for two.

I ordered the spaghetti due to its overwhelming popularity on yelp and enjoyed the obviously homemade noodles and sauce. Simple Italian done right. For dessert I had the warm banana bread per suggestion of our waiter. Sliced banana bread under thin layers of chocolate, banana creme, another chocolate wafer, more banana creme, and a final chocolate wafer. When I say wafer I just mean a very thin slicing of chocolate that's about 2.5 by 2.5 inches. A nice streak of butterscotch garnished the plate with strategically placed walnuts. Alongside was a stout beer flavored gelato (perfect texture for gelato, so they didn't just make icecream and pretend it was gelato). Very large dessert, definitely could have been enjoyed by two people. My friend ordered the scallops. Only critique would be that the waiter informed her it was an appetizer size (one scallop for $19) so he convinced her to get the ""entree"" size which came out with like 4 or 5 scallops (and of course the cost was doubled to $38).The ambiance was lovely.

Foccacia was my favorite because it went well with all their dipping condiments: mascarpone butter, eggplant and tomato spread, and citrus-flavored olive oil. I was with a date and he didn't need to speak to me because I was too busy enjoying myself.Appetizer:  Polenta. Oh my goodness it was so creamy and delicious. It was as if it melted in your mouth because it was that smooth.  It was tasty on its own. They added sautéed mushrooms once they place the dish in front of you, but in my opinion, I didn't need the mushrooms. It added a bit of saltiness to it that some may like, but I like to taste the natural product - because if you get THAT right, then you got my vote. I would love to order this again, but this time have them leave the mushrooms on the side (like how it comes) so I can put as much/little as I want.Pasta: Spaghetti. Absolutely delicious!  Simple ingredients. A slight hint of spiciness that teases you. The perfect amount of basil because you get some in every single bite. I had no complaints whatsoever with the tomato sauce - it wasn't too runny, too thick, too much, or too little. The pasta was fresh - not too gummy as I read it some reviews. The portion was perfect if you are ordering at least 1 or 2 more courses. I will come back, plop myself on a chair at the bar, order the spaghetti, eat it, and all will be good in the world again.  I haven't ordered simple tomato and basil spaghetti anywhere else (or if I did, clearly it wasn't memorable) so I guess my review about it is slightly biased. But I know good food, and this was good.  Oh, and it's expensive spaghetti @ $24. Whoa.Entrée: Black Cod.Very good - cooked well, tasted great, accompanying veggies and presentation were great. Small portion. I'm keeping this review short because with all that I already ate and the speed at which they were bringing out the plates, I was sooo full! I was eating the delicious cod just to eat it and because I already ordered it. Dessert: Chocolate cake w/ salted caramel gelato.One phrase:  ""Lick. The. Plate.""I wanted to do that. I never wanted to do that before.::PRICE::  Definitely pricy. I could see why: location (aka, rent), celebrity chef, high-end quality products.::SERVICE::I experienced a very attentive, knowledgeable, and nice wait service. However...Boy, do they rush you. That's my reason to deduct a star. Thursday night at 6pm I ordered appetizer, pasta, fish and dessert. Right after the appetizer, the pasta came out. Before I had a chance to fondly think back about that delicious spaghetti, the fish entree came out. I didn't even finish my glass of wine and a dessert menu was plopped in front of me. So instead of ordering dessert right away, I said I needed a few minutes.  I figured I'd finish my wine (without chugging it - it's a pretty expensive glass of wine as it is so I might as well savor it) before I place my order. But get this: the manager comes over and asks if I'm going to order dessert! Really?  I get it - you need the table and I saw the waiter hover a bunch of times to try to catch eye contact in hopes of moving our dinner along. But, dude, I think I can say I was a pretty good customer because I had a four course meal complete with drinks. Give me a little time to digest!  Sure enough, I rolled home. Can't complain THAT much if I want to go back for certain repeat dishes (polenta and spaghetti) and to try new ones (duck ravioli).::AMBIANCE::I kept reading ""romantic"", but nuh-uh.

I wish they had an entree version of this dish. Creamy but not heavy, and flavored just enough with mushrooms and truffles. This dish also looks beautiful.We went all-carb. Polenta and two pasta dishes. I was debating to get the black cod instead of a pasta dish to balance out the meal a little, but decided to go for their signature dishes (polenta and pastas) since it was my first time here. Everything was great - would recommend sharing the foie gras and duck ravioli among a few people... 3-5 ravioli pieces per person are enough as it is so flavorful and heavy. The spaghetti with tomato and basil had a nice, just barely perceptible spicy kick. Not sure if it was worth $24. I want to come back for the polenta, and also to try the black cod! There were also a few other pasta dishes that sounded promising. We had the chocolate cake with salted caramel ice cream for dessert. It was just as we expected - chocolate cake was dense and the salted caramel was a nice pairing. The couple next to us ordered the banana bread which was beautifully presented, and looked delicious.

5.0,12/31/2012,"I seriously can't come here more than once a year. Otherwise I would have gout for sure because almost every choice in every course is so delicious you have to try it. First off, you have to sit at the bar and have one of their yummy cocktails (the spicy mezcal is amazing) and eat the fresh rosemary potato chips. Then waddle into the charming dining room and gorge on various breads and spreads. Meat bread with eggplant dip? Don't mind if I do. You pretty much have to get apps, and come with a big crowd so you can sample them all. They have the. Best. Beet. Salad. I've ever had. For those of you who are like so what, hippie? The scallops and short rib are great too. Then, the pasta course. You have to get the spaghetti. I don't know how they get the basil to smell that fragrant but it kicks the perfect noodles and sauce up a notch. The cavatelli and goat is great as well. By now you're probably slightly uncomfortable, but power through. I feel like a lot of places phone it in on their entrees but not here. Protein, sauce, and perfectly paired finely diced veggies for all. At this point you are probably having difficulty breathing but DO NOT leave without trying dessert. The banana bread is so ridiculously delicious. Finally, you roll your fat ass out the door and swear to never eat like that again. Till next year.",1,3,1,Tara W.,"Ridgewood, NJ",488,585,132

I'd read about their sphaghetti with tomato sauce, which is pretty much my favorite italian dish ever.  it was not disappointing - it was very, very very good, and one of the best I've had in a restaurant of this dish.  The spaghetti was fresh spaghetti, the sauce just the right amount of tomato, saltiness, and basil.  The other best version of this dish in my opinion in nyc is the very simple one from Eataly at the pasta/pizza restaurant.My boyfriend had the agnolotti, which he said was amazing.my mom had the lobster and squid ink farfalle which i tasted and it was pretty good.my dad had the snapper which he said was good.our other friend did not have good luck, he had the chestnut soup (interesting but not good) and then the duck. I tried his duck.  it came out insanely rare (and I eat a lot of duck breast and am not afraid of going rare), but it had a bad texture, kind of mushy. he was disappointed.The chocolate cake dessert was the best out of the ones we ordered - i thought it was a very good balance of rich chocolate and salty caramel.  My boyfriend had the banana bread, which i thought was ""blah"" but he said was really good, and my mom had the apple tarte.  it was not a good version of an apple tarte - bleh.  I am an extreme connoisseur of apple desserts, but the one from Scarpetta was very disappointing and no amount of dressing up with cider or ice cream could make the pastry/apple concoction less bad.In sum, the sphaghetti and a few other things were very good, but I couldn't give 4 stars because of the other misses.  Also, I was appalled at the paucity of salad or appetizers involving fresh vegetables, and when pressed for a side vegetable, our waiter said the only thing he could do was stir fried broccoli rabe.  My boyfriend ordered the tomato and mozzarella appetizer, but discovered the mozzarella to be fried, which while good was not what he was looking for.  we would have appreciated some lighter, vegetable appetizers or more accompaniments to the meal.",0,0,0,Yin L.,"San Francisco, CA",131,63,0

The service was very attentive and really could not have been better.Now to the food. I started out with the pork cheeks appetizer which was quite tasty. My daughter had the tuna susci which she enjoyed very much. My wife decided on the mozzarella in carrozza which was presented differently than we had seen before and very good.On to the main course . Here is where the problem was. Because we had heard so much about the spaghetti we really had no choice but to order it and we were not disappointed. It lived up to the hype cooked just perfectly with a great tomato and basil sauce. Since this was a must have we didn't have an opportunity to try anything else on the menu which will necessitate another visit. I guess that's the idea draw them in with the signature dish and get them to come back again.Considering the time of year (Saturday before Christmas) while the restaurant was crowded the service was top notch and unrushed.

Bad, stupid  decision. Anyway, second time was just as amazing. Seated further inside the restaurant, I loved the glass ceiling, the dim lighting, and the bar setup. Happily starting off with a glass of prosecco, our waiter brought out the most amazing bread basket and oh god, the spreads. I literally could have died happy just munching on the tomato eggplant one. And then I tried the seared divers scallops - done just right and salted just enough. I also sampled the yellowtail with flaked sea salt - cut thinly and full of flavor. And of course, the reason I went back: the home-made sphagetti. The portion was just right. It was simply presented, garnished and was absolutely perfect. For dessert, I went with the amedei chocolate cake.

Finally, the beef filled agnolotti, while good, were slightly strange and surprising as there was no mention of the horseradish in the description.  Desserts were fantastic, we did the chocolate cake and apple tart which were both phenomenal.  I would definitely go back, ask to be seated farther away from the door, and ask that the pasta be brought out in paces, since they got pretty cold while we were eating the spaghetti first.  Also, for $170.00 dinner, I'd like to be there longer than an hour (literally there an hour and 5 minutes).  Our food seemed to be flying out of the kitchen.  I know that they want to turn over our table, but seriously, I literally put my fork down from the app and the pasta was already out.

I had high expectations for this place especially after reviews about the restaurant and they were ALL met. The interior design is romantic but not too dark-noise level was alright (no yelling needed). The only negative that I have is that they will not seat a party that exceeds 8 people--also the female hosts in suits that walk around the restaurant seem a little pompous and only cater to the male diners. Let's get to the food-The bread basket was one of my favorite parts of the night--so many different breads to choose from as well as toppings to put on...there was the citrus infused olive oil, eggplant something, and some flavorful butter. The butter and eggplant were my favorite--I had to stop myself from eating the whole basket.We ordered one of each appetizer minus the soup, raw yellowtail, and mozzarella dish. My favorite would have to be the Creamy Polenta and Braised Short Ribs--all so divine..I could have eaten both dishes as my meal and be satisfied. It literally melts in your mouth and all the ingredients compliment the dish so well! Everyone was raving about the spaghetti so I ordered that as my entree, as did 4 other people at my table, but the others also ordered the Black Cod and Branzino. I got to taste the Black Cod in trade for some of my spaghetti and it was DELICIOUS--literally melted in my mouth and the sauce that came with it wasn't overpowering the taste of the fresh fish. The spaghetti was a good choice and nice try but I think I will have to get the Black Cod or Steak as my entree on my next visit!Dessert- We got three desserts....warm apple pie, chocolate cake, and hazelnut something...we also got little dishes of Italian desserts.

5.0,10/22/2012,"Incredible dining experience! Service was top notch, ambiance was perfect, and the food and wine were to die for. Assorted bread basket with burrata, eggplant tapenade, and olive oil trio for dipping was an elegant treat. Had the creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms and roasted baby beets to start. Both dishes were full of flavor and presented beautifully. The polenta is incredibly rich and buttery. The beets were light and delicate. For my entree, I had the Taleggio Mezzalunai which was also incredible, rich, and filling. Great spot for a date night or to celebrate a special occasion. The restaurant has very high ceilings and marble everywhere with fresh flowers and candles that make every moment feel luxurious. Seating in the front is best for couples, while the back room can accommodate larger parties. The climate controlled wine cellar is displayed through glass walls and provides a nice focal point for the center of the dining room.

4.0,10/14/2012,"I'm almost always hungry when I wake up. From the brief afternoon naps to the epic Sunday sleeps, I'll want to break bread upon opening my peepers.This morning is not one of those cases after Leslie D's birthday dinner last night at Scarpetta. In the battle of man versus food, food not only won but altered my gastrointestinal system in such a way that I may just have a spoonful of granola three hours from now and call it a day.When trying to find this restaurant, don't look for a sign with the name clearly spelled out: it's not. Instead look for the number 355 on 14th Street. Then you will enter a dark world of upscale Italian dishes populated by well dressed and well heeled eaters.Literally dark. Trying to read the drink menu at the bar without supplemental light was an act in squinting and waiting for Prometheus. Eventually, my eyes adjusted to the cave like lighting and they were ready to examine the upcoming feast.And, dear yelpers, your photographs of spaghetti were enough to convince me that this was what I desperately needed to order. Yet the pictures also gave the impression that this was a dainty dish, a few twirls worth of homemade pasta goodness and on to the next plate.So I pre-gamed with boquerones at a nearby tapas bar, thinking I'd made the right move. Not quite.Firstly, the spaghetti is unveiled by the lifting of a cover as if royalty is reviewing the latest bounty from the New World. I could see Ferdinand and Isabella nodding their approval once the lid is lifted and beginning to chow down.What deceived me was the actual depth of the dish. It's as if discovering that Kim Kardashian is a Rhodes scholar who can discuss international politics: not just a flashy exterior but also substance!So it was with the spaghetti, simply prepared with tomato and basil. Keep your Ragu jars to the pasta sauce aisle at Keyfood, this dish was not at all drowning in red sauce but rather each piece of homemade spaghetti was lovingly lightly covered in tomato. Cheese? Not at all necessary as the primordial ingredients spoke for themselves.I'd have it again in a heartbeat, a $24 heartbeat at that.Other highlights included creamy polenta served with a truffled mushrooms. It's like eating a stick of butter, a quart of heavy cream and living to speak about it. I generously borrowed a few spoonful of my wife's appetizer and realized that my very tasty braised short ribs with risotto, while amazing, still couldn't reach the ethereal heights of dairy delight.The dessert that added the final nail to the coffin of appetite destruction was the semifreddo. It's half cold but all delicious. I was surprised by the inclusion of a sweet potato gratin, an orange square that seemed out of place on a plate of mousse and chocolate crumble. Combining all three ingredients justified the sweet potato but the dish would have been just as amazing without it.Note that Scarpetta is crowded and cramped- you may bump elbows or be bumped by waiters and other guests. But for a special occasion it's well worth the struggle and squinting for a taste of spaghetti heaven.",8,7,5,Tom K.,"Forest Hills, NY",337,820,47

Mostly because the food is incredible but I think the service is even better. Seriously you finish with a plate and no more than 10 seconds later it's gone. The pace of the meal was perfect, they were so courteous, just perfect. And the food - all I can say is that even the bread basket is insanely delicious. Who puts a crazy bread filled with meat and cheese in your bread basket? Scarpetta. That is amazing.I wouldn't be back all the time just since it's a special occasion type of place, but I am super excited to return. Keep it classy Scarpetta!",0,0,0,Barb B.,"New York, NY",201,506,0
5.0,10/13/2012,"Before my visit here on Monday night, I only knew chef/owner Scott Conant from his terse comments as one of the harsher judges on the ""Chopped"" competition series on what else, the Food Network. I didn't even know he owned Scarpetta although I had heard about the place from my East Coast friends for the past several years. Lucky me I was in New York on the first day of a new job, a business trip with my manager and a local colleague, and as it turned out, we are all foodies. The first thing that strikes you when you enter Scarpetta is how incredibly dark it is. I get the cosmopolitan ambiance they are trying to capture here, but personally I found it a bit excessive given how much effort is placed on the presentation of the food at least judging from the website.Funny thing is I just read about a new app on TechCrunch called Chefs Feed in which famous chefs list their absolute favorite dishes at other chefs' restaurants. I downloaded it and found the $19 Creamy Polenta with Fricassee of Truffled Mushrooms mentioned with gusto by Chris Santos of Beauty & Essex. By coincidence, I recently saw the tail end of an episode of the Food Network's ""The Best Thing I Ever Made"" where Conant was making his signature dish. Sold. It was sensational - luxuriant with the chicken-infused morels and preserved truffles almost as velvety as the cream-based polenta itself (see photo). My dining companions agreed. But even before the polenta came one of the best bread baskets I think I've ever devoured.It was filled with not only thick slices of rustic Italian bread and foccacia but unexpected slabs of Stromboli oozing with salami and mozzarella, all of which was quickly devoured (see photo). The three condiments were almost unnecessary, but they were excellent - a buttery mascarpone, a citrus-herb-infused extra virgin olive oil, and an eggplant caponata. Just as we were savoring the polenta, the $25 Short Rib Agnolotti arrived, and the platter presented melt-in-your-mouth pieces of short rib into a ravioli-like folded pasta and blended them with root vegetables in a horseradish brown butter (see photo). Gone too soon. The entrees came in quick order, and each provided individual pleasures.The $34 Fennel-Spiced Black Cod came in the form of two large filets with the crispy skin left intact and piled atop concentrated tomatoes and artichoke leaves. It was all surrounded by a creamy mantecato & black olive oil sauce that brought the proper amount of decadence to the fish (see photo). The $33 Branzino was more simply presented with a large piece of the seabass covered in bottarga (tuna roe) breadcrumbs and sitting atop a blend of sunchokes, cotechino (salami) and leeks (see photo). Fish is definitely a specialty here, but I had the rock star of the night, the $33 Spiced Duck Breast surrounded by a foie gras emulsion (yes, it was a brownish orange foam) and served with butternut squash, Tuscan kale and pickled raisins (see photo).It was succulent as you would expect but with unexpected flavors that kept my palate tantalized. Mere mortals would have stopped there, but an expense account empowered us to move forward with the decadent dessert selection at $12 a pop. First up was the Amadei Chocolate Cake with a salted caramel gelato (a tad too bland) and chocolate butterscotch (see photo). The cake was deceptively small, but the Italian chocolate was obscenely rich. The second was the Sesame-Honey Semifreddo, which was milk chocolate mousse shaped like biscotti with a sweet potato gratin and malted chocolate crumble accompaniment (see photo). Both were lovely, but the unexpected surprise was the Coconut Panna Cotta, a milky tropical creation sitting in a pool of cool guava sauce with a sprinkling of caramelized pineapple.Delicioso, Mr. Conant. You're not chopped.FOOD - 5 stars...masterful execution of dishes that seem deceptively simple in concept with the polenta and panna cotta the genuine standouts of the eveningAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...personally thought it was too dark to allow the eyes to complete the picture of the luscious foodSERVICE - 4 stars...solid if a bit unctuous, almost too attentive perhaps due to the lateness of the hourTOTAL - 5 stars...Conant definitely knows his food",12,9,7,Ed U.,"San Francisco, CA",4522,4629,37977

4.0,10/8/2012,"At restaurants in this price range, I kind of expect to be blown away and, while Scarpetta was very good, it didn't strike me as new or unique or pushing the boundaries of food. It's fresh and flavorful Italian and, hey, that's alright but for the price it won't get you five stars.As mentioned, everything we had here was very good. My short rib appetizer and duck and foie gras ravioli were both well prepared and the fresh pasta was really a highlight. My wife's spaghetti was also really well prepared but, at the end of the day, it was just very good spaghetti.As for the restaurant, the space is really well done. I was there at dusk and the natural light coming in through the glass roof was nice. In fact, I suspect that going to Scarpetta during the day is the way to go for this reason alone. Service was prompt and attentive and we had no complaints. In general, this is a fine place to go if Italian food is your thing. It's a solid menu of traditional-type Italian food, everything is fresh, and the service is good. But, if you are looking for something new, exciting, and creative, you probably need to look elsewhere.",1,0,0,John H.,"Durham, NC",39,109,24

5.0,9/28/2012,"My husband recently took me here for my b'day dinner. Both of us are big Food network fans and end up watching Scott Conant frequently on TV. I've seen how critical he is of other people's food, so I went in with really high expectation. Almost like, now it's my time to judge your food :)Loved everything about this restaurant. The decor was modern and very cozy. The lighting, extremely creative. We were promptly seated and within minutes our server greeted us with menus. He was very polite and helpful. Made excellent wine recommendations, pairing it well with our meals. They served two basket of breads. One, the regular assortment of Italian breads and the other basket had the more sophisticated bread stuffed with ham and other stuff. Each was served with butter, eggplant dip and olive oil. All extremely delicious. We started our meal with: HEIRLOOM TOMATOES - Burrata, pickled eggplant & fried capers  - very fresh and flavorful. The fried capers added an amazing crunch to the dish. The only thing I did not like about the dish was the chunky size tomatoes. They were too big and not at all delicate. But everything was delicious. Portion size - one person only.CREAMY POLENTA - fricassee of truffled mushrooms - this was one of the tastiest dish at our dinner. It was creamy and bursting with amazing flavors. I absolutely loved every bite of this dish. Highly recommend it. Unlike common perception, the polenta was not too heavy. For the main course we ate:TALEGGIO MEZZALUNAI - new potatoes, green garlic & shiitakes  - the pasta was very well prepared and scrumptious. Once I tasted it was hard not to take another bite. It was so good. FENNEL SPICED BLACK COD - concentrated tomatoes, mantecato & black olive oil - The cod was very moist and cooked perfectly. The skin was super crispy. Overall a very satisfying dish. For desert we chose: SELVA NERA CHEESECAKE - maraschino cherries, sesame crunch & sour cream - Loved the presentation. I am not very fond of cherries so overall found this desert to be ok. But for a cherry lover, this is a delicious desert. The cheesecake is chocolate flavor and is shaped in small squares.AMEDEI CHOCOLATE CAKE - salted caramel gelato & chocolate butterscotch - This desert was off the hook. It was super delicious from start to the end. The combination of salted caramel, gelato and chocolate butterscotch is always a winner. The cake was super moist and rich. Everything about this desert was amazing. A piece of heaven!! We loved the place, the food was delicious, ambiance great and service pronto.

Scarpetta comes so close if not equal, close your eyes and take a bite, it is one of the best food experiences in the city. I recently went back a second time and it was just as great.

While the service was good, I will not go back to Scarpetta and will not recommend it to anyone. It was wildly expensive for the quantity and quality of food received.

3.0,9/19/2012,"Another one that was on my list (for those of you who read this often you know that I missed out on this restaurant in Vegas).  My overall assessment was that it met expectations but didn't wow me.  The burrata starter was awesome (I often feel like the cheese is too hard and it was soft and creamy).The olive oil braised octopus with charred scallions, rice beans and mantacato was really good although I just don't think I like octopus that much. My rabbit agnolotti with peas and riesling-mustard reduction was good but then made my stomach hurt (not sure why since I've eaten this dish many times).  Not sure if it was too rich or too many carbs? I then rescind my rabbit comment because I tried the duck and foie gras ravioli with marsala reduction which was phenomenal and should've been the richest thing on the menu.  It was probably my favorite dish after the burrata.For dessert we went with warm rhubarb tart with basil yogurt, macadamia nuts and Chianti sorbet.  It was SO good.  All the different flavors came together to create this sweet, sour, sugary, crunchy, melty taste. Loved it.The amedei chocolate cake with salted caramel gelato and chocolate butterscotch fell short.  I feel like I can get this at every restaurant.Lastly the restaurant itself was kind of standard.  Nothing all that special to it.  The one thing I did like was they had belts around the mirrors which was an interesting look.  Dinner was good but for the price and the experience I would recommend but not necessarily need to go back.",0,0,0,Laura H.,"Sydney, Australia",412,394,3
4.0,9/17/2012,"Scarpetta was a great treat after walking the Highline from North to South.  We came down the 14th street access and walked a block when Yelp! alerted me to this gem.  My companions were out-of-towners so we decided to sit outside so that we could watch the world go by.  We did not have reservations but arrived before 6pm and were seated without a problem.  The menu is varied - several kinds of pastas and many types of proteins including steak, duck, and halibut.  The wine list is extensive but expensive - probably the only downfall of this evening as we couldn't find a bottle under $45 and the majority of bottles were in the hundreds of dollars.  We did settle on a $45 dollar bottle, and it was delicious, but it seemed a bit pricey for my out-of-towners, who were treating for the meal. The wine arrived and it was fantastic.  We were also served a bread basket with 4 different types of bread - the two that I remember the names of were ciabatta and stromboli.  We also received a divided tray of bread accompaniments - olive oil, eggplant/tomato relish, and marscapone butter.I had the Taleggio Mezzalunai ($26) - see pic.  They are little moon shaped stuffed pasta that taste like bites of sunsine and moonbeams with a smokiness and a tangy bite at the same time. Delicious sauce and potatoes with crispy shitakes as a garnish.  I used the bread to sop up the juices.  YUM.  I did have bites of my friend's Halibut.  DELICIOUS.I'm a big fan and would definitely go back.  This was the perfect restaurant for the end of our trek.  The service was fantastic and the bill was aproximately $150.",0,0,0,K D.,"Little Compton, RI",15,208,393

I haven't eaten polenta a lot in my life, but if it was this good every time, I'd be serving it up a lot!For our main course, I ordered the Spaghetti with tomato and basil. Yes - it seems simple, but sometime when things are done simply yet perfectly they can be the best! The pasta at Scarpetta is made in-house daily, so it was a treat to have something so fresh...you can taste it with each bite! My husband opted for the Rabbit Agnolotti with peas and a riesling mushroom reduction. This was my first time ever trying rabbit, and it was definitely a new flavor for me! The seasoning was perfect with the fresh peas and light sauce; I'd definitely recommend trying it out if you want something delicious but a little bit different than the norm. Scarpetta was definitely a highlight meal of our NYC trip! The only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars is because of the service.

3.0,8/19/2012,"I really wanted to give Scarpetta 4 stars. I remember liking it a lot the first time I went but I was pretty underwhelmed the 2nd time. I think it should be more of a 3.5. There were a couple things that I loved but overall I thought the entrees with just OK, and overly salty for my taste. Here's what I loved- The polenta is out of this world. It's so rich and creamy and has mushrooms and is super truffley, which I love. It's SOOOOO good. I could take a bath in it. Yummmm- I was pleasantly surprised by the Coconut Panna Cotta. It had a similar texture to flan and the pineapple was a nice touch that I didn't except to love but it was really refreshing and a nice way to end the meal. - The breadbasket had this mozzarella and ham bread that was delicious with the eggplant tapenade. Here's what was ehh- The soft shell crab was ok but nothing special. It doesn't compare to the soft shell crab at Sushi Yasuda.- I was really excited to try the duck and foie gras ravioli since I love both but it was underwhelming. I was hoping to taste both the duck and the foie distinctly but it was just kind of like this pate mush.- I was also excited about the Tajarin since I've been on a sweetbread kick but this was the most disappointing. The sweetbread was overcooked so it no longer had that nice soft texture and just tasted like chicken. - The pork loin was just 2 really tiny pieces wrapped in prosciutto. It had a strange rubbery texture and was overly salty, probably from the prosciutto. I did like the corn on the side though. - The Amedei chocolate cake was SUPER rich. I had a small bite and didn't want any more but maybe it's just bc I don't have much of a sweet tooth and don't like overly sweet things.",0,0,0,Susan Z.,"New York, NY",74,115,127

My boyfriend had the Tuna Succi which I couldn't resist to try and I could just taste the freshness of the fish. Upon the recommendation of our server, I had the Rosemary Braised Lentils which were to-die-for. There was a burst of flavor in every bite. The sundried tomatoes on top was really sweet which complemented the savory goodness of the lentils. My boyfriend had the black tagliolini which had a hefty portion of seafood. Service is amazing as well.

Went with a friend on a Saturday night and we shared everything - 2 pastas, 1 appetizer, 1 entree and 1 dessert and we were stuffed but both agreed it was one of the best meals either of us had ever had. 5* for every dish and also for the service. Our meal recap:The bread basket is the best bread basket ever. The eggplant/tomato tapenade and citrus-infused oiive oil are excellent. But the stromboli with salami and mozzarella is the decadent star. I felt like I could've gone home after the bread basket and still felt like I had a satisfying meal.Polenta with truffled mushrooms. I don't always like poletna... but LOVED this polenta. So creamy, so perfect. I will always order this every time I go back.Spaghetti with Tomato and Basil and Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli in marsala reduction. This is the perfect combination of pastas because the ravioli is so rich, with just the right balance of duck meat and the decadent foie gras, and the spaghetti is fresh and light with a little spicy kick. I think i could eat this spaghetti every day it's that good.Short ribs w/farro risotto. We got this doubled to an entree size. Also very decadent  and delicious. If I could do it over, I would get it as an appetizer thought because we were so stuffed and had to take a break before dessert. Amadei chocolate cake. I struggled to eat half this because I was so full but it was so good. The Amadei chocolate is dark and has subtle hints of spiciness.

Busy Saturday night and got almost immediate seating on the patio, and boy was the weather and walk-by scenery outstanding. Bread basket is delicious, the butter tasty. Excellent wine list, we settled on a great Super Tuscan and followed up with a final glass that was well recommended by the waiter. The braised short ribs : hilariously butter like quality, no need for a knife, you barely need a fork to break them in half. Best I have ever tasted, hands down. I only wish you got more than 4 pieces ;) While it sounds boring, read the other reviews and you will understand: the Spaghetti is the dish to get, or at least one of them for a couple or group. The best hand made noodles and sauce you will ever eat. Again, I only wish you got more ;) We were pretty full from the bread, 2 course meal, and wine, but the server brought us a birthday desert platter that really hit the spot.

My gf took me here to celebrate my birthday....half because it was my birthday and half because she was hoping there would be a Scott Conant siting(didn't happen). Scarpetta has a modern feel with mood setting acoustics. I could hear some background music but it wasn't overpowering. The music in the bar area was louder but that noise never made it into the dining room. A nice touch that is sometimes overlooked. The service was helpful but not intrusive..

In fact, a waiter bumped into me 3 times while I was dining!  The service has gone way down, we sat waiting for a good 10 minutes before being offered menus!  The sommelier had to take our dinner order because our waiter was so busy.  While this is clearly not the fault of the wait staff due to how busy the restaurant and the lack of servers, it still made the experience less enjoyable.The only reason I am even giving Scarpetta 3 stars is because of the spaghetti, the rest of our meal was totally blah.  I am truly sad to lose such a great restaurant!",0,0,0,Larry C.,"New York, NY",16,71,0

5.0,7/8/2012,"I admit that I was one of those that thought it was just plain ridiculous, when I first read through an article that I came across last year -- that this restaurant offers a simple tomato & basil spaghetti for $24.  What?  It don't even contain any seafood nor meat, yet it's $24?  Are you kidding me, I'm not going to pay that much for something like that. . .  But as the months passed and the more and more I kept thinking about it, I became intrigued about it for some reason and I felt like if I ever got to visit NY, I would have to check this place out and try their spaghetti, to see for myself if this ""crack-like"" addictiveness is really all that it's cracked up to be.  When it was confirmed that I was going to be able to visit NY for the first time, I knew I had to save up some $ and put this place on my list of restaurants to check out and a few weeks before my trip, I made a reservation through Open Table, for my Mom and I.I never thought I'd say this, especially after all that making fun of in the beginning, but their tomato & basil spaghetti is, in my opinion, worth the $24.  It's something so simple, yet the execution of it and how its prepared, justified the price.  People can and will argue about their signature dish, but who cares?  This was easily, the best tomato & basil spaghetti that I've ever had in my life.  The fresh house-made al-dente noodles, along with the delicious sauce, was wonderful and I could find nothing that needed any improvement - it was done just right.  Although the ingredients used are simple, I could see how this would be hard to duplicate at home. The bread basket was also, no doubt, the best I've ever had and quite impressive -  the citrus infused olive oil, roasted eggplant caponata and mascarpone butter were all excellent additions and I particularly loved the latter two.  The stromboli was the best - this thing was almost like a sandwich itself and along with the other types of delicious bread included in the basket, I could see why their main menu items costed a lot - partly the reason is because they have a complimentary bread basket such as this.Their salad was the only thing that I thought was not really worth the price - it was $17 and could barely feed two people, but couldn't deduct a star as that was our fault, for not asking the waiter exactly how much this was going to cost, since their salads were not printed on their main menu that we received.  The salad itself that we tried though, had a bunch of different vegetables mixed in and was very tasty, but just portion-wise, it was too small.And finally, the dessert, was absolutely heavenly:-)  I tried their Amedei Chocolate Cake and everything from the cake to the butterscotch to the salted caramel gelato was excellent and complemented each other perfectly.  I don't know how anyone could possibly find anything wrong with this, taste-wise.  I was a bit sad when I got to my last bite of the dessert, since that moment of bliss had to come to an end.  Definitely remember to leave room for and order dessert, if you go to Scarpetta:-)  Presentation and service at Scarpetta was really good - our glasses of water were constantly filled and the severs were nice and friendly from beginning to end.  To me, this place was overall, definitely sophisticated and refined, but not at all too fancy shmancy nor was it in any way, pretentious.  Our total bill for the spaghetti (2), a salad and a dessert (without drinks), came out to be $83.83.  We normally don't & can't eat like this on a regular basis due to financial reasons, but ultimately, we did not regret the cost, nor our time and experience here.  Even if I were to visit NY in the future, I doubt that I'd ever be able to afford to dine here again, but if anything, I'm personally glad that I did decide to and was able to eat here, as in the end, I really did enjoy it!",2,1,1,Kahanalei M.,"San Francisco, CA",274,193,650

4.0,7/5/2012,"I got to try Scarpetta tonight for the first time.  First, I am surprised no one mentioned how difficult it was to locate this restaurant on 14th street.  The signboard is too tiny to read, especially in the evening.  I had to call the restaurant right in front of it. I didn't know whether it was the restaurant's modesty or supreme confidence for having almost an invisible sign post.  I was quite skeptical of how truly good Scarpetta was because of so many rave reviews by yelpers.  I was relieved not to be let down with the ambiance, food and service.    The bread basket was fabulous, especially Stromboli.  I loved the mascarpone cheese, which seemed to be whipped and then piped into a water drop shape.  And, the second basket was necessary since the portion of the main dishes was rather wanting.  Unlike other restaurants, Scarpetta surprised me with its invention: it was as if I discovered new notes of my palate which I didn't even know existed.    For example, one of the appetizers my party ordered was fritto misto.  I wondered about the purpose of fried lemon slices among calamari.  The taste of lemon was softer yet still added freshness to the fried calamari.Soft shell crab was presented with shaved asparagus and lemon, garlic, and sesame sauce.  The texture of shaved asparagus, which was slightly blanched, was a whole new way of making it more appetizing for me who had been less than enthusiastic about this vegetable all my life.      Although the Spaghetti was definitely superb, I found it a little salty.  My party enjoyed both black cod and halibut for their different ways of preparation.  Black cod came with caramelized fennel and sun dried tomato underneath, which added wonderful subtext to the fish.  Halibut was accompanied by green peas and baby artichokes in almond broth.  It was like eating a wonderful bowl of spring.  The only disappointment was the chocolate cake.  I suppose Ademei chocolate is special.  However, the cake didn't taste all that special.  I didn't taste much salt in the salted caramel gelato, either.  I expected more intense juxtaposition of salty and sweet tastes in my mouth.  But, I couldn't taste such.  Ther service was attentive throughout the whole meal.  I liked the casual atmosphere for a fine dining.  I would definitely return to try other dishes, especially the desserts.",1,1,0,Sydnee L.,"Palisades Park, NJ",0,6,0

4.0,6/17/2012,"Very solid restaurant with a very nice ambiance and vibe. Elegant but not stuffy made for a very comfortable evening.Service was superb with both the waitress and sommelier doing excellent turns and never really missing a beat. 5 stars for that.Appetizers were very good. Mozzarella was delicious although portion size was small even by appetizer standards. The Farm Salad was excellent. The onion and goat cheese was also excellent and the final appetizer we had was the crunchy vegetable which, while not what we expected was very good nonetheless.For mains, we had 3 servings of the spaghetti and tomato sauce which is a signature dish. I really enjoyed it but the two others where only somewhat impressed. The sauce has parmesan already in it making for a somewhat creamier sauce than some would like. The other main was the halibut and that was deemed very good.All the portions were served hot and the presentations were very nice.For Desserts we shared three chocolate cakes with salted caramel ice cream. Fantastic!So service was 5 stars. Food a solid 4 but the pricing tips it to a 4 star overall",0,0,0,Joe M.,"Martinsville, NJ",0,40,0

For starters I love the look of the place. We had a late dinner & the place had a sexy & trendy vibe but still classy. Secondly the wait staff was very attentive, accommodating & personable so the service was great. Then came the infamous ""Scarpetta Bread Basket"" complete with olive oil, salted butter & some kind of RICH ragu & it was easily one of the best bread baskets I've ever had! Lets get real . .  you put thick slices of Stromboli in the basket?!?! Whew. Next we shared the braised short ribs appetizer & with that being said, I'm putting the next sentence in all caps. I HAVE NEVER HAD MORE TENDER! TENDER! TENDER! & BOISTEROUSLY FLAVORFUL SHORT RIBS IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!! (sorry mom lol) . . The meat was falling apart at the mere slightest touch of our forks! I couldn't even believe it. My girlfriend had the spiced duck breast & I took a chance with the goat & we were both floored. Once again the meat selections were SO TENDER & the flavors were ALIVE! I could go on & on about the meal cause trust me it was that good. Not to mention they sent a dessert sampler to the table as a birthday surprise & it was delicious.

3.0,6/9/2012,"After reading all the rave reviews I decided I had to check this place out and went here last weekend. I was able to get a last minute reservation for 2, two hours prior to dinner on a Saturday night. The place was packed and had a nice energetic vibe though I thought the space was a bit crammed and the tables were set up too close to each other. At least this was the case in the dining area by the front bar. I was practically IN the conversation of the table next to us and my husband and I couldn't exactly enjoy a nice romantic dinner date. The bread basket is good and my husband enjoyed it though I guess I was expecting more because of everything  read on yelp. The mascarpone cheese that came with the bread basket was very good. We ordered their spaghetti of course, and the duck ravioli. The spaghetti is definitely something else. I was skeptical at first but it is THE best spaghetti ever. Just the right amount of chewiness and the sauce is very fresh.Overall 3 stars b/c though I would go back just for the spaghetti, the duck ravioli was a bit of a let down, and the space wasn't as fabulous as I thought it would be (maybe if we had been seated in the back main dining area under the sky light it would have been a much more different experience).",1,0,0,Diana L.,"New York, NY",8,31,0
5.0,6/7/2012,"Practically perfect in every way... no not Mary Poppins... Scarpetta! My girlie T took me here as a birthday present, and it really was the gift that kept on giving. All night long everything was exceptional... OK, maybe it started with a bit of a bump in the beginning as we were seated 30 min late for a resie that was already at 9:30 but once we got our table they more than made up for the wait time. I'm always hesitant to head to meatpacking with hostesses on a power trip and overpriced menus... however Scarpetta proves the be the exception of the rule. The service was absolutely impeccable! Our waiter Jose made sure we had a fabulous evening and were treated like royalty. He even brought us an appetizer and a dessert on the house! (Yes, wow... clearly T and I need to get all dressed up more often!!) The sommlier helped us pick out an excellent full bodied wine that was moderately priced. For the most part prices are reasonable for what you are getting, higher end but not ridiculous. The bread basket assortment that arrived was just as good as everyone has raved about. The eggplant dip was excellent, I even ordered a second serving. We started with the braised short ribs and also Jose brought over the fried mozzarella for us as well. Both were quite good, but the short ribs was the clear winner. It simply melted in your mouth, holy food orgasm! Next we shared both the signature Spaghetti and the Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli. Both pasta dishes were truly amazing! The sharing was a great way to do it because the Ravioli was very rich. I was eager to try the Spaghetti as I'd read that Scott Contant used to make this for his ladies in college in order to get a little something something (wink, wink). Well, let me just say had someone made me spaghetti like this in college that someone would have gotten lucky too! A perfect example of how something so simple can taste so perfect and let the ingredients shine. Now I get what all the hype is about. As full as we were at this point we did not want to to pass up on dessert after everything else had been so spectacular. T is more into fruit in her dessert whereas I need something chocolate after a full meal. Yuummmm chocolate! So luckily Jose brought us the Rhubarb Tart to try as well because I don't think T was all that excited about the Birthday Girl's choice on Chocolate cake. All in all it was a wonderful evening and I would highly recommend Scarpetta to anyone with something to celebrate...

From beginning to the end the service was amazingly good. We split the greens salad and the famous polenta. The salad was good, and the polenta is famous for a reason, so smooth and creamy. My mom who has said many times that she hates polenta was licking her spoon clean, she loved it. I had the spaghetti with tomato and basil as my main, and I don't have anything to add that hasn't already been said, but it was simply stellar. The simplest things can be the hardest to execute. My mom had the ravioli and really enjoyed it. My dessert was the chocolate cake, again it was fantastic, and the highlight was the gelato. Also I have to say, the three of us eating all discovered that the bathroom lighting in Scarpetta is amazing!

5.0,5/30/2012,"I've eaten countless great meals, but this is the top of the list. My whole philosophy on restaurants is that I'd rather eat at some cheap diner with good home-cookin' food, than pay way too much at some fancy place for mediocre food.  HOWEVER, that being said, I'm willing to pay for an amazing meal, and Scarpetta was amazing! Went with a friend and we ordered a plate of the regular spaghetti, then also ordered a plate of the special pasta with black truffles that was the special that night. Told the waiter we were going to pass the plates and share them, so he actually brought them split between two plates.  Nice touch of service that most places don't do.As if the main course wasn't amazing enough, the desserts were even more phenomenal.  But I think just about everything there is probably near-perfect.  The one item I would not order again was the Short Ribs appetizer. They certainly weren't horrible, but I've had better and they just weren't nearly as special as every other item we had.But I love it and will return often!",0,1,0,James D.,"Denver, CO",0,6,0

Super soft and super flavorful. The creamy polenta was topped off with some delicious mushrooms, yum. The raw yellowtail was extremely fresh, but my one reservation for this dish was the sea salt sprinkled on top was a bit strong. This restaurant is famous for their simple Spaghetti dish. My expectations were extremely high with all the hype, and yes, it lived up to it! The first bite you're seriously WOWed by the chewy texture of the noodles. The sauce was a perfect balance of sweet and sour. The Duck & Foie Gras Raviola was also delicious - love anything cooked in marsala. However, i thought it was a BIT on the saltier side.

4.0,5/21/2012,"Scott Conant, owner, and his take on Italian cuisine has gotten him the attention of many. Scarpetta is the epitome of a sophisticated modern Italian restaurant. It has earned him a loyal following of New York critiques alike as one of the best chefs in Manhattan. The food - it speaks by itself. Anything from the paste menu will blow your mind. I've eaten most all the staple Italian dishes being served these days - and the one and only place you should try spaghetti and marinara sauce is here. Scarpetta is making their pasta in house and you could clearly tell by the taste and texture. The duck foie gras ravioli is perhaps one of the most decadent pasta dishes I've ever come across.

Feels like you're paying more for the atmosphere than the food.Just a hop, skip, and jump away from meatpacking, so saw plenty of women in short dresses and high heels ;) We called in last minute on a Saturday around 8 and had no problem getting a table. We were seated outside along the building, so we were shielded from the people walking by. Had a guy walk along the perimeter of the outside eating area trying to sell roses to the diners. Not something you want to deal with during dinner..Waited more than a few minutes for the waitress to bring the menus. Good bread selection with sourdough and Stromboli, and a selection of olive oil, eggplant and tomato spread, and some kind of cheese that I didn't try. Started out with the soft shell crab, which was a bit greasy but decent. I was really disappointed by the tagliatelle, which was overcooked to the point of being clumpy and really creamy. Dining partner enjoyed the duck and foie gras ravioli, and the portion was sizeable, especially given that it's a ravioli dish. We finished with the warm rhubarb tart, which was decent - a bit heavy on the macadamia nuts, but the chianti sorbet was delicious.Nice for the people watching, but not so much for the food.",5,2,2,Eva W.,"San Francisco, CA",625,390,15

Both dishes were definitely fresh and tasty, but not $28 tasty. My entree, a veal tenderloin, was good but again not stellar. It was juicy but the portion was minuscule.  I also thought that the accoutrements of the dish didn't go well with the veal itself. There was a vegetable in there that tasted somewhat sour.  My mom and sister had the branzino though and they thought that was delicious.  Overall, a good restaurant but it has not yet proven to me to be a great one yet.",1,0,0,Lauren K.,"Manhattan, NY",38,216,2

4.0,5/16/2012,"i've always had mixed feelings about trying the spaghetti because it is a $24 do spaghetti dish; who pays that much for a dish you can easily make at home, right?although my experience was dampened by a sour man sitting at the table directly next to me, the food was solid.ordered the crispy soft shell crab with asparagus, garlic,  and it was perfect. the asparagus was cut lengthwise and very delicious. soft shell crab is my favorite kind, but only available in the summer season. i will definitely take advantage of it! the braised beef short ribs were underwhelming. the flavors were not clean and seemed a bit heavy to be a primi. i suppose i prefer it to have more flavor that enhances and lightens the heavy meat. finally, the spaghetti with tomato & basil. it was really delicious spaghetti. it is by no means a light noodle, they are almost reminiscent of chow mien noodles in Mongolian bbq dishes.and finally onto the bread basket. it was filled with a variety of breads, but the prosciutto cheese bread was perfectly amazing. so much that i had to take a picture of the perfection. overall, a delightful meal without frills.",0,1,0,Diana Y.,"New York, NY",320,294,493
4.0,5/15/2012,"We arrived promptly at 6:30pm on Sunday for Mother's Day dinner. We were greeted by an aloof hostess who confirmed our reservation and told us it'll be a few minutes. A moment of apprehension later (Is she an indication of the service in this place?), we were approached by a smiling hostess and a gentleman who greeted and wished my mother a Happy Mother's Day (we later figured him to be the manager [and sommelier]) and were seated. I'm happy to say it was smooth sailing from there. Before I get to the food, let me just say - the interior is beautiful. The dark woods and beige wall gives a rustic feel to the place, but the opened ceiling and mirrors attached to the wall by thick orange leather straps makes it trendy as well. We quickly decided on the tasting menu and after the friendly sommelier recommended a very good bottle of wine, we got to noshing on the basket of warm bread that was placed in front of us. OMgosh, the smoked mozzarella and salami bread is outstanding! I could've happily ate this all night. My dad jokingly commented, ""how can this be free?!"" The other breads are good as well (and served warm). They came with 3 ""dips"" - a citrus infused olive oil, a mascarpone cheese spread and a kind of tomato & eggplant purée; all delicious. Our first course was a yellowtail and tuna ""sushi."" A light start to an inevitably heavy Italian meal, the fish seemed to melt in my mouth. If I were to come again, I'd consider getting the yellowtail appetizer a la carte. Our second course was a braised short rib over risotto. The meat was tender and flavorful; the risotto well-cooked. We also got fried mozzarella with basil oil & tomato and polenta with mushrooms and truffle oil served family style. One of the best polenta I've had in my life; it was creamy and smooth and perfect paired with the mushrooms. Our third course was the pasta course. We each got Scott Conant's famous spaghetti with tomato and basil. The sauce is simple yet fragrant of basil; I'm definitely going to try his recipe for this at home. As family style, we were served the rabbit agnolotti, which are like mini raviolis. This dish is a little heavier than the spaghetti, but also enjoyable though a little salty for my taste. For the main courses, we had a choice of the goat or black cod. The black cod dish was wonderful; the fish light and flaky with fennel and tomato. Those who had the goat said it was overly salty because of the pancetta in the dish. I had a bite and did agree, but we do eat less salty than most do at home...At this point, we were stuffed to the brim - what we thought would be a 5 course meal was in reality more like a 8 course meal (not that we were complaining!). Dessert came out and we were shocked to see that we each received different desserts. I think it may have been a first for me. We had the chocolate cake, semifreddo, pecan pie and a rhubarb tart. I'm not much of a dessert person so I didn't really partake but the one bite of each that I took was good. All throughout the meal, various servers came around to refill our waters and wines and occasionally asked how we were doing - unobtrusively. At the end of the night, my very critical parents proclaimed this meal as one of their favorite dining experiences... I commend you, Scarpetta, on a job well done and thank you for making me a good daughter (at least for one night).",2,0,1,Kate Y.,"Queens, NY",218,197,689

The mushrooms are very flavorful and the polenta was creamy with tiny grits in it--really good texture.Short rib risotto - The meat fell apart as soon as you pierce into it--a sure sign that it's amazing. The risotto was perfect, al dente but not hard. My boyfriend actually smiled when he ate it, which is really a big deal for him.Duck foie gras ravioli - My boyfriend ordered this, and he really, really liked it. It was a little rich for me, especially with the marsala reduction.Spaghetti with tomato sauce and basil - This is by far the most famous dish from Scarpetta, but honestly, I can't believe it costs $24. I was expecting really amazing sauce, but it's quite plain. The money goes into the pasta, which does have a really nice bite and texture. It's a lot more dense than most spaghetti. Overall, still a good dish, but really overpriced for average tomato sauce.Lemon semifreddo - I think this was just okay. I was a little put off by the apple and lavender butter though--it has this strange bitter/sour flavor--but the meringues were nice.Coconut panna cotta with guava sauce - So, so good. The guava sauce is delicious. This is perfect for people who don't like coconut, since the flavor of the panna cotta is very mild; it doesn't taste too tropical.

It's not a big plate so if you are very hungry I would go for a scondi piatti versus one of the primi. This being said, it was delicious and unique. My friend had the short ribs and bone marrow agnolotti, which are little raviolis. It was also excellent and quite unique.

Parking garage was near by which was very convenient. It was  hard to find but worth the search. When you walk in  you get that cozy feeling. Everybody was very nice and welcoming. The food was delicious and the portions were decent. Everything was so fresh. I had the duck which came medium rare. It was interesting but rather tasty. My fiancé ordered the octopus ink pasta with seafood. Everything was out of the shell already which made it easier to eat.

4.0,4/18/2012,"So im told its a nice place to get some pasta with tomato and basil. In my head this strikes me as a simple and good idea. I assume this means if you show up for dinner on a weeknight you might show up dressed as simple and good, or ""smart casual"" or some such. Beware, its actually nicer than that.the service is annoyingly polished, too smug perhaps (the pastas are unveiled at the table from their solver domes), but on point.Lots of dates of finance-y looking dudes and the blondes that they seem to attract, all in jackets, dresses, proper shoes, its all a bit grown upThe food itself is very good. Every appetizer i've had has been good, the pastas excellent, and the mains very good, so i guess thats your average mark. Now granted it may be a bit odd to spend like 30 bucks on a pasta dish that lacks anything but pasta, tomato, basil, no truffle, no foie gras, no lobster, no caviar, no wagyu, nothing of the sort. But its some fantastic pasta, perfectly executed for what it is, and its pretty spectacularAt the end, after a well proportioned meal, a couple of glasses of valpolicella flickering behind the eyes, you'll walk out content, missing a chunk of your tax return, and thinking next time i'm wearing a blazer",0,0,1,avi d.,"New York, NY",18,115,0

Right away we were greeted with a very friendly waiter, and he helped pick out a bottle of wine. Extremely knowledgeable when it came to the wine list, and he directed us to a delicious perfect bottle of wine.It is beautiful inside, it is very busy but not too loud. Aside from it being busy it remained intimate and is a great spot for dates.Bread basket is awesome, and the fact that they give you capponata, mascarpone butter, and olive oil to dip makes it even better.  We had:Scallop Appetizer: Delicious!!!! Scallops were perfectly cooked, soft in the middle with amazing flavor. I wish there were about 10 more on the plate.Tuna Appetizer: Looks like a sushi roll, again, delicious. Great flavor and a very nice portion size. Short Rib Appetizer: My boyfriend had this one. It was over risotto, and he loved it, The meat was falling apart, and it was packed with flavor.The Cod Entree: So so so so good. The filet was flaky and delicious. I loved the sunchokes underneath, and the tomato sauce was wonderful. It was sweet and savory at the same time. Highly recommend.Sirloin Entree: My boyfriend had this. Perfectly cooked, he ate every last bite. Cooked medium rare, and it was the perfect amount of red. Rhubarb Crisp: Great ending to a great meal.

4.0,4/4/2012,"Wonderful place to celebreate a special occasion.  The ambiance is casual but still formal at the same time - this is probably because the service is so incredibly attentive but not pretentious at all.  We thoroughly enjoyed the famed bread basket, especially the fiance because I don't eat pork and thus did not partake in the stromboli.  The waiter even gave us more stromboli when we asked.  We started with the polenta with mushrooms, which was incredibly rich and delicious.  We then split the spaghetti with tomato sauce and a special vegetarian tagliatelle with winter root vegetables (you have to ask for the vegetarian menu).  The spaghetti was definitely worth the $24 pricetag (it was a special occasion!) and the tagliatelle was also quite tasty.  The portions, although small in appearance, were actually a decent size, and we were stuffed after the bread, appetizers, and entrees.  To finish, I got a cappuccino and the fiance got the carrot cake dessert.  I couldn't even take a bite because I was so full, but he said that it was one of the best desserts he's ever had, which is quite a compliment coming from this guy.  The cappuccino was above average for a restaurant but not as good as, like, Stumptown, obviously.  And then the petit fours came, which we pretty much devoured, except for the weird marshmellow-looking thing.My only complaint about the food is that the polenta and tagliatelle both had so much cream that they tasted almost the same.  That's probably more of my fault for ordering two things that were similar, but it wasn't clear from the menu that the tagliatelle came with a cream sauce.My only non-food-related complaint is the ""B"" health dept. rating that I happened to see on my way out.  Not something you want to see after dinner, but I'm sure the kitchen's okay... right?",1,0,0,Rachel G.,"Queens, NY",60,262,5

I actually felt under-dressed, even after changing to come here.  We were led in and immediately seated in a nice romantic, plushy corner seat. AWESOMESAUCE ALERT! Signs of a romantic night to come ; ) We were served with the complimentary bread which they had like three-four different types including a stuffed cheese bread and some rye/Italian style variations.

We were seated after they checked our coats and were given a basket of breads including stromboli which was delicious (to say the least)! I was a little skiddish about the menu, and reluctantly went with the duck ravioli after reading several yelp reviews. My parents ordered the same and my boyfriend went with a safe bet...the spaghetti. I had never eaten duck before and I was shocked and awed at how delicious my dish was! My parents also loved it! My boyfriend said his spaghetti was the best he has ever eaten. Now...the dessert. O.M.G. I got the chocolate cake with salted caramel gelato...to die for! My bf got the pecan bar which was also delicious!

5.0,3/12/2012,"Though Chef Scott Conant may come off as a prickly, arrogant judge on the Food Network's Chopped, his restaurant is everything but pretentious. Dimly lit with a modern and sexy vibe, Scarpetta is definitely not your Italian grandmother's kitchen, but the food sure tastes like it. The menu is packed with flavorful renditions of classic Italian dishes such as polenta, braised short ribs, and of course, pasta - fresh and homemade. Although the prices are on the steep side, there's really no need to order anything more than wine and one of their celebrated pasta entrees. Once you sit, you are greeted with a delicious (and complimentary) assortment of bread alongside whipped mascarpone butter, eggplant marinara, and olive oils. Truthfully, I could have been a very happy girl left alone with that bread basket and a glass of red. However, that was until I tried the homemade cavatelli with rabbit ragu. Rich and tender, this was certainly one of the most divine, and unique, dishes I've had and to echo my earlier sentiments, not a skimpy portion!

It would later make the perfect location for me to sneak away and request a special Happy Birthday dessert be presented to him later in the evening. Moohahahaha. Our initial waiter wasn't very warm or smiley, but he definitely got the job done.  Their bread basket w/ whipped mascarpone butter, eggplant marinara, & olive oil dips was amazeballs. The stromboli bread was by far one of the best things I've ever tasted in my life - it completely blew our minds! I'm also a huge eggplant fan so I couldn't stop myself from eating up the dip. Yum! We ordered the below, per Yelp of course, and all our dishes came out in quick succession to one another but did not feel rushed.We had: * Creamy Polenta - omg what is this?! I could only compare this to mushy and delicious buttery grits. Turns out polenta is actually cornmeal! The truffle, mushroom, and polenta made every single bite memorable. Mm mm mm. I forced Jimmy to finish the rest of mine before I devoured the entire thing and had no room for the pastas.* Spaghetti - served w. tomato & basil, a simple dish that reminded me of home...or at least what I would envision an Italian home would be like ;) The sauce was incredibly creamy and not as tart and tomato-y as I feared. I actually finished up this entire dish & I rarely finish dishes at restaurants! Totally worth the $24.* Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli - I thought this was an extremely rich dish that was heavily foie gras flavored but still mighty tasty. I'm glad we shared our pasta dishes because I could definitely not eat more than a few pieces of it. Jimmy thought that this dish had an Asian flair to it ;)We also ordered two cocktails & the coconut panna cotta (w. guava sauce & caramelized pineapple). The Arancio In Fiore and La Sporca Bacca cocktails were pretty darn strong - even for a resident alcoholic like me! I couldn't finish mine (but mainly because it was way too olive-y/gin-y for my liking). The dessert was fabulous....preeeeeetty sure it blew Jimmy's mind away ;) As a part of his birthday, our waiter also brought out a plate of sweets with ""Happy Birthday"" written out in chocolate. The plate contained macarons, truffles, marshmallows, toffee brittle - the works! Everything was so good and we packed the rest to save for later.

I was excited to try it out because Scott Conant is touted in the celebrity restaurant world, yet I was a tad skeptical because I am of Italian-American descent. Well Scarpetta meets my approval. We ordered the creamy polenta with the wild mushroom sauce and the braised beef short ribs for apps. Both were tasty though I'm not a huge fan of polenta (the mushrooms made up for it, as did the presentation of ladling the warm mushroom sauce over the polenta, nice touch by the wait staff). I must say the entrees didn't really speak to me, so we skipped secondi and stuck with primi and ordered the spaghetti with tomato sauce and the tagliatelle with guanciale (pork cheeks) and veggies in a truffle zabaglione sauce. The spaghetti was delish and may have even been better in its simplicity. The tagliatelle were decadently delectable.

3.0,2/4/2012,"The restaurant is very nice, good service, we had three pasta dishes just to get a variety but I really only liked one. The best was a take on pasta carabonara using guanciale instead of bacon. Very delicious. The one that most people yelped about was a duck and foie gras ravioli. I found this one strange because it was adorned with stripes of a sauce that tasted very much like Hoisin. I really thought this was going to be a restaurant where Italian flavors were predominant but this was a weird Asian fusion, Peking duck kind of thing. The last was a pumpkin tortellini kind of thing which was so sweet and full of nutmeg it felt like eating a pumpkin mousse and could have served as a dessert.

I was totally unprepared.  I didn't read the menu and I only glanced at a few reviews.  I was going to be spontaenous... someone alert the authorities!I'm so glad I went ""blind"" because I was so surprised and happy with the menu.  Between the 4 of us, we ordered 4 appetizers, 4 pastas, 3 entrees, and 2 desserts.   The creamy polenta was amazing (and I'm not usually a fan).  The short rib and bone marrow pasta had the perfect texture and also delicious.  I think the stars were the pasta dishes, but then again, maybe we were just full by the time the entrees came out.  Oh, and like others have already noted, the duck and foie gras ravioli is... orgasmic.  Don't believe in food orgasms?  Try this and you'll get what I  mean.And yes, that bread basket is great.  I love the different accompaniments that came with it.

I don't care if the chef himself flew to Italy to handpick the tomatoes for the sauce and the wheat for the spaghetti, there is just no way to justify paying $24 for a plate of spaghetti.

We're sat in the front of the restaurant by the windows (cute spot you think) until the roof starts leaking...on us. Someone then says, oh would you like to move to another table. Um, yes. So we walk up to the hostess stand, which is only like 2 feet away from where we're sitting and she looks at us quizzically and says, ""Oh do you have a question?"" Um no, someone told us that we could move tables because your roof is leaking. So they find another table for us in the back of the restaurant and the waiter comes over and is completely oblivious to what has transpired thus far. Honestly, we just wanted someone to apologize for the roof leaking ON us. So finally we tell the waiter what's happened and that we're upset no one has even acknowledged that it has occurred. And he says word for word, ""So what do you want me to do? Get you a napkin?"" Are you serious, Scott? How rude. I was so shocked and none of us even know how to respond. Finally the manager comes over and apologizes and offers to send out some apps on the house. I can't even believe this happened in a place like Scarpetta. Anyway, the entire dining experience was tainted after this. The food was ok. Not bad, but not amazing. If you're looking for great italian, I suggest you go to other places in the city.

Until now.   Mozzarella in Carozza was up next.  Served with tomatoes, it was crispy and not one bit greasy or soggy.  Perfect!My main course was the roasted organic chicken that had a taste that would make vegetarians rethink their stances thanks to a crispy skin and juicy meat.  The secret seems to be in the brining, but I won't tell.Dessert was equally impressive.  We ordered the still warm chocolate cake, which had an inside so deliciously gooey, it reminded me of a chocolate soufflet.  Served alongside a caramel ice-cream, the flavors seemed to complement one another perfectly.As I lay here on my back, unable to move, my only suggestion would be to rename the place Scarf-etta, as I seemed to scarf down everything but the wallpaper!Our server Jorge was the best.  Friendly, outgoing and more importantly a fan of the food he proudly serves, he made our dining experience something special.Thanks Scarpetta and thanks Jorge!I'm so glad Scarpetta has a branch in Beverly Hills, so that this L.A. native can enjoy fine Italian dining all year long!No hesitation donning the five star review for a place this amazing.  Don't believe me?

3.0,12/20/2011,"""Fare la scarpetta"": mopping your plate clean with a piece of bread.Classy place for dressy people with money who like expensive Italian food.Cocktails are $14, and are a bit of a hit-or-miss.- Hit: Lillet, Elderflower liquor, vodka. Bold and flavorful cocktail; I really enjoyed it.- Miss: the San Remo (Carpano Antica, Campari, Elderflower liquor, bourbon) was fairly light, nicely balanced in taste, with a dominant citrusy flavor. The problem with using crushed ice in a cocktail is that it melts quickly, and therefore your cocktail will become watery very fast. If the cocktail is light in alcohol, mild in taste, and watered down, that is a problem.The wine list is nothing short of spectacular. I was very impresses by the vast variety of Italian wines available. Also, the choice of wines by the glass is pretty extensive, and many are also offered by the half bottle. The beer list, on the other hand, is almost non-existent.Our special langoustine appetizer ($24) was delicious: thin slices of delicious raw crustacean dressed with a fennel reduction, grapefruit, and pine nuts. I really liked the freshness of this dish, and how well the flavor of the pine nuts went with the sweetness of the langoustine. Most regular appetizers are priced just below $20.You can look at the spaghetti dish two ways:Either you will see this dish (made with handmade egg pasta, tomatoes, basil, and nothing else) as a homage to the most classic and simple Italian pasta dish, or you'll  wonder how a simple spaghetti dish that only has tomatoes and basil can cost a whopping $24. Either way, these spaghetti are delicious.The turbot with Tuscan kale, salsify and mussles ($33) was good, but nothing spectacular given the hefty price. The salsify accompanied the delicate taste of the turbot very well, while the slightly bitter taste of the kale offered a good contrast. The mussels, however, just seemed like an afterthought. Perhaps next time I'll try the moist-roasted baby goat.I felt that a few things were not quite up to par with the kind of dough you drop here:I. Tables in the room by the entrance are tiny! I definitely recommend getting one dish at a time, otherwise you won't have enough room. Even having two glasses on the table (wine and water) plus one dish is going to be a challenge. II. Our server was great: knowledgeable, unintrusive, and enthusiastic. However, 20-25 minutes in between courses is way too long. We had to inquire about our main course, which is never a good thing. Granted, the restaurant was busy; but if you cannot get the dishes out of the kitchen in a timely fashion on a Wednesday night, I wonder how you're going to cope when the restaurant gets really busy during the weekend.III. Ask to be seated in the main dining room, under the beautiful skylight. The dining area where the bar is is rather ordinary (but the dishes are equally expensive).Final verdict: 3 1/2 stars. Too expensive for what it has to offer.",30,18,21,Matteo R.,"Brooklyn, NY",703,698,3183
2.0,12/19/2011,"As we approached the restaurant I was shocked to see they had been awarded a B grade, I mean, seriously? Surely a restauarant with this kind of reputation should be able to muster an A. Had we not been meeting friends there we would have chosen not to eat there at all. Deciding to attempt to keep an open mind we entered a ridiculously packed restaurant. As our friends were delayed by 10 mins we were instructed, and I select that word carefully, by a very snippy girl to take a seat at the bar. We would have been happy to do this but as we approcahed the bar the staff quickly slapped down reservation signs and wouldn't even let us perch on the four empty barstools whilst we enjoyed our extremely over priced drinks. I explained to the girl at the front of house that I had a really bad back and it would help enormously if I could just sit down at the bar for 5 minutes. It was at this point that I had the misfortune to encounter possibly the rudest, most sour faced maitre D' that I have ever encountered. Guests in the bar area were actually laughing at how ill humored she was with everyone. Can it really be necessary to speak to everyone as if they are extremely stupid or they are a major inconvenience? Silly me, there was I thinking her job might be to make people feel welcome. On hearing of my bad back she slammed a chair down next to the coat area and demanded I sit at a distant point at the top of the stairs. So that is me on the naughty step then..It was a relief to finally be able to move into the main dining room given that the bar was a place of exceptionally high tension with several would-be diners looking close to rebellion. At least the Maitre D had given us all something to laugh about. The food was quite nice, all four of us agreed that it was more than passable but madly expensive for what it was.The menu was small and not enormously interesting. In stark contrast to the horror of front of house, the staff in the dining room were really nice, efficient and knowlegeable. Sadly by then the damage was done and no amount of niceness could make up for what had gone before. So we called it a night and decided to leave. As we made a bolt for the exit we were slightly delayed by the need to retrieve our coats and that is when the fun really began. As I approached the front dest, ticket in hand, it was wordlessly snatched from my hand and a sour faced servant of the high priestess of rudeness, aforementioned Maitre D, scurried off to find our coats. Imagine my joy when she returned with two jackets which bore no ressemblance to my rather lovely shearling coat. When I said they were not mine, she asked whether I was sure, seriously you couldn't make this up... She was clearly outraged that her word should be challenged and stomped back to the coat closet. After a few minutes I went to the closet myself to see for myself what was going on. Clearly all that was going on was confusion and more displays of bad temper as coat closet lady and my ticket lady disagreed on how the coats were organized (or not, as the case turned out). After rummaging about she found my coat based on my description but clearly had no idea whether it was really mine or not. It struck me that for those who are less than honest this could be a fabulous way to upgrade your winter coat. No apology nor explanation were offered. I expressed concern that coats could be so easily lost and in return all I got was another grimace. Could this be part of the training at Scarpetta? Perhaps they have decided that they just have too many customers, so by having rude staff and a slightly dodgy B grade that will be a surefire way of having to deal with far fewer of  us pesky customers.

We were really confused but of course more than happy to accept. Let me tell you, it was the MOST amazing pumpkin ravioli I've EVER had!! The pasta was so silky smooth, the pumpkin was well flavored and pureed and the crispy almond bits on top just sealed the deal. I went home to check at how much it actually costs on the menu and they gave us a free $24 dollar entree. :O Awesome! Then came out the Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli and Spaghetti. Both plates were delicious also. I did find the Ravioli to be a bit too rich to eat as an entree by yourself but good to share with someone. The spaghetti also was delicious and it was just one of those simple pastas that you can't stop eating. I don't know if I'd say it was worth the money since it still really is spaghetti in tomato sauce but I was glad to have tried it. The suprise still though was that my favorite dish was the pumpkin casonsei. MMMM!!!I had a great dinner experience here and left extremely stuffed and was unable to try their desserts. :( Next time Scarpetta!",2,2,3,Annie M.,"San Francisco, CA",222,190,372

I ordered the yellowtail, which was a nice refreshing starter but nothing special. Comments on the bread basket are true. We shamelessly asked for another helping. It comes with delicious ricotta and eggplant spread. I ordered the bone marrow agnolotti, which seemed like a small portion but it was so rich I was definitely full by the end. For dessert, I shared the panna cotta, which is not worth trying at all. We ordered sheep's ricotta for the table. Skip it here and get your fix at Locanda Verde.

I wasn't too excited about the horseradish, but you couldn't really taste it.  Actually you couldn't really taste much of anything in the dish.  The raviolis were REALLY small.  Too small to really fit any bone marrow or short ribs.  Hmph.  AND, after eating a few bites,..I FOUND A HAIR IN MY ENTREE.  wtf.  I was disgusted and appalled that a high end restaurant let this happen.  ugh.  and of course, not wanting to cause a scene, I told a passing waiter and he said sorry.  He told my waitress, and she came and she said sorry.  And the was IT.  I got a new plate.  and THAT WAS IT.  no more apologies, no free stuff, and we were even billed for my plate.  WTF.  even the small restaurants know that you take it off the bill.  I was pretty angry.  Perhaps I should have caused a scene and yelled and screamed.  ugh.  Then we ordered the panna cotta with guava puree.  At least, this kind of calmed down my nerves because it was freakin delicious.  Best panna cotta I've had.  Still thinking about it.  But really, Scott Conant, make sure your staff treats your guests right.  Even if they're not rich and snotty THey're still paying customers. :P",3,3,2,Carrie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",268,623,1006

It was perfectly cooked and paired perfectly with the saffron semolina and bone marrow. -The ricotta with truffle honey was delicious but not completely unique. The honey comb and fennel pollen really enhanced the cheese and truffle flavor but I was taken aback by how ridiculously small the portion was. You can go to Locanda Verde and get this exact dish for the same price but get 4x the amount. The cheese at LV is better anyway.-Toffee pudding: I was extremely unimpressed by this dish aside form the Guiness ice cream.-Pana cotta was bright and fresh.

We had a bottle of red wine (which I don't remember the name of) and delicious entrees. Mine was Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli and it was mindblowing! When you bite into each ravioli, you taste duck meat then slowly turns into foie gras. Delicious!! - not too oily or dry or smelly. My friends had Spaghetti with tomato and basil, Sheep milk ricotta raviolini and Short rib & bone marrow agnolotti. Other than ricotta raviolini being somewhat bland, the portions were good and flavors were just right. I would definitely recommend Scarpetta.

The complimentary bread served with eggplant, butter, and oil dipping sauce was very good. I specifically came here for the spaghetti featured on ""The Best Thing I Ever Ate"" so I ordered it. $24 for a tiny amount of spaghetti??? A little steep but it was veryyyyyy worth it! I also ordered the tagliatelle ($28), had a lot of meat and was a much bigger portion than the spaghetti but not nearly as good, even though it was still wonderful. All in all, I can see why they're so famous! The menu is small but I can tell it's because they focus on the few plates they make to perfection instead of having a huge variety.

The Braised Short Ribs was quite delicious, it was full of flavor, somewhat moist and fell off the bone relatively easy.

Black tagiolini with seafood ragout was a nice combination of shell fish and light sauce.  Seafood flavor really came through.  Perfectly cooked pasta.  I will remember this dish.2. Spaghetti with tomato sauce had great flavor, but the spaghetti was a little overcooked.  In fact, it reminded me of a really well made Chinese lo-mein noodle.  Nevertheless, worth a try if you haven't tried it.3. Short rib and bone marrow agniolotti:  The garlic chips and horseradish make this dish.  Very unique.  Also, pasta is super thin.  Can't imagine how difficult it is to make this pasta.  4.  Cavatelli with rabbit ragu:  Nice flavors, good chewiness to pasta.  Rabbit tasted like chicken...  which is probably a good thing?Service was fine, wine was good, and there was just enough pretense by the staff to make it feel like NY restaurant.",0,0,0,Richard K.,"San Francisco, CA",7,60,0

(I actually ate both portions of the split appetizer.  Oops.)  Sirloin was ordered well done but I'm sure it would've been great cooked to a normal temperature.  The baby vegetables that came with it makes eating babies my new hobby.  Dessert of Chocolate Cake was super rich and very chocolaty.  The salted caramel ice cream was a great complement as was the super chocolaty chip that came with it.  By the time dessert came, I was already pretty tipsy from the bottle of wine and the Negroni before dinner.  Wine, by the way, was recommended by the sommelier who was super friendly despite my total ignorance and poor taste when it comes to wine.  You'd think with all the wine tasting I've done in my lifetime I would've learned something useful to say when people ask me what I like by now.  One last thing:  The bread was so bomb.  Faccocia and the  salami and cheese stuffed roll were so delicious I kind of wished it was Olive Garden and I could have unlimited rounds of just the bread.  Can't wait to go back!-------------------------------------* So the only complaint I had about the entire experience was the ladies room.  For some reason, the stall I was in was pitch black.  I thought I was peeing in a scary outhouse or something.  I checked the other stalls and it was just my bad luck to end up in the one with the barely functioning fancy lightbulb.",6,5,4,Margaret T.,"Brooklyn, NY",530,358,80

4.0,7/9/2011,"I scheduled a meetup with two friends one hot humid weekday evening in meatpacking. They arrived before me, and selected an outdoor spot at a Mexican themed  bistro. While they had margarita's they complained to each other about the heat, sun & humidity.By the time I arrived they were so uncomfortable from the heat that all they wanted to do was get inside out of the sun.When I pointed across the street to the building where Scarpetta is, they both looked at each other as if to say, maybe we want to consider somewhere else. The exterior of the building looks like the aluminum sided homes found throughout New Jersey, so I understood their chagrin.Never the less, I persisted and assured them thy would not be disappointed. We walked thru the threshold of the restaurant and were greeted by two smiling faces that asked if we wanted dinner for 3. We decided to sit at the bar as we only had about an hour. Well, I ordered a bottle of sparkling wine (prosecco) and the frito misto. If you could have seen the look on the face of my two friends when the frito misto arrived. It was a tower of thinly sliced calamari, lightly battered in the most delicious delicate batter you could imaging. But wait, what was jaw droppingly delicious was the rosemary and basil that were lightly battered too and tossed with the calamari to make an incredibly wonderful and flavorful party in your mouth with every bite.Now that I had won my com-padres over the the wonders to be experienced behind the un impressive faced of the restaurant. They really began to relax and look around. They saw a back room that had filled with an impressive crowd of well dressed diners. The polite and very professional wait staff zipping about serving and attending to each patron and table with ease. The dark woods on the walls,, tables and counters balanced with the light browns and tan fabrics fell warm like an afternoon sunset. So, with everything now in order and my pair of foody friends completely smitten with the unexpected delights of Scarpetta, I ordered two orders of the home made pasta noodle and marinara split three ways. Well as you expect by the tenor of this story so far the the dish was going to be incredible, well it was but even before we could experience the taste we were presented with two white platters topped with these interesting white domes (presentation matters). When we uncovered them we found the most aromatic dish of pasta that any of us had experienced in a while. I mean dishes like this are routine in italy, but we were in meatpacking. The flavors were infused into the pasta but not so much dominating the pasta but allowing each texture and flavor to somehow express its note and feel before the next flavor stood up to your taste buds and said politely , what about me.We could have stayed for hours drinking Prosecco and eating each delicate course until, well until I don't know when because Scarpetta is one of those gems where everything makes you feel bello contente!",2,2,0,Arthur J.,"New York, NY",366,22,1

3.0,5/29/2011,"We ate at Scarpetta last night.  If I had known in advance that it was Scott Conant's restaurant, I would have had higher expecations because I just expect perfection from him since he seems to be a perfectionist on TV.  None the less, I enjoyed my meal.  We had a 10 pm reservation and decided to eat outside since it was very loud inside and we wanted to talk.  We had been seated for about 5 minutes when a lady walks up to us (not at the restaurant), takes our candle to light her cigarette, blows a puff at our table, and walks away.  Ugh.  For our appetizers, we got the braised short rib on my sister's recommendation - it was good but tasted like any other braised short rib - nothing memorable and not worth the $.  We also got the yellow tail - again, good, fresh, but not memorable at all.  Our third app was the house spaghetti with marinara sauce.  We wanted to try the fresh pasta.  It was good and the pasta tasted very rich and decadent but the flavor of the sauce was flat.  No one came by asking if we wanted fresh pepper or cheese.  We ate it, but again, it was just so so.  They bring you a bread basket with 4 or 5 different breads.  The breads were very good, especially the stromboli bread.  They also bring you 3 dippers with the bread.For my entree - I got the Halibut, which was wonderful.  The fish was cooked perfectly and I was very happy with it.  The fish is what saved this place for me.  We got also got a dessert, some chocolate concoction with salted caramel ice cream.  It was very good.  Give this place a try if you are able to get a reservation but I would not put this on my ""go back to the next time I'm in NYC list.""",1,2,0,Lyla A.,"Round Rock, TX",274,548,1228
5.0,5/23/2011,"I can't even begin to describe how incredible this meal was. From the moment we walked in I was thoroughly impressed! The restaurant is gorgeous, the service is fantastic and the food is out of this world. I tried to not let the hype raise my expectations after a recent letdown at Babbo, but Scarpetta is completely deserving of every bit of hype it gets!I'd come here for the bread basket alone. By far one of the best in the city- not just for the ""calzone"" bread, but the other types were great as well. I also really enjoyed that it was served with butter, olive oil and their tomato basil spread. For an appetizer I had to have the polenta with truffle mushrooms. I'm obsessed with polenta and this was heaven! I love that they serve the mushrooms separately allowing me to add the flavor as I worked my way through the dish. I'd recommend any polenta fan to order this!After hearing so much about the famous spaghetti with tomato and basil, I couldn't help but feel like I had to try it. While I'm typically not wowed by a pasta in a tomato sauce, I find myself unable to describe it by any word other than ""wow"". The texture of the pasta along with the different flavors made me realize why this is one of their signature dishes. I knew that after the bread basket, polenta and spaghetti I wouldn't have much room for a main course, so I decided have the short ribs appetizer as my entree. While they were delicious and tender, I wasn't able to fully appreciate them as I was already full at that point. My boyfriend had the short ribs as his appetizer and ranked them as his 2nd favorite in the city (pretty high honor considering it's his usual order at any upscale restaurant). He then ordered the pasta, which he agreed was amazing, followed by the roasted chicken for his entree. He raved about the chicken being the best he's had, even better than his previous favorite at Maialino. I was so full that I was ready to not order dessert....that is until salty caramel gelato was spotted as being served with the chocolate cake. Being my favorite ice cream flavor ever, it seems like my arm was twisted to order dessert. I am SO glad it was! The chocolate cake, while teeny, was so rich that I only wanted a few bites. It paired perfectly with the salty caramel gelato and was an exquisite end to a ridiculously great meal!",2,2,0,Jen G.,"New York, NY",36,188,0
5.0,5/19/2011,"Every time I come to Scarpetta, I seem to love the food more and more. Not only is the food delicious, but the service, drinks and atmosphere are great. To start, the break basket is amazing, but extremely filling. The yellowtail with sea salt is the perfect combination and isn't an overwhelming appetizer. If you are looking for something more filling, the creamy polenta is great, but beware, this dish is heavy. I was not too impressed with the burrata here, but everything else makes up for it. The pasta at Scarpetta is unbelievable, and takes nouveau-Italian cuisine to a new level. The short rib and bone marrow agnolotti, black tagliolini and duck & foie gras ravioli are all amazing. I would stick to the pasta as an entree since it is filling and better than the other entrees.

5.0,5/16/2011,"I just happened to look for a restaurant to go to prior to the entertainment of the Robin Hood Foundation's benefit last week, and came across Scarpetta, and their 3 year anniversary menu.  At first, I thought I wouldn't get a reservation, since the original 5:30 seating I saw was gone within 3 minutes, but after refreshing the page several times, it came back up, and of course I had to take it, since there wasn't an opening again until the end of the week.It was a little difficult to find, mainly because we were walking on the opposite side of the street, and the sign saying ""Scarpetta"" can really only be seen on the same side.  However, they did have large numbers for the street address, which made it easier to find from the opposite side, after I had to look up the address.  We came in and sat at the bar, and glanced at their drink menu.  I wasn't really feeling a drink, but my bf got a captain and ginger, and I just got a soda, which ended up being about $18.We were seated in one of the booth/chair set ups.  I didn't think the booth would be as comfortable as it was, since it appeared to be at a 90 degree angle, but it wasn't too bad.  The decor was really nice and home-y; very comfortable to sit in.  The best part was the sunroofs that were open, allowing fresh air and sunshine in.We chose from the 3 year anniversary menu, because we were able to try many items all at once.  I had the creamy polenta, spaghetti, duck breast, and chocolate cake.  He had the yellowtail, short rib and bone marrow agnolotti, black cod, and mango and white chocolate napoleon.  Everything was absolutely amazing.  The creamy polenta was served separately from the mushrooms, which was nice because I was able to add as I ate, rather than mix all at once.  The spaghetti was to die for...simple, but very tasty.  The duck was cooked perfectly, and the chocolate cake was very rich too.  I had a cup of coffee, which helped wash it down.The yellowtail was very nice, the salt on top gave a nice texture and taste contrast.  The agnolotti was very smooth and rich in flavor.  The black cod was great; crispy skin with a moist, tender texture to the fish.  I saved the best for last.  I think the napoleon was impeccable.  The mango mousse was full of mango flavor, and they provided thin sheets of white chocolate, which balanced with the mango.I appreciated the fact that despite being a prix fixe menu, they did not mess up the quality of the food that came out.  Everything was excellent.It was pretty quiet, even when the dining room was 3/4 full, which was nice, so we didn't have to yell across the table.  It was also cool to see Bob Tuschman, from the Food Network, also in the restaurant.  To me, it said that this restaurant is good, if he enjoys going there too.All in all, we will definitely be back.  I cannot wait for the spaghetti and napoleon again!",0,0,0,Hannah D.,"Massapequa, NY",7,43,5

I know, it's a little too early to say, but I think it's love at first bite.Fast forward to 4 weeks earlier, in early April. I was in high anticipation of when Scarpetta NYC would announce their 3-year anniversary menu. I had scoured the internet for hints as to which week it would be. Notably, they make the announcement around the end of April and it's generally around Mother's Day Weekend. So NATURALLY, I made 5 reservations trying to guess which week it would be. Ok, I am a reservation whore, but I could not miss this meal after hearing taunts from my friends about the ""dinner from heaven.""*Damn you friends! *shaking fistWell the announcement came and I rejoiced that the day was fast coming.

I scoured the internet for the recipe and I will attempt to make it. The duck breast was cooked exactly as I like it, where it has a nice bite to it, but not overly chewy. Chocolate cake? Hells yeah! My friend ate most of it when I let him have ""a bite."" (Thanks a lot).As for the wine pairings - AMAZING. The white was the best, I have to admit, but I've always been a bit more partial to whites.For $50, it is absolutely a deal that cannot be missed. And yes, I will be back on non-anniversary dates.

5.0,4/30/2011,"Dinner are Scarpetta was a wonderfully delicious experience - very intimate at night, with a skylight to brighten the dining room during the day.Fresh bread is taken to a new level as Scarpetta stuffs it with salami and cheese. With the mascarpone butter, I could eat this all day.Braised beef short ribs with vegetable & farro risotto was tender and delicious; the risotto perfectly cooked and rich. However, I felt that it didn't bring anything exciting or new to the table with regards to short ribs. But don't get me wrong, this is comfort food and will bring a smile to your face no matter how hard your day was.Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli with marsala reduction, on the other hand, was spectacular. Rich and creamy with the earthiness you would find with game birds, but not overpowering at all.The spaghetti with tomato and basil is simply how spaghetti should be served. Simple and clean flavored. Al dente noodles dressed lightly in a fresh tomato sauce that wasn't seasoned by a heavy handed chef.The final main course for the night was the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti. I was the least impressed with this one. The flavors were muddled and didn't stand out well.Finally, dessert. The chocolate bomb with passion fruit was a luxuriously smooth chocolate mousse surrounding passion fruit mousse in the center. And the mini (one bite mini) ice cream sandwiches were delicious with the mango slices.

5.0,4/25/2011,"Okay, so since my last review I've been here two more times and now I can officially say this is my new favorite restaurant.Highlights are still the menu items I got during my initial visit: the DIVINE polenta, and the FAMAZING spaghetti.I've also tried a number of other dishes since my initial visit thanks to the fact that I impose Chinese eating values on my friends who come here with me, ie insist that we order lots of food and share all of it instead of each getting his/her own entree. Since I'm the food authority among my friendies, this method works well. Anywho.Primi Piatti:Crispy Fritto Misto aka Scarpetta style calamari. Pretty damn good. It's just simple calamari done well, nothing particularly fancy but that's the beauty of Scarpetta: well executed simple dishes.Braised Short Ribs of Beef: very tender and flavorful. I enjoyed it thoroughly while eating it but remembering back it isn't particularly something that blows my mind the way the POLENTAOMGTHEPOLENTA does.Raw Yellowtail with olio di zenzero & flaked sea salt: four little pieces of yellowtail perfection. You have to really be able to appreciate raw fish. It's very fresh and simple, and the fish isn't drowned/masked by excessive flavoring or other alteration. Again, simple quality.Pasta:SpaghettiThe friggin Spaghetti (please capitalize) with tomato and basil just gets better each time you eat it. I said I wouldn't order it again. Well I've ordered it two more times now and I think I could eat this every day (but I won't or it won't be as special anymore. Also because $24 pasta dish/day doesn't fly well with my college student/unpaid intern status). My friends ask me, Lena, how can you justify spending $24 on a ball of spaghetti that literally only has tomato sauce--not even any meat at all--don't you think that's a huge waste of money? And depending on the asker I either say, a) young padawan, you have not tasted divinity yet; b) $24 is not bad when you consider the existences of places like Per Se or Daniel or Jean Georges; c) you are not bourgeois enough for me to be having this conversation with you. JUST KIDDING ABOUT THE LAST ANSWER. But I had to ramble a little for the review of the Spaghetti because it's that friggin flavorful/perfectly al dente/general PERFECTION. It's what every Barilla noodle aspires to be and then fails to achieve and then realizes its inferiority and then shrivels the fuck up and ends up on the shelves of Eataly.Duck and Fois Gras Ravioli with marsala reductionCreamy, buttery, fois gras perfection in thin but al dente pockets of pasta skin. With sweet marsala reduction drizzled over it. Again, well executed.Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti with garlic chips & fresh horseradishThis was actually a really tiny dish, one of my famished guy friends ordered this, saw it, and was like whaaa? I tried a piece, it was good, but I remember not being as blown away as I'd hoped when I saw the words ""bone marrow.""Black Tagliolini with seafood ragout & basil bread crumbsAnother dish I only had a bite of, like 3 or 4 weeks ago so my memory is a little stale, but it was quite delicious if I recall correctly. Not the way the Spaghetti is, but good in its own right. And it was a MASSIVE mound of pasta, if that matters to you at all.PiattiBranzino with endive, pancetta & rosemary-braised lentils  The ultimate pan searing perfection. The skin was perfectly crisp without being even in danger of burnt, and the flesh was cooked thoroughly enough without losing moisture. The rosemary-braised lentils complemented the fish nicely--nothing overly fancy, as with all other menu items. Just simple, high quality, well-executed.I've actually never had dessert here because I'm always so full from the food and oh of course who could forget the BREAD BASKET, which they will bring you another of if you finish yours and keep looking longingly at the empty white napkin folded into the black wire basket. Trust me, service is good enough you won't have to stare too long.And speaking of service, I've never had exceptionally mind blowing service here before, and once when I sat at the bar the bartender was clearly trying to subtly pressure my friends and I into ordering more food/drinks even though both of them abstain from alcohol and I'd already had dinner (I just couldn't pass up an opportunity to induct newbies into Scarpetta fandom), but to be fair he was helpful with menu choices. The bussers also tend to speak with thick accents so I can never quite understand what they're saying when they put my dish down, oh well.Overall, this is my new favorite restaurant and if you're looking for a solid, surefire amazing meal, I'd recommend this place for sure because nobody I've brought who appreciates food has been disappointed in the least. However you're also more than welcome to stay away from here to make my reservation-making/table getting easier.Obsession.",1,2,2,Lena X.,"Manhattan, NY",105,105,64

They arrived first and were waiting for us at the bar.  When we walked in, the four of us were promptly ushered to our table, a comfy corner booth where even the chairs are padded.  Mmmm, padding.  One of us requested a vegetarian menu, another a wine recommendation, the other was happily eating the SANDWICH that comes in the complimentary bread basket.  All wishes were fulfilled.I was hungry and it took a while to get our food.  Good company or not, bring it on!  Everyone licked their appetizer plates clean... except for me.  The cured arctic char was a bit bland, I was expecting much better.  The short ribs my boyfriend had were amazing and tender and falling apart.  Next was the entree.  I had the farfalle and I cannot stop thinking about it.  I want it in my mouth.  Now.  Best pasta I've had.  It had body.  It was slightly chewy and buttery and meaty and amazing.  My boyfriend said his squid ink pasta was also the best pasta he's eaten.  Our friend could not stop saying just how tender her pork tenderloin was, thus aptly named.  The desserts will definitely not be forgotten.  A selection of cheeses that our friend literally licked clean with her fingers.  A chocolate bombe that was delightful.  Chocolate cake with orange-caramel sorbet -- very inventive and delicious.  And my own personal dessert, the ice cream sandwich, which is awesome in its own right because I get to eat with my fingers... not something my boyfriend often lets me do at nice establishments such as this.  We were done with our meal and had already discussed how good our meals were about 4 times and still did not have our check or even our plates cleared.  We were having a good time but it was getting late and I wanted to get home to crash out for Monday.  Waiting, waiting, finally it comes.  Maybe they forgot about us because we were in the corner, but, regardless, it was frustrating.  For a dinner for 4, with a bottle of wine, 3 courses, and additional drinks, the bill came to less than $400.  Not bad at all.  We paid and headed on out.  No one said goodbye or acknowledged us when we left.  Come on, people, don't you watch Kitchen Nightmares?A big 5 stars for the food.3.5 for the service.Terminator references aside, I'll be back.",1,2,1,Yelena K.,"Nashville, TN",162,275,167

5.0,4/15/2011,"so maybe i haven't been to all the top restaurants in NYC yet for Italian (babbo, del posto, marea, etc), BUT.... in the meantime, scarpetta still holds the number ONE spot for italian food in my heart.  simply put.  i've had fantastic service, consistently top notch, high quality food.  my experiences here are bedazzled.  the ambiance couldn't be more attractive.  i love the people who work here and i always leave super full and satisfied.  for the spring/summer weather, they have tables outside for your enjoyment.things you need to know now:creamy polenta is cheesy, creamy, smooth amazing. the best polenta in the city hands down.Spaghetti - chewy udon like texture.  tomato basil delight. also the best i've ever had.spare ribs - so soft...they melt in your mouth.  If you like tropical, light desserts, then you will enjoy the guava coconut panna cotta.  i've been super lucky to roll right in without reservations.  SCORE!  has the hype finally died down?

It could have been my fault for not ordering the tomato basil pasta that people rave about, but that was my impression. Also, maybe more wine would have helped...I will say that the bread was delicious and that you need to get a reservation well ahead of time and may need to go slightly earlier or later than when you would ideally eat dinner.",0,0,0,Lucy R.,"New York, NY",46,46,0
5.0,4/13/2011,"Scarpetta was a wonderful restaurant. The soft lighting and natural wood gave the restaurant a very warm ambiance. My friend and I were seated in the main dining area where I think most people with reservations are seated.The food was exceptional. We could not decide what to offer so we decided to get two pastas, two entrees and two desserts. Our server was very kind and made sure everything was split into two separate plates/ It was a lot of food but we enjoyed all of it! The pastas were delicious especially the black tagliolini. As for the entrees, the branzino and the pork were phenomenal. I really had nothing to complain about!",0,0,0,Samantha W.,"New York, NY",12,44,0
4.0,4/13/2011,"It's always hard to take parent's to dinner. You want them to be pleased, but you want to enjoy the experience as well.  You don't want them to bitch about the price, but you don't want to take them to a dump. My mom tends to feel ""old"" if she is in the presence of people her own age and thus likes to go to young and ""fun"" places.  And while she pretends to be easy to please, she is really nothing of the sort.I decided to take her to Scarpetta. Having eaten at the one in Miami, I knew one thing for sure: the food would be great.  Also, considering it's close proximity to the Meatpacking district, I figured the atmosphere would be lively as well.Upon arriving we were treated graciously by the hosts and asked to wait at the bar while our table was prepared.  This is something it seems that all the Scarpetta's do.  Once seated we were presented with their incredible spreads and bread basket.  This is no ordinary bread presentation.  The basket has choices from homemade focaccia to stromboli with smoked mozzarella and salami.  The dips go even further. Whipped mascarpone butter is the perfect accompaniment to these delicious breads as is the tomato confit and olive oil.It only gets better from here. To start we were able to try many amazing things.  My favorites were the creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms.  I had this in Miami and although incredibly rich and a meal in itself, it is so delicious. The scallops are another must. They were perfectly tender and paired wonderfully with the mushrooms and truffle butter.Another great starter are the beef shortribs. They are braised and served with a vegetable farro risotto. They were tender and rich.A few starters that were much lighter but in my mind not nearly as rich or satisfying as the few above are the raw fluke and the crispy frito misto. The fluke was lovely, light and simple, just didn't really stand up to the other dishes at the table. The frito misto was also surprisingly light and one of my mothers favorites.For our entrees we decided on the spaghetti, which really does deserve every bit of the hype it gets as well as the black cod.  The black cod was the only real ""miss"" of the night. Served with caramelized fennel and concentrated tomatoes, it was served with a chicken stock sauce that rather overwhelmed the fish and was too meaty.  The spaghetti was heavenly. Described on the menu as having tomato and basil, it is miles beyond your average spaghetti. We were soo full, but they had all these incredible sounding desserts and we couldn't resist. Bread pudding was surprisingly good and the pumpkin panna cotta was a bit of a miss for me.Scarpetta is the unique type of restaurant that anyone would fall in love with. Our service was great, the food delicious and an atmosphere that was sophisticated yet relaxed.",7,7,5,Brittany F.,"Los Angeles, CA",4564,1592,1644
3.0,4/9/2011,"Good food, bad service.  Actually not bad, terrible.  Called to make a reservation and they only had 8:30 available for 5 people.  I called again the day of to see if my party and I could come earlier.  They said we could come at 8 and there would be a chance.  I came around a quarter to 8 and they were like deer in headlights.  I don't understand why Scarpetta needs four girls to do a job for one.  All of them were very rude and unwelcoming.  Also, it seemed like one of the girls, actually she looked very old so woman, was very reluctant to take my coat.  This was really evident when I was reclaiming my coat and she gave a ""I don't want to do it, you're wasting my time"" kind of look.  My party ended waiting 30 minutes, so we got our original reservation time.  Scarpetta is very hip and popular with young people.  Noticed the place was still busy with a few empty tables.  The waiter soon came after we sat down.  Menu was pretty interesting and my party debated if we wanted the tasting menu but since it was pretty late and the tasting menu would take a long time, we decided to order à la carte.  Waiter came back and I noticed that he did not tell us any specials or offer anything to drink or start, just took our order.  I noticed this when he gave the next table over the specials and drink orders.  He also did not ask us how our food was or check back at us.  In fact, the assistant waiter did most of the work, including refills.  Food was pretty good, probably one of the best Italian restaurants in New York.  I had the black tagiolini which is a seafood ragout and basil bead crumbs pasta dish.  I usually like anything with black pasta.  I also tasted the creamy polenta and crispy fritto misto.  Both were very good and tasty.  For the main course, I had the black cod, which was very crispy.  It had fennel and tomatoes with it.  I also tasted the duck breast, which had a great hint of spice.For desert, my party and I tasted the chocolate cake and coconut panna cotta.  Both were great but the cake tasted a little bit like cake from a store.  Scarpetta is one of the best Italian restaurants in New York.  However, they need to improve their service.  I thought it seemed as if they were too good to serve.  It seems like they forget who is eating and who is serving.",1,0,0,Nicky C.,"Manhattan, NY",11,23,1
5.0,4/8/2011,"One of the best meals I've ever had in NYC. In celebration of my friend passing her nursing boards, we had dinner here. It was perfect. I was WOW-ed from start to finish.Walking into the dining room was breathtaking. I loved the natural light streaming in from the sunroof and all of the warm elements from nature - lush plants, dark soft wood, and glittering candles on the table tops. Our waiter was very helpful in explaining the food on the menu to us. I felt like he was candid in his opinions about his favorite dish and I appreciated his honesty. We shared a delicious bottle of red wine and dove like starving heathens into the luscious bread basket and condiments. The meat and cheese stromboli won me over. I could have left Scarpetta having just consumed bread and been satisfied. The foccacia was a delight, partnered with the eggplant caponata and the marscapone butter. So so so good.We shared the short ribs and creamy polenta and the restaurant split the two dishes into individual portions for each of us. The flair with which they poured the sauce over the polenta was wonderful. The short ribs were divine, the polenta a revelation. I would have never thought it could be presented like a soup. I ordered the spaghetti with tomato and basil - and as soon as I tasted it, understood why everyone orders this simple dish. It's intensely flavorful and very comforting. My friend ordered the pink snapper which was perfectly cooked. We felt full by this point, but couldn't resist ordering the banana budino for dessert. Scrumptious. Excellent service, beautiful restaurant, a must-try. I'm so glad I was able to finally dine at Scarpetta. It's really an amazing experience.

5.0,3/31/2011,"I ate at Scarpetta last night with a friend for my birthday and it was absolutely wonderful. The service was flawless and the food was fantastic.We started at the bar with a glass of prosecco. When the glass tipped over and shattered on the bar spilling presecco everywhere (not on anyone thank goodness!) it was cleaned up immediately and I was presented with another glass in my hand. After we sat down, they offered to keep my flowers (my friend got major points for the roses!) in a chilled area. So we looked over the wine menu for a bit, knowing we wanted to start with a white and move on to a bottle of red with the main. The sommelier was excellent, he listened to what we were looking for and made three suggestions for the red. We told him what we were having to start and he selected the perfect glass to enhance the dishes.The food (we decided to share everything, how can you not?)Apps- Arctic Char with citrus and pomegranate seeds, the very thin layer of cucumber underneath the fish was a wonderful clean addition.Creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms- Oh. My. Absolutely delicious. Possibly my favorite dish of the evening. We kept it on the table through the pasta course so wwe could dip our bread. Pasta- duck and foie gras ravioli- creamy and smokey and perfect texture on the palate. Absolutely delicious.A word on sharing, if you tell them that you intend to share, they split them in the kitchen. If you do not (like the table next to us, they bring over a plate after what seemed like confusion). Entree- pork tenderloin with mustard spaetzle and pork belly. The tenderloin was flawless, perfectly cooked and wonderfully paired with the spaetzle, I wasn't in love with the pork belly because of some kind of acidic sauce, it was the only portion of th e entire meal that I did not finish.And finally,Dessert- ricotta tart with blackberry sorbet.

Italian food has never been my cup of tea, but after dining at Scarpetta, I'M A BELIEVER.Came here with good friends who love food, so we definitely didn't hold back at all. Was totally psyched they had a separate vegetarian menu, because yes, yours truly doesn't eat meat.For my app, ordered the mustard spaetzle with butternut squash--spaetzel was tender, had a nice kick from the mustard and the squash was luscious and sweet. Entree--Red beet and smoked ricotta casonei with buttery smoked ricotta cream sauce, toasted pistachios and poppy seeds. Simply amazing--everything from the beautiful color of the beet filling to the freshness of the ravioli-like casonei made it divine. Toasted pistachios added a wonderful pop. For dessert--chocolate and vanilla parfait with a cookie crust, mini hazelnut milkshake and fresh biscotti. Almost like a mini tiramisu with a hazelnut shooter. The biscotti was perfect.All in all, great service and great ambiance. Our waters were never half empty, and our waiter even walked me to the restroom. Foodwise, incredible. You can sense the high quality and class once you step in. A little pricey, but well worth it.

For example pasta dishes were great (love their spaghetti), fish was well-made (had a sashimi appetizer and a cooked entree), chicken was well made, beef short ribs (appetizer) were soft and immensely flavorful...etc... Bottom line - everything I've had here has been very well made and full of flavor! Just as a heads up - get ready to enjoy the bread basket (which includes this fantastic roll with cured meat inside) and the tray of house-made dips (for lack of a better phrase) which accompany the bread very well and are a nice change from the norm of butter/ olive oil.

4.0,2/19/2011,"This was a nice place & a good experience... It is a comfortable restaurant that has 2 sections sort of - one in the front and one in the back.  There are a lot of booths in the back, which is really the main seating area so you can have more privacy than some of the tables in the middle of the back  (or in the front, where the tables seemed too close together to me).  The decor is nice as commented on by others but it is unfinished cinder blocks from the 9 foot level upward...not sure why that design choice was made...it's odd and distracting aesthetically.  For a refined aesthetic, why go so urban at 9 feet?  This does not affect your dining experience really, but it caught my eye - and makes the place seem less refined.  I kept envisioning different types of wallpaper or plaster for that area - but I'm weird that way.  The restaurant can get close to being ""too loud"" but the right table can minimize the problem.   Try to get a booth.  There were a lot of ""Sex and the City"" wannabe tables of single girls in there - always amusing to see.  I guess that means the place is currently in vogue.Service was extremely attentive in terms of clearing the table between courses & refilling water, etc... Our waiter was nice & there were other runners for the food, etc... nobody seemed overburdened.   Anyway, here's my rating on the food:FoodThe food is excellent, in general.  They did not bring out the vegetarian menu by default - which is odd - the only way to know about it is to go online, I guess...or to ask - even though there are some interesting options on there too that are not on the main menu.  Braised Beef Short Rips - absolutely 5 star delicious.  Incredibly soft, well seasoned, perfectly prepared.  No bones present.  Fabulous appetizer.Spaghetti - Very good.  My friend said it was like an ""orgasm in his mouth"" and wanted to order a second one.  I thought it was just ""very good"".  I see Scott Conant on Chopped, ripping apart the contestants' pasta preparation so I was very curious about this.  I have to say it's a lot more eggy that I thought. It's heavy...dense pasta.  I tend to like homemade pasta on the thinner side.  However, the flavor was pretty good....near perfect.   4 stars.Black Cod - Was small...like all entrées -  a little basic with just some tomatoes and fennel.   We got extra bread so we didn't leave hungry.  4 stars.Chocolate cake -  A classic... well prepared, soft / liquid center... coffee ice cream.  Just not that big for $11.  4 starsRicotta tart - like cheesecake...velvety and delicious.  5 stars for the ricotta... but the raspberry sorbet was waay too sweet. 3 stars on that. Generally, the portions are small and it's best to share appetizers (what you get of them)  The bread basket is very nice & discussed elsewhere...the bread with inlaid melted pancetta & motz looked good but I don't like pancetta.  My friends liked it.3 appetizers, 4 entrées, 2 desserts, 1 bottle of $80 wine, and a dessert liquor ended up right at $300.  That's about right for a place like this I think.  This certainly wasn't the best Italian experience I ever had (I'm from Boston & can list a few better ones there) - but it was a good experience... and I have to admit I sort of wanted to go because I am a fan of Chopped... but that was probably a silly reason.  There are a million good restaurants in NYC whose owners are not on TV.",1,0,0,Astro J.,"Chicago, IL",1,48,25

5.0,1/27/2011,"Never underestimate the power of a man in a well-tailored suit. Every molecule of air was robbed from my body when I laid my eyes on the exquisitely-fitted bespoke suit that Chun L. wore at the Snow Ball. This is a man who knows what he's doing and does it very well. I knew I just had to meet and speak with him even if it were for only a few precious seconds. Afterward I dreamily mooned over the suit to my darling twin sister, Helena H., for days on end. She must have said something because a few days later I received an invitation to a dinner for three from the man himself. I promptly accepted. When we finally settled upon a date, Chun made reservations for Gusto because we couldn't get a 7 pm reservation for Scarpetta. Knowing that Scarpetta was on my wish list, Chun secured a last minute heroic seating for three at 7. When I received a text informing me of the change, I squealed with delight. See, the suit never lies. Scarpetta, like Chun's suit, is a celebration of the care given to the little details, which elevates something from good to great to extraordinary. Nothing loud or gaudy, but an exacting demand that everything be done absolutely correctly, with polish, and an elegant finish. A humble plate of pasta becomes a work of gastronomic art in a master's hands just as threads meant to cover the body for modesty and warmth becomes a  habiliment proclamation of one's character and identity.We started with drinks at the bar. Still early in the evening, the dining area was empty while the few patrons were clustered at the bar. I had a beautiful flute of prosecco with raspberry syrup, which made a delicious light cocktail. There's something utterly delightful in sitting in an elegant space with beautiful drinks, lovely nibbles (thinly shaved potatoes that were fried into crispy chips adorned with sea salt and parsley flakes), and erudite company. I was filled with happiness and bliss. This is how life was meant to be lived.Life is a celebration. We ordered a bottle of prosecco. Then came out the legendary bread basket. Oh, the stromboli! I was not at all sorry that Helena had decided to become a vegetarian this year because that meant that I could have her share of the utterly decadent soft white bread with slices of salami and nuggets of mozzarella hidden within the folds. The lemon-infused olive oil, eggplant caponata, and marscopone butter accompanied the bread basket. The smooth rich flavor of the eggplant caponata won me over and the mascarpone butter was an interesting fresh twist. I was very much looking forward to having venison as it is a rare treat for me. Unfortunately there are discrepancies between the online menu and what is actually being served at Scarpetta. I ordered the pork tenderloin with pork belly, mustard spaetzle, and butternut squash. Such tender juicy succulent pork! Perfection! The pork belly melted in mouth. The only drawback to the dish was that I wished they had given me more spaetzle. The spaetzle got lost and I couldn't taste it, especially when I had some butternut squash to go with it. Still, this was a magnificent dish.But what made the dinner superlative was the coconut panna cotta with guava soup and carmelized pineapple. *sigh* heaven translated into dessert. The flavors were carefully balanced so that nothing got lost, instead they were all perfect foils and complements to each other. The panna cotta was wickedly smooth and creamy. The guava soup wasn't overly sweet and the fresh taste punched up the coconut in the panna cotta. The carmelized pineapples were perfect accent and contrast in texture to the smoothness of the panna cotta and soup. Helena took a bite and her eyes immediately widened in appreciation. The service was lovely as the wait staff kept a watchful eye on us making sure that our water glasses were always topped off and our glasses of prosecco were filled whenever we got dangerously low. Every crumb was swept after each course. Our needs were met before we even had a chance to express them.

We also had the raw yellowtail which was refreshing and delicious.  The spaghetti is a classic - so rich and perfectly portioned. I'm not a huge fan of beets, but I would order the red beet and smoked ricotta casonsei again, it was that good.

4.0,1/22/2011,"A solid four stars. Nice dining environment, great services. I went to Scarpetta without a reservation, they still managed to get a table for two instantly (it was about 6:20~6:30pm on Saturday) The table wasn't great, it was next to the bar, more like a bar side table, instead of a real dining table and we didn't end up going into the dining room area. I don't know if it was because we were walk-in. We ordered duck and foie gras ravioli and spaghetti . I only took a bite on spaghetti which was finished mostly by my friend, so I won't address too much on it. The duck and foie gras ravioli was creative. It tasted even a bit like Chinese dish upon your first bite because of the source, however, when your tongue got enough source and focused on the ravioli, it did taste pretty Italian with great cheeses inside.I also have to say a little more about its side breads. The olive oil was added lemon juice, so you won't feel too oily, instead, it tasted pretty refreshed. That was something new I would love to try.In general, a delightful dining place with decent yet creative italian foods.",1,1,1,Ariel G.,"Redwood City, CA",128,98,1
4.0,1/20/2011,"Q: If it's your birthday and you've already had two bottles of wine, where do you eat?A: Apparently, you aren't done drinking yet, but you're going to end up here.So, as you may have guessed we wound up showing up for our reservation a little tipsy, but quite on time, though we still had about a 15 minute wait as the restaurant was really busy. And loud. While the girl powdered her nose (I love that expression), I sidled up to the bar and decided that what I needed most in my life at that moment was a French 75, which is basically just gin and champagne, and which it also turns out are actually the last two things that your body needs after having two bottles of wine and no food.We skip on appetizers, because upon seeing pasta our drunken bodies take over and realize that they have the ability to add something to soak up said alcohol from our stomachs, so she orders the ravioli, and I get the $24 tomato and basil spaghetti. I order this because I've heard that it's really good. Extremely good. I've also heard it's how he used to get laid in college. If it was free, I'd have put out for it, too.It wasn't, though. Sorry, dude, no man-parts for you.Her ravioli was REALLY good, however, being rich but at the same time balanced so you didn't feel like stopping because it was too much. Quite the opposite, really, as we did things to the pasta that are illegal in Guam.We finished our quick nosh, but apparently the girl had snuck word that the hammered guy in the bright shirt was turning older because someone showed up with a plate of petit fours. w00t*The food was actually 5 star quality, but the service was, even with the inclusion of my free dessert bites, pretty spotty.

4.0,1/13/2011,"If I hadn't been to Bouley a few days prior to coming to Scarpetta, I might give this place 5 stars.  The lady and I decided to buy the Scallops for the appetizer, and for our entrees the Spaghetti and Ravioli Foie Gras.  The spaghetti was quite good as the noodles were soft and chewy, and it tasted as though the sauce was infused into the noodles.  If you were to look at the pasta and sauce you would think there is no flavor or it would be dry because there isn't the typical pool of sauce at the bottom of the plate or dripping noodles.  The foie gras however was not as enjoyable as the spaghetti.  It was very good and flavorful, but after eating a third of the dish I got tired of the taste and was just too rich for my taste buds.  Finally the scallop appetizer wasn't as flavorful and it didn't taste nearly as good as the scallops I had at Bouley.  Half of my scallop was actually overcooked and the other half was perfect, but the flavor was not something I was particularly expected and familiar with.  If I'm going to pay 16+ dollars for an appetizer, I do expect it to be cooked to perfection.  If you strictly go here for the spaghetti, I don't think you will be disappointed as long as you are willing to fork out the cash.  Is it a bit expensive?  Maybe, but I don't plan on eating at restaurants like to on a nightly or even a weekly basis so I found it somewhat reasonable.  My overall experience for a restaurant that is considered to be ""fine dining"" was good, but not 5 stars good.  Therefore I am rating it 4 stars.",0,0,0,richard k.,"Los Angeles, CA",97,94,26

3.0,1/12/2011,"I know, I know, only three stars? Well in fact, I actually considered going with two for a while. And it's not because the food isn't good and the service isn't fantastic. And I didn't have a bad experience. So hear me out!Scarpetta provides really excellent food in a wonderful atmosphere with cordial, friendly and knowledgeable wait staff. Yet despite all this, I am not a fan, because I have in fact, had better. Their stromboli bread to start is, as others have said, quite delicious. Have a couple of those rolls. Also, take the recommendation of other yelpers and get the braised short ribs as an appetizer. Or the polenta. Both are winners. They really are quite good. As far as an entree goes, you won't leave disappointed with any of them. The reason I feel disappointed by this is that rather than letting the ingredients speak for themselves, the style here is more ""gourmey chef-y"", where complexity and distraction are added in an attempt to produce something fantastic. This is true even for the simple spaghetti with basil. It's not to say it was poorly executed - things were done quite well - it's just that these dishes can be done so much better when the ingredients are allowed to speak for themselves. Take the spaghetti for example. Some here have raved about how the fresh pasta is perfectly cooked, toothsome, and has a velvety smooth sauce. Now - these things are all true, but I would argue that cooking pasta perfectly al dente is actually not that impressive of a feat (maybe you've just gone to the wrong places?), and point out that the ""velvety"" nature of the sauce is the result of a nice simple marina sauce infused with a healthy dose of butter and a touch of cream. It's not bad. It's not greasy. it's just that when you let it speak for itself, when you make a perfect marinara sauce and use nice fresh basil, you don't have to resort to those tricks of the trade. I was disappointed that after hearing all this stuff about this miraculous tomato basil sauce, what it all comes down to is tricking your brain into loving it by adding a bit of fat. All this aside, if your goal is to try out all the great places NYC has to offer, you should probably check this place out.

The polenta might have been a tad rich for an appetizer but was delicious and something in which I'd like bathe at some point in the future. The Fritto Misto was a heaping mound of perfectly fried seafood and veggies. Also delicious but I did have one bite that was intensely spicy while the rest of my bites weren't spicy at all. Not sure what happened there. For a second course we shared the famous Spaghetti with tomato and basil.  You know, it's just a simple dish done perfectly.  I wish we could have tried all the pastas on the menu.Our entrees were the Sicilian-Spiced Duck Breast and the Branzino with lentils. Both were excellent and cooked perfectly.  The branzino had a braised endive that I found a bit clunky but the rest of the dish was superb. How they get the skin on the fish to crisp up like that is a mystery I still haven't solved in my own kitchen. The duck breast had five or six distinct elements that melded into many delicious bites of food.For dessert I tried to break my habit of always ordering the chocolate cake so we split the Banana Budino. What a great choice. A dense banana cake soaked in caramel with pecan gelato and an oat tuile. So good.The service was extremely efficient and executed like clockwork. It was a touch impersonal and we wondered if our waitress was a robot.  Minor quibble though. The atmosphere was upscale but casual. The room is not very big but never got too loud.The price really wasn't bad. Neither of us drink so I guess that helps and our total with a couple of bottles of pellegrino and a mocktail came to $155.  We both thought that was very reasonable for the quality of food we were served.  This is the type of place where you can feel secure that every dish has been well thought out and will be prepared with extreme care and skill.

4.0,1/2/2011,"After a long day at the Met, my gf and I met up with a friend at Scarpetta to recharge and get our Italian fix in NY before heading back home to Baltimore.The bread basket is certainly one of the better bread baskets I have come across in my life. For appetizers, we ordered the Fritto Misto and the Truffled Mushroom Polenta. The fritto was perfectly fried and surprisingly light. The rich and creamy polenta lives up to its reputation and is one of the best preparations I have had. We had three pastas: the black taglionlini, the duck foie gras ravioli, and the famous spaghetti w/ basil. The black tagliolini was delicate and fresh, dressed lightly with chopped bits of seafood, though I longed for a more intense flavor. The duck foie gras ravioli was to me one-dimensional, though everyone else loved it. The spaghetti was the best pasta dish of the night for me, it's flavor rich and homey. I could eat bowls of this every night! For entrees, we shared the Black Cod and the Capretto. Both were perfectly executed. The cod was flawlessly cooked, with crispy skin providing a nice contrast to the juicy meat and subtly sweet sauce it was sitting on. The Capretto was awesome as well, accompanied by perfectly roasted diced potatoes and a sauce as delightful as it was complex. Desserts were nice, but nothing spectacular. We had banana budino and date bread pudding, the budino being the better of the two. I expected the pasta dishes to be the highlight of our meal, but I actually have to admit to enjoying the entrees more.

Not only do they give you FOUR KINDS of fresh bread, but one of the breads is this homemade stromboli with fresh mozzarella, basil and meat. It is divine and if you go there just for that, you will be perfectly happy. The lemony olive oil is the best I have tasted anywhere (and I have been to Italy multiple times). The caponata with the bread was also excellent.We split the fritto misto for an appetizer, which was very light and tasty. Lots of fresh herbs really made the dish stand out and it was very well seasoned.For my entree, I tried the meat-filled agnolotti which was absolutely incredible. The layer of flavors worked well in this dish. You get the bite of the fresh pasta first, then the bold flavor of the meat, but then wait..this wonderful cheesy goodness right at the end! The sauce was very light and stood up well to the pasta.I also sampled the lobster with squid ink pasta. The only way to describe how it tasted is ""essence of seafood."" Sounds really weird, but the pasta and sauce was more infused with the taste of seafood rather than overwhelmed by a ton of seafood. The flavor of shellfish can be overwhelming, but I could taste the squid as well and the flavors worked well together. Overall very delicate and light.For dessert, we split the chocolate cake and the banana budino. The banana cake was the winner. I don't think that their ice creams could stand alone (somewhat lacking in flavor) but they were excellent combined with the cakes.

5.0,12/15/2010,"It's been talked about.  It's been on television.  Hell, it's all over the internet too.  There is a tremendous amount of buzz regarding the spaghetti with tomato and basil at Scarpetta.  Let's back track a tad.  Scarpetta means ""little shoe,"" and in Italian slang refers to a piece of bread used to scoop up sauce.  The restaurant's facade is modest, and after months of walking by it every single day on my way to work, I still had no idea where it was until I really looked for it.  I looked hard.  The only sign was a small one by the door, no awning with large painted letters, no sign screaming ""HERE I AM,"" just tiny, unassuming lettering on a small rectangular placard.  Chef and owner Scott Conant has definitely built up steam leading up to the opening of Scarpetta in spring 2008.  Not only is it located in the swanky and über-trendy Meatpacking District, but what has turned out to be the signature dish, the simple spaghetti, has been featured on Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate, Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations (Techniques show), and all over the internet including Serious Eats.Let's start from the beginning of the meal: bread baskets.  Scarpetta blows the other bread baskets out of the water.  It's the freaking torpedo of bread baskets.  To start, it contains 4 different bread offerings: a simple crusty white Italian bread, thick and dense focaccia, stromboli (filled with meat and cheese), and a crusty roll.  There is no way you are not going to want to try every option.  If that wasn't enough, the spreads/dips that accompany the bread basket will send you over the edge: a lemon-infused olive oil, chunky eggplant and tomato caponata, and whipped mascarpone butter (yes, MASCARPONE BUTTER).  Do I really need to talk about this?  I mean, doesn't it speak for itself?  Does the fact that we left not a single crumb of bread, nor a single dab of the spreads mean anything to you?We shared a couple appetizers, and they were both exquisite.  First, the creamy polenta with fricassee of truffled mushrooms.  This was easily the best polenta I've ever had, bar none.  It was creamy, silky, luscious perfection.  Without the mushrooms, it would have been satisfying, but with the mushrooms... again, do I really need to go there?  It was sublime.  I literally scraped every last bit from the bowl and the spoon.  None of this dish would go to waste, and if I could drown in a pool of this polenta, I would die a happy woman.Our second appetizer was the braised short ribs of beef with vegetable and farro risotto.  Three thinly sliced pieces of perfectly fork-tender short rib laid atop a small bed of chewy farro and still somewhat crunchy vegetables to offer a lovely combination of flavors and textures.  Topped off with strips of salty Parmigiano-Reggiano, and you have yourself a delectable plate of food.Time for the main event.  Now, when I noticed all the attention surrounding the spaghetti with tomato and basil, all the fans, I wanted so badly to call them out, to say, ""nope, it's not the best I've had,"" to say it's only spaghetti, it could never be mind-blowing, to say it was overrated, like so many other things in New York.  Well, they sure showed me!  First of all, the portion looks a lot smaller in photographs than it is in reality.  There's actually a lot of spaghetti wound up in that perfect mound.  Scott Conant doesn't believe in cooking his sauce for hours (like many old school Italians might) and he also infuses most of the flavor at the very end of the cooking, because according to him (and this really is so true), the last thing you add is the first thing you will taste.  The spaghetti itself is fresh and fairly thick, with a perfect chewy texture that one just cannot replicate with dried pasta.  It just can't be done.  The sauce clings to every bit of noodle.  It is thick and the flavor is incredibly intense.  I really did not expect it to be so good.  It's freaking spaghetti with tomato and basil!  It almost felt meaty in that way that the flavors were just so powerful, deep, and concentrated.  The spaghetti is worth the hype, it truly deserves its fame, and it's worth the $24 price tag at least once to say you tried it.  I wouldn't lie to you.",4,2,3,Victoria K.,"Cranston, RI",579,664,2519
3.0,12/15/2010,"I went here for my brothers 30th birthday at the end of the summer(yes I know Im a bit late on writing my reviews but I am new to yelp! and Im catching up and letting everyone know of my experiences)and I was a little disappointed. Everything I have to say was perfectly fine except for it being a bit to noisy and seemed stuffy. We were a party of 7 and they stuffed us at what seemed to be the smallest table in the middle of the restaurant(even though we made reservations a week ahead of time). Our elbows were literally ontop of one another and was very annoying. To top it off, constantly having to move in our seats and elbows to make room for waiters and busboys!! Not cool!Our waitress was very welcoming and accommodating(my family can be a bit demanding) and not once did i not see a smile on her face.. The busyboys were very attentive as well re-filling our waters and bread basket when asked. The menu looked and was delicious; we basically ordered a bunch of app's and shared everything ranging from the mozzarella n corozza(which i grew up on and LOVE) , beet salad, leak soup, scallop tartare and a few others which i forgot to be honest. For the entree I had the rib eye which was delicious and cooked perfectly but seemed a bit small for a rib eye. my family all had a variety of diff entrees ranging from cod to pasta to one of the veal specials. Everything was very tasty but a bit to small.. After dinner we all went for a walk around the meat packing and ended up at the standard beer garden having some hot dogs and beers. Im not saying not to taste this place out, just be prepared to leave hungry and with less $$ in your pocket . They need to balance that out at this place.",0,0,0,Johan H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,52,5
5.0,12/14/2010,"Although did place didn't receive a lot of reviews but I absolutely recommend you to give this place a try if you have not yet!Location/Service: This restaurant was also located near chelsea market (very close to MORIMOTO) so My friend and I decided to eat after our Morimoto appetizer! It is hard to get a reservation at this place because the restaurant isn't very big so when My friend called in, they advised us to sit at the  bar which was ok with us.  Since we got there pretty late, a perfect window spot opened up for us and we were able to grab that seat right away! The service was awesome. The min you sit down the waiter came over and asked if we want anything to drink.  Food: The next best thing is the ASSORTED BREAD BASKET that was brought to our table immediately after our drinks arrived.  There wer 4 differnt types of bread: Small sourdough dinner rolls, Typical sour dough bread, rosemary infused bread, and lastly the best free bread i have ever had: ham/cheese bread with herbs.  What made this whole experience better was that the bread was served with three types of dipping sauce: Lemon Flavored Olive Oil, Slow cooked Eggplant in tomato/Anchovy sauce, and a marscapone butter cream for spread.  The bread was so good that my friend and I kept eating them before the appetizer even came out! We ordered POLENTA WITH WILD MUSHROOMS and their all time famous SCARPETTA SPAGHETTI.  CREAMY POLENTA fricassee of truffled mushrooms ($15)- this dish is so creamy and melts in your mouth right away! It pairs so well with the truffled mushroom. It is an undescrible feeling that you need to explore yourself. I am not a big fan of polenta but this dish is so awesome! I was already pretty full at this point but i still managed to finish whatevere is on my plate!SPAGHETTI - tomato and basil ($24)- Who in the world would think a spaghetti can be sooo good? Before i stepped into the restaurant i've done multiple reserach on their specialty dishes. I could not belive so many people recommended spaghetti. I didn't understand why would a simple spaghetti cost so much in the first place..isn't it just tomato sauce and pasta? I found out i was wrong! I am not sure how they make this perfect tomato sauce but the sauce incorporated all the flavors of tomato; you can taste not only the tomato but the tomato puree in the sauce! There was a hint of basil which blends in perfectly with the pasta.  The pasta is cooked to perfection! It tasted homemade and the texture is just right for this perfect pasta dish! Now i understand why it cost so much! This is a must get item !What's the BEST thing about this place is that they DIVIDE UP THE WHOLE DISH for you if you and another friend decide to share. My friend and I got equal portion of each dish and didn't have to go thru the mess of dragging pasta noodle from one plate to another! sO SWEET AND THOUGHFUL OF THEM!This is a must try italian restaurant !",2,1,1,Sherry H.,"Pasadena, CA",289,124,173

The waiters was very professional (as were other staff), but he did not even look at any women at my table when describing specials, asking if everyone was OK, or giving the bill. Since I was the host and female, this was disconcerting. My husband loved it, of course. He gave the bill to my husband, who passed it to me.

Reservations was not uber difficult to make though I could tell the place fills up pretty quick by around 8 (which apparently is when the locals come out to eat).Where do I begin...the bread basket! The boyfriend and friends loved the bread baked with salami and cheese. I was in love with the slice that was on top (glad they gave only a slice because I would have stuffed myself before dinner was served).I shared the shortribs with farro with boyfriend- delisioso!!! The dish was so tasty and rich that if I had not shared I would have not eaten my main dish, which of course was the popular spaghetti. I tried not to get overly excited in case the dish failed, but it was as good as I had heard it would be. Boyfriend ordered the duck/foie gras ravioli and as much as he liked it he   was hoping for a bit more texture- perhaps pieces of duck meat. I think the duck and foie gras were blended together.

4.0,11/19/2010,"I'm not really sure how to write this review or rate Scarpetta...As soon as we walked in, our party of four was immediately happy with the inviting, yet cool atmosphere. Inviting bar and pay special attention to belts on the mirrors in the dining room...I like. The bread basket was wonderful and the cheese and pancetta bread was a nice touch. We had the short ribs with farro and seared sea scallops with sunchokes as our appetizers. Both were delicious and I would happily order again. As we were not too hungry (late lunch) we decided to order three pastas and share. 1. A friend ordered the rabbit cavatelli. Alright, so I wasn't brave enough to try the rabbit, but the pasta tasted like it was made in my friend's grandma's kitchen in Firenze. Just perfect. 2. Black tagliolini, a squid ink homemade pasta with lobster. Perfectly light, flavorful and overall delectable. Order this dish if you like simple wonderful textures and flavors.3. Beet and ricotta ravioli with pistachios. This dish makes me want to giggle with happiness as it consists of three of my favorite flavors. The ravioli was paper thin, perfect and filled with the most gorgeous rich concoction. Not only did it taste wonderful, but splitting it in half and seeing the beautiful red pop out of the pasta with the green pistachio touch was a visual treat.The food was sensationally delicious. Every bite was an explosion of freshness and subtle yet lasting flavor. However, with all of this said, we had one of the worst waiters...ever. He was abrupt, rude and didn't pay any attention to us at all. As soon as he realized we weren't going to order the whole menu, we were ignored. Annoying waiters never bug me...I live in LA, it's filled with stuck up people who WORK at posh places...however, this waiter rubbed us all the wrong way. Up to the point where this was my birthday dinner and we decided to forgo the birthday candle and head to our next location. We all have a deep respect for the service industry and always tip 20%. For the first time ever, we tipped less than 15%. I do not think this one waiter reflects the whole restaurant as the ladies in the front of house were lovely as were the people I made reservations with.

5.0,11/9/2010,"W-O-W. I'm impressed. And that doesn't happen all that often. I had the pleasure of eating at Scarpetta in New York last week because my good friend knows Scott and managed to score us a reservation. I didn't know what to expect and frankly wasn't prepared to be blown away given I'm from San Francisco and we have some damned good Italian in our city. Well, blown away I was.The moment I walked into Scarpetta I got a good feeling...it wasn't  overcrowded, I could talk comfortably at the bar, etc. I began my evening with a Negroni (gin and campari served to perfection). Then I had another. Mmm. The potato chips served at the bar are absolutely delectable...bits of rosemary sprinkled throughout and a little something that gave it a spicy kick too. But I couldn't eat too many given I had a whole night of eating ahead of me.Let me begin by saying that it pays to know someone who knows someone. Because of my friend, we were treated like royalty the entire evening. We placed our order and were greeted warmly by the GM who told us to relax and enjoy our evening because he would be sending over some specials and favorites along with what we'd ordered. And he did!We started with the raw yellow tail with olio di zenzero & flaked sea salt along with the tuna susci, marinated vegetables & preserved truffles. The fish was so fresh and served so beautifully. We then tried the burrata with heirloom tomatoes & baby greens and the braised short ribs of beef with vegetable & farro risotto. OMG. Amazing. But, the creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms is NOT to be missed. You don't even know that you're eating polenta. It's like liquid gold. You'll never taste anything like it again. I swear it.Moving onto our pasta course, the spaghetti (a signature dish) and duck and foie gras ravioli were OUTSTANDING. I hope you're not missing my use of all caps and acronyms to describe this restaurant experience. If I could, I would add exclamation points liberally in this review as well but my journalistic nature would be compromised. ;)For our entrees, we focused on the Branzino, a mediterranean fish withslow-roasted swiss chard, manila clams & salsa verde and the Sicilian-spiced duck breast with trumpet royale mushrooms, baby vegetables, wilted watercress & cherries. All delicious and cooked perfectly.Think we didn't have room for dessert? Think again. We tried the amedei chocolate cake with burnt orange-caramel gelato and espresso sauce and the banana budino with pecan gelato. I can't even tell you which I preferred because I had to have a bite of one and then the other and then back to the first and then back to the other....I think I finally fell into a food coma.And, if you're scratching your head wondering what I drank after I finished my Negroni...I indulged in several bottles of a gorgeous Italian red. Scarpetta has a terrific wine list - albeit largely Italian - so ask the lovely sommelier for help. We did.All by way of saying, I've had some great experiences at the French Laundry, Cyrus, Michael Mina and many, many other world class restaurants and this ranks with the best of them. Truly memorable and TRULY worth going back to.And, lest I forget to mention, the bread that is served upon first sitting down is out of this world. It is so rich and full of flavor, pizza in a pocket...with prosciutto and cheese....I think given a chance I could have easily had a romance with that bread basket and a bottle of wine and been happy. But only if I didn't know what what was coming. :)Go try Scarpetta! You won't be sorry.",5,1,1,Corrine S.,"San Francisco, CA",72,129,22

Bryan and I enjoyed a glass of wine at the bar before being seated at our table.  Between sips and stories, we couldn't help but admire Scarpetta's casual, yet incredibly elegant, space.The good    * Gorgeous interior space    * Friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable staff    * Free bar snack: homemade herbed potato chips    * Attractive crowd/clientele    * Sommelier on-site    * Gratis bread basket + dipping sauce trio: a bountiful array of freshly-baked, assorted breads was accompanied by a trio of dips: ricotta, caponata, olive oil    * Spaghetti: think simple - handmade spaghetti noodles, fresh tomato and basil.  That's it.  Sounds boring and uninspired, right?  Wrong.  Believe me when I say that this is one of the best bowls of pasta that you will have the pleasure of eating this side of Italy.  In some cases, mastering the art of simplicity is harder than mastering that of complexity.  And this bowl of noodles, dear readers, is one damn good example.  Don't be deterred by its $24 price tag - this, I promise you, will likely be one of your most memorable pasta experiences, to date.The bad: there was no ""bad""The ugly    * Cauliflower Panna Cotta: if ""ugly"" had a picture next to it in the dictionary, I'm positive that it may resemble this atrocious appetizer.  ""It tastes like the fish department at Kroger!"" Bryan squealed.  That was a really bad sign, considering that it was he who chose to try Scarpetta 's newest ""starter.""  There's just something about chilled, savory panna cotta/pudding/creme brulee that gives me goose bumps - not the good kind, either.  Pair that with an abundance of the ""fishiest"" fish in the sea - caviar, sea urchin, days-old crab meat - et voila!  You've got a ticking ""gag reflex"" time-bomb on your hands.  The panna cotta was accompanied by two toast points, which I *thought* would aid in mutilating some of the overwhelming flavor.  To no avail, I could not even get past one bite.  Sigh.  I used this near-vomit experience as an excuse/justification to hold the bread basket hostage, proclaiming its components to be my ""appetizer chasers.""",1,1,0,Lindsay F.,"New York, NY",376,277,184

This was a great portion size and probably saved us a couple of bucks.Everything was incredible -- even the breadbasket! After snacking on the salami and cheese focaccia, we enjoyed the short ribs, scallops and spaghetti with tomato an basil sauce (split). We also ordered the Mozzarella In Carrozza. This was good -- made better by using the tomatoes from the bread alongside it.

4.0,9/29/2010,"As converts to Paleo eating, we've recently sworn off grains, which -- at first glance -- makes Scarpetta an odd choice for dinner. After all, Scott Conant's pastas are the primary draw for many who dine here.When our server tried to tell us about the tasting menu, my wife asked: ""How carb-y is it?"" Our waiter looked a little stricken.""Um, is it a gluten thing?"" he responded.""No, not really."" We don't like to get into it, but interactions like these make for awkward silences.The four of us passed on the tasting menu (the spaghetti and tagliatelle dishes were the deciding factor) and ordered a la carte. While our two dinner companions feasted on Scarpetta's grain-enhanced staples (braised beef shortrib with farro risotto, creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms, and heaping bowls of Scarpetta's signature spaghetti with tomato and basil), my wife and I stuck to caveman food: meat, seafood and veggies. We started with delicate raw yellowtail with olio di zenzero & crunchy, flaked sea salt, seared sea scallops with sunchokes and roasted porcini mushrooms, and an incredibly flavorful cauliflower panna cotta with crab, sea urchin and caviar. (We also managed to pluck some of the truffled mushrooms from the aforementioned polenta, and nabbed some of the melt-in-your-mouth tender shortribs from atop the risotto. Both were excellent; I would have loved a dish consisting of just beef shortribs with truffled mushrooms.)For our main courses, we split the roasted sirloin with root vegetables and rapini, and the black cod with caramelized fennel and concentrated tomatoes. The sirloin was hearty, delicious, and perfectly medium-rare. And while the portion of black cod fillet was a little on the small side and slightly undercooked, I really enjoyed the sweetness of the fennel and tomatoes.Our companions had the chocolate and vanilla parfait for dessert, served with a little hazelnut milkshake and biscotti; it looked terrific, but we did not partake. Instead, we finished off the meal with a selection of three cheeses -- my favorites were the Humboldt Fog goat cheese and Robiola sheep cheese. Each came with a dollop of sweetness: honey, figs, blackberries.In sum, Scarpetta was terrific.

5.0,9/20/2010,"Let me begin by saying the service is phenomenal. The attention to detail, the way the servers take care of the customer is great. The crowd varies but generally it is a good mix of locals some t&b, and tourists. The bread basket is an assortment of freshly baked breads that are made on premises. The pancetta and cheese wrapped into one of the breads is delicious. Appetizers:The Creamy Polenta with truffled mushrooms is a must. I ask for some red peppers flakes to add another depth of flavor. Entree:Hands down Scott Contant has the best Tomato and Basil Spaghetti in the city, so that is a must. The halibut is perfectly cooked and does not need to be wrapped in lardo. You can request that. Desserts:Are less desirable. I would say mediocre at best. One last tip, if you enjoy Ginger ale as much as I do, I highly recommend ordering it at Scarpetta.

1.0,9/19/2010,"To begin the very long list of why not to waste your money at this terrible restaurant the service was some of the worst I've ever experienced. We waited for over 15 minutes to order a drink and then had to hail the hostess to help us because we had no idea who our waiter was. This was particularly infuriating because there were at least 10 uniformed servers and busboys swarming the dinning room area, yet no one approached our table. The hostess also took our order because again our waiter was no where to be found. When the entrees were served one was the wrong dish and instead of apologizing the busboy argued with my mother about what she had ordered. My father and I had finished our meal by the time my mother's correct dish came out. At this point we had already asked for the check multiple times, and my father had to get up and physically locate the manager to get the bill since no one would bring it to us. The food that we were able to eat was mediocre at best and certainty no where near worth the cost. Additionally the menu was very limited and unappealing. After we waited another 20 minutes for the check we paid and spoke to a couple sitting next to us who had to send their pork tenderloin back because it was so rare it looked like tuna tartare. I had overheard the waiter arguing with them about how it should be cooked.  When we finally were able to leave the man who apparently was our waiter barely whispered an apology as we walked out which was the first acknowledgement of our dissatisfaction with our meal and overall experience. This is clearly another trendy meatpacking restaurant which is overhyped and overpriced. Don't waste your money or time.",0,1,0,Janna B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0
3.0,9/14/2010,"As I was eating my entrée of veal loin with sweet bread, I kept thinking ""less is more,""  While the veal was cooked wonderfully, there was just too much else going on.  The same can be said of the black pasta with seafood. My dinning companion also complained about the amount of sands present in the shell fish.  On the other hand, the famed spaghetti with tomato and basil is an exemplary case of ""less is more.""  The secret lies in the fine quality of the pasta and the use of butter in the sauce (saw it on FoodTV).  Definitely over-priced, I would still order it again.  The table breads with the accompanying dips and spreads are only eclipsed by Le Bernadin's salmon rillettes, and the polenta is pleasant.  Unfortunately, the lardo-wrapped halibut was unfathomably dry despite its inspiration.  A complete misfire.  The service was fine but there are way too many staff members walking around non-stop--quite distracting.",0,0,0,John T.,"Portsmouth, NH",19,50,20

I love beets, but did not particularly like the poppy seed-pistachio topping on the ravioli.I think a key to your experience here is to keep your expectations in check. Opinions on Scarpetta have ranged from ""phenomenal"" to ""just okay"" to ""overhyped"", so each time I just hope for a a good meal and nothing out of the ordinary.

5.0,8/31/2010,"I've always thought Scott Conant was a harsh critic on TV, but now I know he's just holding other chefs to his high standards. DInner at Scarpetta was a simple, wonderful, delicious meal.Bread Basket - I'm not a huge fan of the bread basket at most restaurants, but the bread here was so wonderfully fresh and yummy, I had a couple of pieces. I can't remember all the different types of bread offered, but all the ones I ate were good. The best one was definitely the stromboli, stuffed with smoked mozzarella, salami, basil, and cherry tomato. I wish more restaurants served bread like this! I slathered the rest of the bread in olive oil, eggplant caponata and mascarpone butter. I could eat this bread basket every day!Braised short ribs of beef w/ vegetable and farro risotto - The short ribs were so tender, no knife was needed. The risotto w/ the sauce was rich, wonderful and oh so tasty.Creamy polenta w/ fricassee of truffled mushrooms - A touch salty, but  a perfect marriage of the smooth, creamy polenta and the rich, flavorful mushrooms. The truffle oil really highlights the earthy flavor of the mushrooms and takes this dish from good to great.Spaghetti w/ tomato and basil - I have never had spaghetti like this before. I've read the rave reviews of this dish, but was always a bit skeptical - how good can a simple spaghetti dish be? Apparently, really, really good. The perfect tomato sauce paired with perfectly al dente noodles, need I say more?Duck and foie gras ravioli w/ marsala reduction - The ravioli filling is creamy and delicious. although there isn't a strong flavor of duck. The marsala reduction is good and doesn't overwhelm the rest of the dish.Black tagliolini w/ mixed seafood, sea urchin and minted bread crumbs - This is one of the best black pastas I've ever had. This is the first time I""ve had black pasta with uni and I have to say, I really loved it. Seafood was cooked well and not chewy, but my fave part of the dish was the minted bread crumbs.Beautiful restaurant, great food, fast service, I'll definitely be coming back again.",2,0,1,Kelsey T.,"New York, NY",401,440,62

4.0,8/25/2010,"Scarpetta has been a name glued onto my best friend's vocabulary ever since I met her.  So, it was only natural for my gfs and I to celebrate my best friend's birthday at this space.  Given its location, in the unfortunate area called MeatPacking, I wasn't sure what type of crowd to expect.  I'm someone close to my mid30s and hanging out 'to be seen' is something I graduated in my 20s.  Loud men with slick hair and women in heels they can barely walk in (I endearingly call women who can't walk in their heels 'the mantis') are the general crowd even on school nights in that neighborhood, and sure enough, the bar area of Scarpetta was filled with obnoxiousness. ""Hi, I was wondering if you could squeeze me and my lady friend in...we have no reservations, but, you know who I am..right?""  (barf)Luckily, all that ended once we were seated in the dining area.  And everything - EVERYTHING - changed.First of all, the service is impeccable. Given, our table did consist of beautiful young ladies (minus me - my friends are definitely hot) and maybe the waiter just felt like being super friendly to us.  Still, he was attentive, patient and willing to explain and help us select the best meal.  And not only was he nice - the sommelier, the bussers... they all did their jobs with smiles and humor.  Food was amazing.  For appetizers we shared the Fritto Misto (there are fried anchovies in here - yum for me, but not yum for many), Burrata and the creamy polenta.  The creamy polenta was a clear winner out of the three, but everything was delicious.  And I think with our waiter's help, we chose 3 distinctively different dishes that played out well with each other.We shared 3 pasta dishes - the cavatelli with rabbit, the agnolotti with fonduta, and a linguine with parmigianno and sausage.  Out of the 3, unfortunately, the cavatelli was the least favorite of mine.  We felt that the pasta itself was too 'floury' (thick - mealy) and I felt that the rabbit was drenched in too much five-spice or some other type of gamey-flavor taste killing herb.  And then we had 2 fish entrees - the cod and the halibut.  Some people might have thought that these two would be too similar and wouldn't have ordered them together.  But, again with the help of our waiter, we had the most amazingly prepared fish dishes ever.  They were so different from each other too - which was the nice thing about it.  During the entire meal, we were never rushed.  Actually, they suggested that they had brought out the pastas too late and to compensate for that, they gave us a complimentary quartino of wine and a dessert.   Meanwhile, we were actually happy with the pace of the meal, since we didn't have to 'stuff; ourselves with the ginormous amount of food we had consumed.FYI, the breadbasket is an entire course of its own, filled with a variety of delicious italian breads.  The most notable of them all is the foccacia baked with slices of salumi and cheese in it.  We named it 'a sandwich' and even asked the waiter ""why are you guys serviing us a SANDWICH before a meal??""  While I would ask you to practice caution with the breadbasket because it could easily stuff you up before the actual food, i have to say... it's yummmmmmy.Definitely go hungry!!  I'm taking my bf there for his birthday.",1,0,1,Junnifer L.,"New York, NY",1,38,0

I can't wait to come back To start - amazing ambiance. We sat outside, and atmosphere was very engaging. Waitress was attentive and supportive (in terms of suggestions). Next to meatpacking, I didn't feel any pretentiousness, and noise level was just right. This place is known for its pasta (as our waitress suggested earnestly), but we were feeling more seafood (to where the menu is also weighted). A restaurant's second best specialty, proving better than almost every other seafood place in NYC that I have tried, is an indication to me of the flexibility, potential, and depth of the menu The bread - wow. A few pieces had butter, some vegetables and I believe meat already baked into it. Absolutely delicious Appetizer: We had the raw yellowtail and creamy polenta with truffed mushrooms to start. I definitely soaked the remainder of the bread in the polenta to completely clean off my plate. Yellowtail didn't have a sushi taste (good thing) and was appropriately seasoned to taste very unique and clean Main course: Black Cod with caramelized fennel and tomatoes. Fish was cooked perfectly, and with a delightful mixture of the sweet underside, crispy skin, and tender meat, i found myself cleaning off my plate, again Dessert: Chocolate cake and Banana Budino. I have always been a fan of cake with ice cream on the side. The blend of the warm fluffy cake and the sharper chilled texture of the ice cream made me (you guessed it) clean my plate again.

 He deserves to be famous, smug, even.  Scarpetta rocks.Let's get the incidentals out of the way.  The atmosphere was swank without being over-the-top.  The service was nothing out of the ordinary, but helpful and attentive enough.  There was one snag when the wait staff forgot to put in an order and it came when we were already getting full, but otherwise, no issues.  Anyway, now to the food.The bread basket was outstanding.  One of the offerings was a strombolli, a practical sandwich with layers of smoked mozzarella, salami, basil, and cherry tomato.  It was a small course unto itself, savory and flavorful.  The rest of the bread was great, too, with nice crusts and fluffy insides.  The basket was served with eggplant caponata, olive oil, and some beautiful smooth mascarpone butter.  I defy you to find a more impressive bread service anywhere.Our table of seven split three appetizers - fritto misto, creamy polenta, and braised short rib - and they were all fantastic.  The fritto misto was a delightful assortment of squid and vegetables prepared tempura style.  I'd never had a tempura without sauce that wasn't worse for its lack until this dish.  The squid and the batter were flavorful, and crispy tempura herbs and thin lemon wedges made sure that every bite was exciting.  The creamy polenta with a fricaseee of truffled mushrooms was tremendous, just out of control delicious.  The mushrooms were earthy and fragrant and offered a firm bite that contrasted well with the perfectly creamy, corn-forward polenta.  The braised short ribs of beef with vegetable and farro risotto was the least of the starters, but it was rich and meaty and good in its own right.The adult half of our table went family style and everything was wonderful.  The standouts, though, were definitely the pasta.  The spaghetti with tomato and basil was $24, and until you try it you'll be unable to fathom how it could be worth every penny.  I've tried Conant's recipe at home, and while it yielded a great spaghetti, I couldn't replicate the finesse and intensity of flavor.  You cannot leave Scarpetta without trying this spaghetti.  It was tauntingly, impudently simple, but delicious beyond compare.  The texture gave a great chew with a lovely amount of bounce-back resistance, and that peerless tomato sauce and basil oil were so consummately incorporated you would think sauce and noodle had been born together, a perfect whole like Venus from her seashell.  Don't squirm at the sticker price - this is the Platonic ideal of spaghetti.I know I've labeled the spaghetti as the must-get, but a couple of the other pastas were just as amazing.  The duck and foie gras ravioli with marsala reduction gets a lot of attention, and deservedly so.  This was the goof-up dish that came towards the end of our meal, and that was unfortunate as it was delicious but very rich.  That said, it was easy to eat considering the unctuous ingredients, and the flavors were intense and luscious.  The ravioli had a great texture, too, again demonstrating Scarpetta's mastery of pasta.  The black tagliolini with mixed seafood, sea urchin, and minted bread crumbs was incredible, as worthy of praise as the signature dishes.  The squid ink pasta was a supple al dente, and it came with fresh mussels, squid, and shrimp.  The sea urchin added a briny creaminess that could come from nothing else, and the bright green minted bread crumbs added color and cool flavor.  The only pasta I didn't love was the short rib agnolotti with hazelnuts, brown butter, and horseradish.  The pasta was nice, but the dish was heavy and a bit cloying.We also tried the black cod with caramelized fennel and concentrated tomatoes.  This was a great piece of buttery fish and the accompaniments were tasty, but it wasn't as memorable as the pasta.  Ditto the roasted sirloin with horseradish potato puree, baby spinach, pickled shallots, and braised oxtail sauce.Desserts were lovely.  My favorites were a white chocolate semifreddo with strawberries, white balsamico, and basil syrup, and a banana budino with pecan gelato and an oat tuile.  The semifreddo was very refreshing and the strawberry and basil made a brilliant team.  The budino was like concentrated banana bread, gooey, dense, and flavorful.  A chocolate cake with burnt orange-caramel gelato and espresso sauce was another delight, and the chocolate and vanilla parfait with hazelnut milkshake and biscotti was solid, served with juicy blackberries.I'm being effusive here, but I don't think Scarpetta is capable of being overhyped.  When spaghetti with red sauce costs $24 and still puts a smile on your face, you know you're eating somewhere special.",7,4,5,Steph C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3889,3534,94
4.0,7/2/2010,"My experience at Scarpetta was fantastic. The space had a great warmness to it. It artfully paired classic elements with modern accents (leather belts holding up the mirrors--cool!). The food was pretty spectacular, and reasonably priced. I tried the burrata, polenta with black truffle sauce, the spaghetti, and the halibut. The spaghetti was unlawfully good.. The burrata was creamy and soft, and the polenta was rich and earthy. I thought that the halibut was OK, but nothing to write home about. It was a tad overcooked, and I thought that the spring vegetables were basic and lacking in flavor. I tried the duck, which was cooked to meaty perfection. Although the service was technically very good, it was surprisingly stiff and remote. It did not match up with the relaxed and homey vibe of the place. Overall, I loved my experience here and I would return in a heartbeat. **Please note, this restaurant is not that ""dressy"" as Yelp says.

4.0,6/30/2010,The tomato basil pasta here is to die for and it alone deserves 4 stars.  We also tried the squid ink pasta and a venison dish which were both pretty good but no match for the restaurant's signature dish.  This restaurant is incredibly elegant and the service was top notch.  Definitely a great place for a special occasion or if you're just craving some delicious pasta!,0,0,0,Annie T.,"San Francisco, CA",182,76,0

The wine list here is good. The bread basket is one of my favorites in the city. The polenta is my favorite app by far, so creamy. Every pasta here is amazing. I always have to order the duck and foie gras ravioli. I dream about this dish.

2.0,6/20/2010,"I was really excited to try this place as I've only heard great things... however I have never left a restaurant feeling more ripped off.We started with the scallop and sunchoke appetizer, which was actually a nice start to the meal.  However when my short rib ravioli arrived I almost wanted to send it back before even trying it.  The portion was so ridiculously small that it took me all of about a minute to finish the entire plate, and that was taking it slow.  The raviolis themselves were tiny, with barely any filling inside and I could not for the life of me taste anything close to short rib.  There was a total lack of any sauce besides an overbearing amount of lemon juice squeezed on top so the taste was very dry.   My friend ordered the orange duck entree which I tried and it had a nice flavor however also a very small portion, three sliced strips of duck atop some caramelized endive.  So there were some good points, but based on the portion size and price and my pasta entree, there's no reason why I would want to go back.",1,0,0,Erik H.,"Brooklyn, NY",14,2,0

3.0,6/5/2010,"Please understand that I'm writing this review not having eaten here, so I'm giving it 3 stars to not dramatically lower its average score.  I became interested in this restaurant after watching Chopped on Food Network, where Scott Conant is an occasional judge.  I called the restaurant to make a reservation, found a time and date that worked for my party, and the receptionist asked me for my name and phone number.  After giving her the phone number, the receptionist asked me to repeat the last four digits which I did, and immediately afterwards I hear the phone slam down into the receiver on the other end.  I didn't get a ""thank you"" or a ""we look forward to seeing you then"" or even a ""you're all set"".  I wondered: ""did I just get hung up on"", ""did she drop the phone"", ""did my reservation even get through"".  Perplexed, I called back, and got the same woman on the phone, and I asked her if she hung up on me, she curtly replied ""No, that's not what I intended"".  She gave no explanation nor apology, and honestly I didn't push the matter.  After reading many reviews it appears this place is more New York attitude than Italian hospitality.  I'm taking my business elsewhere.",0,0,0,Matt J.,"Atlanta, GA",14,108,4
4.0,6/4/2010,"Had an awesome meal here - anniversary special of 4 courses and wine pairings for $50. 2-3 choices per course, and everything was from their normal menu. We started off with the delicious bread basket that included their famous stromboli and a selection of dips. Our first course we sampled the short ribs over farro and the mushroom polenta. both were delicious and good portion sizes. Our second course was pastas - the famous spaghetti with tomato and basil and the short rib agnolotti. The spaghetti was so simple and fresh I couldn't stop eating it. We preferred the short rib from the appetizer over the pasta course but it was still pretty good. By now we were stuffed but we ate our third course of black cod and the capretto. We both found these dishes a bit disappointing after the previous courses - the cod was just a touch undercooked (I like everything rare but this texture was a little much for something as meaty as cod) and the capretto was a bit more gamey than I liked. Last course we had dessert, which was, I think passion fruit panna cotta with coconut ice cream and a moist banana cake with carmelized bananas. Both of these were very good, and I was glad they had creative fruit options rather than just the standard molten chocolate cake and creme brulee. Also, the wine pairings were great (although not actually paired to order, they were delicious) and our server mentioned to us that the second wine was actually a $200 on the menu so they really went all out on this special menu.We really enjoyed our meal and the special was an unbelievable value. Although I wanted to give this place a 5 star - the last entrees just didn't hit the spot. If we were paying full price I would have been unhappy. I would, however absolutely recommend the place. I think the starters and pastas shine and I can't wait to come back for the foie gras ravioli.",2,0,0,Lainy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",145,634,8

The portions were generously sized and YES, they are as good as everyone says! My husband ordered the asparagus soup with clams and lobster ravioli entree. He did not seem to love his as much, but was overall pleased with his meal. Service and staff were excellent. My waitress came by a few times to see if we needed anything and every time she asked me how I was enjoying the meal, she had this knowing grin on her face like... ""yea, I know you love it"".

3.0,5/22/2010,"I was really excited to come here but didn't feel this restaurant was anything too special.I enjoyed my food but was not blown away by anything. My favorite dish of the night was the seared scallops with sunchokes. This was by far the best dish we had of the night. I also enjoyed the other 2 appetizers we ordered: yellowtail and polenta (although this was lacking a bit of salt, in my opinion). Next was the short rib filled pasta which was good but definitely not as good as either of the pastas I tried at convivio.We shared the goat which I thought was tender but in general goat is not something I order and this preparation definitely did not change my mind on that.The service was indifferent (borderline bad), the atmosphere was not impressive. I found this restaurant mediocre and I am not sure what all the hype is about.

5.0,5/3/2010,"Love of the ingredient is evident in everything Scarpetta has put on our 8 person table. Starting from the freshly-baked, still warm and crusty breads that were used to frenziedly mop up the delicious starter of olive oil and eggplant tapenade, it was clear were were in for a treat. Scallop appetizer was contained and rather simple, but every single bit on the plate, from the ocean-tasting scallops to the roasted garlic was delicious. The famous polenta and truffled mushrooms stole the show however. Buttery and decadent, the first taste created a personal Ratatouille moment as I have gotten that warm and fuzzy ""I don't know when was the last time I enjoyed anything that much"" feeling. Pastas- Ravioli with shrimp in a saffron broth (more like saffron water) was good, very flavorful but nothing ethereal. The hyped up spaghetti with tomato sauce tasted a bit too..hyped up. It was good, no doubt about it, but I've had the same in most trattorias in Rome and Tuscany for $12 not $24. The rest of the pastas however shined through their hefty price tags. Black tagliolini with seafood was superb. Elastic, perfectly made and cooked pasta with carefully selected velvetty uni, plump mussels, briny clams and translucent shrimp. Bowtie special pasta with sweetbreads was great as was tagliatelle with spring vegetables. Savory, perfectly balanced and deceptively simple. Wines by the glass were excellent, both reds and whites. Deserts- dark chocolate cake was good but nothing special, I've had much better. Olive oil cake was more interesting and the ice cream and tangerines that came with it complemented it perfectly. Although next time for desert, I'd probably just order another pasta.Service was attentive, non-intrusive and efficient.",6,3,3,Dina L.,"New York, NY",93,87,3
5.0,4/30/2010,"I adore Scarpetta.  The decor is chic and comfortable, the menu is full of delectable things and the overall experience was relaxing and blissful.  I expected it to be a lot more casual and more of a ""scene."" Instead it was a very refined place with a long bar, casual front seating area and a main dining room with a massive glass enclosed ceiling that let the light in.  We sat in a caddy corner booth perfect for two.  i didnt see anything interested on the cocktail menu so I went with a glass of champagne (my old standby) and my husband had red wine.  The menu was difficult to navigate only because everything looked SO good.  From the traditional mozzarella in corozza to the new American fish carpaccio and soft shell crab appetizer (which I had, delicious.)  The entrees were a page full of pasta like duck and foie gras ravioli (amazing, and a very nice portion!), cavatelli with rabbit, black tagliatelle and good old fashioned spaghetti to meat entrees like steak, goat and fish.  I can't complain about any of the food, it was all absolutely delicious.  I went with the more exotic flavors (soft shell crab and duck and foie gras ravioli) while my husband went the more traditional route with the mozzarella and spaghetti (as usual.)  I even had trouble deciding on the  dessert menu so I got two (white chocolate semi freddo and chocolate and vanilla parfait) but they also had cake, fruit tarts and panna cotta.It's pricey so not a casual place but I'll definitely go back for another date night or special occasion.",3,1,2,Kimberly G.,"Williamsburg, NY",0,69,0

5.0,4/18/2010,"This place was great! From start to finish everything was delectable. First off - the BREAD - there had this stromboli and I beleive a marscapone cheese bread that was absolutely delicious. They give you three different dipping choices. I could have been happy on the bread aloneAppetizer - I had a creamy polenta with truffles. It had the feel of comfort food but with much higher quality. The flavors of the truffles and the polenta mixing together warm and creamy was perfect. I also tryied a braised short rib on a bed a risotto. It was tender and savory. Entree - Spaghetti wtih Tomato and Basil. This sounds simple enough but the way Scarpetta does it is to die for! House made noodles that are extra thick with a density that you don't get with generic noodles. The spaghettie was perfectly sauced with a tomato sauce that must have been made from magic. And the basil was fresh and added just the right amount of herbally flavor. My husband had a duck and foie gras ravioli, which was a bit rich for me, but it tasted quite nice. Dessert - Chocolate and vanilla parfait with hazelnut milkshake and biscotti. The milkshake was actually quite small, which was good because at this point I am stuffed. The parfait was smooth and creamy and and had many more complementary flavors in it that just chocolate and vanilla. I also sampled a chocolate cake that was rich but it was perfectly tempered with a burnt orange sherbert. The service was exquisite. They took full orders and the beginning of the meal, which is great because they bring out the food at perfect intervals. Our waitor and the staff was friendly and attentive. The only drawback was that it's a bit pricey, but it's a good place if you are looking to treat yourself.",1,0,1,Amy D.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,14,0
2.0,4/15/2010,"My husband and I were invited to dinner here as a thank you present from a friend, and after reading various online reviews we were quite intrigued to see what lay in store for us in the kitchens of Scarpetta.Upon arrival we were greeted by somewhat surly hostesses who couldn't seem to locate our reservation, but once they had, we were led to our table, seated and greeted by a very smiley waiter who asked us if there was anything we'd like to drink. I ordered a G&T and was very happy, when it arrived, and the waiter poured it into my glass, that there was more G than T. That always puts me in a good mood!It took us all a while to decide upon what we were going to have, but in the end, my husband took the polenta fricassee of truffed mushrooms for a starter, and I had the scallops. Before they arrived we were given a bread basket and a selection of 3 different dips. The lemon oil was amazingly good, as was the bread, and we sat there thinking, ""Good, this looks promising."".Then, the starters came. Whilst I was not expecting the world from my scallops and was not at all disappointed in them, probably due to that fact, my husband's mushroom goop was another matter. The polenta was thick and gunky, the flavour rather bland and the mushrooms could have been cooked by anyone with a little bit of mushroom chopping, butter melting, frying-pan-cooking knowledge.A little disheartened, but ever hopeful, we awaited our main courses: the (infamous) basil & tomato spaghetti for my hub and the cavatelli braised rabbit, parsnips & mint for me. After all the hype regarding the spaghetti we had expected some ground-breaking pasta sauce set to make you weak at the knees and beg the chef for mercy, what we got was something that I - without sounding presumptious - could rustle up in two seconds flat, and have much more flavour and depth to it. My rabbit pasta was fine, but that was all I could say about it, it was also pretty bland and devoid of spices or herbs that really managed to set it off.The desserts were better than the rest of the food and we were all pretty happy with those, as we also were with the wines that our hostess ordered.I'm very sorry to say, after having been so excited to go to Scarpetta and expecting to be given a really wonderful culinary experience, we both came away thinking that if we'd been paying the bill (the prices are not cheap of course) we would not have been remotely happy. As it was, we got a free meal and were left thinking that we are, in fact, a lot better chefs than this guy and feel quite proud of our own culinary skills.",4,2,1,stefanie f.,"New York, NY",0,2,0

4.0,4/13/2010,"Next to The Diner which commands the corner of 14th and 9th, I've probably easily walked by Scarpetta a million times. From the outside the restaurant is discreet and unassuming, making it a real treasure to the Meatpacking District. I liked the open space (high ceilings) of the entrance and bar area. The backbone of the bar, an exposed brick wall, adds character to the front room. The dining room exudes a warm ambiance - intimate but not cramped, dim light but not a black hole. Scarpetta means ""little shoe"" - how much cuter does it get? It feels like you fit nicely inside. For starters, we decided to share two pastas between a group of 4. We had the short rib agnolotti with hazelnuts, brown butter and horseradish and the tagliatelle with seasonal vegetables, white truffles and parmigiano. Both were delicious and fresh. I am not a big meat eater so my personal favorite was the tagliatelle. The sauce was light but still very tasty...can't go wrong with truffles! For my main course, I had the black cod on top of carmelized fennel and concentrated tomatoes. Black cod is one of my favorite fishes but I've never had it at a non-Asian restaurant. The sauce and its pairing with the fennel and tomato made it an excellent blend of flavors that melted together. Other entrées at the table included the imported turbot and lardo-wrapped halibut. Unfortunately, I didn't try the other dishes but everyone else was very pleased!

5.0,3/28/2010,"What a greal meal I had tonight and it has just vaulted into one of my favorite restaurants in the city. Everything was wonderful. I arrived 5 minutes before my 5:30 reservation and was seated immediately. I really loved the room with the skylight ceiling, allowing the natural sunlight to flow through. My waiter was great and really steered me in the right direction as far as ordering was concerned. I was very tempted to order from the tasting menu which was $80 and included 5 courses. But I didn't feel like having a huge meal so I decided on ordering the following: Spaghetti, Cod, Polenta with mushrooms.The bread basket is one of the best I have ever had. The stromboli bread was addictive and reminded me of my mother's (great compliment lol). The focaccio was good also. But best of all were the accompaniments. I am a butter junkie and any time a place takes time to give you mascarpone butter and eggplant caponata they get big time brownie points from me baby!!! Tip though- try not to fill up on it because it is quite heavy and you want to save room for all the delicious food that comes later on.Since they do not do half portion pastas, I requested that I have half the spaghetti with tomato and basil and the other half packaged to go, and the waiter kindly obliged. The pasta was still an incredibly generous portion and I loved how it comes out with a cover on top of the bowl to keep it hot. When they removed the cool lid, I was presented with a soft ball sized portion of thick spaghetti coated in their signature tomato and basil sauce. As I dug in, the steam burst into the air. Right away that gets huge poitns for me since I love my food hot! I must say this dish was very good, but I didn't think it was a total mindblower or worth all the ""hype"" it has received. To be 100 percent honest, I actually prefer my mother's pasta more. But nonetheless it was a really good dish- very light, fresh, basily, and cooked perfect al dente.Next I went with the black cod and I requested the creamy polenta (2 signature dishes) to be served with it as a side. OMG! Where the spaghetti was a tad ovehyped, these 2 really lived up to their billing. The cod had a perfect crispy skin and the inside was so incredibly moist when I cut through it, it fell apart and was oozing with juiciness that I have never seen before with a fish dish. The tomato glaze on top was perfect and the caramelized tomatoes and fennel were the perfect accompaniments. And that polenta WOW! I love love love polenta and I must say this is the best I have ever had and definitely on of the top ten dishes in NYC right now. Perfectly buttery, creamy, cheesy, and you get that sweet corn flavor to boot. Oh yeah and did I mention to unbelievable mushrooms that are stewed in this mushroom broth from heaven?

2.0,3/20/2010,"All the hype, all the glowing reviews, all the accolades are once again for naught. While this is a nice, better than decent restaurant it certainly is not worth bending over backwards to secure a reservation.  The Times gave it 3 stars and perhaps it was worthy at the time but now it warrants 1.5 stars, at best. Nothing is bad but nothing hits the heights either.The experience starts off with a cold, snooty and disinterested greeting from the woman who appears to run the front desk.  A semi-blonde who is drunk on some non existent power and manages in the first 5 seconds to set a tone of 'what are you doing here' kinda attitude.  NOT GOOD when you diligently and excitedly book a dinner reservation a month in advance to celebrate an occasion. So bottom line, she sucks big time.Next, the food.  Supposedly the star attraction. We had 4 apps, a pasta course and 4 entrees and 2 desserts plus 2 bottles of vino:Apps: Fritto misto was fine but unexceptional, burrato was fresh and lovely, the polenta with truffles was dull and uninspired.Pasta: the short rib and horseradish agnolotti was light and interesting if not a bit odd in taste.  Entrees: the baby goat was wildly disappointing; heavy handed in the seasoning and simply blah.  The turbot and halibut were fresh but I was underwhelmed with the seasoning on the fish.  The pear almond tart was good but the vanilla/chocolate parfait was a throw away.  Great wine selection with lots of offerings in the mid range, which is appreciated.  Bottom line is I've had much better dinners, at Morandi for example, where the food is blow away great...Scarpetta simply isn't delivering excellent food.",0,0,0,David P.,"New York, NY",115,108,16

I've been talking about Scarpetta for quite some time, and the constant OpenTable e-mail reminders have haunted me, as we've always had to reschedule.Holy elitist sexism and double standards when it comes to service and ambiance. In the words of Mike F.: ""harder to find than the tiny shoe for which it's named""; don't be fooled, Scarpetta does it for a reason... While yeah, we did arrive at 9:50 for a 10 pm rez, they sat us after 10:15, and only after re-inquiring. Scarpetta provides unmatched cuisine but it was not my crowd, from lumberjack obnoxious cappuccino girl to the 4 or 5 people who miraculously misplaced their cell phones inside their seats. They were packed on a Tuesday with suits and pomp, but it's because of the food. Apparently, however, the suits at the bar can't grasp the concept of OpenTable, and I was happy to see them have to wait until another day for a table. Not sure why they come just for drinks, though, as the bartenders were clumsy and socially awkward, especially for this kinda joint. I guess it's just the place to be seen. On that note...sure, show up dressed well, but don't feel down if you don't (but you really should, and you will).

4.0,2/23/2010,"You walk into Scarpetta feeling like you need to be fashionable, trendy, and really really good-looking to eat there.  Everyone in there was well-dressed and attractive.  So naturally, I fit right in.  In all seriousness, places like these feel cold and relatively superficial and usually fail to speak to me.  However, the food (for the most part) were utterances of warmth and depth.  I especially loved the table bread.  There was even one stuffed with cheese and cured meats! (one of the best free table carbs I've ever had).  Don't get too full on this though because the portions are quite large.  SHARING IS A MUST.  Each plate contains enough to serve two, easily.  The wonderful thing is, the staff divides each course for you and serves it so.  The service was also particularly embracive.  Our waiter (whose name I'm ashamed to admit I've forgotten) exhibited sincere concern in regard to every aspect of our meal.  Our opinion about each dish was graciously solicited and seemed genuinely valued.  He was never too busy to chat about a particular dish, his prior work with Michael White, or the new projects of Scott Conant (check out Faustina).   Food:Polenta with truffle and mushrooms - What everyone else said.Duck foie gras ravioli - best dish of the night for me based on the first few bites (but eating too much of it can get slightly nauseating)Spaghetti with tomato and basil - lived up to the hype. Sounds so boring and simple but Conant transforms this classic into a novel joy.Branzino with winter truffles - BAD.  I don't understand what happened here.  Not only was the fish bland and uninspired, the truffles had strong hints of what seemed like Chlorox Bleach (at least that's what me and my gf got from it).  It rendered the entire dish practically inedible.  Was it supposed to taste like that?  An acquired taste? An unusual cooking mistake?  I really was confused by it.  If I really gave this dish its due consideration and weight, it was off-putting enough to spoil the ENTIRE meal and experience.  However, I'm choosing to disregard it as best I can, treating it as a forgivable anomaly.Panna Cotta in guava soup, topped with sorbet, and caramelized pineapple - Overly ambitious.  The panna cotta itself was perfect.  We ended up eating just that.  The other components were irritating bells and whistles.  I can see how others may find it fun though, but it just wasn't for me.Conclusion:If I'm being honest about this particular meal, this place is 3 stars at best, especially considering how poorly it ended.  At 70 dollars per person for food (tax, tip incl., wine not incl.), there is no excuse for a dish like the branzino.  I'm giving Scarpetta 4 stars because I'm being stubborn and refusing to give that dish any weight in my rating.  The service really made me want to love this place and so damnit, I will love it.  But if something like that happens again when I return, you can be sure I won't hesitate to spew Yelptastic crap all over this establishment, regardless of how ridiculously well I fit in as a good-looking person.",8,8,6,andrew c.,"Brooklyn, NY",43,78,0
4.0,2/22/2010,"I've always thought that Scarpetta sounded like the name of a villain. It's so sibilantly similar to Scarpia, Scalia, Slytherin.... Maybe those associations are why, after all these years of hearing rave reviews of this restaurant, I still hadn't gotten around to trying it -- until tonight. We walked in without any difficulty around 8:30, without reservations, and were seated in the front room (where, evidently, people without reservations are relegated). Our table was a bit unpleasantly close to the wait station -- right next to it, in fact -- but the space was still quite attractive and far enough from the door that we weren't getting hit with blasts of cold air each time it opened. I have to confess that I did love the front room's farmhouse chic, its variegated wood walls and cast-iron light fixtures. We started with the yellowtail crudo with ginger and sea salt and the chestnut soup with root vegetables and beef cheeks. Both were quite good. Yellowtail was a nice study of textures, with crunchy sea salt and microgreens contrasting nicely with the well cut, tender, fresh fish. There was just enough acid to brighten each bite and not a bit more. Chestnut soup was rich and earthy -- a lovely wintertime dish. For my main, I had the Sicilian-spiced duck breast with preserved orange and roasted root vegetables (actually carrots, endive and beets). The portion was small, clearly meant to be eaten after a larger, belly-lining pasta course, though sufficient for me. The meat was extremely tender and beautifully, perfectly seasoned, but prepared very rare without the wait staff asking me how I wanted it cooked. I personally love my meat bloody, but probably not everyone enjoys duck that way. In any event, I thought the dish was excellent. I do wish I'd ordered something more assertive to go with it than my quartino of pinot nero. It was a 2007, but was pale, watery and tasted much younger. [Didn't try the SO's housemade spaghetti with tomato and basil, but he loved it.] We finished with a nuanced, light, refreshing dessert of coconut panna cotta served with guava ""soup"", caramelized pineapple and a scoop of coconut ice cream (or possibly sorbet). Panna cotta was a lovely texture, almost as tender as dofu fa, and the guava soup was not overly sweet. The coconut ice cream tasted of the very essence of coconut, but avoided being cloying. It was a great dish to end a rich meal, though not entirely seasonal.  It's pretty clear that the kitchen is able to put out beautifully made food. Some might take issue with the portion sizes, which are designed to be part of a four or five course meal, though I personally do not. I wasn't thrilled with the two wines off the wine list we tried that were available by the quartino: Quality to price ratio seemed to be much lower than it is at Mario Batali restaurants. But in all honesty, at this point, it's too early for me to have a well-informed opinion; I'll have to do a lot more, ah.... ""research"". :) I will say I'm inspired to come back after a strong first meal. [A shout out to Deanna W. for giving me the kick in the pants to go!]",6,1,4,Jane D.,"New York, NY",102,255,31

When we were finally sat, we asked to speak to the maitre d' and just expressed our disappointment that we had to wait for so long for our table. She gave the same excuse and seemed dismissive and not at all apologetic - whatever, we thought. We gave her our opinion.I'll forgive Scarpetta for making us wait so long - later on I was deciding between the scallops and the polenta. The waiter (extremely nice guy, great service) helped me settle on the polenta (very good. I'm not usually a fan of mushroom but despite this, I liked the dish as it was rich in texture and had a nice balance of flavors.). When it came the waiter also brought us the seared scallops (cooked to perfection) - on the house! The spaghetti with tomato/basil was INCREDIBLE, and foie gras good (I'm not usually a fan) but a little salty. The noise level is a little loud for such a nice place. For the quality of food they're serving, I would expect a more relaxed ambiance. My friend and I sat across a table for 2 from each other and often had to speak up quite a bit to hear each other. One more note: these three incredibly annoying girls were sat next to us. The type with nasal, whiny voices who spent the time talking loudly about make-up and boys, and flirted quite openly with the Jersey shore boys who (unfortunately) sat on the other side of OUR table. All this is not the restaurant's fault, but this shows you can get quite a mixture in the crowd here. And props to our waiter for being incredibly patient and kind to these girls (I would've wrung their necks within 2 minutes).POSITIVES:- polenta. Seared scallops.

We ordered the short ribs which actually didn't have much meat, but it was amazing and I tried the polenta which was very good too. Everyone at the table ordered the spaghetti which I was told was amazing and homemade. it was pretty good, but quite honestly, I thought the tomato sauce could have been much better.Overall, the service sucked and the food was pretty good, but not enough to offset the lousy overall experience.

4.0,11/9/2009,"Trick to getting a reservation at Scarpetta? Make your reservation a month in advance at least. I know, it sucks, but plan ahead. Trust me, it's worth it. Service was not the most attentive especially given this place's stature and hype. We were ignored a few times and waited a hell of a long time to order and then a long time in between appetizers and entrees. I knew from the very first time I read about Scarpetta what I would order when I came here. The duck and foie gras ravioli. Another person dining with us stated 'this dish is everything I ever wanted in life and in a dish'. Strong statement, strong and powerful dish. For real. Such a simple looking dish and with small ravioli scattered about. Looks can be deceiving. This was flavor personified as food. The spaghetti was another deceiving dish. Spaghetti and tomato sauce? What kind of a person orders that in such a restaurant? Again, strong contender this one was. Had a spicy kick to it too. Wasn't my plate but it might as well have been as I kept picking off my Dad's plate (sorry Dad!) Fried breaded mozzarella was a surprisingly light dish. Also one of those OH-EM-GEE dishes when you just keep repeating that over and over again with every bite you take. My dad's entree of duck with orange was also very good (sorry I ate off your plate on this one too!). And my venison with a bacon polenta was pretty good too but could have used more sauce. At this point though I was so stuffed I had a really really hard time finishing it. Felt so bad. And normally I have two stomachs, one for regular food and the second for dessert but I think in this case my regular stomach borrowed space from my dessert stomach so I couldn't stomach it (pun intended!). But I took one bite of the chocolate parfait and wished I had had more space for it. Also, whatever the milkshake shooter that came with it was, was very good too. I read somewhere that most people after dining here make another reservation on the way out to come back. I get why. Come with a fun group to dine here, people you feel comfortable enough with to pick off their plates.

5.0,9/26/2009,"I learned two things when we went to Scarpetta for my birthday: 1) I don't like goat, and 2) I really like the food at Scarpetta (goat excepting). We started with the bread plate with four kinds of bread (the stromboli with prosciutto and cheese was my favorite) and three kinds of spreads. We skipped cocktails and split a bottle of Barbera instead- it went amazingly well with our food choices. When we told the waiter we were celebrating, he told us that we could do a special tasting menu because it was my birthday. We chose two appetizers, a pasta and an entree to share, and each came pre-split into two tasting plates, one for each of us. Probably the best decision we made all night- we both got to try the perfect amount of perfect food. We started with the truffled mushroom polenta, which was amazingly fragrant and creamy. Next, we had the braised short ribs with farro risotto, which was also wonderful- the meat was so tender it fell apart at the slightest prod of my fork. For our third tasting course we had the tomato and basil spaghetti- I'm amazed at how something so simple can be so perfect. The tomato and basil flavors were fresh and vibrant, and the sauce was held together by cheese and maybe even a touch of cream. The noodles were what made the dish for me- a much thicker and denser spaghetti that was amazing when cooked al dente. Next, we had the goat with pancetta, which I didn't like. I appreciated the effort and the presentation, but I really just plain don't like the gamey taste of goat. We were pleasantly surprised when dessert came. We had ordered the molten chocolate cake, which came with a cute little candle and ""Happy Birthday"" written on the plate. In addition, they also threw in a complimentary peach sabayon dessert and a plate of cookies. I was really impressed with the effort the restaurant made to make my night memorable. Definitely get major points for amazing customer service!To sum up, amazing food and amazing service.

5.0,9/22/2009,"I think I might be in love. You know that feeling I'm sure you have felt before, it's like this crazy combination of butterflies, a tingly feeling and smiles, lots of smiles. Thanks Scarpetta, you give me that loving feeling. Everything about Scarpetta fits in nicely with my criteria for a fabulous restaurant. The signage is subtle and not easily seen from the street. Yes this makes it hard to find, but to me that makes it somewhat more special to me somehow. In the main dining room I immediately notice dark wood beams against the faint blue night coming from the skylight which on this lovely Saturday night was open. Old fashioned bulbs line some other beams for this soft orangey glow. Mirrors on the wall are held by these orange belts which just looks amazing. Fresh cool air sifts into the dining area, giving the area a natural feel of sitting in an outdoor garden under the night sky, but still maintaining the elegance of a dining room. Loft style ambiences like these are what usually makes swoon when I am introduced to a new restaurant and this place fits the bill as the space in it's former life was previously a Greek revival townhouse.Now for the food. Everything on the menu looked delicious. As we arrived relatively early for dinner to assure a table, we weren't craving the appetizers. Our table instead opted to order the duck and foie gras ravioli, imported turbot, sirloin, and the capretto. To drink we had a crisp but not too dry white, Friulano, Edi Keber. It fit the meal perfectly. Once we were settled in with the wine, the bread came, and it was RIDICULOUS and I mean that in the best way possible. Warm, fresh and served with olive oil, ratatouille and mascarpone butter. Not only was it served with quality spreads, the bread... freshly baked in mozzarella and bruschetta! I could eat the bread they served here for days until I become horribly obese and I would be ok with that. Then they mentioned that black or white truffles could be served to supplement any of their dishes and my friend's eyes lit up with glee. When the main courses came every single thing was DELICIOUS. Duck and foie gras mixed so well together in the ravioli. Sometimes foie gras can overpower a dish, but in this it was in perfect harmony. Turbot from what I've been told can be a really dry fish, but here it was moist on the inside with firm outer layer. My sirloin was spot on. People know I can be picky about my meats, but it was a warm medium rare. I generally like the meat warm as it needs time to rest so that it isn't all bloody by the time it gets to your plate. I'll admit the first piece I tasted was a bit overcooked on the edges, but the two subsequent ones I ate made up for my first bite. Lastly the capretto was a pleasant experience as I normally the thought of eating goat is unappealing entirely as it normally isn't fresh or is prepared to taste very gamey, but here it's done right.Finishing up I ordered the olive oil cake with blood orange sorbet as I love blood orange everything. This too was spot on with texture and flavors. Scott Conant and Scarpetta thank you. My first time in NYC was rounded out by this fabulous experience.",2,1,2,Jessica C.,"Cupertino, CA",698,804,333

The food is creative, the service is great, the decor is clean. HOWEVER, be clear, this is why I only give this place a 3 star rating. This place is filled with the meat packing district, and Bayonne, New Jersey's most do*chey, do*che bags EVER. If you're a female and don't have big hair, fake boobs, an oompla loompa orange spray tan, and enough make up to put Mac out of business on your face, If you're a guy and don't have chevron's entire emergency reserve of oil in your hair, lip gloss, only 3 buttons fastened on your 12 button shirt, jeans with intentional holes, long and pointy designer shoes, and a shirt so tight that someone can see your heart beat in it YOU WILL BE STARED AT.

4.0,9/8/2009,"fan-tas-tic -adjective 4. extravagantly fanciful; marvelous. Never in my life would I think to rhapsodize over simple spaghetti with tomato and basil, but I think after eating that dish I used the adjective ""fantastic"" at least 25 times. The spaghetti was perfectly cooked, made fresh that day and coiled voluptuously on my plate. It was coated with this absolutely velvet tomato sauce, simply flavored with cheese and basil, fresh, sweet - to use a foodie term, umami. I attacked this spaghetti with a single-mindedness that only comes over me when I am starved. And starved I was not because I indulged in the wonderful bread basket, dipping my carbs in a fruity olive oil and slathering on the ricotta butter. I also ordered the heirloom tomato caprese and it was so light, refreshing - the perfect whet to my appetite. It was a wonderful meal, with wonderful people and the atmosphere, our pleasant and accommodating waiter and general service only served to make the celebrations even more celebratory. I am definitely a fan. And yes, I will pay $24 for that spaghetti!",6,4,5,Ki G.,"SUNNYSIDE, NY",250,710,92

4.0,8/29/2009,"3 kinds of bread to start? One that is wrapped with soppressata and smoked mozzarella? Served with rosemary olive oil, an eggplant kalamata mixture, and a mascarpone butter? Wow, this place is not messin' around.The meatpacking district is full of trendy places that, let's face it, don't live up to the hype. But unlike many of the restaurants found in the area, this place is unassuming on the outside, but kind of a big deal on the inside. I walked in and instantly felt the vibe - lively, chic, and comfortable but classy. I sat at the bar (all by my lonesome) for dinner and thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere and experience. Anyone that has read my reviews (i.e. Paragon) knows that not only am I a huge calamari fan, but that I don't need all the frills and fuss that a lot of restaurants are putting in their calamari dishes. In other words, keep your zucchini, squash, onions, garlic, and whatever else you deem necessary, and just give me the squid with some aioli and lemon. However, Scarpetta has made me question my beliefs by giving me one of the best calamari dishes I've ever eaten. Chalk full of all of the aforementioned ingredients, seasoned to perfection, and not skimping on the expertly-fried calamari, their calamari fritto misto is a dish to be reckoned with, and one that I wish existed in San Francisco. I followed this amazing appetizer up with the AGNOLOTTI DAL PLIN filled with mixed meat (chicken, veal, pork) & fonduta (a fontina fondue), mushrooms & parmigiano. I think, probably for the sake of saving money, they fill it mainly with chicken, which was slightly disappointing. And, although cooked perfectly and quite tasty, it needed seasoning (I added salt/pepper + some of that rosemary olive oil and it made a world of difference!). Basically, it was very tasty, and I think that if I had ordered a different entree I would've been thoroughly impressed.Delicious wines, friendly service, solid food - just an overall great NYC dining experience. I would definitely come here with friends, a date, or my parents - it fits the bill for almost any occasion.

I dined at the bar and received incredible service from the sweetie behind the bar, Beau.  The whole staff was attentive, kind and knowledgeable about the food and wine.  Upon suggestion I had the yellow tail sashimi appetizer which melted in my mouth. The chilis lent a delicate spice which was brilliantly offset by the sea salt.For my meal I had the pasta with corn and asparagus and couldn't believe how such a simple, light dish could have such complex and full flavor.  I ate every last bite and appreciated every bit of it.  Paired with an Italian Sav Blanc, it was the perfect meal and there's a good chance I'll be back very soon to order the exact same thing.The only difference is the next time I'll go on a Monday.  Although it appears hidden and quaint from outside, it's the meatpacking district and the inside will remind you of it.  A bit too much of a scene but if that's what you like, go Thursday night... ;)",0,0,0,suzi p.,"San Francisco, CA",9,40,0

We were off to a rough start when they told me it would be an hour & a half wait, but it really wasn't. Once we were seated, everything was superb.First shout out goes to the eggplant caponata served with the bread. Can I take a jar of this home please? So delicious. The olive oil was also light, lemony and amazing.Second shout out is to the water pitchers. They're beautiful and I want one of those to take home too.For appetizers we had the creamy polenta with mushroom sauce which was rich and intensely creamy. I loved the mushroom sauce, and I don't usually like mushrooms. We also shared the fried mozzarella with stewed baby tomatoes - the cheese was good but the stewed tomato sauce was what really made this dish.I got the duck foi gras ravioli - they were amazing! Little pillows of deliciousness in a thin cream sauce. Again, very rich, so I was glad that the family wanted to share around because I might not have been able to finish the whole plate (OK yes I would have, but I might have regretted it later). BF had the pasta with asparagus and corn which was the polar opposite to my pasta - light, crunchy and summery. We were a little nervous about the corn but it was a winner. Mom had the Sicilian duck, which was cooked in a way that made it more like a red meat than a poultry. It was really unique, and very enjoyable. Dad had the black cod with fennel which was also an interesting combination done perfectly.For dessert we got the amedei chocolate cake which was wonderful but once again, incredibly rich. We also shared a peach shortbread with ice cream dessert which was sweet and delicious. Loved them both.All in all, wonderful experience.

5.0,7/28/2009,"My experience at Scarpetta last night was an example of the best that NY dinning can do. The last time I was in this space it was a dive bar called the Village Idiot. Now it is a bright, wonderful environment that I found welcoming, cozy and sophisticated. First, let me give the disclaimer that my experience was heightened by the fact that one of the people I was dinning with new the owner - Scott Conant. He not only came over to the table but he also made sure we were taken care of beyond any service I have ever experienced. I would like to send a special YELP kudos to our waiter Guy D who cleaned up the puddle of sweat my glass of ice water kept making - even before I noticed it. No one has ever patted away my glass sweat before. And when I inquired about the rhubarb dessert wondering if rhubarb was in season he actually went and looked it up. I have NEVER had service like that! That isn't even service it is a form of hero worship and I was the hero in the situation - hello, how great!!! So now lets get to the food - we had the special beat salad that had a cheese in it that I would only describe as creamy smooth passion. The creamy polenta fricassee of truffed mushrooms well - we were told of a customer that comes in and only orders a double order of the polenta and a double order of spaghetti and I totally understand that thinking. Whatever is in it, it is buttery sinful goodness. Other highlights among an evening of highlights was the braised short ribs of beef vegetable & farro risotto, the raw yellow tail olio di zenzero & baked sea salt and the olive oil cake with marscapone cream. But wait there was something even more amazing. There will always be a place in my heart for the special drinks that came to the table. My friend was admiring another table's beverage and before I could get a glimpse of what she was looking at three arrived. Picture this - three shot glasses with raw oysters swimming in (I think) mojito - it was beyond a drink it entered the realm of decadence - remember this was all on a Monday night!

Amazing with ten exclamation points. This dish alone is worth 4 Stars.For my second course I chose the pork tenderloin at the recommendation of our waiter. The pork was tender, appropriately brined and juicy. Instead of bottles of wine my friends and I opted for stiff cocktails. My well-made Manhattan was garnished with real cherries, as opposed to those neon globes that accompany most others. Scarpetta's decor is warm, intimate, modern and comfortable. Earthy wood tones and large antique bulbs bathe diners in warm incandescence. Low music and the open floor plan make for a surprisingly pleasant dining atmosphere.After our main course was laid at out table the service dropped off. Our waiter was harder to find and when he did arrive to take our dessert order for one of everything, he returned late with only the olive oil cake. The cake was good but not great, and it would have been nice to have the full dessert menu from which to taste.However, many fashionable diners go to Scarpetta to be seen, rather than seen eating.

4.0,7/25/2009,"My SO and I celebrated my birthday this past week at Scarpetta and it was a fantastic meal. I've heard Scarpetta referred to as Babbo lite before and I think that our meal here this year every bit rivaled our meal last year at Babbo and was bit better bang for the buck.  We were seated in the main dining area, a beautiful room with lots of natural light from the huge skylight roof and hues of brown and orange throughout.Special praise should be given to Scarpetta's bread basket, what a great selection of foccacia, stromboli and ciabatta with creative spreads! The eggplant caponata was my favorite-so different! File this under favorite bread baskets around town.We started off with braised short ribs and polenta with truffled mushrooms-two standout appetizers! The polenta was rich, soothing and creamy and the truffle oil was just the right amount. I could definitely eat this again! It was also a nice touch that the polenta was split for us. Braised short ribs was ultra tender and the accompanying farro risotto was perfectly cooked.Pastas were next up and these did not disappoint either. My tomato basil spaghetti was simple, distilled tomato goodness and the pasta was the right texture and perfectly al dente for this dish. The hubby had the duck foie gras ravioli which I really enjoyed as well. Delicate pillows of pasta wrapped around the distinct flavor of foie gras very decadent! For an entree we split the capretto, an unusual choice given that neither of us had goat before! It was delicious, slightly gamey and savoury. On to dessert where we had the extremely rich amadei chocolate cake-a must I think for chocolate lovers and the olive oil cake a light cake paired with refreshing blood orange sorbet and marscapone cream. Yummy.Service was outstanding throughout, they were really on their game: our table was crumbed twice, water glasses constantly refilled, and we were always made to feel at ease. Our server also suggest a fantastic bottle of red wine, he really knew his stuff. Overall this was an experience just as good as Babbo's last year perhaps even better as we had less pretentiousness to cut through and the final bill was cheaper!",6,2,5,Deanna W.,"New York, NY",343,320,232

That is a fair description.  Although I believe this was fresh mozzarella, well seasoned breading (maybe made from the older table bread), stewed grape tomatoes and a drizzle of basil oil.  It wasn't reinventing the wheel but really was so damn good. Entree I had the black cod with roasted fennel and roasted tomatoes.   This was a really well balanced dish, all the flavors incorporated beautifully.  With no one singular element taking over the stage.  The cod was cooked perfectly with a beautifully crispy skin. BF had the spaghetti dish that is has so raved about by many others. He found the saltiness a little aggressive, and the flavors very rich. But overall he thought it was excellent.  They had a decent selection of wine but the beer section could use a little expansion.  The service was outstanding and I have to commend my server.  On the way to be seated at our table a fruit fly had flown into my wine glass.  While she was talking about the menu I kept waiting for an opportunity to mention the little bug and without saying a word she took the glass away and brought me a fresh glass.(Now that is personal attention to details).Overall I thought it was excellent, but not outstanding.",0,0,0,Permafrown H.,"New York, NY",0,15,0

I could live on bread alone (it's the little things that make me happy in restaurants sometimes). The agnolotti was good but not great - after hearing so much about it, I was expecting it to be mind blowing.

Knowing it was Saturday night so I called Scarpetta up and they said oh just come, there is no one waiting....so we all cabbed there (took us about 10 mins) Now, the hostess at the door says, the wait is one hour wait.

I called two days ahead and they said only time is at 5:30PM. So we got there at 5:30PM and guess what, they weren't ready and we had to all stand around the bar until 6:15PM ish until they were ready. So over all the service was excellent. Thats why I even gave it a star. Also this dish deserves a star: Mushroom polenta. Yummy! What was so overated was this, ""Spaghetti with tomato and basil."" Not as great as people says.

3.0,6/27/2009,"Overall it was a good experience, but my expectations were very high from all that I've heard/read.  Hence, I left feeling a little underwhelmed.The space is rather large but tables are a bit small if you are going as a group.  Service is great when the food is ready but getting the food ready seemed to take a really long time...we sat down around 8pm and only left the restaurant at 11.40pm...and not because we were staying around to chat.  The decor is a little strange, I didn't like the mirrors against the walls that were held up with orange-colored restraining straps - they reminded me of an asylum and didn't fit in with the otherwise sexy/cozy atmosphere.  The skylight with its broad wooden beams and naked light bulbs was really pretty.This restaurant is known for their pasta dishes, the tomato basil spaghetti and the duck and foie gras ravioli in particular.  They are also known for their polenta and truffled mushroom fricassee appetizer.For appetizers, we tried the fritto misto and polenta.  The fritto misto was light and non-greasy with a lot of sweet, tender seafood and fresh rosemary thrown into the fried mixture - a good pick if you are in the mood for something fried and crunchy.  The polenta was very tasty, the polenta was very creamy and fine-grained.  The fricassee wasn't the thick stew I was anticipating but came as a little too watery from what I was expecting.For pastas, the spaghetti was good - it was very tomatoey and I did like the fact that it was so simple.  The fresh basil gave it a very nice, fresh touch.  Overall...I wasn't overly impressed though...it was good but didn't have an oomph... maybe it wasn't meant to have one?  The ravioli was tasty and packed in plenty of foie gras flavor...but perhaps my personal preference for foie gras is both flavor AND that melty, butter texture afterall, so I wasn't overly impressed by this dish either.  The fettucini with asparagus and peas was my favorite even though it isn't as famous as the first two pasta dishes I just mentioned.  It came with a little pot of cream sauce that was poured over the pasta dish at service.  The dish was really tasty, the vegetables were cooked perfectly and reminded me of spring (albeit it is now early summer).For entrees, the steak looked very good and the goat was flavorful and tender.  The duck was tasty but due to its overall ordinariness, I am unlikely to order it again if I am ever back here for another visit.For desserts, there is a good selection but again, nothing blew me away.  The chocolate parfait looked better than it tasted and the olive oil cake sounded better than it tasted.Price-wise, it came out to be rather reasonable.  I would recommend trying all categories of the menu ie appetizers, pasta and entree but sharing some of them with a friend.  Almost everyone in my party each had an  appetizer, pasta and an entree plus dessert (there were a few dishes that were shared here and there) plus a bottle of barbera and the bill (plus tax and tips) came out to be just over $100 each.In conclusion I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come back again.  It was by no means a bad experience.  It just took too long and wasn't particularly special to me.",0,0,0,Princess M.,"New York, NY",33,337,591
5.0,6/21/2009,"My friend (JS) and I arrived at 8 pm for our reservation at that time and we were promptly seated. Almost all of the tables were filled. The dining room had a nice decor and a pleasant buzz. The glass ceiling was a nice touch and the light was perfect at that time of the day. The room was moderately loud, but we had no problems communicating with each other or the staff. We already had drinks at Spice Market (complex, tasty, but small) nearby so we turned down cocktails. The menu (available online) seemed to be the perfect length and had many interesting dishes in all categories. It was quite difficult to make decisions, but we received some nice help from the staff. Our main server and the sommelier were particularly helpful in picking a moderately priced rosé for us to match our diverse food selections. There were some very nice varieties of bread to start, although neither of us ever eats a lot of bread, especially when we have four courses to eat. The citrus dipping oil was great, but the red pepper spread and mascarpone butter were just OK. I started with the tuna susci (pronounced ""sushi"") with marinated vegetables and preserved truffles. It was basically raw tuna wrapped around various vegetables with mushrooms on the side and fresh herbs on top. The taste and texture were outstanding. There was a very nice combination of flavors and the portion was larger than I expected. I grade the dish an A-. JS had the creamy polenta with a fricassee of truffled mushrooms. This dish was one of the highlights. Visually it was very appealing--the polenta was in one white porcelain bowl and the mushrooms in a separate small metal pot. The polenta was luscious and tasted so elegant when combined with the mushrooms. My friend likened it to eating a mushroom dessert. That dish was an A+. JS followed the polenta with the agnolotti dal plin filled with mixed meat. This dish looked very simple, but the taste was excellent and the pasta perfectly cooked (A-). I had the ravioli with duck and foie gras and a marsala reduction. It was hard to decide between this dish and the polenta for the best of the evening. The ravioli were perfectly cooked and the duck flavor was intense. The foie was not overwhelming and really added a slight richness to the duck and seemed to extend its flavor. The marsala reduction leant a nice counterpoint to the richness of the duck/foie (A+). Once again, the portion sizes for both pasta dishes were generous. The rosé complimented the pasta dishes extremely well and also did a good job with the starters. It was less good for the final courses, but we weren't complaining. We both ordered fish with JS having the black cod with caramelized fennel and concentrated tomato. I had the turbot with caramelized endive, leeks, onions & salsa verde. Neither fish dish rose to the level of the previous dishes (B+ for both). The fish were perfectly cooked and most of the flavors were nice, if not a little muted. The concentrated tomato was very bold. One of the reasons we went with fish was that we thought we would be stuffed from the first courses. I had strongly considered the goat and my friend was interested in the porkchop--perhaps next time. Both desserts were excellent. JS had the amedei chocolate cake with burnt orange-caramel gelato, and espresso sauce. The cake had a nice texture and an intense chocolate flavor, complemented well by the gelato and sauce. I had the special rhubarb dessert with these elaborate cookie rings, filo layers, pineapple gelato, pineapple gelee, and vanilla risotto. The contrasts in textures and flavors were delightful. It was one of those dishes where it's fun to get a little bit of every ingredient to get the full effect. Both desserts were an A. The service throughout the evening was uniformly excellent. The head server stopped by several times to check on us and the sommelier made sure that we were enjoying the wine. We only had one bottle, and the staff did a very good job of spacing it out over the three savory courses. We thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere. It seemed like most of the people were enjoying themselves around us. We definitely recommend the restaurant and will try to get back someday.",0,0,0,Joe W.,"Danville, KY",0,2,0

With a good bottle of wine, one could easily make a meal out of them. The mozzarella in carozza and the fritto misto were both sublime. The pasta dishes were like taking a quick excursion to Rome, with the spaghetti still leading the pack.The ravioli filled with fois gras could stand up against any ravioli in this city.Some fresh  herbs might have nicely complimented the rich filling and butter sauce, like maybe some sage leaves. The veal dish was cooked to perfection and so was the turbot, (though a bit salty).  Thought that the veggies accompanying the main dishes were sparse, but very crisp and fresh. Not much room for desert, though we picked at the banana budino.It seemed like more of a winter dessert, the cake being a bit heavy for warm weather, and the oat cookie pretty bland. Met the chef on the way out. He asked if everything was OK...very humbleguy, considering the quality of his cooking. OK? He asked if it was OK? I just laughed.  'It was really amazing""  He looked satisfied by my answer. Guess even the great ones need occasional strokes.",1,1,1,Lucienne D.,"Hoboken, NJ",17,171,0
4.0,5/31/2009,"I'm not one for expensive dining, but I ended up here for a company dinner, so since I wasn't paying, I was happy to enjoy.The wait was less that five minutes for our reserved seats in this VERY busy place. We had drinks at the bar first and they were very generous with the Jameson in my Jameson and club soda, which is always a plus.We were seated by an amazing waiter in the center of the dining area. The wait staff is very well trained and attentive. The ambiance is busy and chatty, but not too loud that you cannot be heard. The 6 pm weekday crowd is clearly the Business Dinner crowd.As others have said, the bread basket alone is amazing, with several kinds of stuffed breads. I could have dined on the basket alone and been happy.I skipped an appetizer and had the ribeye beef and it was amazing. Cooked just right with some interesting veggies that I was unfamiliar with but ate and enjoyed anyway. A generous amount of meat but not too much that I was over stuffed. They have the PERFECT portions.The only thing that was disappointing was the lack of Italian dishes that I was familiar with. I am not a very sophisticated diner, and I didn't really want to try duck ravioli or cavatelli with rabbit.  That's why it got only 4 stars.I wanted some fancy cheese tortellini or something that I was familiar with. I  REALLY wanted to try the spaghetti with tomato and basil sauce, but spaghetti is something that I tend to make a mess of myself when eating and since it was a business dinner, I got something less messy.Now, let me tell you about the dessert. I LOVE dessert. I do. If one could marry dessert I would.Again, I'm used to much more blue collar type places, so I skipped the fancy desserts and had the seemingly simple chocolate and vanilla parfait with hazelnut milkshake and biscotti.OH. MY. GOD. I don't know what sorcery  goes on in the kitchen but the parfait was ORGASMIC.  SO delicious and creamy that I wanted to stick my fingers in the glass to get what was left on the sides but I don't think my boss would have appreciated that.  I want to marry this dessert.The portion was very generous and came with a little shot glass filled with hazelnut milkshake that was so good I wanted to ask for a pint of it. The shot glass was a tease!I can't review the biscotti because my boss stole it off my plate.All in all I would highly recommend this place for business dinners with high level executives who have expense accounts.I liked it but would not go there myself on my own coin because the entree itself was $36. Add drinks, appetizers and desserts and it's way out of my price range.",0,0,0,Trixie V.,"Queens, NY",10,95,20
4.0,5/30/2009,"I have to admit, when I walked up to Scarpetta (which sits on the 14th Street border of the Meatpacking District) late on a Saturday evening, part of me expected to see an H2 limo pull up and let out a gaggle of women having ""like the best night ever on Stacey's 34th birthday!"" Luckily, that was not the case. For now, the tasteful and dim lit room is calm and relatively untouched by Meatpacking District sprawl. I say ""for now"" because rave reviews, proximity to the Gansevoort, and the chill out lounge beats pumping through the speakers will soon draw in Stacey and her wobbly heeled friends. Regardless, Scarpetta fully lives up to all the recent hype. The food is absolutely incredible, and I was blown away by how simple and well executed everything was. Truffles and foie gras make appearances, yet don't come off the slightest bit heavy handed. I was never a fan of sweetbreads, but Scarpetta might have changed my opinion after having them in the excellent farfalle dish. The spaghetti is just that, spaghetti in tomato sauce with basil - incredibly simple and somehow the star of the menu.

4.0,5/28/2009,"I've been meaning to dine at Scarpetta for quite some time.  I've heard great things from every person I know who's eaten there, so obviously i went in with high expectations.  For the most part, I was not disappointed.  I'd really give 4.5 stars if I could but there were a few small issues with my dining experience.  I started off with the braised short ribs.  Unbelievable!  So tender, they literally fell apart if you looked at them funny.  I was worried that these would be the high point of my meal.  My worries disappeared as soon as the spaghetti came out.  I don't know what they make this stuff out of... maybe it's rainbows and unicorns, but it is undeniably the best spaghetti I've ever had in my life.  However, my main course was slightly disappointing... especially considering how amazing everything else was.  I took the waiter's recommendation of the black cod.  It was very tasty, especially the carmalized fennel and concentrated tomatos, but it was just a little too salty for my taste.  While not unpleasant, it just didn't live up to my expectations.  All in all a great dining experience.  Attentive wait staff (until we were done eating and then had to wait 45 minutes for the check because our waiter disappeared), great food, and nice ambiance.",3,2,2,Jason H.,"New York, NY",77,112,5
5.0,5/24/2009,"Blog for full review with pics in context.Arriving after a great day of eating and browsing the galleries and stores of lower Manhattan I checked my bag at the hostess stand and was immediately led to a small table near the window up front - great for people watching out in the meat-packing district and with a full view of the main dining room and bar.  While I will admit the music was a bit loud for my liking, it certainly was no more-so than Babbo and the temperature up front was cool enough to wear a jacket, yet not so cold that I felt chilly or that it affected the food - though my neighbors did complain of both.Shortly after seating I was greeted by my server, an attractive and friendly yet professional young lady named Anastasia ( the service at Scarpetta was on par with what I received at Jean Georges and with more personality.)  Handed a menu to browse I was also presented with a bread basket featuring a hearty and crusty ciabatta, oiled and aromatic rosemary forcaccia, and an absolutely mind-blowing Salami and Mozzarella Bread with a trio of toppings including Citrus infused Olive Oil (good, but standard), Roasted Eggplant Caponata (superb, I finished 3 servings,) and  Mascarpone Butter (tasted like a sheep's butter, but more airy and succulent.)  While I must say I have a strong love for Bread Baskets in general, this example was particularly impressive and in-and-of-itself a reason to love Scarpetta.  With wishful thinking on my mind I asked Anastasia (who I must note I think I may have fell in love with during the meal - any friendly and attractive woman who bears salami mozzarella bread is a winner in my eyes) whether half orders of the pasta were available - alas, no luck.  Judging my hunger and knowing dessert was a must I decided at that point 2 pastas would be my max. After approximately 20 minutes my first dish arrived - and oh what a dish it was.  Entitled DUCK AND FOIE GRAS RAVIOLI with Marsala reduction I'd experienced similar once before - the famous version at Babbo...as a matter of fact, aside from the Gnocchi at Bouchon it was probably my favorite pasta of all time - until I took my first bite of this.  Words cannot describe the texture - like silk, butter, cream - you get the picture.  Pasta so thin it seemed impossible, a marsala sauce clearly enhanced with balsamic vinegar, butter, chives - sweet and savory all at once - bringing the meaty perfection of the duck/foie filling to a peak that permeated the nose and palate as much as the tongue - completed true Scarpetta style I wiped the plate clean with a piece of the ciabatta.Already impressed yet perhaps wishing I'd received the Foie second in order to ""save the best for last"" I once again waited approximately 15-20 minutes (while trying desperately to keep my hands out of that damned bread basket) before my second dish arrived on a covered dish and dramatically ""unmasked"" by a male from the kitchen-staff at tableside.  Entitled BLACK MACCHERONI with mixed seafood, sea urchin & bread crumbs the very first thing to strike me was the beauty - the thick, long, and perfectly al dente noodles intermingled with long strands of long-cut calamari and glistening with hints of a light broth highlighted with yellow chunks of uni, fresh pieces of crab and lobster, and breadcrumbs accented with a spice I couldn't identify (perhaps a refined oregano.)  The second aspect of the dish, the smell, matched the visual effect - it smelled like the sea, capturing its very essence with a hint of spiciness and butter providing a base.  Finally, the taste - incredible - not since Kinch's ""tidal pool"" at Manresa have I experienced so many different tastes and textures with the spongy pasta, meaty yet flawless seafood, smooth and light broth, crunchy bread crumbs, and fatty/melt-in-the-mouth uni.  Once again a piece of bread found its way into my hand as I sopped up every last drop - and considered licking the plate.Thankfully with the bread basket was taken away from me at this point and the coffee was brought quickly (again without Equal) - a bold yet somewhat boring blend that, for me, seemed more like a breakfast coffee than a ""feature"" coffee, but it certainly wasn't bad.  Another 10 minutes later my dessert arrived.  Apparently Scarpetta's signature dessert - AMEDEI CHOCOLATE CAKE with burnt orange-caramel gelato and espresso sauce.  Having had a great chocolate lava cake the night before at Crop and two weeks earlier at the Ritz Dining Room (and subsequently having the fabled version at Jean-Georges) all I can say is that if you're going to have a signature dessert, make it this well!  Utilizing the deep Tuscan chocolate to the maximum of its breadth by accenting both the sweet (with the sublime caramel-blood orange gelato - possibly as good as the balsamic caramel at Humphry Slocombe) and the bitter (with the rich yet understated espresso sauce) the cake was absolutely amazing - the best I've ever had.",3,1,2,Michael U.,"Las Vegas, NV",3079,4441,99554
5.0,5/24/2009,"As everyone has said, the food here is terrific.  Our waiter recommended the top three pasta dishes and they did not disappoint.  Most remarkably, the spaghetti with tomato and basil was excellent - amazing that such a simple dish can make such a significant impression.  Even better was the duck and foie gras ravioli with marsala sauce - the savory filling was balanced beautifully with the sweetness of the sauce.  The agnolotti was also quite good, though definitely the third place finisher.What tipped the scale from 4 to 5 stars for me was the service - it was absolutely perfect.  Our waiter struck the right balance between being professional yet relaxed.  When asked for recommendations, he clearly knew what he was talking about - he provided very specific reasons why he suggested the dishes he did, without sounding rehearsed or spouting BS foodie-speak to sound impressive.  He also ""read"" our table perfectly, knowing when was and wasn't a good time to interrupt, and anticipating our needs throughout the evening.Satisfying yet sophisticated food, excellent service, and a beautiful setting - Scarpetta deserves the praise it has received.  And, important to note, absolutely NOT a Meatpacking-crowd.  Sophisticated, dressy, professional crowd - dress accordingly.",0,0,0,Victor C.,"New York, NY",87,121,18

All three pasta dishes we tried were spectacular, so was the octopus with chorizo and the three desserts they were offering.  Now, the bruschetta was only toasted bread, not real bruschetta, but the spreads were spectacular, including the misleadingly simple avocado spread.

The wine list is extensive, but the first page lists ""featured"" wines, which I found helpful (although, at the same time I had to wonder if these were bottles they were trying to get rid of). We narrowed it down to two selections the waiter recommended, and then he brought us samples of each to make our final choice. The bartender recommended the raw yellowtail app and the black maccheroni, both of which our table ordered. Both were excellent. The yellowtail tasted light, fresh, and clean. The black maccheroni was the highlight of the evening. Delicate seafood flavors, just enough vegetable to brighten the dish, and exquisite pasta. We also got the famed spaghetti, which had very nicely balanced flavors, but the dish is perhaps overhyped. The sea bass entree was a little bland, with only 4 gnocchi, which seemed stingy. Overall, a really pleasant experience. I'd go back.",0,0,0,Catherine O.,"Seattle, WA",0,7,1

Thanks to my avid reading of food blogs, I was able to come across this crazy deal for their one year anniversary. I was lucky enough to snag a 10:45pm resy for two yesterday. Note that the anny special was only for this week. What impresses me most is consistency across ALL dishes. It's what makes me swoon over Scott Conant's food. You definitely taste the love as no corners are cut. Every ingredient shines through on your palate and is a farm fresh explosion in your mouth. The Asian that I am, I calculated the normal menu prices for this meal and it came out to ~$80, and that's discounting the wine. If the wine pairing was added that would've been another $45+ easily. In other words, this meal was essentially 60% OFF! The sirloin itself was already $36. Let's not forget about the fact that the food is hot and every dish comes out on a piping hot white plate, to the point where you can't even touch it. How awesome is that? Great service to boot doesn't hurt either. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the wine pairing. Maybe because they skimped there and each bottle retails for ~$15.

4.0,5/7/2009,"I so planned on revisiting Scarpetta to dine on their one year anniversary 4-course prix fixe with wine pairing for $50. I went to the Picasso exhibit yesterday at the Gagosian (amazing!) and then strolled a few blocks east to the bustling restaurant, busy even at 5:30. Scarpetta is quickly becoming serious competition to the Babbos and Del Postos of NYC. Once one of New York's most hyped young chefs, Scott Conant all but vanished two years ago whiles his reputation and restaurants, L'Impero and Alto, were still riding high. Fans moved on with their dinners and lives, embracing his revolving-door replacement, former Fiamma chef Michael White. Out of sight and out of mind, the rising star seemed quickly forgotten. Since his opening in 2008, Chef Conant has branched out with another Scarpetta at the luxe Fontainebleau Resort in Miami and has made appearances on Iron Chef and Bravo's TOP CHEF. Scarpetta, in the Meatpacking District, is a comeback and throwback, a less-is-more trattoria. It may be the least obnoxious restaurant to open in the neighborhood in years. Though a great deal of money has clearly been pumped into the place, but it's clearly not gaudy. The S. Russell Groves design is a cavernous, sleek space featuring a mood-lit front lounge with a floor and bar in matching white marble. It contrasts with the airy back dining room, done up tastefully in rustic wood. Stripped down to its beams, the ceiling is outfitted with a retractable roof, offering on warm nights what may be Manhattan's only real indoor-outdoor dining experience. While the noise level can be deafening when inclement weather seals off the room, the buzz spilling in from the bar doesn't persist--during our visits, the happy hour crowds thinned out early. Another indication that the food, not the scene, is the focus was the service--veteran-restaurant smooth rather than velvet-rope prickly, with wineglasses filled promptly and food that comes out in choreographed unison. The restaurant takes its name from the Italian slang for sopping up sauce with your bread, and the generous bread basket is clearly designed with la scarpetta in mind. Among the four types there's a delicious smoked mozzarella and salami stromboli, ideal for topping with the accompanying chunky eggplant caponata, citrus-infused olive oil and butter-mascarpone spread. Starters offer a sort of greatest hits of Conant's earlier work. A truffle-scented riff on sushi featuring raw tuna slices rolled around brunoise carrots is an elegant holdover from his crudo-stocked menu at Alto. You'll also find the butter-saturated polenta he served at L'Impero, indulgent as ever with aromatic truffled mushrooms. Conant, like Batali, rose to prominence on the shoulders of his ethereal pastas. At Scarpetta they still merit top billing. As stuffed pastas go, his plump, meaty duck and foie gras ravioli, slicked with a rich marsala-duck jus, are as gorgeous as you're likely to find in New York. A close second: miniature ricotta-filled specimens topped with paper-thin slices of baby zucchini, petals from their wispy blossoms and a drizzle of briny anchovy-laced butter. Entrées--mostly on the lusty, peasant end of the Italian food spectrum are where Conant shines. Braised short ribs flaunt the desired slow-cooked, falling-off-the-bone succulence. It's served with a minimalist saffron-laced orzo that, unlike a more traditional risotto, isn't rich enough to stand up to the meat. Capretto (goat), one of Conant's more celebrated entrées at L'Impero, was among the most impressive dishes I tried at Scarpetta. Instead of roasting it until golden as he'd done in the past, the chef braises the goat then offers it cubed with fingerling potatoes, rapini and pancetta, lubricated with gelatinous drippings and then stacked in a measured heap, like a haute sloppy joe. The rustic meat dishes I tried were missing one thing: seasoning. As a chef, Conant may be more at home cooking in the upscale style he made his name on, rather than the Bold Italian (the title of his new cookbook) that he's going for here. His delicate turbot, for instance, is a throwback to his best high-end cooking. The flaky fillets get an appropriately light touch, gently browned and served with a mild pickled-onion and parsley salsa verde and melt-in-your-mouth endives and leeks. While Conant strives to find a middle ground between upscale and homey, pastry chef Gary Minos, formerly of L'Impero, nails it. His apple ""pie"" features caramelized apples, brown-sugar streusel and a layer of apricot puree on an earthy polenta crust. The coconut pannacotta in guava soup is ethereal. An almost flourless warm chocolate cake, made with chocolate-of-the-moment Amedei from Tuscany, and served with chocolate-espresso sauce and burnt orange gelato, is so remarkably rich, only true choco-fiends will be able to finish it. Personally, I'd gladly skip it for an extra plate of that remarkable foie gras ravioli, a dish that inspires even the savviest foodies.",3,0,2,The Jedi Foodi E.,"New York, NY",333,107,515

4.0,3/24/2009,"Interesting decor, good service, foie gras ravioli not as crazy as described by TONYI really didn't know who Scott Conant was so when Jeff C. mentioned him, I really didn't know who the heck he was talking about. But then I saw him as a guest judge on Chopped 2 weeks ago and at least now I know who he is.As for his restaurant, it is fancy, yet, eclectic. When I first entered, I felt like I was back in Midtown. It was after work early dinner w/ Jeff C.'s group and there's a lot of shirts and dress pants hanging around. The place has a simple black and white schema but then you noticed some really cool and strange details, like all the lights are the old school tungsten lightbulbs (you actually see the filaments glowing), encased in glass box hanging right above the ceiling windows. There's also these giant mirrors right above the booths on both walls that are literally suspended by leather belts/safety harness. Here's what we ordered:Scallop Tartare - (I tried this) It was delicious, soft and tender and flavorful, a perfect way to start a mealBraise short ribs - really tender, but the meat wasn't that flavorful. My gf didn't like the farro, so I ended up having most of this dishHampshire Pork chop (I tried this) - Pork done right!Foie Gras Ravioli - Time Out NY, this is the 2nd time you have let me down (the first is Corton). Don't get me wrong. I like this dish. There's about 20 tiny foie gras filled ravioli with a marsala reduction decorating the ravioli in a weave pattern. The foie gras is creamy and delicious, but there's a slight bitter after taste, which is fine, but I didn't feel like there's something to balance that. Maybe some truffle sauce instead? I don't know.Black Maccheroni (I tried this) - My gf ordered this, and I have to say, I love this dish way more than the foie gras ravioli. The high expectation and the below par result from that dish makes this one taste all the more better. I love the sea urchin in there, it goes so well with the pasta.A little pricey, when comparing the portion size, but I thoroughly enjoy the meal.",1,0,1,Jack N.,"Brooklyn, NY",155,352,129

5.0,1/28/2009,"I came here with a friend for NYC restaurant week. First off, the service was good. When we were entering the restaurant, a guy carrying a box came out of the main door to go into the staff only area. He saw us and still tried to open the door for us, then wished us a good evening at the restaurant. After looking at the photos in books at the restaurant,  we agreed that it was probably Scott Conant himself! That was a great start to the night. I made reservations on OpenTable at 9:30 so we were seated immediately. But it was a busy night but our waiters still came by frequently and made sure we were taken care of. Each dish was carefully explained to us. We both had the braised ribs of beef. The meat was practically falling apart before I touched it. I hate cucumber and I didn't even mind that there was some bits in the risotto. The flavor and texture combination of the cheese, meat, and risotto made it a wonderful dish. It seemed small at first, but I think it was just enough leave a lingering impression on my taste buds and make me excited for the dishes to come. Next we both ordered the spaghetti. My friend believe the ingredients were so simple. The tomatoes reduced to a soft cream and the pasta was bordering on al dente. It tasted like no other spaghetti dish I'd ever had before. I usually don't order spaghetti on a menu anywhere, because I think there's nothing too special to the dish. But Scarpetta has changed my outlook on it! At first the portion doesn't seem so big, but I felt like my fork never reached the bottom. For dessert we finally deviated. She ordered the olive oil cake with oranges and some sort of citrus sorbet. It was light and fruity and she really enjoyed it. I ordered the chocolate cake with orange gelato. I actually wasn't blown away by the gelato or anything, because I'd just gotten back from Italy. But the chocolate cake was so decadent and melt-in-your-mouth. I was so full by this point but could not resist this cake. As a long-time chocolate lover, this was one of the best chocolate cakes I've had. I didn't even realize we had stayed past their closing time, but nobody rushed us. My friend even ordered coffee and she got refills without a problem. Scarpetta definitely left us with a good impression.",3,1,3,Melissa Z.,"New York, NY",203,117,81

Amadei Chocolate Cake - The burnt orange-caramel gelato that goes with this cake is excellent but the cake itself is your typical Jean-Georges molten chocolate cake.  I wouldn't order this again just because when you're paying this type of $, you want to eat something new, not just the chocolate cake that's been replicated at every other restaurant.",2,0,0,Estelle T.,"New York, NY",38,119,3
4.0,12/27/2008,"I was in a quandary over which restaurant to take the manfriend to for his belated bday. After our near perfect meal at Babbo, it seemed dangerous to follow up with another hyped Italian place, but we narrowed it down to Convivio and Scarpetta. In the end, laziness trumped all and we went with Scarpetta b/c we could walk there. After a preprandial glass of bubbly at Ara, we headed over to Scarpetta. Although I had read the reviews when Scarpetta opened, I had tried to stay away from recent chatter about it so there would still be an element of surprise about the meal. The manfriend approved of the entry and bar area in its many shades of brown. Some kind of v.i.p. arrived before us so we waited at the bar momentarily for our table. I'm happy to say we had a corner banquette table, my favorite for side by side eating. We started with the creamy polenta with a fricassee of truffled mushrooms.  I was apprehensive that it would come with a heavy dose of truffle oil, but this dish was delicious. A variety of earthy mushrooms were not overwhelmed by the essence of truffle and I loved the presentation. I do think that Scarpetta has one up on Babbo with plating. The mushrooms came in their own little covered urn and we were able to add them and their tasty juices to the polenta at our leisure. We had asked our waiter for a red that was a good value. I was curious what his reaction would be as the wine list has many pricey options. The sommelier recommended a 2005 Mara Barbera Dante Rivetti from Piemonte (from where all good things come) that was perfect for the chilly night. After the polenta we split 2 pastas , the duck and foie gras ravioli with a reduced marsala sauce and the maccheroni with an assortment of seafood, uni, and breadcrumbs. Foie gras and uni are two items I'm hard pressed to resist when I encounter them on a menu. Overall, both of the house-made pastas were fresh, savory, properly cooked to al dente, and consisted of quality ingredients, but came up just short when compared to those we had at Babbo. Interestingly, our pasta dishes at Babbo had simpler ingredients (mint love letters and a spicy salami and rock shrimp spaghetti) and still managed to come out ahead.We split the veal loin for an entree which was appropriately cooked and had no main detractors but fails to stand out in my mind. Surprisingly, we were completely stuffed at this point, so full we had to pass on cheese plate and dessert (which says a lot b/c we are big eaters). This dishes at Scarpetta seemed much richer and dependent on butter and other savory fats when compared to those at Babbo. Our waiter was pleasant and didn't mind us lingering over the end of our wine sans dessert.

In my new life as starving artist, it's rare for me to eat out these days - particularly at a place like this. So, while it's been sitting in my bookmarks, and got quite a bit of buzz when it opened this summer, I just didn't think it was worth the price tag. As my favorite dining companion remarked, ""it's just wrong to have pasta dishes at more than $18 a pop."" And I have to concur. I had the maccheroni with octopus. Very good. I'll echo that some of the service seemed a little pushy, but it wasn't bothersome. Scott Conant seems to have made a name for himself cooking subtle, simple, Italian dishes and it would be nice if the prices also reflected such simplicity.

4.0,11/2/2008,"The food at Scarpetta will not whisk you away to a land beyond your dinner table or change your beliefs about what should be. What it will do, and does do, is satisfy with competent, sometimes creative, and extremely tasty spins on classic northern Italian cuisine, with some regionally-inspired dishes thrown in for good measure.We came here at the recommendation of one of my cookbook-writing friends, who told me that the food had been well-received. Since I trust Mindy, I made the reservation a month in advance - this was to be the location of my pre-40th dinner. What I hadn't counted on was my bafflingly stupid behavior the night before - Halloween - something that Scarpetta takes no responsibility for. I had gotten absurdly drunk, failed to take care of my inebriation with an equal dosing of water, and woke up to catch my flight to NY still drunk and very dizzy. I shook like an addict as I waited for my flight, thinking, ""oh, I'm going to have to cancel dinner tonight, because there's no way I'm going to keep it down"" - this after I threw up a stomach-full of water, pepto-bismol, and dramamine in a garbage can in concourse B. After two naps, several tylenol, and water, I felt much better, but I was concerned that Scarpetta might not agree with my fragile, hungover self.  To test this, I choked down a cracker - my first solid food of the day - and, after not throwing it up, realized I was actually going to be able to eat dinner. Which turned out to be a very good thing.Our table enjoyed our food - we ordered the polenta (it really soothed my belly), the tuna tartare, the beet and La Tur salad and the pumpkin ravioli (whoah, almost more dessert than pasta course), the duck (incredible, perfectly-cooked, really delicious), and the black cod. We splurged on the chocolate cake, the carrot budino, and the semifreddo for dessert. We loved every course and left not a bite. Sauces were quite good - classical reductions and glaces that were not too salty and were not used with a heavy hand. Because I was hungover,  my critical capacities were compromised. Usually I'm a much more critical and picky restaurant goer. But the upscale comfort food offered up by Scarpetta caught me off-guard - none of my critical neurons were firing and I loved bite after bite. And I was thrilled that the room had stopped spinning and my nausea was gone. I'd definitely consider Scarpetta for a business dinner or a casual bite at the bar.

Paired with lemony olive oil, butter and an olive tomato mashup that tasted like pasta sauce. I started with the tuna susci rolled up with carrots and greens drizzled in truffle oil. Delicious. The flavors sound weird but taste great. Scott had the short ribs, with barley and corn and cherry tomatoes, the meat was really tender, (i tasted everything ;-) and we split the yellow tail with ginger oil and sea salt (scott didnt like the crunchy salt - but) being kind of a salt lover and big on texture, i enjoyed it. Then we had 2 pastas. The cavatelli pasta with rabbit and mint -Interesting flavors (very good!) & The agnolotti, a mixed meat ravioli, in a white truffle cheese sauce, so rich, but sooo good. for entrees, scott had veal wrapped in pancetta with butternut puree, I don't even eat beef and this was good. I had the scallop appetizer - tartare style with greens, avocado and citrus (lemon or grape fruit, not sure) - this had great flavor, but, imho, could have gone a little heavier on the citrus. For dessert we split the pumpkin cheese cake with pineapple cream (mascarpone?) and some reduced gingery sauce (was supposed to have cherries too, but I'm allergic) this was amazing - with great spices and texture and not too filling at all (and believe me we were pretty filled!) all in all - probably closer to a 4.5, but I'd have to go back to be sure...  :)",4,1,3,Erica S.,"New York, NY",170,94,1

4.0,9/13/2008,"Annoying Twats. Both genders. I detest Meatpacking district! Even though the website downplays the location with the qualifier: ""edge of"", how can a few hundred feet offer any protection from the Garden State marauders who regularly invade the area to indulge in hedonistic pleasures?  Should one take a star off for dining patrons? Probably not. But, unless one expects, and accepts, inattentive service as par for the course, one would reconsider the merits of an exceptional meal under the twin onslaughts of sloth and avarice. After all, contemporary political spin also attempts to relegate real issues (""the meat"") to the background and instead focuses on ""a composite view of what people take away from the candidates"".I had lofty expectations from Scarpetta, and the food is definitely excellent, with some dishes ranking as, or bordering on, sublime. The book at the reception reminds one of the credentials of the chef/owner Scott Conant, who perhaps ranks second only to Mario Batali in his fame as purveyor of masterful Italian in NYC, and is back after a sabbatical. My own sloth prevented me from reviewing one of his earlier restaurants, L'Impero, before it shuttered - much to the dismay of my then dining companion from LA.We started off with mozzarella in carozza and the polenta with truffled mushrooms. The former was selected keeping in mind the oft heard refrain that few chefs can work as much of a wizardry around tomatoes, as Scott can. The latter though outshone and the creamy, buttery polenta is definitely the best version of cornmeal that I have EVER tasted. The truffled mushrooms are an inspired addition and round out the taste and textural variations really well. The only dish which compared to it in my mind was the (50% butter!) mashed potatoes at Joel Robuchon, which reach the pinnacle of culinary genius by transcending the mundane.Similar expectations led me to order the spaghetti with tomato and basil as my entrée. I mentioned to my dining companion that while this seemed an odd choice, given its simplicity and ubiquity, the match of basil and delicately simmered Roma tomatoes had garnered rave reviews for the earthy and sweet taste. Sadly, the results did not match our expectations, and I lamented not ordering the version of house made Spaghetti with Octopus that I had done earlier. However, the other entrée, the Black Cod with caramelized fennel and slow roasted tomatoes, was pure perfection with the tomatoes bringing out a nuanced sweetness, elevating it to its best in class in the city: Nobu. For dessert we ordered the molten chocolate cake with burnt orange caramel gelato and espresso sauce, along with the Key Lime and Torrone ""Cheesecake"" with a citrus salad and key lime-pistachio gelato. The molten chocolate cake turned out to be too rich even for my dining companion who loves all versions of the dessert, even though the Amadei chocolate was top notch. I thus lamented not ordering the coconut panna cotta that also comes highly recommended. The 'cheesecake' was definitely a stand out dessert and one that I strongly advocate to all lovers of citrus desserts.

By the end of the meal, with the disappearance of our assigned waiter, rush to clear the plates, servers bumping into our table AND into my dining companion - all the initial attention sadly amounted to little more than ""lipstick on a pig"". And, no, seeing Padma Lakshmi did not make up for it. The polenta, however....",14,16,13,Atif I.,"New York, NY",177,642,1772
5.0,8/14/2008,"Ok, so lemme start by saying, that I've been living in the UK for about 2 months - so I might be uber sensitive to service (or lack of)...but Scarpetta from a service stand point is a well-oiled machine. I am in awe, I have to say it caught me off guard because the service there ranks with, if not better than 5 star restaurants (and I've been to Le Bernardin, Jean Georges, Adour, etc as my comparison pool.)  Here's why I'm so shocked by the service I received.  I had picked the spot since it's been written about, etc as one of the latest & greatest to go to and a person I know raved about the food -- so I asked a friend to meet me at the bar so we could grab drinks & consider getting something to nibble.When I walked in, the space was really cool - I just really like the layout and the decorating-- (but it has those lights that seem to be in right now, think Blue Ribbon Wine Bar & Tailor.)  So I went to the bar to see about having a drink -- but every person seated, was there eating!  I had kinda hoped for a more 'inoteca bar feel--with everyone eating, it gives the bar more of a dining room / formal feel.  But off to the side of the bar are 2 tables and I asked the host if I could sit there and just order drinks/apps and he said it was fine, but that the full menu was also an option.  They start you off w/a bread basket and a small starter with olive oil, eggplant marinated in a tomato sauce & butter that reminded me of the clotted cream...the bread is pretty good, the additions yummy.Here's where I'm amazed.  I'm not seated in the dining room, I'm just a table in the bar and the service from that point forward was flawless.  We had a waiter come over & take our drink order (rose prosecco by the glass, thank you! - one of my all time favs) then after a bit another person came by and asked if we wanted to order food and we decided we'd check it out.  Water was always promptly refilled and someone was always at the right time checking up.  I just laughed when I saw that ppl wrote the service was spotty - perhaps they've fixed the issues.We split a polenta with truffled mushrooms - delicate and creamy.  I had the Agnolotti dal Plin which was a meat and cheese filled ravioli / capuleti type pasta in a what I believe to be a light butter / white wine sauce which had baby oyster mushrooms, shallots & diced carrots - the flavors all melded well.  My friend ordered the cod - and it was amazing!  It was on a bed of roasted fennel and what seemed like a sun dried tomato that was reconstituted - but tasty (I know I'm not making it sound tasty) but the light tomato sauce and fennels weren't overpowering to the cod and the cod was so light--you'll just have to order it to believe it.The waiter recommended a dessert (key lime cheesecake w/pistachio ice cream which was so tempting)- but we didn't have room.Here's how it added up: 2 glasses of prosecco / 2 chardonnays & the food above came to $84/person w/tax, tip, etc.The overall experience was delightful - the people who work there are friendly, knowledgable, and no attitude.  Also - Scott Conant was there the entire time, walking around, greeting people.  I met him a few years back at an event and he's rather charming (yeah, I know good eye candy too) but I think his friendly, warm vibe trickles down to the staff which makes for a really pleasurable dining experience.",1,0,1,K P.,"New York, NY",73,106,3
4.0,8/9/2008,"Went here for a late dinner with a friend who was visiting, and thought it was pretty good.  The dining room is less precious and more bustling than it looks in photos, without you being crammed into tables.  I was a little worried about service, given other people's reviews, but it was actually quite good - our server was informative and friendly, with excellent recommendations.  One hiccup - they brought my main course out at appetizers - but besides that, everything went smoothly.  We shared two appetizers - the yellowtail (fantastic) and the polenta, which was also quite good.  I imagine that the polenta is best in the winter, when it's cold outside.    We then each had a pasta dish - the calamarata and the agnolotti.  I was really impressed by the quality of the pasta itself - it was much better than the pasta I had last week at Babbo.  I would say overall, the pasta as a dish was not quite as good as Babbo, but it was still quite good.  It's nice to know that Italian can be this good.",1,0,1,M C.,"Cambridge, MA",0,8,0
5.0,8/5/2008,"I hate to say that I and Frank Bruni are right. But, we are. I just ate here tonight again for my ummm.....sixth time since it opened. And yes, I do live very near, but I WOULD travel for this place. I really would. And so would my husband (even though he doesn't have to) which is a rare treat. I've had every fish, polenta, beet salad dish multiple times and each time they impress. The wine list is great. You choose between $70 or $355, but we've only had the $70 bottles and they're great. I hate to pump this place up since I know it doesn't need it, but I just cannot hide my light under a bushel no more.

4.0,8/5/2008,"Oh MPD. I took my mother and boyfriend here on a Sunday night. They were still packed, so I guess everyone is still going crazy over the NYT article. I just really like Italian food and this place does not disappoint - the food part. Started off with the creamy polenta with mushroom sauce, short ribs and scallops...of which the polenta was miles away the best. The short ribs were very very tender and juicy so they are my 2nd favorite. The poor scallops didn't stand a chance! Since I basically got what I wanted (short ribs!), the rest of the dinner went pretty smoothly...I enjoyed the black cod, boy enjoyed the seared scallops and my mom showed us fatties up by ordering the beet salad. Whatevs! I definitely agree that the service is miserable - the waiters. The water - pourer is really ON though, my boy drinks water like he's running a marathon and that glass was never empty. So overall, the bread was delicious, order the polenta, skip dessert ($11 for a teeny mousse?? are you KIDDING ME??? - go to Rafaello's uptown on 9th avenue! Half as much for more chocolate :)).

4.0,7/31/2008,"went here last night to help my roommate celebrate his meager reward for toiling away at merrill lynch the past 2 years-- a trivial raise, no advancement in responsibility, but new business cards that say ""associate"" on them.  w00t.  i had the chilled pea soup with crabmeat and duck/foie gras ravioli.  like some other people who've already written, i wondered whether or not everyone was there cause they saw the same nytimes article we saw (i guess they did).  but i don't mind following the masses if it's to a delicious plate of duck swimming succulantly in duck fat and wrapped with pasta, all topped with a delicious sauce of duck fat.  i'm like the tucan from the froot loops commercials except i'm not a tucan and i don't give a shit about cereal, just. . .fatty duck chunks.  anyway, yes, it was delicious and fun.  you should go too.",2,0,1,Stephanie L.,"San Francisco, CA",78,174,0
4.0,7/31/2008,"We went to Scarpetta last night, the day that it received a 3 star rating in the New York Times. The room seemed to be buzzing from that excitement. Our experience was very positive and we left feeling that the review was mostly justified. We were greeted warmly and seated in the main room. The room feels light and spacious and there is a good amount of space between the tables. Our waiter was warm and convivial and did not steer us wrong all night. We started with a few appetizers, all of which succeeded incredibly well. The Pea soup was refreshing and flavorful; the Carozza was lightly fried and very tasty. The polenta was the most incredible of the 3. It comes presented in a small white bowl with a steel pot of wild mushrooms on the side. The two are mixed together in front of you and it is truly magical. I could have eaten another serving of it right away. Our waiter suggested a rose from Montepulciano to match with the appetizers and it went brilliantly. We then split an order of the spaghetti with tomato and basil for the table. It was rich and flavorful with a little bit of a bite to it. What a treat to have fresh pasta served al dente.The main courses were the only part that did not overwhelm us. We had the Osso buco, the chicken with a liver sauce and the baby goat. They were all good but a bit overly salted. Not terrible by any means. Just a bit too much. If the first two courses had not been so spectacular, I probably would not have noticed the slight slip ups in the main courses.Desserts were really good although we were really quite full. The apple pie was spectacular with a polenta crust that tasted like very good shortbread. The Parfait came with a small milkshake that could have been enough just by itself. The Cheesecake has no cheese and was overwhelming tart. It was the least successful of the 3. The service was professional and friendly all night and the whole evening was a pleasure. We will certainly be back to try all of the pastas that looked so good (and of course to have that polenta again. ) What a great addition to the New York restaurant scene.",1,0,1,Amy L.,"New York, NY",0,3,0
4.0,7/28/2008,"Brand new restaurant.  Scott Conant.  Beautiful wood slatted ceiling. Polenta and mushrooms omg mmmmmm, buttery pomodoro, amazing fritto misto, in other words divine italian comfort food.  So far, the equation is right.  But, alas, terrible service!  I could be a better waiter and I have no experience!  Change the staff, change the staff before people catch on!  But ho, I reccommend you go anyways, its too fabulous and calorie rich to miss (definitely head across the street to Country Club to dance the calories off afterwards...)",2,0,2,Erica B.,"Brooklyn, NY",937,85,0
5.0,7/11/2008,"It might've been the bottle of Pinot Grigio, but I walked out of Scarpetta swearing it was one of the best meals I'd had in awhile.Why? Because any place that starts you off with focaccia and bread baked with cheese and pancetta gets an automatic A for effort in my book. We first ordered the creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms and mozzarella in carozza with stewed baby tomatoes (ie, fried cheese with tomatoes), and it was like dying and going to food heaven. I don't know that fried cheese is ever a bad thing, but the polenta was beyond words. I don't even want to think about the fat and calories involved there, but I promise, promise, promise that it's totally worth a trip to the gym (if you know, you're into that, which, I swear, I'm trying to be). Anywho, just when I thought things weren't going to get any better, my spaghetti came out - and was perfection on a plate. Yesssss, I realize I'm talking about spaghetti, but it was perfectly seasoned with basil and I  would've licked the bowl if it wasn't so frowned upon. My friend ordered the cod, and I'm pretty sure she felt similarly. It was totally unnecessary (because at that point, we'd consumed a week's worth of calories, and, more importantly, we were both uncomfortably full), but we ordered dessert: the chocolate/vanilla parfait. Even though my waiter mentioned the word ""gelatinous"" when describing it, it was quite tasty, and the biscotti that came with was the best I've had in years. Don't worry about the tab - just go. Totally worth it.",2,0,1,Lesel M.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,24,0
4.0,6/24/2008,"I went here for a special dinner w/ my girl on a Sunday night and came away very pleased with my dinner and meal.Even the most unassuming dish rang loud and true on our tongues. Don't forgo the roast chicken and the spaghetti pomodoro simply because you've seen it elsewhere. I declare both dishes to be the best spaghetti with tomato sauce and roast chicken I've ever had. The chicken was like a different creature all together. It was supremely tasty and moist with all the juices calling to mind the wonders that proper technique can eek out of an oft neglected protein. The liver sauce lent the dish a sense of gameieness that might be often missed from chicken.The spaghetti was savory, but also nicely sweet with a great bloom of basil. The pasta was fresh and cooked just right. And definitely get the creamy polenta with mushrooms! You'll need a couple of jogs to work it off, but it's well worth it.One thing I would suggest (and this goes true for most restaurants as well I suppose) is that if Opentable doesn't give you the option of your prime eating time, try calling the restaurant directly. We arrived at 6 to an empty restaurant and it detracted from an overall great experience. The place didn't even remotely start filling up until 7. I should've just called.",1,0,0,John Z.,"Philadelphia, PA",21,140,21
1.0,6/14/2008,"Went here last week with a friend, and it was horrible.  Sat at the bar as we like to do for dinner, and ordered a half bottle of Sancerre and Grilled Octopus to share as an appetizer.  It was the worst octopus I've had.  Completely underseasoned, so we had to ask the bartender for salt and pepper.  I got the duck and foie gras ravioli as my entree, and it tasted like bad dumplings.  Not completely inedible, but really not worth the price and not what I expected.  My friend got the steak, which wasn't horrible.For dessert, we asked the bartender which she liked better between the plum crostata and the coconut panna cotta, and she told us the panna cotta was tiny, so we should get both.  When they arrived, the panna cotta was huge, but it was pretty good.  The plum crostata was a bit too tart for my taste but it wasn't bad.After we left, both of our stomachs were hurting an hour later.  So the 1 rating is for the atmosphere, good wine and not so bad dessert.  I would never come here again for food, though.  I'd rather eat street meat.",0,0,0,JaShin T.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,102,6

5.0,6/8/2008,"It had me at hello.  Actually no, Scarpetta really had me at spaghetti. They also had me at yellowtail carpaccio with sea salt, sprouts, and ginger oil. And the scallops with mushroom fricasee and sunchoke puree were pretty amazing too. The orata with crispy skin, morels, truffle jus and cippoline onions was delish. And lest I forget the agnolotti... (*sigh*)Scott Conant  (formerly at Alto and L'Impero) has gone and done his own thing. Per the manager, Jeff, this is a ""casual"" venture, but the food is super high end and the crowd (in typical weekend Meatpacking style) is overdressed. The space is airy (FKA Village Idiot and then Gin Lane) complete with skylight in the back dining room and outdoor seating smack dab on 14th Street. The service was spot on: absurdly friendly and unrushed for an MPD establishment (thanks to Guy, our bartender). The price point was pretty high (all the pastas were mid $20's and the mains were upper $20's and $30's) but ... well such is the price of good food, service and atmosphere.I don't often wander into the MPD, especially on a weekend, but for Scarpetta I may.
