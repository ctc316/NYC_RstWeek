5.0,4/15/2019,"Bar none one of the best restaurants I've had the chance to eat at so far in NYC. Not only is the food diverse and incredible, the service is attentive, humorous and engaging. The space is relatively small and intimate; we were seated at the bar, but never felt too close or crowded out by other patrons. For the size, the noise management is fairly good too.For appetizers we ordered the caviar on sprint toast with wasabi aioli and the octopus. Both were incredible and I was amazed by the crunchy delicacy the shrimp toast had. Think of a fried shrimp ball from your favorite dim sum restaurant, but with an airy and crispy texture, and then topped with caviar to balance out the dish. Incredible.For our main course, we ordered the Scallops, Pig Out, and the special, which was a type of game which tasted similar to duck. Scallops were well seared and complimented the lentils and foam well, however the leftover lentils by themselves left something to be desired. The Pig Out and special were a parade of textures and flavors, from crunchy to fork-tender, and umami to spicy. The sides of Japanese Sweet Potato and Sticky Rice just helped to round everything out.It was a delectable meal for two for a decent price and I'll definitely be back to clear the rest of the menu!",0,0,0,Roger C.,"New York, NY",522,49,22
5.0,4/13/2019,Amazing dinner here with friends. The pork was delicious but that snow crab pasta...lawd have mercy. Beautiful on the inside and worthy of the michelin star. Def check it out,0,0,0,Parth D.,"New York, NY",0,17,22
4.0,4/9/2019,"Overall, Tuome is great.  I really wanted to give it 5 stars, but alas it wasn't an A+ meal.  I'll list the hits & missesHits: - Service is great.  My waitress was attentive / knowledgeable / all that you can ask for in a server.  - Chicken Liver was really good.  Of course we needed more bread so that we could lick the plate clean haha.  - Reasonable menu prices for the quality of food - Broccoli side dish.  I don't know what was in the sauce but I could've drunken it.  Misses- Pig out for two.  I reaaaalllly wanted to love this dish, but I found it very average and not worth the hype.  Even with the garlic & sriracha toppings, the whole dish felt very pedestrian.  Ugh.  The noodles were good though. - Chinese Beignets.  Again, I realllly wanted to love this dessert, but it was just OK for me.  I think I love the vanilla ice cream the most.  The caramel sauce tasted very lite to me.  Overall, it was a great experience, and Tuome is a great restuarant.  Will I be back though?  Not entirely sure.  Still, for what it is, I'd recommend Tuome to others.",0,0,0,James C.,"Manhattan, NY",65,34,6
5.0,4/5/2019,"The food is excellent, so is the service. A fusion restaurant doesn't always tempt diners but this one is unique in the fact that the combinations are creative and work well. Definitely recommended!",0,0,0,Rathore V.,"Hoboken, NJ",2,209,0
5.0,3/29/2019,"It's hard to sell me on Asian fusion, but I love Tuome. I get the same thing every time I come here, because it's so amazing I can never bring myself to try other things on the menu! To start, get the chicken liver mousse. I'm not the biggest foie gras/pate person, but this dish is incredible. The texture is so fluffy and light, which is great in contrast to the really rich, umami flavors of the chicken liver. You spread it on perfectly toasted squares of bread, with some sea salt and maple syrup. HEAVEN. I've also had the octopus with XO sauce, which is very good, but not as life-changing as the chicken liver mousse.Then you need the pig out for two -- this is some crispy squares of pork belly, a bowl of peanut noodles, and a little citrusy side salad. I am very picky when it comes to pork belly (it's generally too fatty for me), but I could eat this for days. The peanut sauce coating the noodles is also incredible. For dessert, get the beignets which come with goat's milk caramel. Ugh. So good.  I also really love the vibe of this restaurant. It's quiet, cozy, and feels like a neighborhood place. And it's never difficult to get a reservation or do a walk-in, even during prime time!",0,0,0,Vickie W.,"New York, NY",32,153,300

5.0,3/13/2019,"This restaurant is not what you would expect as it's in the heart of Alphabet City, on a relatively quiet street, but boy is it a gem in disguise. It recently received a one Michelin star rating for it's unique take on Chinese-inspired American food. This is a tapas style type of place, so definitely order a decent amount! I'd say 4-5 dishes make the perfect serving size for a couple ready for an amazing dining experience.For my first appetizer, I ordered the octopus. The dish is an art in itself as the brown butter is dished out in front of you from an icing style type of can. The second appetizer I got was the cauliflower dish with blue cheese miso, grape and herbs. This was amazing. The blue cheese miso kept your mouth guessing and pleasantly surprised as the saltiness of the miso coupled with the blue cheese added a nice punch.As for my main dish, I got the Pig Out (for two) and shared it with my boyfriend. This is the one dish here that is meant for two people, so the serving was much bigger. It also comes with garlic QQ noodles which were such a good pairing for the friend pork that had a sticky candied top. Definitely a must try! The salad on the side was probably one of the BEST arugula-based salads I've ever had. It had this sweet lychee-based dressing with candied walnuts and real lychees throughout. This dish was a gem and truly stood out to me.We didn't realize at first this dish came with noodles, so we decided to also order the rice, which was definitely a great option. This sticky rice was served classic Chinese style in the banana leaves. It had Chinese sausage and was steamed with duck fat. So rich and so flavorful.Highly recommend this spot and will definitely go back.",2,0,2,Sarah C.,"New York, NY",396,144,193

4.0,3/8/2019,"This review is almost a year late, so I am not going to remember all the details. :'( I do remember, however, that we had a reservation for 6 people for 9:30PM (which is late already as it is) but we were kept waiting until 10:30PM. The management gave us several bottles of wine to appease us, which did help for my friends, but not for me because I don't drink any alcohol at all. After that harrowing experience, the reason that Tuome gets above 2 stars from me is really the crab noodles - they were stupendous. They were easily one of the best dishes I've ever had in my life. Even over a year later, I remember this dish being incredibly memorable, delicious and thought-provoking. I really want to come back on an early weeknight to avoid the wait (so I'd recommend you do that, if possible) and enjoy the crab noodles again. Raymond and I also shared the pig out for two, which I had been really excited for after seeing a detailed explanation on a video online. It sounded absolutely amazing, and it's definitely very thoughtfully executed, but it failed to wow me because it was pretty comparable to excellent siu yook in Hong Kong (that costs 1/10 of the price for a larger portion). It's definitely better than any siu yook I've had, and each piece was truly equal parts tender, fatty and crispy, but the marginal taste experience difference did not make up for the shockingly large price difference. It's definitely good, though, and worth the price for the amount of effort and overall tastiness. It also comes with a bowl of noodles and is very filling; I think this is definitely enough for two people. So in the grand scheme of things, this is a quite reasonably priced meal for two.Overall, I would really just come back for the crab noodles and see if there's anything else I want to try. I had Chef Thomas Chen's dish at the MOFAD and I loved it, so I know I like his food. I'm definitely willing to give it another try.",1,1,1,Liana L.,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",490,691,2389
5.0,3/8/2019,"My fiancé and I saw a last minute opening on a Saturday night for bar seating and we grabbed it right away, as someone must've just cancelled.  we had a very nice experience, with wonderful food and attentive service.My fiancé has a difficult time with restaurant that have Asian influences given his celiac disease but they were very knowledgeable here and we were able to order many things to share that were gluten free.The spiced curry popcorn with lime zest that they give you is very flavorful and a wonderful way to star the meal.The wagyu tartare was incredibly fresh and well executed (they just had to put the crisps on the side since they contained gluten).  The chicken liver was very sweet and tasty.The pork for 2 was incredible, so crispy and not too fatty, and gluten free!  The sauces on the side were awesome as well.  They were able to substitute the noodles with a sweet potato dish for my fiancé that had mashed potatoes (or butter) drizzled on top they were delicious.  The noodles I got were amazing, with a very strong peanut flavor that complemented everything.We would definitely come back!",1,1,1,Elyka A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",198,204,634

5.0,3/5/2019,"I don't normally like to go to a restaurant twice but this place is somewhere I'd go again. The ambiance is very romantic, though a little drafty. I didn't mind the drafty windows, just placed my coat on my back. The building is very old and the restaurant reflects this, small, closed off spaces but it really lends itself to the romantic atmosphere. The decor is dark, Asian but I'm not an interior decorator...the food was incredible with some misses due to the boldness of the menu, especially the Berkshire pork dish. This dish was so rich and decadent I wanted to fall asleep after I ate it. They took some pork meat, chopped it up then stacked chopped up skin, pressed it down tight, crisped up the skin and cut it in small ""bite-sized"" squares. They paired it with a salad and peanut noodles. I enjoyed this dish very much although there were some flaws which I hope they perfected. It was so heavy but was lacking in vinegar, acidic element to cut the fat. The salad was tasty but I thought the candied walnuts went rancid. I LOVE candied nuts SO much and I couldn't eat them. I still recommend it",0,0,0,Dia Q.,"Queens, NY",134,123,318
4.0,3/4/2019,"Pretty decent experience, the majority of dishes was heavily flavored, a lot of cream, blue cheese, butter etc, the pig out was particularly heavy... we ate a bit more than half of the plate and just gave up, not because we were full or it didn't taste well, it was just too much for the stomach to handle at once lolThe rice wrapped in lotus leafs(?) was very authentic imo, enjoyed that very much as well as the cauliflower (just wish there wasn't so much blue cheese)Overall a very decent dinner, tables were very close to each other which was a bit awkward, but it's nyc, we are used to it (sort of), the place gets filled up rather quickly, so definitely make a reservation",0,0,0,Casey H.,"New York, NY",97,58,53

We dined at the bar and ordered octopus, cauliflower, chicken porridge, crab noodles, side of carrots and beignet ice cream to top it all off!

4.0,2/26/2019,"Definitely make a reservation if you're planning to come on a weekend (we got denied on a Sat night one time), but on a regular Tues evening, it was empty! The dining experience is on the romantic side with very dim lighting. FOOD:Egg (deviled): Tbh probably the highlight of my meal!! Perfectly crispy and pipin' hot on the outside and the chili sauce was a fantastic twist to this classic appetizer. Quack on brioche: Duck was cooked really well. Brioche was buttery. A bit saucey for me, so I wish there were more daikon relish in mine but other than that I enjoyed this appetizer. Pig Out (for two): Comes with 12 pieces of crispy pork, arugula, 2 bowls of peanut noodles, and 2 condiments for the pork. I could tell that the pork was cooked exquisitely and the skin was actually super crunchy. Under the layer of crispy skin, the pork was like a pulled-pork texture (not like the pork belly from Chinese butcher shops). The peanut butter noodles were cooked al dente which is just the way I like it! Got a bit saucey as well though. For $58, I don't know if I would pay that much for it again, but nonetheless the whole dish was cooked well. SERVICE: Everyone was very attentive and refilled our water once it was half empty! I like how they explain every dish to you as well.",1,1,0,Kristina Y.,"Hollis, NY",578,61,85
5.0,2/23/2019,"We went to Tuome for restaurant week, and were absolutely blown away!The Food: 5/5. We shared the roasted cauliflower (5/5), chicken liver mousse (4/5), snow crab noodles with truffle ($13 supplement) (5/5), and amish chicken (5/5). We agreed that the snow crab noodles were easily top 3 dishes we've had in New York thus far. We rarely order chicken when eating out, but the server highly recommended it, so we gave it a try. This was probably the BEST chicken I've ever had. It was cooked perfectly and utterly delicious. The Service: 5/5. The server was friendly and attentive throughout the whole meal.I get a little nervous going to Michelin star restaurants during restaurant week and fear that the experience will be a bit diluted. THIS WAS NOT THE CASE. Tuome totally lived up to the hype, and the food was everything we hoped it would be. Only minor complaint is that it was FREEZING outside and they did not seem to appropriately adjust the heat inside. The experience would have been perfect if they turned up the heat - the cold was a bit distracting during the meal. However, we will certainly go back to try their Pig Out (for two) in the near future!",0,0,0,Kezia Q.,"New York, NY",137,30,64
3.0,2/17/2019,"The octopus appetizer is to die for! The night we went, they offered black truffles on top so we opted for it. It was perfect on top of the potato puree, so divine. The joong, Chinese tamale, or ""rice"" side dish was pretty great, a cute reminder of the ones I eat back home. Everything else we ordered was lacking - the pork belly, sesame noodles, and the deviled eggs. The pork belly was basically pulled pork shaped into a cube and fried until crispy on the outside - not a real Cantonese pork belly. I will say the portion was huge, we couldn't even finish the entire thing. However, it was really really fatty. I don't think the sesame noodles was a good pairing because the pork was already so heavy. I wish we had more of the arugula salad because that made eating the pork belly more bearable. The octopus really stole the show and made me excited for the rest of the meal. Unfortunately, the rest just didn't deliver, so we passed on dessert.",2,1,1,Betty W.,"New York, NY",360,271,556

5.0,2/16/2019,"My husband and I came here for an anniversary dinner, and we both agreed it was one of the best places we've eaten at together. It's a quaint place - very cozy, dim lighting, exposed brick wall. The vibe is warm and comfortable. You can tell it's a nice restaurant without being too upscale. We decided to order off the prefix menu that included 3 dishes. We got the chicken liver, pig out for two, and beignets. We also ordered the cauliflower as an extra app. Each dish was more delicious than the last. If you love suckling pig, the pig out for two is a must-get! It also comes with peanut noodles.

3.0,2/15/2019,"TLDR; I do not recommend coming here for a prix fixe menu (except maybe RW?) but yes for the regular menuWe came here for the valentines day 5-course menu. The ambience and service was great but the actual prix fixe menu was not. A lot of their items I really wanted to try that they are known for were not on the menu and some of the dishes served were not good. We asked for their recommendation on a red wine. I specified I wanted something sweet but not too sweet. The wine we were recommended was too light and too sweet it tasted like diluted grape juice. Course 1 is the fluke, which is a type of fish. The sauce on the fish was amazing as was the 2 chips they gave us. The amount of fish though was maybe 3-4 thin, small slivers, adding up to maybe one or two pieces of nigiri you might get from a regular sushi restaurant. Course 2 is the caviar on shrimp toast and sun choke soup. It was overly salty. Course 3 is the crab noodles, which were absolutely heavenly. There was very little crab but the sauce and the noodles were the real MVPs and the portion was big. Course 4 is the wagyu, which also was amazing but the sauces were a little salty. Course 5 is the chocolate tart, which tasted like a dryer, more bitter and heavier version of Royce chocolates. It was not good. Not sure why but me and my bf also felt really nauseous afterwards. At the end, they took a Polaroid of us to commemorate the occasion which I thought was super cute!So was this worth the $150pp? Definitely not since only two of the dishes were worth getting (and combined cost less than half of the price). Some of the items were really good though so I would definitely urge people to come and order off the regular menu since you can choose exactly what you want and it'd be a lot cheaper. I'm a bit disappointed since I had been wanting to come here for a long time but I think my experience might've been better if I had come on a regular evening.",2,0,0,Candice L.,"Queens, NY",610,59,127

Perfect for a date. The food took a little long to arrive but the service was outstanding! - Chicken liver mousse: WOW! This was incredible. The mousse was so smooth and full of flavor. It paired nicely with the side condiments and white toasted bread. They also provide more bread if needed. - Beef tartare: Not my favorite. It was good but I didn't feel the two hour yolk was special. The beef itself was too chewy for me. - Snow crab noodles: SO DELICIOUS! It came with plenty of crab. The egg noodles had the most perfect texture and the dashi butter was bursting with flavor without it being overly salty. - Chocolate tart: Average. It was super dense almost too dry for my liking. Might suit someone who loves chocolate. - Beignet: Incredible asian influence on this. The fried buns were warm paired with cream goat milk ice cream and caramel. The dish was sort of DIY which made it fun to eat. Highly recommend! Oh did I mention a bottle of wine (red, white, rosé) was only $35?? Take advantage of restaurant week specials.

3.0,2/2/2019,"Ok so let me start off by saying the service and ambiance deserves five stars.I came here for restaurant week on a Friday evening and our meal started with complimentary popcorn. The curry popcorn kind of reminded me of Indian food. It was a nice idea but I didn't particularly care for the specific flavor combination and it was served warm or at room temperature, perhaps it would have been better hot. Still, it was complimentary so I appreciated the gesture. I had the chicken liver as the appetizer. It was quite creamy and light at the same time, which I enjoyed. On the side, sea salt was given which added a nice pairing to it. My friend had the cauliflower appetizer and I tried a bit of her sauce for it and it was simply sublime. I actually think the tiny morsel of sauce from her cauliflower was the most delectable part of the meal for me.As an entree, I was kind of disappointed that the pig out had to be for two as my friend did not want it/was not in the mood for it... meaning I could not try it. We both had the snow crab and we were both a little let down. My friend immediately commented that the ""snow crab"" was more of a minor garnish. The butter flavor to the noodles was nice in a subtle manner. At that point, I mentioned to my friend that I could not really pinpoint or taste the Chinese influence as strongly as I was hoping or initially imagined. My friend was shocked! She could not believe that it was a Chinese-American fusion as she said she hadn't tasted anything Chinese at all. I showed her the type of cuisine on yelp as it's listed and she still couldn't fathom it. For this reason, I would definitely say (at least with the dishes we ordered), the Chinese flavorings were not immediately recognizable or coming through. For the dessert, one of us had the beignet and the other had the chocolate tart and we shared both. The chocolate was too dark and rich for me personally but if you enjoy dark chocolate, you would like it as it was very rich. My friend felt the beignets were just okay as she commented that they could have been softer and they did not resemble beignets as typically seen in New Orleans at the Cafe du Monde or something of the sort. I really enjoyed the flavor of the ice cream as well as the caramel topping which came with the desserts. I think overall, the food was three stars for me personally.",2,0,1,Tina S.,"New York, NY",112,197,226
5.0,1/26/2019,"No wonder it's Michelin worthy! I came here for restaurant week ($42/person) and left with both my heart and my stomach full. This is a really great place for delicious food in a very intimate atmosphere that's perfect for a date or to catch up with a good friend. We ended up ordering:+ chicken liver mousse+ wagyu beef tartare+ pig out (for two)+ chocolate+ Chinese beignetsEvery single bite of food and every single component of each dish had its own bursting flavor profile but I would say that the chicken liver mousse was the highlight of the night! The beef tartare was also really refreshing and delicate but there was something so intoxicating about the chicken liver mousse.When you order the pig out, each person gets their own bowl of peanut noodles and I really appreciated how chewy/al dente the noodles still were. The pork itself was skillfully prepared. I'm usually hesitant to order pork at a restaurant but it was as if they had deconstructed it. The meat was very tender and flaky (is that even a thing) while the skin was super crispy (my fav).The chocolate is a bit heavy so definitely do share. It worked out well to eat it with the vanilla ice cream that came with the beignets. I loved the citron jam (reminds me of the Korean tea) and the goat's milk caramel (tangy but still sweet).All in all, I really enjoyed my experience here and would love to come try some of their other dishes!

4.0,1/25/2019,"Rule Number 1 of eating at Tuome: Do everything the chef recommends. If you've never been to Tuome, get ready for dark, moodily-lit space and some stellar Asian-fusion fare.We started off with drinks and were gifted a complimentary mini bowl of cumin and lime zest popcorn. Eat this. I immediately warmed to the establishment because popcorn forms the base of my personal food pyramid (along with peanut butter and coffee).At the time of this review, it's restaurant week, so we ordered off that menu. The chicken liver mousse with milk bread was very nice, as was the wagyu beef tartare with a ""two hour egg yolk"" and crispy chips. I truly have no idea what a two hour egg yolk is, but I can report that the crispy chips are, in fact, deep fried wonton bits and furthermore, they are downright delightful. Next up was the pork belly. The chef recommends using both the confit and lime chili sauce on each bite of pork. Do that. I marveled aloud that I've never had pork belly that quite so crunchy, at which point my boyfriend pointed out that the crispy part was actually pork skin. Mystery solved. (Don't let that deter you if you're squeamish about non-conventional meat parts--it's delicious and more of a texture than a flavor). The accompanying noodles had peanut sauce (another win for my food pyramid!) and overall the dish was excellent. I experienced a fleeting moment of doubt because the noodle portions appeared small, but the dish was rich and very filling. If your server asks if you'd like accompanying sides, you can safely pass unless you've just finished a half marathon or fasted all day. Beignets and a chocolate tart rounded out the meal. The chef recommends that you make the beignets, ice cream, and goat milk caramel into mini ice cream sandwiches. Do that. I pulled the middle out of my beignet, which was a cross between a croissant and a traditional beignet, and proceeded to enjoy the best ice cream sandwich I've had since the stroopwafel ice cream sandwiches I used to buy in Colorado. The tart was accompanied with crunchy almond bits, rich in a flourless chocolate cake kind of way, and not to sweet, but if I could go back in time, I would get mounds of those beignets with ice cream.",0,0,0,Veronica P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",59,17,11
4.0,1/24/2019,"My partner and I saw tuome online and thought it was a cool (but also weird) concept to incorporate traditional American food with Chinese food, so we decided to stop by for dinner one night. The service wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. We walked in and it was packed that night, so we were told that we would have to wait. That wasn't a problem. I would have liked for the waitress to be more attentive, though. It was like she took our order, brought our food, and that was it. She wasn't around when we needed more drinks or wanted to order more food. The food on the other hand was very yummy. The deviled eggs were breaded and crispy, and I can say confidently that they were some of the best deviled eggs I've ever had. The seafood dish I ordered was too yummy! It was creamy and packed with flavor.

5.0,1/21/2019,"Came here for our first stop of restaurant week! Overall we were very impressed with all of the dishes, but the chicken liver mousse, Berkshire pork and beignets really stood out!We ordered chicken liver and wagyu beef tartar for the appetizers. Chicken liver was so smooth and creamy -- smeared over a warm piece of toast, it almost tasted like a very rich butter. I could eat that all night! The beef wasn't as tasty in comparison. Next was the Berkshire pork for two served with peanut sauce noodles. The pork reminded me of crispy pork belly skin on top of something similar in texture to pulled pork. Paired with the sauces and the chewy peanut noodles, it was an interesting and delightful entree. Dessert we ordered the beignets and chocolate mousse. The restaurant week menu online offers apple almond tarte but this wasn't offered in the store, and my waitress said the online menu may be from a previous year. Darn! I like to plan what I'm ordering ahead of time for restaurant week so I was pretty disappointed that the menu wasn't up to date - but it's hard to be upset when everything else was so tasty. Anyway if I could do it again, I'd make it two orders of the beignet. The chocolate mousse was very rich and there was nothing wrong with it, but it just didn't compare to the beignets. They were almost like mini croissants, still warm, and we were told to cut them in half and make an ice cream sandwich with the vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce (which came in the cutest little condiment bottle). Overall, I would highly recommend Tuome!

5.0,1/18/2019,"Glad I finally was able to try this place. We went on a Thursday at 8:30p. We had to make reservations a week in advanced. Tuome's already popular and it's gotten even more traction since it made the Michelin list for 2019. This gem of a restaurant's in the east village - dim light, exposed brick, and some wood interior. It's the perfect date spot / intimate spot. We sat at the bar and the servers were super friendly and attentive. Food highlights below: - octopus -- deliciously charred, soft and juicy in the middle. The sauce paired is thick and delicious. - pig out for two -- this gives you 12 pieces of crispy pork belly. It's cooked in duck fat which gives the pork an extra depth of flavor. For the pork, there are two sauces - one is grated ginger and the other is chili oil. Would suggest eating with both sauces. This dish is paired with a salad that's refreshing, and peanut noodles on the side. It's thick and sweet - I loved it. - sticky rice with Chinese sausage - this is an underrated dish. I think it was my favorite dish of the night too. It's steamed in a leaf with duck fat, so the rice is full of flavor. I couldn't stop eating this.I can't believe it took us this long to go to Tuome. It's a well deserved star, and I'll be going back regularly.

4.0,1/3/2019,Had a great nye dinner here. They served prefixed meals on that night. The chef started us with butternut squash soup and it's very creamy and delicious. Then we had the fluke crudo which has coconut milk and lemon sauce on top which makes it super yummy. Then we had Brussel sprouts and I think it's the best brussel sprouts I have ever had in my life and I'm not a big fan of brussel sprouts. Then we had the snow crab egg noodles which tasted like caramel and butter and it's just melt in your mouth!!! it was definitely the best dish there. We had the steak as our main course which was just ok because they're better steaks out there at steakhouses. Then we finished with a chocolate ganach. Fire in the sky is a must have cocktail very delicious and it's not too spicy. The food is 5 stars and the service was also perfect. The only thing not so great is the space and the decor for a Michelin one star restaurant. Our table was wobbly and people kept butting on our table when they want to get out to go to the bathroom. The bathroom is also very dark. I think if the vibe improves a little in this restaurant then it would be amazing!!!,0,0,0,Callie S.,"New York, NY",133,122,494

They tend to overbook and they obviously don't buy enough food so the patron can actually get get what they want. It's just very disappointing when this happens consistently.

4.0,12/22/2018,"I live nearby Tuome and have been wanting to try it for a while. We had considered going during Restaurant Week but ended up choosing another place. And then lo and behold, Tuome earned its Michelin Star, so we had to come by and try. My boyfriend and I came for dinner on a weekday night around 7:00. We made a reservation day of, but it was definitely bustling by the time we were finishing our meal.  To start, we shared the octopus which may have been my favorite dish of the night. The octopus was crisp and tasty, and the whipped potatoes that came with it were fantastic. Additionally, there was some crispy bacon or chorizo with it that just added additional flavor. For our entree, we had to do the pork belly for two. The peanut noodles were tasty but a little overwhelming after a while. We both didn't finish our noodles although the portions were definitely large. We finished all the pork belly, which was great and came with two sauces as well as an arugula salad. Finally, we shared the curry Mac and cheese as a side. This dish is extremely unique and surprising when you first taste it. We had just come back from a vacation in India, and it was strange to taste the curry with traditional macaroni shells, but it definitely grew on us, and we finished the whole thing.  Overall, we spent about $50 each, which was reasonable for the portions and quality of food we got. My only hesitation was the service was slightly lacking to me in regards to earning a Michelin Star. It was not bad by any means but not great, compared to what you normally see at Michelin starred restaurants. I noticed they offered to take other people's coats, but they did not offer to take mine. They forgot to bring out our Mac and cheese with the entree, and I had to remind the waitress that we still had not gotten it yet. We also noticed at the table next to us that they brought the wrong appetizer to the wrong table. Just nit picky things but my reason for not giving 5 stars. Overall did definitely enjoy the meal though!",4,0,1,Dana H.,"Manhattan, NY",766,296,1380

Then, when I told them about it, they didn't do ANYTHING to find a solution, neither a glass of champagne or a second bite of desert. That's really unfortunate; if you're looking for a nice Michelin Star restaurant to spend a romantic and special night, this is NOT the place.

4.0,12/7/2018,"I had a fantastic meal at Tuome and they recently also just gained one Michelin star for NY!! From the food, service to the ambiance, everything was just perfect for a night out with 3 of my best friends! We ordered a variety of dishes to share as each portion was on the smaller side. Do note that their dishes are rich so you do get full easily (at least for us). Deviled Eggs - WOW, this has got to be my favorite and best deviled eggs I have ever eaten...Absolutely amazing. The egg white was lightly fried to perfection and the yolk and toppings were absolutely divine! I especially liked the addition of xo chili sauce to top it off. Chicken Liver Mouse - another amazing dish. So cream, so flavorful and delicious. Another must get here! Snow crab noodles - wow another to die for dish. The noodles are al dente.. covered in this creamy dashi butter sauce topped with snow crab. It was so delicious, we couldn't stop eating it. Unlike anything I tasted before! Beef - (not sure what cut this was), but it was tender as F! It was so good, flavored well and also gluten free! Loved the sweet savory sauce that the meat was cooked in. Pig out for two (came with peanut noodles) - This dish was good, but I expected a little more since most yelpers hyped this dish up. The skin was extra crispy which I liked, but the overall pork meat it self was mediocre. I say that because I've literally had multiple versions of this dish and I personally prefer the meat to be a full piece and not fall apart. I didn't get that texture of the pork and I couldn't pick up the full with chopsticks either. Overall, a great restaurant and would try again!",3,1,2,Brenda L.,"Los Angeles, CA",320,353,753

I ordered off the prix fixe menu, while my boyfriend, a vegetarian, ordered the single vegetarian main entree. Service was friendly but it took some time for each dish to come out. Luckily, each dish was incredibly delicious. We started with the roasted miso blue cheese cauliflower; the sauce was rich with umami flavors and the blue cheese was never overpowering. We are every bit of this and used our utensils to spoon up the rest of the sauce. Next, my snow crab noodles came and his mushroom noodle dish. The next day, I spent all of thanksgiving dinner talking about how good this dish was. The noodles were so buttery and lightly sweet and perfectly chewy.

Meant to be eaten on little pieces of toast, and topped with kosher salt, pumpkin (?) seeds, and sprouts which you add on yourself.3) Snow crab: Was a very decadent dish. Basically a creamy seafood pasta. Flavor was great. Good amount of crab.4) Chicken: The chicken was on a bed of congee that was topped with a mild sweet soy sauce. 5) Pig out for 2: Really decadent dish. Reminiscent of Chinese roast pig with the crispy skin, but more moist and greasy. Came with spicy peanut noodles that I wasn't able to try because of allergies. Friends were fans of it though.6) Broccoli: Really well flavored, but after a few bites felt a little too greasy.7) Rice: The rice was like the sticky rice wrapped in a lotus leaf that you can find at dim sum restaurants! The flavor was delicious because of the duck fat and the kale went surprisingly well, but wish it had a little more meat in it!8) Beignet: Probably the most disappointing dish of the night. Just four pieces of fried bread served with caramel sauce and a side of vanilla ice cream. Wasn't bad, but lacked the innovation and more complex flavor profiles that the other dishes had.- Service: A+Our waitress was SUPER sweet and really attentive.

Complimentary (and pretty tasty) popcorn was provided after we ordered. I chose the chicken liver for my appetizer, the snow crab for my entree, and the beignet ice cream sandwich for my dessert. The chicken liver was delicious and was my favorite part of the meal. It was so creamy, smooth, and buttery, but still had that animal liver taste that people who like liver enjoy. It also came with a sweet syrup, which I thought paired really well with the chicken liver, even though I don't typically like mixing sweet with savory. There were six small slices of bread and my only complaint was that there wasn't enough bread compared to the liver! I only enjoyed about half of the snow crab entree. It got pretty heavy after 10 minutes, but the crab itself was really good and I loved the crunchy texture of the noodles. The beignet ice cream sandwich for dessert was my least favorite part of the meal. The ice cream wasn't anything special and the beignet was quite oily.4/5 experience overall.

I came here for restaurant week and I have been waiting months to come back to this restaurant again!  The first time I tried to get a seat, the wait was too long so I didn't have a chance to try it....this time, I planned ahead and made a reservation.  Food: - HEIRLOOM TOMATO - [RICOTTA, VADOUVAN GRANOLA, BASIL] - This dish was very refreshing.  Tasty, but nothing amazing.  Only ordered this because it sounded better than the 3rd option. - CHICKEN LIVER - [MOUSSE, NY MAPLE, MILK BREAD] - Now, I usually do not like liver because of that iron taste, but this dish was really delicious!  I actually asked my friend to make me a second toast and then we asked for more bed to finish the mousse off!  Definitely try this dish if you have a chance.  - QUAIL - [CLASSIC SOY SAUCE, SMOKED POTATO, MIZUNA] - super tender little bird with a nice reduced soy sauce.  What was best about this dish was that the flavor brought back childhood memories of my grandma's cooking!  That was the best part.  Another dish highly recommended! - PIG OUT (FOR TWO) - [BERKSHIRE PORK, SPICY PEANUT NOODLE, CONDIMENTS] - So this was actually the highlight of the night.  Apparently it takes 3 days to cook this pork.  It has a really nice crisp skin topping.  The pork is shredded and made into a block.  It's paired with grated ginger, hot sauce, and peanut noodles.  Pork is a little big salty, but not unbearable and pairs well with the noodles.  Noodles are cooked al dente and the peanut sauce is very flavorful.  This is a must have if you come eat at Tuome.  Very unique dish that I haven't had anywhere else.  - TAPIOCA - [COCONUT PUDDING, BERRIES, ALMOND] - standard tapioca pudding, nothing special.  - BEIGNET - [ICE CREAM SANDWICH, GOAT'S MILK CARAMEL] - this was pretty good.  It was like a fried bao, crispy and slightly warm and paired with the ice cream.  A little too much breading for me so I just ate one side with the ice cream. Service was great and they explained a lot of the dishes very well.  Glad I got a chance to dine here and I will definitely be coming back to try the other dishes on the menu, and maybe even the pork if I come with a larger party of people.",1,1,1,Teddy C.,"Washington, DC",843,319,746
4.0,8/11/2018,"Tuome is a American restaurant with a Chinese twist in the East Village/ Alphabet City. The food was of higher caliber than your usual fusion restaurant, the service was good (they were short that night) and the ambience was charming and simple (think dimly-lit barely-on Edison bulbs, candles, and dark wooden chairs and tables).We went for our friends' joint birthday dinner. The night was humid and the flash flooding turned some roads into mini river ways. Stepping in the dim restaurant, it took a few seconds for my eyes to adjust and find my party. I was glad to be inside a cool dry restaurant. It happened to be restaurant week; the pricing was similar to Tuome's usual prix fixe and restaurant week's menu gave us slightly more options so we opted for 2018 restaurant week menu.We tried the following:Pig in a blanket- crispy pork cutlet with pickled daikon, capers, and shishito. This was ok. It was a decent crispy pork sandwich.Heirloom tomatoes salad with ricotta, basil and granola- I liked the granola mixed in. It was appetizing and simple. Chicken liver mousse with maple and milk bread- This was the best appetizer out of the three options. The liver was creamy, sweet and very rich. It was magical. I wish I had ordered this dish. Pig out for two- It came in ~ 2 cm x 2 cm cubes with a total of 10 cubes. They looked the traditional Cantonese roast pork but the cubes were made of braised juicy pork compressed into cubes with a tiny square of broiled crunchy pork crackling. It was delicious. It was like a great version of the Chinese roasted pork since this version had perfectly crispy crackling AND juicy pork underneath. Usually the pork is a little dry in the Chinatown version. I enjoyed it. I also love the Chinatown version.Peanut noodles- the noodles were egg noodles al dente with creamy sweet peanut sauce. It was topped with crispy onions. This was really fun to eat.Snow crab noodle- creamy noodles in dashi butter and topped with snow crab meat. The crab meat was delicate tender chunks of snow crab with the rich umami noodles. This was my favorite noodle dish of the night. Rice- this was sticky rice with kale, Chinese sausage and duck fat wrapped in bamboo leaf. This was wonderfully familiar of the zhongzhi of my youth. My grandma used to wrap zhongzhi filled with tiny shrimps, shiitake mushrooms and peanuts. She would lovingly fold in chunks of pork fat to flavor the sticky rice.This version of zhongzhi looked the same with mildly sweet sticky rice in the bamboo leaf. The kale and duck fat were a welcome twist on a classic. The duck fat was aromatic and added a savory butteriness. The kale was softened and tasted sautéed with garlic. I'm not sure my grandma would approve but I really enjoyed the nod to the past and innovative touches. Mac and Cheese- this was good. Creamy pasta shells with curry, parmesan and chives. There was a unique kick to the mac and cheese, which tasted like 5 spices. It was unique and ok.  Dessert:Beignet- this was a crunchy shell with vanilla ice cream. It was ok. I would return for the Pig out, the rice and snow crab noodle. Dessert you can get elsewhere.instagram.com/snackchatn…",10,4,6,Doreen L.,"Queens, NY",1214,1020,7030
3.0,8/9/2018,"We had a delicious dinner for two for Restaurant Week (Summer 2018). It totaled to $42 each for a three course meal. We also ordered drinks - Fire in the Sky ($13) and Blushing Sangria ($13). I'd recommend the FITS over the sangria. For food, we ordered the tonkatsu and the chicken pate for our appetizers followed by the snow crab pasta and chicken porridge for our entrees and ending with ice cream and pudding for dessert. The food was pretty good. My favorites were the pate and the crab pasta by far. The tonkatsu was dry, porridge and ice cream were fine, pudding is very heavy in lactose so be forewarned. Based on the meal, I would've given four stars because the pate and pasta were stellar. But, what made me dock a star and never want to come back is that I was overcharged $3.77 on my total bill, despite giving a fairly standard 18% tip. Now, am I mad at the extra $3.77 - no, I am not - but THIS. IS. STEALING. I don't know how often this happens, but this is morally and legally wrong.",0,0,0,Judy S.,"New York, NY",322,1183,1192

I ordered the set, and my bf ordered an entree so that while we both have our own entrees, we can share appetizer and dessert.Food we've got:Free popcorn: the seasoning is some curry powder and lemongrass; full of flavor, pretty good, but I still love the free popcorn in distilled a tad moreChicken liver: my favorite dish of the night! The bread pieces came warm and crispy, while chicken liver was so smooth. Finished it in matter of minutesSnow crab pasta: good, but nothing spectacular. The noodle is creamy and has a small portion of snow crab meat on top. However, there is not much interaction between the flavors of the crab and the noodles, and the portion of snow crab is really small. So I would not really recommend it.Scallop: scallop tastes good: chewy and flavorful, but the dish is simply three scallops+ few corns, so it did not fill my bf up at all.Coconut rice pudding: another good but nothing spectacular dish. The portion is also very small- we finished it in three spoons.In all, if you ever plan to come, be aware of the small portion of dishes! Also, the restaurant is tiny with little room between tables.

Friends who use their expense accounts to pay for meals at expensive restaurants are THE BEST FRIENDS. Keep them at your side.Anywho, the service was quite low-key but very good at. The place doesn't seat too many people (20-30). There's only one unisex, cramped bathroom. A couple apps, two entrees, two cocktails, a side, tax, and tip came out to $140.So now that we've gotten the boring stuff out of the way, onto the food.It was phenomenal.

2.0,7/8/2018,"Tuome isn't a restaurant as much as it's a place to hang out with friends or bring a date who you don't really care about. There isn't much to distinguish this place from any other gastropub, but Tuome I feel has bought into it's own hype. The stylistic food and subtle tastes does little to make one remember or even want to come back. We were a group of three, saw the place on facebook post, great free advertising, but as we all know everyone on social media lies right? Started with the chicken liver, and the four slices of milk bread that it came with. Great pate, but 4 pieces of one slice of white bread,? really? really? I already knew I was going to be hungry after eating in this place. Had the quail, meh, the finer intricacies elude me after what amounted to eating a hummingbird. Octopus, a slight improvement in taste, still a common flavor profile exists of texture, flavor, counter flavor. Subtle tones of countryside fare?; maybe with enough wine it might taste better? Then had the scallops which were memorable, if only that flavor memory didn't last four bites? Pig out for two was what brought me to the place, so tried it, crunchy, hearty, not a lot of oil, then paired with the peanut noodle absolutely confused my taste buds. The protein was savory, less filing than I'd hoped, but not entirely original, maybe a little bit more chic. Ok so bottom line this place is for people that hate food, folks who just want to be seen eating great food, or people who just wish to overpay for something while sucking down bottles of wine. Come to Tuome for wine, for laughs, for discussions about art and whatever gives your lives meaning but don't come for the food, because there's nothing here that you'll remember, and you'll still be hungry when you leave.

5.0,6/24/2018,"Yes, it is pricey. You're in NYC and you want to dine out at a place that serves really amazing food. You shouldn't be so surprised to pay a little. We had the pig out, broccoli, octopus and snow crab pasta. Between the 3 of us, that was enough food. We were full but didn't get a food coma...so that's a good feeling.If you love octopus, you must get it here. The texture of octopus is 1000% the bestest ever. So soft & subtle with flavors... Then there's aerated mashed potato (!!!) to accompany said amazing octopus. One of the best, if not the best, octopus I've ever had.Lastly, the gold medal goes to (I know, octopus didn't take it) the snow crab pasta. I didn't get a chance to analyze it too much because I slurped it down so fast wanting for more with every bite. I will be back just to eat this dish again.

3.0,5/31/2018,"Boutique shop... courageous idea... Chinese American cuisine!!!See here is the thing with Chinese cuisine. It can range from a mom and pop shop serving the general Tso chicken and fries crab wonton, to high end traditional highly skilled technique dishes; it can be very easy to make Chinese food, but at the same time very easy to screw it up.  The problem with Tuome is that they are right in the middle of that scale.If you never had Chinese food, then Tuome is a good place for you to start. If have Chinese food pretty much throughout your whole life, the. It might be a bit disappointing, which is exactly my case.My wife and I came here on my birthday night. The mocktail and my ale beer is really refreshing pairing with the chicken pate and crispy toast. I would say that is my favorite.The big out (for 2) was a dish I have always wanted to try after watching a YouTube review. My problem with this dish is that the technique is overly complicated. Basically the chef deconstructed the pork belly by pulling the meat out from the pork skin, then put them back together using duck fat to confit the pork meat. To be honest, there is not much of flavor there but a mouthful of duck grease... not at all what I expected.The rice side dish is not bad, but cannot be considered to be delicious. If you have been to dim sum place, the rice with Chinese sausage is way better tasting. I know it might not be fair to compare Chinese American cuisine to traditional Chinese, but when they are making their dishes so similar to the traditional version but lacked the deliciousness and flavor, then it might better just go totally wild to reinvent a traditional dish instead of playing safe.

They do have one dessert each night, which is not on the menu. For us it was chinese donut with vanilla ice cream, citrus, red bean and caramel. How can you go wrong with donut and ice cream?

4.0,3/29/2018,"At least based on our menu selections at dinner the other day, I really would call this place vaguely Chinese at most. Our meal included some very non-Chinese sounding items including deviled eggs, fried chicken sliders on brioche, chicken liver mousse, and striped bass. There were some Asian flavor touches here and there, like the black sesame crisp on the fluke crudo and the amazing broccoli with Sichuan chili, as well as the sticky rice with Chinese sausage. I also had a wonderfully spicy sake cocktail with yuzu and Thai chili called Fire In The Sky... but that's more Thai/Japanese than Chinese, right?But enough about categories. Tuome was categorically tasty so that's all that matters! My favorites were the broccoli, the deviled eggs (turns out when you deep fry something it's usually pretty tasty), and the fried chicken (turns out, a bun is much more tasty when it's absolutely slathered with butter). Though the server was slow with a few things here and there, she was very friendly and was also understanding when we had a late addition to our table. During the meal I was sure that we'd be spending a ton of money, but after two bottles of wine, some other drinks, and lots and lots of plates to share, we were out of there at about $65/person before tip. Not that bad! I also saw that they have a $45/person tasting menu. The space is dim, romantic, trendy, etc, etc... lots of couples dining with quiet conversation on a Saturday night. The manager/owner, not sure which, was very helpful in suggesting another spot in the neighborhood with great cocktails to continue the evening. It's a little fancier than I would choose to go on any old evening, but it was a lovely experience and on my list to recommend to friends for date nights or special occasion meals in the future.",8,4,10,Christina P.,"Culver City, CA",4723,2090,4060

5.0,3/19/2018,"Prices: Pig Out for two $56Deviled Egg appetizer $8I still don't know how you pronounce this place's name, but I enjoyed my dinner here. I made a dinner reservation for two for a Monday night. I probably didn't need to as there were plenty of empty tables when we rolled in for our 8PM reservation. I'm not sure how busy this place gets on the weekend though. If you come here on a Monday to Thursday, you have the option of getting their 3 course prix fixe for $45. It's a pretty good deal given that a single entree already runs around $30. We started with the deviled eggs as an appetizer. It was easily the best deviled egg I've had. They somehow managed to place a delightfully light but crispy crust over the egg white. The yolk came with a touch of chili oil to tie in the Chinese flavor. I was really torn between ordering the snow crab and the Pig Out, but went with Pig Out in the end as it's their most popular dish. I really wish there was a Pig Out option for one so I could've tried both. The dish comes with a bowl of peanut noodles, 5 pieces of pork for each person, and a salad. The noodles had the perfect texture. They were dense and yet still springy. The peanut sauce coating the noodles was reminiscent of the peanut sauce you get to accompany Vietnamese spring rolls. The pork is prepared as a confit in duck fat. The pork itself was super rich and tender.The meat texture fell apart as if it had been shredded and then reassembled. Somehow it oddly held together well enough for me to pick it up with my chopstick despite how it felt like it was falling apart each time I bit into it. I have no idea how they achieved that. Our meat came with a little bottle of pepper sauce and a little bowl of ginger shallot sauce. The pepper sauce added flavor while only throwing in a hint of heat. In all honesty though, the meat had enough flavor on its own that you can eat it plain if you want. The skin on the pork was incredibly crispy. We've eaten our fair share of crispy pork in various Asian dishes, but my husband proclaimed this as the best iteration he's had of it.  Delicious food, intimate atmosphere, and friendly service.

Needless so say we were pretty excited to try it. Came on a Tuesday night, it was pretty empty and service was great. They were attentive and explained every dish that came out as well as answered any question that we had.We started with the fried chicken appetizer, which essentially are two fried chicken sliders with a honey sauce and pieces of daikon. LOVED this!! Can they make a bigger version for half the price? They're small.. but so flavorful and juicy.We also had a side of Brussels sprouts, really enjoyed this as well! The grapes gave it a good balance of flavor. The Berkshire pork which I guess is supposed to be the highlight of the pig out, to be honest fell short. It was oily, the skin was super crispy, and it all just sounds amazing, but sadly this was disappointing. Even with the condiments on the side, it was just okay. I thought it did lacked some flavor, I did really enjoy the arugula and persimmon on the side though. The peanut noodles that it came with was awesome.

I was sure to make a reservation and we were able to be seated right away.We were all pretty hungry, so we decided to split a few dishes:Egg (3.5 stars): These were good, but seemed to be a little less exciting than was expected based on all the ingredients and special preparation.Snow crab (5 stars): Oh. My. Gawd. This. Dish. I don't even know where to begin. I did not even know that I enjoyed snow crab until I had this dish. The crab was so tender and flavorful and paired perfectly with the noodles. This was definitely the best dish of the night.Pig out (4 stars): This was the dish that I expected to shine most. The peanut noodles were definitely 5 stars, but the pork belly was closer to 3 stars as it was overcooked and almost too crunchy to eat. The sauces that it was served with were nice, but they couldn't make up for the lack of tenderness.Rice (5 stars): This is one of the best rice dishes I have ever had. Totally was not expecting the dish to be so tasty and was definitely the most bang for the buck dish of the night.Brussels Sprout (4.5 stars): These were done well--a mostly classic preparation with a few additions that really elevated the dish.Overall, the food here was spectacular and that was despite the underwhelming pork belly that we expected to be the bright spot of the meal. In addition, the service was top notch and super friendly as they let us enjoy a leisurely meal that definitely topped the 3 hour mark. The main downside of this place is that the pricing is a bit absurd as some of the dishes (especially the pig out) are very overpriced. That being said, the quality is worth biting the bullet for a special occasion.",1,0,0,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",746,1843,225
3.0,2/19/2018,"Service left more to be desired. Food was tasty. Overall would recommend trying it out, although it's far from being my favorite ""creative"" / ""hip"" fusion Chinese restaurant.Had an 8:45pm reservation for a party of four on Lunar New Year's Eve. We weren't seated until close to 9:20pm. A friendly host checked in on us intermittently to provide timing updates, but the fact of the matter was that we were not seated until 30 minutes after our reservation time.The waitress was friendly, although there was a period of time towards the latter half of our meal where our water glasses were empty for 20 minutes, and I was really thirsty given how salty one of the dishes was. I wouldn't have minded if it weren't for the fact that there were only a few tables left at the time, so the service could have been more attentive.We ordered the shrimp on chip appetizer, chicken liver with milk bread appetizer, crab noodles with dashi butter, spicy peanut sauce noodles, side of sticky rice, berkshire pork for two, and the chicken two ways with porridge. The shrimp was my least favorite. It didn't taste bad, but the flavors of the shrimp, the chip, seasonings, and creme fraiche did not pair well together. I enjoyed the chicken liver and they gave us extra bread too. Very delicious and would recommend this as a starter dish. The crab noodles had potential to be my favorite dish of the night - I love buttered noodles with seafood. However, this dish came out WAY too salty to enjoy! Same with the spicy peanut noodles. The berkshire pork for two dish was tasty - the meat melted in your mouth, but the portion size is barely made for two. The chicken was my favorite of the night. The dark meat was very flavorful and rich. The breast was cooked sous-vide and not overly dry, and I really enjoyed the ""risotto-like"" base that accompanied the chicken.",0,0,0,Wendy C.,"New York, NY",8,252,471

Pig Out was very one note with its crispy pork belly and spicy peanut noodles.

Going during restaurant week is an amazing deal so hop on it before this season ends and keep an eye out for the next restaurant week. The whole menu was great but the snow crab noodle dish was unlike anything I've ever eaten in my life. Seriously I will be going back purely because that dish was so good. It is so buttery, perfect amount of crab, perfectly cooked fresh noodles. Highly recommend this dish. The atmosphere of the restaurant is super coast and romantic- this would be a really great date spot... low lighting small intimate tables... candle light and a stellar wine list.

4.0,1/29/2018,"Winter Restaurant Week 2018:Stopped in last Fri for a 9pm reservation and the place was totally packed. Many people waiting awkwardly by the front door. They seemed to have trouble getting people seated on time and were giving out champagne to the patient diners. We were seated 20 mins or so after our reservation time, yet weren't offered anything while others who arrived after us were. Hmm.I haven't been a fan of restaurant week in the past because I don't believe places put forth their best effort to discounted diners. Tuome sort of turned me around. I had wanted to try their snow crab noodles with dashi butter for some time and saw this as a perfect opportunity. I was very happy they had it on the RW menu.I had a ""Fire in the Sky"" sake cocktail which was SO good. Gingery. I loved it. Followed by a nice IPA.I had the shrimp appetizer while my BF had the fried chicken sliders. The shrimp was unimpressive and bland. As well as a bit difficult to eat. However the fried chicken sliders were incredible. So crunchy and delicious with a sweet sauce and some pickled daikon on top. I could literally have eaten like 10 more. If I ever go back, I will 100% order these again.The much anticipated snow crab noodles totally lived up to the hype. The noodles were perfectly cooked, had just enough bite. The crab was sweet (though scarce) and the dashi butter was rich and profoundly flavorful. I thought the whole thing tasted like a lobster roll, sweet and buttery. They were a bit heavy but it helped you fill up more. The portion was generous. I would go back for these noodles, but no more than once a year because they were swimming in butter.Beignet dessert was not what I expected but I really enjoyed them. The texture was less like a donut and more like a lobster roll Italian pastry. The ice cream and caramel were good. Not too sweet which I definitely appreciate. It was a nice way to end the meal. Overall, I'd love to go back and try more.",7,3,5,Stephanie M.,"Leonia, NJ",160,251,204

My colleague had been telling me how great this place was, and I was very excited to try it out.The restaurant is on the dimmer, cozier side, and the space itself is not that big. We had the option of doing the $45 weekday prefixe menu (Taste of Tuome) or ordering a la carte off of their regular menu. We opted to do the latter, and were all very pleasantly surprised.Drinks: I ordered the East Village Blossom (refreshingly delicious, not too sweet!) and my friends ordered The Blushing Dragon Sangria and Rare Voss beer. We all ordered the same drinks for our second round, so it's safe to say they were all good.Food: We ordered - Fried Chicken, Chicken Liver, Octopus, Mushroom, Snow Crab, Beef, Pig Out, and a side of Brussels sprouts. Everything was SO GOOD. We all agreed there wasn't a single dish we wouldn't get again. Special shout outs to the Chicken Liver (ask for extra toast!), the Snow Crab (buttery flavored al dente egg noodles topped with snow crab...beautiful marriage), and the Pig Out (juicy Berkshire pork with extra crispy pork with a delicious ginger sauce). Noticing the Asian flair each dish has was fun too. Service: Our server was a young brunette lady and she was quick, friendly, and very knowledgeable. By the end of our meal, we were stuffed and very happy with all that we consumed. The fact that I only live 7 streets away from Tuome is the cherry on top!

4.0,1/4/2018,"Made reservations for 7pm on a weekday but you'll probably be fine without at this time as they had open tables, but they did get packed later in the night. The space is dark and cozy. The entrance is spacious and has a bar and a lot of standing space. The room on the left is where most of the dining tables are. There are two large windows turned bench seating and more tables opposite of it.I came here with a friend and we started with cocktails. I got the fire in the sky and my friend got the blushing dragon sangria. We both enjoyed our drinks though I do think hers had a lot of ice in it. We both got the ""taste of tuome"" which is the 3 course pre-fixe. First, we got the shrimp - the creme fraiche goes really well with the shrimp and the chip adds a nice texture to the mix, but I felt like the shrimp was not flavorful enough even with the spices piled on it. Second, we got the pig out for two - the 10 pieces of pork was super flavorful and the crispy skin on top was cooked to perfection, the side sauces weren't even necessary. It also came with a salad on the side of arugula, persimmons, and walnuts. It also came with bowl of peanut noodles for each of us, which we couldn't finish. The portion looked small, but after eating the pork, it's quite heavy. For dessert we got the beignet (only one option here) where you can build your own little ice cream sandwich. There were four freshly made beignets, ice cream, red bean, goat milk caramel, and citron. I thought the citron was over powering so I avoided that on my second creation.And the service was great!Overall, it was delicious and I'd come back to try the other items.",3,0,2,Connie L.,"New York, NY",38,375,184
3.0,1/3/2018,"Tuome is very small and intimating restaurant with warm and cozy interior. I dined on Christmas day at 6:30pm with my partner. Overall, it was pleasant experience but didn't meet my high expectation since Yelp has such high ratings and great reviews from other people. Food itself is above average - flavorful and creative menu items with Chinese influenced. I really appreciate the menu idea. Even though all the menu has very small portion, I have no complaint on that (it's New York).The best menu item I ordered was brussel sprouts. It was well-seasoned, flavorful, and delicious! Most popular menu - Pig Out was Ok though. It's definitely juicy, has wonderful pork flavor but it didn't WOW me unfortunately. Everyone was talking about this pork dish and maybe I was too hyped to try this dish in New York. Restaurant was packed in Christmas day and food service was quite slow. It seemed like everyone ordered Pig Out for entree so my table had to wait quite awhile for the main dish to come out. We sat right next to the entrance, and it was freezing whole evening when people kept coming in. Again, restaurant is really small and there's no space available between your table and group next to you. It was good dining experience, but it didn't blow me away to have me come back in New York.

And boy have I been missing out! Everything we ate was fantastic! In fact, it was one of the best RW dinners I've had and certainly a most memorable meal of late.For starters, we shared the chicken liver mousse and shrimp tostadas. Both were delightful! The liver mousse was velvety in texture and the combination of the liver and maple syrup was perfect. The tostada was also an interesting dish and certainly piqued my appetite. For the entree we of course had to have the pig out! This is the dish I've so been looking forward to after all. And it was amazing! Perfectly crisp skin and tender pork belly meat along with the condiments, the lychee salad and the peanut noodles.. The entire dish was terrific! Now, the snow crab noodles more than held its own as well. Both my partner and I and our friends all agreed everything was just delicious!

No hassle reservation, warm staff, good food at high-er prices but not to terrible, and cozy restaurant (so note for your bulk winter coats!)  Came here with two gfs on a Tuesday night around 630 (it was busy around 8ish). Come early and take advantage of their happy hour where we got to snack on deviled eggs (not my favorite thing), and shrimp chips with everything bagel type toppings and creme fraiche (very yummy), and a glass of dry Italian red wine for $6! Most items on the HH were around that price, which is such a good deal. For dinner, Mon-Thurs they do a ""Taste of Tuome"" where one could opt to a tasting of 3 courses. They do put most of their greatest hits on this menu which is nice. We decided to just share a bunch of the dishes- all pretty good. Here's the rundown: - Perfectly grilled octopus in XO - Octopus was perfectly grilled but a bit small to share, and the XO butter didn't really shine through. The octopus could have used more flavor as well... -Famous Snow crab noodles - deliciously creamy with a good helping of meat of snow crab. They also take it all out on the shell, which is nice so you eat mess-free -The chicken- so good!! I love a good perfectly cooked, seared chicken. A good chunk of dark and white meat- perfectly salted, crispy on the outside, and juicy on the inside. Served over a stew of rice which was supposed to be like congee.. but kinda not. Wish they added a bit more veggies (think it was bok choy) on this -The lobster for two - incredibly rich. This wasn't my favorite because the sauce was a bit sweet and the chow fun noodles a bit too saturated with that flavor, and it was very rice. The grilled bread as an accompanying item was good. The tripe addition (for flavor) was not my fave and I felt the delicate flavor of the lobster did not go throughAfter food, drinks, tax, tip, came to about $80 ish pp.  Highly recommend the shrimp chips, chicken, snow crab noodles as the home runs here.",8,3,5,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",878,1242,25

My friend watched a youtube video on the making of the Pig Out and got stoked about food that takes over 48 hours to cook.... so of course we ordered it when we got there. I have to say, I don't get it.... I've never been a huge pork fan, but if we're talking ribs, pulled pork, or a pork bun, I'm all in... but the Pig out just wasn't for me...

The tender pork was was fried and seared to perfection and was so delicious! The skin reminded me of pork belly or chicharrone style. It was served with a side of spicy noodles and homemade hot sauce! Last but not least, the watermelon salad. There's just something so perfect about the combination of watermelon, mint and cheese!

5.0,8/9/2017,"I came to Tuome for NY's Restaurant Week last night. It's a small restaurant on E 5th and Avenue B in East Village. I've never heard of it before, but the menu intrigued me. We had a reservation and were seated right away. The restaurant is dim lit and romantic. It's a great date spot! The service is excellent; everyone who helped us was very nice. I ordered the Chicken Liver Mousse to start, which was tasty and a lot creamier than I've had before. Note: The courses were spread out quite a bit, but nonetheless, we were fine waiting. Our entrées came next: Snow Crab w/ Noodles, Squash, and Dashi Butter. This dish was incredible. The noodles were fresh and the flavors were fantastic. It was getting late, so our dessert was packed to go. I have not tried my Berry Tart, but it looked great. The prices here are a bit steep, outside of restaurant week, but I really enjoyed my experience.",0,0,1,Lindsey S.,"New York, NY",354,276,199

4.0,7/30/2017,"Came here for restaurant week per a friend's recommendation!I was way too early and was the first patron there when the restaurant opened. However, I was greeted with warm welcomes and seated once I gave my reservation name.Once my friend arrived, we looked over the menu and decided on the Shrimp (on chip, smoked creme fraiche, everything spice) and Heirloom Tomato (Crispy Farro, Watermelon, nam phrik). The Shrimp came in a set of two's so my friend and I each had one while the Heirloom Tomato came in a bowl so I just took a couple bites. Out of the two, I loved the Shrimp a lot more than the Heirloom Tomato probably because I'm a big fan of seafood and loved the way the smoked cream fraiche complements the shrimp. If you're looking for something more refreshing, this is definitely the one for you but if you prefer something more soup-like, you'll probably like the Heirloom Tomato more.For our main course, my friend and I chose the Pig Out for Two (Berkshire Pork, Peanut Noodles, Sambal). It was a lot heavier than we were expecting so my friend and I each ate a max of 3 pieces before we decided to doggy bag the rest. I can't say this agreed with my palate due to the strong pork taste and I'm usually not big on meat. However, the outside skin was crispy but it's not something I'd eat solo without any sort of complements. I felt the peanut noodles was perfect to balance out the flavor.Finally, dessert was a choice between Berry or Beignet. I love fruit tarts so I had to get the Berry (Tart, Mascarpone Cream and Basil Seeds). It wasn't too sweet -just the way I like it!  The basil seeds were a nice addition with the mascarpone cream tying the entire mix together. Definitely give this a try.I would return to Tuome again for sure but I don't think I'd come during restaurant week or order the Pig for Two. The table next to us also took their leftover order home so it can be shared between 3 people rather than two. There are other items on the menu I'd like to try including Snow Crab and Chicken. It's the perfect place for that catch-up, reunion, or date.See you soon, Tuome!",2,0,0,Kelly Y.,"New York, NY",144,162,281

Overall ambiance was chic, yet comfortable and friendly.The food was absolutely delicious. We had the deviled eggs and scallops to start. Both were light but enough to get a good taste.

We were told to get an appetizer, main, and side per person (for 2 people) but found that to be too much food. The portions were really generous. We started with the chicken liver which was so delicious. It was so smooth and spreadable, with a ton of flavor and topped with a bit of honey. We also got the deviled eggs which definitely had an Asian inspired twist. Good but not amazing. For our first main we got the snow crab noodles. Definitely a must try. They're made with a dashi butter that gives it a super rich umami taste but it didn't fall apart or get too heavy like some cream based pastas do. The other main was the chicken, which was a big plate of crispy and seared chicken on top of a really yummy bed of rice. We only got one side which was the broccoli. Again pretty Asian inspired. It was steamed broccoli so it's light but there was a miso-like flavor to it.",2,0,1,Jordan J.,"Manhattan, NY",106,72,147

5.0,5/19/2017,"I would unequivocally endorse Tuome as a stellar meal and one of the best I've had in a while. Every dish I got was a hit and essentially I am only evaluating degrees of greatness. I came with a friend and we ate our way through a sizeable chunk of the menu and both of us were very satisfied. Our opening appetizers were the chicken liver mousse and the octopus. The mousse was topped with a bit of maple syrup and was accompanied by some fried onions, salt, and a seed that I believe was sunflower. These three were placed on the side and entirely optional additions to be combined with the mousse. Milk toast was the delivery vehicle for the mousse. The flavors were great and I loved the salty sweet combo with the addition of the syrup. Our waitress even checked in and provided us more toast when we ran out. The octopus might be my favorite dish of the night especially with a string of weak offerings at other restaurants. Beautifully cooked with just the right balance in texture so it wasn't too mushy but not too chewy either. The pork xo was the highlight, fulfilling all my salty umami desires. Paired together with the fingerling potato spread? Sauce? Just made it even better. For mains we had the beef and the pig out for two. The beef was a gorgeous medium rare, sauces included a butter nut squash puree and what I believe was a bearnaise sauce as well as a bordelaise sauce. A crispy sunchoke and mushrooms accompanied. It was delicious. Pigout for two was my other contender for best dish of the night. I have tried to guess how exactly the pork was done and my conclusion is that they did a Berkshire pork confit that they built back into cubes. Then made the crispiest much beautiful pig skin I've ever seen to layer back on top so you end up with beautiful cubes. Hoisin sauce on the bottom, just enough for a bit of flavor. Then served with a ginger scallion sauce and a sweet chili sambal. This pork was amazing and might be my favorite pork dish of the year. The peanut noodles were also great. Just enough spiciness for flavor, a not too thick but still peanuty sauve and nice springy noodles. There was also a walnut and pineapple arugula salad. Good for contrast from the heaviness of the pork. As a side we also got the rice which was sticky rice, Chinese sausage (lap cheung), and kale wrapper in a lotus leaf and steamed. You've probably seen something similar at dim sum places. This was better than any I've had state side. Lastly was dessert. They served fried mantou with citron lemon marmalade, vanilla ice cream with red bean on top, and caramel sauce. You build your own sandwich with the freshly fried mantou. The mantou was made even better versus traditional ones as the chef managed to layer the dough so it ended up a bit like a croissant. Phenomenal restaurant and definitely worth a visit. I will note my friend and I came fairly early with a 6pm reservation and likely managed to monopolize the kitchen's attention for a good while so that likely helped.",0,0,0,Hamilton Y.,"Manhattan, NY",3,51,2

5.0,5/15/2017,"I came here for Winter '16 Restaurant Week and am so glad I did. Writing this review makes me want to come back here, because the food was incredible unique, satisfying and worth every dollar.I got the following:Appetizers: Watermelon Ricotta Salad, Fluke Crudo with Squid Ink CrispsMain Dish: Pig Out for Two - fried pork belly, peanut noodles and condimentsDessert: Deep Fried Buns with Vanilla Ice creamI'm not sure if these specific appetizers are still available after checking their site, but be prepared to be shockingly surprised with how they uniquely pair simple ingredients. The appetizers act as great introductions to the main plates that are heeavvyy, so they're great refreshers on your tastebuds!I will never say no to pork belly, ever. I practically grew up on Korean BBQ and pork belly is  practically flowing in my veins so any time it's available on the menu, count it ordered. That being said, Pig Out for two is outstanding. Not only is it hefty cuts, but the meat is fried in a way that the top layer (skin) is thick, crunchy and so freaking satisfying on your mouth that although it's meant for two, you will steal the other half. Other half which is the actual meat has a good consistency. The dish might be a little too salty and drying without the condiment/salad pairing (which is personal preference) but the overall experience beats minor details. It also comes with side bowl of sweet, rich/dense peanut noodles for each person. To top it all off, dessert consisted of fried buns + vanilla icecream. Honestly I felt like this was one of those 'final meals' you choose before death-- probably from being too full but certainly happy.",0,0,0,Veronica B.,"Manhattan, NY",603,41,90
3.0,5/13/2017,"3.5 to be fair.We decided not to do their tasting ($45 for 3 courses), as we really wanted to try the snow crab noodles and pork for 2 entrees. We thought we wouldn't have enough food, but were overwhelmingly full by the end of the meal. Both dishes were extremely rich and heavy. Thus, I would recommend getting either one of the dishes and pairing it with something lighter.The snow crab noodles was buttery, rich and heavenly. Generous chunks of crabs were sprinkled across the chewy noodles that were drenched in a creamy, buttery sauce. Absolutely a must-order!I didn't really enjoy the pig out for 2 as I thought it was overwhelmingly oily. The pork reminded me of the roast pork at a Chinese restaurant. However, the meat was a bit unusual as it was shredded and mushed together, topped with the super oily/crispy pig skin. I couldn't handle eating more than 2 pieces of this pork. I appreciated the balance of a salad that came with the dish (loaded with refreshing pineapples chunks and walnuts), while the spicy peanut noodles was too heavy to compliment the pork.In all, I think my review is a bit bias as I only had 2 dishes and the pig out for 2 was just too much for my liking.",0,0,0,Jennifer C.,"New York, NY",168,165,1433

We didn't come for restaurant week but RW is quite a steal for a place as good as this!For the app, we got the octopus with pork xo, brown butter, and fingerling potatoes. Fat piece of octopus tentacle that paired amazing with the pork XO sauce with bits of bacon and pine nuts, which also paired nicely to the fingerling potatoes that came as a really smooth creamy purée. Every bite was delicious and while not a huge portion, it was just right because of the strong flavors and textures. The only suggestion I have for this dish is for the octopus to be a bit more charred! I would have preferred a more smoky/burnt taste on the octopus.For the main, I got the red snapper with manila clam and leek that was served in a milky broth table-side while my boyfriend got the beef with sunchoke, shallot confit, and mushroom. The fish was cooked to perfection and I slurped up every last bit of that milky (but not creamy) clam soup!! I have not ever had a fish dish served like this and omg it was a party in my mouth. A very light and tasty main. My boyfriend's beef was super tender and also went well with its accompaniments.

5.0,2/4/2017,"** Restaurant Week 2017 Review ** Tuome has been on my life since last Summer's Restaurant Week. I had reservations last summer with a coworker but we both ended up canceling. This year, we decided to try our best to make it happen! We arrived on a Monday night a little bit early for our reservation, but was seated right away. We both pretty much already knew what we were going to get - the goal was to order two different appetizers and desserts and split them. We ended up ordering their Deviled Eggs off the regular menu. The Deviled Eggs are fried and topped with chili, which was a nice departure from your traditional Deviled Eggs. Highly recommended! For appetizers, we split the the Beef Tartare with wagyu beef, three hour yolk, and lemongrass and the Chicken Liver Mousse with New York maple and milk bread. I honestly thoroughly enjoyed both appetizers and could not tell you which one I liked more. The beef tartare was fresh and meaty while the chicken liver mousse was smooth and both sweet and salty at the same time. They're both so good! For our entrees, we both ended up ordering their famous Snow Crab noodles, which comes with a squash and dashi butter sauce. These noodles...my God. The noodles themselves were cooked perfectly - super bouncy and al dente. They definitely do not skimp on the snow crab at all, there was so much crab! Together, the crab and dashi butter sauce so was flavorful but yet light at the same time. The portion size is very generous as well. I would definitely come back JUST for these noodles! For dessert, we split both RW options - a deconstructed banana ""pie"" with bananas, malted cream, and goat's milk caramel and the Beignets ice cream sandwich with persimmon jam. First of all, the ice cream in both desserts was super iced. How was it so hard?! The ""pie"" cream was really good, but I wasn't a huge fan of the cracker/""pie"" crust. The beignets were very tasty and hit the spot as the sweet component of the night. Service was attentive without being overbearing. I really enjoyed my meal at Tuome and will definitely be back outside of Restaurant Week. I'd love to try their Pig Out for Two with crispy pork belly.

4.0,2/3/2017,"This was on my list of places that I've wanted to try for awhile, and I finally made it here for Restaurant Week. Besides for the fact that some of the tables were really close together (I was this close to inviting myself to go on a trip to DR with the girls sitting at the table next to me while I was waiting for my friend to show up) everything else was great. Like I said, I showed up a little before my friend, and they sat me right away. The place wasn't filled yet, but by the time we left there were a few people waiting around to be sat.  While I was waiting I browsed the RW menu and the regular menu.  The one thing I wish I had tried off the regular menu was the deviled eggs, but that just gives me an excuse to go back.  We stuck with the RW menu, and ordered the tartare and butternut squash soup to start, the lamb for two, and there were two desserts so that made it easy, we got the beignet ice cream sandwich and banana.  I also ordered the east village blossom (brut rose, hibiscus, blood orange) and it was pleasantly sweet, but not too sweet.  They brought out an amuse bouche to start, which was some whipped ricotta with everything (bagel) seasonings on top, and served with some home made root vegetable chips.  So good, I could have eaten a lot more of that, but it definitely a nice way to start off the meal.  Next they brought the tartare, with a 3 hour yolk in the middle, and it looked so good!  I'm somewhat new to eating tartare, I really only stuck to raw fish before, and this tartare didn't disappoint. Next up they brought the butternut squash soup, and boy was it good.  I imagine there was lots of cream in it, but I did not care, it tasted great.  The lamb came out and it was served with red quinoa and bibb lettuce wraps. The lamb was so tender it just fell off the bone.  It was fun to make little tacos with the lettuce wraps, and the portion was huge and wound up taking some home, since we didn't want it to go to waste!  I do not like banana, and even though my friend insisted it would be easy to avoid I skipped the banana dessert.  It was like a deconstructed banana cream pie, and it must have been good since my friend polished it off.  The beignet ice cream sandwiches were good, but nothing special I would say.  Definitely a nice way to end the meal though.   Overall I enjoyed my meal here. The service was good, with our waiter being attentive, but not too attentive. The food as I said was all very good. I would definitely come back, and get some of those deviled eggs!",7,5,5,Rachel W.,"Manhattan, NY",284,202,541
5.0,2/2/2017,"Tried this place last night, as they participate in Restaurant week, and wow what great food and great experience. Staff was all incredibly knowledgeable and friendly. Got seated by a gentleman who was very friendly, accommodating and helped sell the experience for us. The wait staff made great drink and food recommendations (the lamb is  MUST-TRY), and the chef made his rounds and was friendly and polite, and in my opinion one of the next David Chang-esque NYC restauranteers.It's a small, dim place with a cozy feel. There are too many restaurants in manhattan that have huge signs with average food. This place has no real sign out front, but lures people in with their creative, amazing dishes with great flavor. Very unpretentious but amazing food and service. You'd be crazy to not try this place out at least once when in the alphabet city area.",2,0,1,James G.,"Manhattan, NY",150,84,1
3.0,1/31/2017,"It's not you, It's me.  That little Seinfeld-ism just about sums up the first two courses I had here as part of Winter Restaurant Week.  Because you see, the food was nicely executed. It really was.  But I realized once and for all that I am just not a New American cuisine sort of girl.   Incorporating global ingredients and techniques with farm-to-table American cooking sounds lovely in theory.  But for me, the end result is often muddled.  Even boring.Case in point: My Waygu Beef Tartare with Lemongrass & Three Hour Yolk.  I got a few hints of lemongrass as I ate this, but that was about it in terms of flavor.  Plus all I kept thinking was, ""Wtf is three hour yolk anyway? Because this just tastes like random raw egg to me.""   Friend got Butternut Squash Soup with Coconut Foam & Chive Oil.  I will concede that this was good.  Delicious even.  Okay, yeah. I experienced a bit of dish envy with this one. As for our mains, my friend and I decided to share the Lamb for Two, which consisted of Lamb Shank & Red Quinoa with Lettuce to create wraps.  The Lamb was nice & tender.  All the ingredients were perfectly cooked.  But had the company not been so engaging, I would have been bored.  Very, very bored.  If there were Asian influences in this dish--and the  kitchen supposedly incorporates them-- I just wasn't feeling it.  The subtlety must've gone way over this uncouth girl's head. The Dessert Course is where this meal really went off the rails for me.  Banana:  ""Pie,"" Malted Cream & Goats Milk Caramel -- The ""Pie"" component of this dish turned out to be some sort of shortbread that was so hard my friend and I could have used a mallet to help us cut into it. (Note to self:  When a restaurant puts quotations around a menu item, as with ""Pie,"" in this case, think twice.)Beignet: Ice Cream Sandwich, Persimmon Jam -- I didn't get this one at all.  It presented more like small profiteroles, not beignets, with some utterly forgettable ice cream in the middle. This final disappointing course was total affirmation of my longstanding belief that restaurants should offer diners the option of ordering wine or beer instead of dessert during RW.  'Cause I'll eat dessert if it's put in front of me, but I'll rarely order it in a restaurant.  At any rate, it's saying something that I barely touched either of these, nor did my friend.Big shout out to the host, who so graciously offered to store the chopped liver I'd just purchased from nearby Russ & Daughers in the fridge for me.  Ditto to our lovely server who retrieved it.  Props also for the lively, happy vibe this little spot gave off.  Place definitely packs 'em in on a Friday night.  So I am clearly an outlier with regards to the food.  What can I say?",1,0,1,Yael D.,"Brooklyn, NY",133,572,1877
3.0,1/30/2017,"We came by for restaurant week on a Sunday. Normally Tuome is not open on Sundays and we had a number of service & timing issues that maybe were due to having different or incomplete staff for the day? Our meal started with an amuse bouche, which was vegetable chips and a ricotta dip. While I can't eat ricotta, my friends said it tasted like nothing so I was not missing out. While waiting for our first course (for a while) they came around with lamb dumplings and mentioned they had some dim sum dishes in celebration of Chinese New Year. The lamb dumpling was absolutely perfect but unfortunately the only outstanding item of the meal. For my meal, I had the beef tartare to start. The tartare has a sweeter profile and adding some salt helped a lot for me. While waiting for our second course (again for a while), they came around with langoustine spring rolls, which were fine but not anything notable. For the main course, I had the chicken with porridge. The chicken was nicely cooked (sous vide) but there was nothing unique flavorwise about the dish for me. I tried a bite of my friends' pig out (pork belly & peanut butter noodles) and it was decent, though a bit rich for my tastes. On the drink side, we did a bottle of the syrah they have by the glass and it was really nice. Overall, Tuome is a solid good but not great restaurant for me.",1,0,0,Justine M.,"New York, NY",8,33,7

5.0,1/29/2017,"What a stellar experience. First and foremost, big thank you to one of my best friends, Wilson Chu, for picking this restaurant and treating me for my birthday. Unforgettable night. The restaurant itself is fairly dim, and immediately places you in an alcove of sorts. Service was pretty good, props to the tall male bartender for being very attentive to us while we waited by the door to be seated. Same goes to our waitress, whom I totally forgot what she looked like or said due to how overwhelmingly flavorful each and every dish was. If you've ever encountered good food, and each bite resulted in you closing your eyes and just saying mmm. Well, I pretty much ate in the dark, eyes wide shut for 2 hours. We had pretty much a taste of the menu, ranging from the foie gras and brussel sprouts to the snow crab noodles and pig out. I strongly suggest the foie gras and snow crab noodles. The foie gras melts on your tongue, and is served with a crunchy crisp made from buckwheat. The crab noodles are lavished with crab sauce and butter, and packs a savory delight with a light amount of crab meat blended into the noodles.Awesome adventure for taste buds.

1.0,1/28/2017,"While I was very excited about eating at this restaurant tonight, I am very disappointed. After reading apparently an ""ad"" in Gothamist talking up Chinese New Year spots to celebrate, I was keen to try Tuome. The Gothamist ad listed this restaurant as a spot to that would have a special Dim Sum menu to celebrate the new year. Turns out, the ""special "" dim sum menu was simply two separate dim sum plates brought around, off the menu, by servers, at random moments throughout the meal. There was no menu stating what the special dishes were. This was deceptive advertising at its finest. I am deeply disappointed with Tuome and Gothamist for this bait and switch.

It was certainly a great experience and I recommend checking it out if you're in the area and looking for a funky gastronomic adventure. RIGHT OFF THE BAT, I recommend you opt to share everything because there are too many interesting dishes to try and I would have regretted getting one entree to myself. The pig out for two ($52) was the star of the show. The pork was perfectly crispy and paired well with the tangy arugula and spicy peanut noodles on the side. It's also pretty huge and can be split amongst more than just 2 people. I would argue that the peanut noodles are the best I've ever tried. Other things we got that are also amazing - Brussels Sprouts, Maitake Mushrooms, Sticky Rice, and Octopus. Of these, I think the standouts included the potatoes that came with the Octopus (came in a puree from a SPRAY CAN, like the ones you use for whipped cream. AMAZING), and the sticky rice served in a leafy wrap of some kind. Perfectly sticky with just the right amount of sweet. Also the tunes here were ON POINT.

It feels very intimate so it's great for dates or just hanging out with friends. Cocktails were super yummy - I tried the Yuzu, Thai chili and sake one. Beef tartare was good, but nothing mind blowing. Still worth trying if you like wagyu beef. Definitely get the sliders with brioche, the entire thing just literally melts in your mouth and is so incredibly flavorful. The portion size is perfect because you get enough to satisfy you and enjoy the flavors, and it's also quite filling.We tried the cobria and snow crab pasta. The cobria is kind of subpar; I would skip on this dish. You get virtually no fish for the price, and the flavor of the broth is just average. Not well executed at all and it was my least favorite dish. The snow crab is AMAZING. I'm not an Italian food/pasta person at all and I really liked this dish. The noodle texture is so chewy and tastes almost like it's handmade. The best part though is hands down the sauce - it is literally the perfect balance of flavor. I do wish they gave more actual seafood for the price tho. Overall - I do recommend this place, although I would keep the price of the dishes in mind when ordering.

It sort of reminded me the crispy pork that I have once had in Hong Kong, only that the crust was more crispy - you have to dip it into the sweet chili sauce! The Brussel sprouts, on the other hand; was somewhat disappointing - the blue cheese scent was so strong that it completely overwhelmed the whole taste. Not a cheese person myself, I would suggest to skip the course. Their cocktail selection was rather limited, yet I did like my East Village Blossom - the blood orange flavor was just at the right level, making the whole drink a bit fruity.

The tables are a little on the smaller side, and quite close to each other, but that's normal for this neighborhood.A couple of minor complaints included a 25 minute delay in getting seated (we had a reservation), and the chill on your back if you're sitting at the window (double glazing would be nice).",0,0,0,Sid L.,"New York, NY",14,37,28

2.0,10/5/2016,"Not very often do I write reviews on Yelp unless the experience was mind blowing and amazing or if I feel like i've been completely fleeced.Unfortunately, Tuome falls more toward the latter portion of my rationale. The service itself wasn't bad and it seemed like a typical hipster joint where the waitstaff are covered in tattoos and looked like they just got out of the L train which isn't necessarily a bad thing since i've been to plenty of good hipster joints.Unfortunately i can't critique much on the wine since i can't drink temporarily (which really blows), but the food i have to say was for the most part underwhelming. IN their defense, the first course which i guess was their version of a petit fourish entry actually wasn't bad which ended up being this pureed parsnip i believe that was very nice left a good after taste.The octopus was pretty well cooked and the fingerling potato foam was rather creative, so its clear that the chef was certainly employing a Ferran Adria El Bulli type of approach with visual representation and having your mind believe one thing while in reality its completely different.Now comes the nay saying.For the deviled egg's i appreciate the valiant effort with the seemingly thai/viet flavor infusion of what i generally think is a rather mundane dis, but I could not get over how salty it was an how is lacked a kick that i would expect from those kind of flavor ethnic profiles.Most disappointing of all was the pig for two. For one, yes for about $52.00 to get i believe it was 10 pieces of berkshire pork is not the worst in pricing, but for such a quality ingredient it honestly fell far too short and it seems like presentation on top of a flat piece of slate was of more concern than the dish taste it self.The recommend sauce combination was a good start, but it wasn't enough to bring out the best in berkshire pork. Honestly if you braised or slow cooked for 15 hours, then why was the pork it self so bland?  The good news is you can tell the pork is quality since there wasn't a single hint of swine taste, but you can honestly do much better than this especially since asian flavors can be so aggressive and should be more aggressive. The pork itself needs to be much better, and some parts of it was rather dry too.Finally there was the desert consisted of an chinese style beignet with caramel and vanilla ice cream and marmalade.  The beignet it self was not bad, but if you are going to use vanilla ice cream, please avoid using haagen daas and just make your own.. its not so hard to do and would take the dessert so much further.It was worth a shot, but for the money, I can think of better places that will cost less and taste good without trying to be to showy in presentation.",2,0,0,Alex L.,"Brookfield, CT",115,20,1

4.0,8/31/2016,"Restaurant week Summer 2016 review:Presentation is pretty. Space is cozy with exposed brick. The drinks are strong and well crafted. Food is rich in flavor and hearty. Lots of focus on heartier and buttery flavors, which was a bit heavy for the summertime. My favorite dish is the crab noodle. Noodles tastes hand-made and lots of snow crab meat. Their version of a deviled eggs is closer to a scotch egg. It is definitely modern pan-asian with Italian influences, but different than the new Japanese-Italian pasta trend. Highly recommend for a special date, but when ordering, strike a balance amongst the dishes ordered so not to be left with all too rich tasting dishes.",1,1,1,Lisa Y.,"Elmhurst, NY",58,135,232
3.0,8/30/2016,"Came here with a friend for restaurant week. We had a last minute reservation for 6 (which is when the place opens up). The ambiance is very nice and romantic (there are little candles on each table). Ice cold water in a glass are the first things that were brought out along with the menu. Then we were brought complimentary starter: golden beet on top of yogurt. It was a cute presentation but I wasn't a fan of the mix of flavors.I tried the chicken liver mousse with maple syrup and toast. It was my first time trying liver...and I'm not a fan. So I mostly ate the small pieces of toast. When the server saw that we were out of bread, they offered to get us another plate of toast (on the house!). The snow crab noodles with danish butter and butternut squash could have been the only thing I ordered and it would have been enough. It's very heavy but also super delicious! I would come back just to order this. Beignets (tasted liked fried mantous) with chocochip ice cream was a nice way to end the meal. As the night went on, servers were not as attentive as earlier in the evening but that's because it was a full house. Servers still replaced our empty bottle of water with a new one and came by to refill our glasses with water.",0,0,0,Hui L.,"Woodside, NY",51,465,1301

We both love pork, must be in our blood.  The pork belly was cooked I think the waiter said  it was baking for 15 hours and it literally melted in your mouth.  We have four little pieces left sitting in our fridge...that's going to be tonight's late night snack.   Once again RUN to Tuome.",0,0,1,Judy C.,"Brooklyn, NY",39,240,9

If you aren't vegetarian, definitely order this. It's the best pork belly I've ever had and I usually don't like pork belly since it's usually too fatty for me. It's large cubes of layered fat and meat sandwiched between amazingly crispy skin. It comes with really good noodles in peanut sauce. The noodles are perfectly thick and chewy, and the sauce isn't too sweet. Branzino - Nice crispy skin.

5.0,8/6/2016,Absolutely delicious meal in a small cozy atmosphere. I came for restaurant week with friends. We all started with the watermelon sangria. It tasted like candy although I couldn't taste the actual wine and the portion looked like a regular class of wine even with the 4 ice cubes in it - pretty tiny for the price. We got a bottle of wine instead after. I had the fluke to start - so fresh and light with a great flavor profile.  I then had the show crab pasta dish without dairy ( they were able to custom make this for me) I honestly don't know how they made it so delicious. One of the best pastas I've ever had. The snow crab was cooked perfectly and was a decent portion. My friends had the snow crab made with butter which they said was delicious and the pig out for two. The pig out for two is pork soaked in duck fat for 15 hours and it looks incredible. My friends confirmed it was. Dessert they had beignet ice cream sandwiches which they could make without ice cream and a chocolate tart. The beignet was delicious so airy yet rich. I would highly recommend.,1,0,0,Jessica B.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",241,235,626

5.0,7/30/2016,"Oh Tuome. It seems like just yesterday that I read Pete Wells's enchanted review about your intrigue, your splendor and your creativity. I've walked past your heavenly gates dozens of times in my life but have never had an occasion to step inside and stay awhile. But thank the good god of all things epicurean, all that fantasy became reality on Wednesday night. Tuome was simply divine and if you're willing to shell out a bit extra for a special meal, please come here.Tuome is fantastic for splurging for a special occasion. Such was our experience Wednesday night. Special occasions of any kind get me very excited. Doesn't matter if we're celebrating for me or for someone else--celebrating means bountiful food. Trust me, I have my priorities straight. In any case, the space is cozy, simple and elegant. They don't need to go bonkers with the decor here though--the food is loud enough on its own. The menu here is quite small, but that should not be mistook for a negative. I actually prefer small menus for several reasons. First, the glutton in me always wants to try as many dishes on the menu as possible. Fewer options, more of the menu can be covered. And fewer decisions to be made. But more importantly, at a critically-acclaimed restaurant like Tuome, I interpret the small menu to mean that serious thought and care goes into each dish. I'd rather a chef cook a handful of things to perfection than try his or her hand at an unnecessarily expansive with just a ""pretty good"" ceiling. The dishes at Tuome are inventive but the menu doesn't give much away. But again, I'd rather the description be vague and the food tell the story any day. Drink-wise, I can only speak to the beer/cocktail offerings. They offer a small but solid collection of beer (I went with the Tripel Karmeliet because when am I not going to get a Belgian Tripel?) as well as some wine-based cocktails. I typically only order liquor-based cocktails but I figured I might as well ask about them. After hearing about the general spice of most of the drinks, I gave the Fire in the Sky (sake, Thai chili, yuzu) a go. Because...Thai Chili. Refreshing, spicy and super yummy (see picture). We knew we were in for a magical night after receiving our amuse, which was a delicious pickled baby beet--a delicious pickled baby beet that did exactly what an amuse should do: perk up the palette, get a bunch of the tastebuds involved, and give us a little preview of how tasty and creative our meal was going to be. And while it'll be hard to put it into words, I'm certainly going to try. Beef Tartare: Wagyu beef, three-hour yolk, lemongrass: A+Just look at that majestic picture. The yolk is served atop the fluffy beef and you get to stir that baby in yourself. This dish comes with broccoli chips for your scooping pleasure and to add a little crunch to the mix. This dish is light but still uber flavorful and is a fantastic starter for a meal that is bound to get richer as you get deeper into the menu. Quack on Brioche: Duck confit, daikon relish: A++I don't even know what to say here. Whatever the chef does to make this duck taste so good, well, I don't even want to know. This is a serious flavor bomb. Take your time with these two sliders because they'll be gone in 15 seconds if you're not careful. These are rich, flavorful and utterly perfect.Watermelon w/ ricotta, farro, crysanthemum: AWhat a gorgeous, creative dish. Aesthetically stunning. The watermelon, as it always is, was sweet and refreshing but paired really nicely with the farro which brought some interesting earthiness to the dish. The crysanthemum added a teensy hint of bitterness to round out this thoughtful dish. Octopus w/ pork xo, brown butter, fingerling potato: A+Sometimes I don't know what I did to deserve so much good octopus in my life. And Tuome gives me yet another octopus dish to rave about. Cooked perfectly, this octopus is served with some delicious and delightful ""potatoes"" which are ""served"" right in front of you. The quotations are due to these particular potatoes being foamed out of some fun gastronomic contraption as the dish is served. My one issue with this dish--which I often have with octopus appetizers--is the actual amount of food one gets for the price. Feels a little stingy. But that's a minor complaint. Snow crab w/ noodle, summer squash, dashi butter: A+Honestly, this dish was almost too rich. The dashi butter was just verging on overpowering but I still inhaled everything. Snow crab, along with octopus, is one of my very favorite foods. This was almost like if that bomb Thai dish you love got a series Princess Diaries makeover and you could still kind of tell the original was there but otherwise DAYUM. Pretty sure my eyeballs were popping out while eating this. Share it with someone who's willing to take the plunge with you.",6,6,5,Molly T.,"New York, NY",887,463,1480
5.0,7/29/2016,"I came here with my family for my birthday and everyone was very impressed with the food. The presentation of the dishes are beautiful. I wish I took a few pictures because they were some of the best presentations I've seen. Everything we had was exceptionally good. My favorites were the deviled eggs, grilled octopus, pig out and the noodles in the crab dish. The peanut noodles that comes with the pig out tasted good but the sauce was a bit too thick for me. All the food is very rich and flavorful so it's a good place to share dishes because eating a whole plate of one dish may be too much, flavor wise. The combinations of flavors were amazing though. Very unique dishes, great presentation, nice atmosphere, delicious food. It's a little expensive but not ridiculously expensive and I think it's worth the money to try some of these dishes. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that's into trying new foods, it's not a place for people with baby taste buds who only eat chicken tenders and french fries.",0,0,1,Jim15ratm ..,"Nyack, NY",24,33,2
4.0,7/29/2016,"Super cute and cozy little restaurant down a quiet st. in Alphabet City. One of the few restaurants that's worth the walk. My husband and I went with the deviled eggs and the pig out. Both were delicious. The pig out is unlike anything I've ever tasted. Tender and juicy meat with a crunch factor that reminds you of bacon, but without the bacon flavor. It was delicious. The service however was a little off. We went right when it opened (with no res) and were the only people in the restaurant, and of course the women had to scroll through her ipad for a few moments to make sure they could seat us, we then just opted for the bar. When we left an hr and 15 minutes later there was only one other table. So why all the scrolling through the ipad to see if they could seat us remains a mystery. Despite the restaurant being literally empty, no one came to check on us during the meal and our beers were empty. Also, they really need to improve their beer selection. It is small with only one selection of each type of beer like pale ale, IPA etc etc. But the white ale they have is $12 which is crazy. Pick a beer that you can sell for $8 or something. Overall though the food and coziness of the restaurant make this a spot I definitely want to come back too.",0,0,0,Brooke U.,"Gramercy, Manhattan, NY",6,33,38

2.0,7/12/2016,"I was part of a group of six that dined here on a Friday night with an 8pm reservation to celebrate a birthday. After we finished the first 3 appetizers we ordered, the busboy cleared our plates, and then the fourth appetizer was brought to the table some time later. It was awkward to eat without individual plates, but no biggie. Then, the wait for entrees was about 40 minutes past the time we finished the appetizers, which is obviously too long but we were having a nice time so we let it go. They really dropped the ball when the entrees came out. First they brought the pig for 2 entree, and nothing else. It was a five minute wait before they brought one more entree. It was over five more minutes before they brought the last of the entrees. That's over ten minutes to get 6 entrees out, leaving people to sit there politely waiting to start eating until everyone got their food. Of course, food wasn't hot when it came time eat it, and nobody offered much of an apology either. I don't think this was the fault of the server, but rather an overwhelmed and/or disorganized kitchen. Unfortunately, the fact that the food was delicious did not overcome the awkward delays in getting food to the table. I thought it was unfortunate given the quality of the food, but so be it.",0,0,0,Adam S.,"Manhattan, NY",2,33,0
2.0,7/9/2016,"I REALLY wanted to like Tuome but it fell short of my expectations. Everything was wayyy too salty. I ordered the special for the day- soft shell crab appetizer and the pig out for 2. That with one glass of beer, our total came out to $94 something. The soft shell crab was crispy but, like I mentioned, too salty.  The pork was overcooked so it was dry and greasy. The noodles were delicious but the peanut sauce on it was also salty. If you've ever been to the fishball rice noodle cart in Chinatown on Canal and Centre St outside of the train station...the peanut sauce tastes exactly like theirs minus a hint of spice.",0,0,1,Loretta A.,"Staten Island, NY",34,35,31

We each started with a drink. Honestly, each one we ordered I would order for myself but my favorite was the one I chose, which was the Fire in the Sky.For food we started with the delicious deviled eggs. I'll admit I think we were all a bit surprised when they came out deep fried... but sooo good. Then we were treated to the phenomenal fried chicken. We loved them so much that we immediately placed another order. The best way to describe them is similar to the original Bon Chon (before Bon Chon was legit and operating out of that 2nd floor space on 5th and 32nd) but better!Finally, we shared the Branzino, which came out fluffy and filled with bright citrus flavors. Also, we all enjoyed the Pit Out, which, imo, is a must. It is a deceivingly large dish and incredibly decadent. Each piece of pork is like eating a slice of super fatty pork belly, seared, giving it a nice crispy texture.PS We also ordered a side, the asparagus or the Brussels sprouts, whichever one, it was a delectable as the other dishes.",0,0,1,Travis L.,"Seattle, WA",51,366,73

One of my friends even coined Tuome their newly crowned favorite restaurant in NYC ;) It's a good walk into Alphbet City, but trust me, it's worth the trek! The reservation was for 6:30pm and we were seated promptly. Not sure if it's because it was a week night, but the restaurant stayed relatively empty for the duration of our meal.Here's what we ordered to share:Egg [deviled, crispy, chili] $8Tasted like a perfect scotch egg with a slight asian flare with the chiliTartare [wagyu beef, three hour yolk, lemongrass] $17Slightly expensive, but I loved how this was different than regular beef tartare you would get at another restaurant. There were infused lemongrass flavors, and it was sweeter in general. The sous vide egg was amazing too, binding it all together.Snow Crab [noodle, english peas, dashi butter] $31Oh man, what can I say........these noodles are glorious, definitely tasted hand-pulled (I hope they really are, or else these are some pretty fantastic premade noodles!). The butter is so rich, but the english peas give it a nice contrast. Crab is also cooked perfectly.Pig Out for 2 [berkshire pork, spicy peanut noodle, condiments] $52Pretty expensive, but made well - there are 10 pieces of crispy skin berkshire pork belly pieces, and two bowls of peanut noodles. THOSE PEANUT NOODLES ARE TO DIE FOR. I could eat bowls of these!!! Same noodles as the Snow Crab dish, but completely different flavor profiles. Berkshire pork had a really nice crispy skin, and the condiments really brought out the flavors in the meat :).Brussels Sprout [grape, pork xo, raisin] $10These were good, but I think it's pretty hard to mess up brussels sprouts :)Rice [kale, chinese sausage, duck fat] $9Ahhhh! The day we went also coincided with dragon boat festival, which meant we had to eat chinese tamales (zongzi)...so this was seriously perfect. The glutinous rice was so yummy with the duck fat and chinese sausages! Pretty oily, but completely worth it.DessertThey don't have a menu, but it seems like they have one item every day.

5.0,6/3/2016,"This review is purely for the snow crab noodles with dashi butter, which I sampled at the Lucky Rice event. I had never been to Tuome before, nor had I heard of this little gem of a restaurant in the East Village in all my years of East Village noodling. How is that possible?! Those were the best, chewiest, most mush-defying noodles I've had in a long time, and I am a noodle FIEND. And who would have thought to infuse butter with bonito stock? The snow crab, delicately sprinkled on top, was fresh and bright. Me thinks the addition of few slices of shiitake mushrooms would have sent the dish straight out of this world, right into the galactic center of our wonderful milky way.I do get ahead of myself...Looking at the menu, which is elegantly abbreviated, I think I might need a quadruple bypass after a meal at Tuome. But then again, I can't think of a better way to die than dying from Tuomitis, the most special of ailments, where the soul takes flight from the body, a body that is enveloped by whirls of buttery chewiness, pillowed by flakes of crustacean goodness, forever frozen in eternal bliss.",2,1,2,Isabella S.,"San Francisco, CA",480,190,62
5.0,5/12/2016,"Excellent date spot nestled away in alphabet city. Tuome delivers the perfect Asian-American fusion inspired dishes. I've sampled all the appetizers/small plates, which you can actually make a very decent meal out of all of those, and they're probably the highlight of the restaurant! The deviled egg is definitely the best! Don't think i've ever eaten a more delicious egg! Steer away from the chicken liver... the texture was a little much for me and tasted super rich. The other small plates are more average to above average dishes (octopus and steak tartare). Overall, if you're targeting a a trendy atmosphere for a fun date night, Tuome is definitely a great choice. Your date will be super impressed.

If I liked them-- people who like deviled eggs will like them. We also got the chicken liver. The chicken liver was delicious: smooth, flavorful. My issue with this appetizer was-- the bread. The bead it comes with is toasted wonder bread cut into quarters. Come on. After hearing all about the ""pig out"" for two from people- we knew we had to get it. My best friend was reluctant because she doesn't love pork, but I insisted. Honestly, I could have done without it. As for the bowl of spicy peanut noodles-- I could eat that all day every day. The peanut noodles were so flavorful. But the pork was heavy- somewhat dry. I literally had one square and was all porked out. I would come back, but I would skip the ""pig out"" personally.

4.0,2/23/2016,"This review is more of a 4.5 but I was not completely comfortable offering a 5 star review primarily because the space is quite small and probably should be more carefully considered.  The wine by the bottle list should also be better developed, we struggled when ordering a bottle which never happens (my husband is a sommelier.)  Our table was near the door and a party of 9-10 people came in during the end of our meal- this led to some unfortunate bustling and cold air coming in and out, along with people hoovering over us.  I'm not sure that Tuome is suitable for large parties with children...  We had to move tables so the restaurant could accommodate the large party; this was fine because they bought our beignets for our trouble (DON'T MISS THE BEIGNETS!) Every dish was imaginative and flavorful.  The steak tartar is suburb and comes close to my favorite tartar at 1760 in SF.  The marmalade that accompanies the beignets was also fantastic, my husband asked for more and ate it with a spoon.  Our waiter was extremely enthusiastic about food and wine and made the experience of dining with Tulome exciting and lively.  We will be back!",1,0,1,Kerstin A.,"San Francisco, CA",8,32,0

Cuisine: when you are offering a 6-course meal coupled with a wine pairing, the key to making it exciting is contrast, variety, and balance. Each course had it's own unique element and was not repeated in any preceding or proceeding dish. The wine pairings complimented each dish perfectly, as well. A job well done by Tuome's executive chef! I truly cannot sing enough praise for this restaurant and for it's generous and attentive manager, Brandon. Please do yourself a favor and experience the beauty Tuome has to offer.",0,0,0,Jeffrey B.,"Manhattan, NY",1,1,0

We had the racer 5Great intimate spot. The service here is wonderful. They are very attentive.We ordered the Persimmon small plate to start which was a nice light opener. We then shared the pig out for two which came with two noodle bowls and the best pork dish!! Each piece of pork was cooked perfectly. It was a slow cooked pork with a crispy top add some of the sauces and you're all set for some great bites. For sides we had the Broccoli which my husband cannot stop talking about, and the butternut squash side which was to die for!! It's a sweeter side topped with granola that is marinated in some type of love. To compliment I started off with a lovely white wine, and my husband had a great draft beer which I then had as second drink.

4.0,2/16/2016,"I have been wanting to try this place for quite some time and I am glad that I finally made it here.  This East Village spot is small and intimate with 2 dining rooms and a small bar if you are waiting for the rest of your party to arrive.  Overall, the wait staff was friendly and attentive and we didn't see ourselves waiting/looking around for much.The menu here is small and simple which I enjoy as it shows some diversity (about 6 items each for apps/entrees/sides) but also focuses on the restaurant's strengths.  Getting to the food, we started with deviled eggs (a must order as they had great flavors but also a nice crunch with the deep-fried panko breading), the chicken liver (served with toasted bread that was nice), the burrata with quiona and persimmon (good balance of creaminess and flavors) and the grilled octopus (a bit too charred for my liking).  For my main, I tried the cod (hot and sour soup with mushrooms that was cooked perfectly and was very moist), the squash with granola and curry spice (unique and not too overpowering) and the broccoli (simple but done well).  To wrap things up, they only had one sweet of Chinese beignets severed with some jams and caramel that was ok but nothing special.  Overall, the dining experience here was great.  The ambiance was intimate but also good for groups and the wait staff was attentive.  After a couple of glasses of wine each and a handful of items above, with tax and tip it came out to about $100/person which I thought was a bit steep but overall worth it.  Buon appetito.",1,1,1,Marco M.,"Manhattan, NY",447,503,263
4.0,2/10/2016,"I've waited so long since this meal (and post-meal fun at Ace Bar) that my memory isn't perfect but I'll give you the average.For one, I was incredibly impressed my friend recommended this place and I hadn't heard about it. Needless to say, when i read the pedigree, I was very intrigued.It's an unusual space, really two rooms with a bar but feels like one small depending where you are seated. When we left and the lights were on, I could appreciate the decor so much more. Oh yes, they close early so make note.One of our four was a bit surprised they do not have a full bar. Yes they have cocktails but they are wine or sake cocktails. We went with bottles of wine for the table.As we were an adventurous group of four, we asked for recommendations on how to order and followed suit, minus one or two small dishes. Let me say, we left a decent amount on our plates! My rating of the dishes was either very good  or not my style, not much in between. Interesting though, while I didn't enjoy the octopus (a fave of mine in general), one companion said it was his favorite.The deviled eggs were fantastic. Unfortunately, as a massive persimmon fan, the dish didn't work for me. The persimmons were not very ripe and the quinoa didn't add any flavor to the dish, although the burrata was very nice and with the prosciutto could have stood on its own. The texture didn't work either. The pig out was worth ordering, a novel presentation and fun with each of the pieces though I preferred the spicy peanut noodles to the pork! The pork has a nice crispy cracking but was just above average in taste. The brussels as sides were good but the rice, better! And my favorite, in a once in a lifetime event (probably), I LOVED the chicken. I mean, when the others wanted the last bites of the octopus or the duck, I took the chicken. Even the porridge, which sounded really strange, worked.While I had some hits and some misses, I enjoyed the atmosphere and the food is definitely above average and worth 4 stars. And, a major plus to one of the staff who volunteered his ipod for the music of the evening. 90's playlist was perfect for my liking!

I've had Tuome on my radar ever since it opened and the famous ""pig out for two"" started appearing on my instagram feed.I walked away completely disappointed by the meal. I LOVE burrata. Its a must order anytime I see it on a menu. This? This was not good. It was thrown together with quinoa, kale and prosciutto. This combo did not work and definitely did not distract me from how flavorless the burrata was.  The brussels sprouts were way too salty. The pig out for two wasn't the crispy pork I imagined and wasn't seasoned well. I must say the deviled eggs were incredible. The servers were also incredibly pushy. You expect this from touristy spot on the west side, but not in the east village. I was told that the ""chef prefers you order one dish from each section of the menu."" Yes, I've been to a restaurant before and am familiar with the concept of appetizers, entrees and sides. Rarely do I walk away from my seat with unfinished dishes.

Certain dishes were Chinese traditional with a twist which was interesting since this isn't (to me at least) a Chinese restaurant.  Three of us ordered to share the apps: deviled eggs (deep fried with a nice spicy touch.. Don't think just get it), chicken liver mousse (awesome), octopus (I don't eat it but my friends loved). Entrees were the pig out for two and salmon. We got an order of the duck fat Chinese bacon lotus wrap and Brussel sprout sides. Pig out out for two was the main reason I was there and slightly underwhelmed. Now understand this, a lot of Chinese ppl including myself grew up eating this crispy roasted pig and it's usually super juicy and fatty. Not here. First bite was great but nothing special after that. Great flavor but a little dry. As for the lotus wrap, I grew up eating this every weekend growing up.

Highly recommending Fire in Sky as has just the right amount of spice in the drink with exposing so fun colorful flavor in a cocktail.We ended up ordering 2 entrees:Duck and Pig Out.The Duck was the first entree to come it out. Amazing and extremely impressive!!! The duck was cooked to perfection. The meat was extremely tender for duck and not to much fat. It was served with a most exquisite xo sauce that left an amazing lingering after taste that made you go back for more. Eating the duck with small pieces of grapefruit was a nice surprise. The citrus brought out the best in both the duck and sauce.The Pig Out Entree was their most popular and know for item. This turned out to be a disappointment. The pork belly was fried to a point where you didn't know what type of meat you were eating. It came with 2 sauces, a chili that was just regular and ginger. The chef recommends you do the same amount of sauce on each bite but the sauce neither helped or complimented the pork belly bites. The argula salad with lychee and walnuts was a nice compliment that brought out the pork belly more than the sauces. The noodles included with entree was just ok. Over dosed in a regular peanut sauce and the noodles were a bit to al dente for Asian inspired pairings in my opinion.

Initially, I was most excited about the berkshire pork but I am really writing the review for the chicken porridge.The kitchen definitely exceeded my expectations on the chicken dish. Growing up with Asian parents, I always viewed porridge as a feel-good food, something I always got fed when I was sick because it's savory and easy to digest. THIS, this was something COMPLETELY DIFFERENT!The porridge itself had a perfect undertone of butter. The tiny bits of basil also made it a pleasant surprise in my mouth. The chicken must have been cooked slowly because it was SO juicy and tender I wish I could have it sitting in front of me right now.

4.0,11/4/2015,"Tuome came highly recommended to me (personally in addition to by yelp). While I did have a positive dining experience there, I'm not sure it quite lived up to the expectations. While most dishes hit the spot standalone, the overall meal felt a little heavy, with almost every dish having been rich, with some combination of cream and fat featuring prominently. It might have been a fault in my ordering, but I personally would have preferred that they strayed a little to the lighter side, for at least some of their dishes. Heres what we had:1) Fried deviled eggs. These were fried, and had a delicious spicy topping. Totally hit the spot.2) Octopus. This was probably my biggest disappointment of the night. Frying up the oyster was a little unnecessary; it is most often found grilled, and frankly, i think it tastes better that way. The crispy pork XO accoutrement was tasty (but also fried). The fancy, out of a canister, mashed potatoes was also tasty but ridiculously heavy. My fellow diner commented that it tasted like more butter than potatoes.3) Pig Out. This dish was fun to order and fun to eat. The servings of the berkshire pork were plentiful - the ~10 pieces may not look like a lot but the indulgent fattiness of the dish (starting to see a pattern?) made it hard to eat more than 3-4 without feeling totally sated. The spicy toppings paired very well with it, and the peanut noodles were also solid. Overall a good dish, but I would much rather share with a larger party.4) Side of pea shoots. This is a great vegetable and Tuome does it well. Pricing might be a bit high for a veggie side, but pea shoots are always on the pricier side.Overall, the menu had enough enticing options that I wouldnt be surprised if I find myself back there, but my preference for next time would be to go with a larger group so I can (1) try more options, and (2) not have to take down quite as much of those larger, more indulgent, dishes.",0,0,0,Ashwin T.,"New York, NY",166,217,108

They give you too few chips tho Oxtail spring rolls - also tasty. Green sauce was excellent. Bright, herbaceous, and silkyCrispy deviled eggs - interesting and good.

The risotto like porridge was fairly heavy and creamy, brightened a bit by a rich soy Demi glace of sort. Great cold night dish.

4.0,10/9/2015,"Trekked out to Tuome for The Pig Out (For 2), because no journey is too far for bite-sized pork belly crisps sitting on a stone slab. The experience is a Brooklyn one with a Manhattan price tag, so don't make any fiscal assumptions based on the hipster milieu.Tuome's flavor profiles are likeable: sichuan chili, peanuty sauces, milk bread, duck fat. It will suit all taste-buds, making it a great joint to entertain guests (although not the right environment for serious, quiet conversations). The Chicken Liver is plated to hold a pool of NY maple syrup, and the taste is simple and refreshingly contemporary. The delicious, peanut noodles that come with The Pig Out can be overwhelmingly rich after a few bites; though a few bites of a lightly-dressed salad topped with seasonal fruit will help take the edge off. Make time for dessert and order the Chinese Beignets - which I'm sure every review below will vouch. The accompanying jams retain only a bit of sweetness to keep the dish mostly a savory experience. Hmm.. something about the soft, coiled texture of the beignets remind me of my childhood at Chinese-Korean restaurants.

4.0,9/12/2015,"Thomas Chen, an ex-chef of Eleven Madison Square Park, was able to execute the Asian American dishes on his menu expertly: each of the items didn't lose the traditional preparation/taste of the dish but had an added opposing American or Chinese flare depending on whether the dish was an American or a Chinese dish. The ""small"" and ""side"" plates stood out most for me and I am looking forward to coming back to try more of the big plates as we only ordered the famous pig out for two this time. From the small plates, we tried the egg, chicken liver, tartare and soft-shell crab and I would order all four again. I particularly liked the deviled eggs at Tuome are very unique and the various textures of the eggs make it a fun bite to eat. The exterior is panko crusted and deep fried, giving the egg a crunchy exterior, and the creamy yolky interior is topped with fried garlic and chiles chilies giving the egg a spicy kick.From the sides we ordered the brussels sprouts, corn and rice. The rice dish was one of my favorites, but unfortunately it didn't photograph well. This was Chen's take on a familiar dimsum dish - Lo mai gai, steamed lotus leaves stuffed with sticky rice lotus leave rice. The lotus rice dish here is steamed with duck fat, kale and Chinese sausage.Unfortunately the Pig Out for two, but this was not the highlight of the dinner for me.. The pig out comes with 10 pieces of pork, scallion-ginger and sambal sauces, and two bowls of peanut noodles. The pig is prepared in the Chinese roasted pig ""siu yuk"" style. I grew up eating this dish and I am used to the pork being more tender and fattier. The Tuome version I found slightly too dry but the ginger and sambal sauces helped add a nice flavor to the pork. On the other hand, the peanut noodles were amazing! The noodles were al dente and just the right amount of chewy. I will ask if I can order these noodles separately next time and order either the chicken or the duck dish as my main!Tip: get a bottle of the red Tannat from Uruguay to go with your meal.

I'm still dreaming about the steak tartare - it's now on my top 3 favorites in the city. It's served with broccoli chips which adds a nice crunch to the super flavorful and perfect texture tartare. The chicken liver was okay but a little too sweet to my liking. Octopus with the potatoes served from a whip cream canister was also good. For mains we had the pork for two, the skate, Brussel sprouts and rice with kale and sausage. Pork was amazing, playful creation with the crunchy top and tender shredded bottom layer.

It's also served with a nice little arugula salad too.Massaman Corn - Since I liked curry it was a nice unique combinationBrussel Sprouts I really wanted to order all the sides because they looked so good.  So if we go back, definitely getting the pea shoots and the duck fat fried rice ahhh drool.",1,0,0,Eileen J.,"New York, NY",40,185,0

One of the dishes we got was  the ""pig out"" which was delicious cubes of pork but came with a bowl of thick, chewy peanut noodles. The flavors didn't work together for us.  We also got the egg.

The brussels sprouts were really good along with the other sides such as octopus. I think this is a great place to meet up for drinks as the cocktails were well priced and delicious.

Portions are small. From my experience, the most fun and enjoyable meal involves ordering a bunch of small plates/sides and no entrees. Eggs are a must. I also tried the rice, brussel sprout, and pea shoot sides. There was something else on the menu that isn't on the website and I think it was a take on mac and cheese that was also really good.

5.0,6/21/2015,"Tuome is a tiny, somewhat under the radar restaurant in the East Village that is bursting with flavor and is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. The story of how Tuome, and its name, came to be is almost too perfect not to share. After working for four years as an accountant, Thomas Chen left his job to pursue his dream of being a chef, worked his way up through Eleven Madison Park and Commerce, and finally, in 2014, opened his own restaurant. I'll let Pete Wells of the the NY Times do the honor of explaining how to pronounce ""Tuome"" and why:""...he was Tommy at home, but on his parents' lips the nickname came out ""tow me,"" which is how Tuome is pronounced...""American / Asian fusion is nothing new, but its usually executed pretty poorly and without originality, which is absolutely not the case at Tuome. Chen manages to introduce exciting flavor profiles in his small plates, which are best shared. There are so many unique bites of food on the menu that you'll regret not tasting more of them if you don't share.Everyone should have one of the spicy, crispy deviled eggs to start, and then order a selection of other apps. Their rendition of octopus with brown butter espuma is great, and the chicken liver mousse is smooth and indulgent. Of the mains, the delicately balanced snow crab noodle dish might be my favorite, if not for the highly regarded Pig Out. The pork belly is crunchy and amazing and the sesame noodles that come with it are addictive, but it is heavy, and not ideal for a party for two. You'd be better served trying more of the dishes - including a side of the rice made with Chinese sausage and duck fat if you know what's good for you - and ordering the Pig Out when you come back with 3 or 4 in your group.In fact, my only critique of Tuome is that, if you aren't careful to counter some of the richer plates with a few of the more subtle ones, you could end up feeling like you need to roll yourself out.  However, I'll take that dilemma over boring food any day - not too bad for an accountant.",1,0,0,Alex S.,"New York, NY",20,91,54

4.0,6/10/2015,"I had been meaning to try this place for a while, but was a bit sidetracked by the fact that I recently moved to the opposite side of the city. I was a bit confused as to what kinda of restaurant Tuome was. The menu didn't seem to have a unifying theme, which isn't absolutely necessary, but again, confusing. Nonetheless, this was a very good meal from start to finish. The hostess seated us promptly, and our waitress was very friendly and attentive throughout the meal.We ordered the Pig Out for 2 (duh) and the sticky rice and artichokes. The Pig Out came with 10 pieces of crispy pork belly, hot peanut noodles, a small arugula salad with apples and candied walnuts, and accompanying sauces. Everything about the Pig Out was delicious. The noodles were rich and satisfying, and the sauces complemented the pork belly very well. However, the sticky rice ""tamale"" or zhongzi, was a bit small, and not quite worthy of the $9 price tag. The artichokes came with a bit of lemon and bread crumbs, and the texture was good, but overall, just an okay dish.I feel like Tuome is a bit of a one-trick pony. The Pig Out for 2 was great, and it seems like a very popular dish, but nothing about the meal made me want to come back try the other things on the (very small) menu. I saw some of the other dishes being brought to other tables, and they looked like things you could find at other restaurants, which is fine. But at these prices, you should come here if you've never tried the Pig Out before, but after that, I don't think there's too much of a reason to come back. Overall, because of the slight lack of value, this is more like 3.5 stars, but I'll round up because of the quality and the great service. You'll have a good experience here, but not necessarily a place I would frequent.",3,1,3,Eric J.,"New York, NY",490,923,1792

It had a hint of curry, which was so unexpected but such a great addition to the entire dish.Although the waitresses can lighten up a bit (I didn't appreciate their not-so-friendly demeanor), the hostess and the manger?

I highly recommend the Jacques cider if you are a fan of cider. Definitely the best cider I've ever had. We also had a bottle of Verdejo's El Gordon. If you are a fan of savignon blanc, this is the wine to try. Crisp with a hint of tropical flavors, yet not sweet and still refreshing. We tried all the appetizers. Loved them all! I highly recommend the octopus, very tender and the xo pork complimented it very well. Also my other favorites were the crispy deviled egg and the chicken mousse which was complimented perfectly with the maple syrup. We tried the pig out for 2. There were 10 crispy pieces of pork with a light arugula salad and a spicy peanut noodle dish. The sauce for the spicy noodle dish was really great and the noodles tasted like handmade noodles. The duck was a huge hit at our table, a perfect medium rare. The chicken was also a big hit with the porridge underneath. We also tried all the sides. They were all delicious. My favorite of the night was the brussel sprouts, crispy with a refreshing hint of sweetness from the grapes and the raisins. I also really enjoyed the steamed rice with kale, Chinese sausage, and duck fat. Dessert was a nice surprise. Was so full didn't think we had room for it but it was so delicious we ate it all.

Do yourself a favor and go to Chinatown for the same exact items in bigger portions for much cheaper prices.Food:- Pig for two. the pork came in 8 bite sized pieces. The pork ended up up feeling too heavy after two bites but I still felt like I got ripped off. For some reason I was imagining something more unique. The noodles were al dente which was slightly weird for an asian dish. - Octopus. Probably the smallest octopus plate I have ever had. The bacon and butter garnish made it taste amazing though.- Peashoots. I literally made this at home for $2.50 for 5x the portion size the night before.- Artichoke. Good but also nothing amazing.The redeeming  qualities to this place are the ambiance and service. It is definitely a date night place. Dim lighting, small intimate tables -- oo la la.

Presentation was beautiful but I thought the mousse was a tad too thin and flavor was one-dimensional. However the toasted bread, pepitas and crispy garlic etc did add really good texture. The artichoke dish was good but I just hate eating this vegetable.... It provides less energy than it takes to eat #*&%*$#&% That's literally the opposite of food. Up this review if hate artichoke ._.Pig out for two was phenomenal..... because of the peanut noodles! The sauce was nutty, sweet and rich and the noodles were PERFECTLY AL DENTE, truly a dish combining the best of both Eastern and Western cuisine. The pork itself was crispy but not as fatty as I had hoped to be. I was also not a fan of the scallion sauce. Didnt think it worked well with the pork. The salad on the side however was more than mere garnish - it was light and refreshing and the walnuts complemented the meat very well. Finally, the RICE was the bomb. I have never had that kind of sausage outside China and it really brought me home (and tears to my eyes... just kd. but almost). The duck fat made the rice so sticky and aromatic!!

5.0,4/19/2015,"I've been meaning to try Tuome for a while. Finally found a dining companion who shared the same urge. We didn't have much trouble with reservation. They are busy but if you can plan couple days ahead then you should be able to get something within your preferred time window, especially weekdays. Either way, don't wait for chance - make a point to dine here. Noise level is average. There's a lot of Asian influence in the food but if you're not keen on fusion like myself don't be discouraged. I tend to be selective with my ""fusion"" food and although it borrows substantially from Asian cuisine it is far from your typical fusion. Overall: Delicious! Great dining atmosphere. A great date restaurant - almost feel like it is tailored made for couples. Not really ideal for large groups. The menu also suggest the same. I am big on family style dining. I feel diversity and variety really helps you identify flavors. The only item on the menu that is adequate for sharing is the PIG OUT. Otherwise, everything is so good you don't want to share. Highly recommend. East village is very lucky to have such a neighborhood gem. Pro: PIG OUT for two is a must. The berkshire pork is just cooked to the right balance of crispy skin and juicy meat. When you dap it with the paired condiments it just really takes off. It also comes with spicy peanut noodles (two bowls). It's not ""Asian"" level spicy but there's a kick. The peanut sauce reminds me of a bit of Thai and Chinese native flavors. The who combination together is a real threat. The appetizer MUSHROOM with fermented black beans, yuba and sixty minute egg was absolutely addictive. The egg was done perfectly where once broken the yolk and it's post-mix texture really made the dish. It can be served as an app or side... heck even main if you really love mushrooms. The OCTOPUS came out same time as the mushroom and unfortunately I was distracted. In hindsight, it was also a very nice dish. The OXTAIL SPRING ROLL with bone marrow and cumin was amazing. There's a lot of different spring roll finding combos out there but this one really worked well.The dipping sauce makes it. It was once a permanent fixture on the menu but it was offered as a special on our night. If it's available then definitely give it a go. Con: Nothing really. Small bar if you end up waiting. Small tables, minimal spacing with your neighbors and a bit challenging to enjoy multiple plates at the same time. Otherwise 5 Star first time experience.

The dishes are asian influenced and the outstanding dishes were the mushrooms and octopus.The mushrooms were pan fried with a lightly poached egg in the middle. Once the egg was mixed with the dish where it amalgamated with the hint of black bean, it created this sauce where I lamented the lack of sourdough to mop up the last drops. I am partial to octopus and loved the crunch of the outside and then to reveal the soft and tenderness of the octopus. Delicious.The pork belly was good. There was the crunch of the crackling matched with the soft, pull apart meat. However, the fat content was palpable. I did not like the noodles that it was paired with. The noodles were heavy with the peanut sauce and it needed a lift with some vegetables/coriander?As for the dessert, it was a Chinese 'mantou' with ice cream.

4.0,3/25/2015,"Maybe because I was coming from a few weeks of not going out much and eating really healthy (yes, you got it, I have been low-cal dieting for a month - can I say this on yelp?!) but my expectation above this restaurant was really high.We decided to go for two classics:- fried deviled eggs, absolutely worth the trip, that's a super cool appetizer and the chili on top gives that devil twist- pig out for two , perfect crispy and crunchy crust, right amount (not like those times that at restaurants they tell you it's for two but it's for one), nice salad with also pineapple to make it sweetly asian. The dry ramen (mazemen) were good but way too heavy and ""buttery"". I know they were ""peanut noodles"" but to me the pig and the peanut noodles were too heavy, I would suggest a mouth refreshing mazemen , with some lemon for example. The (beautiful) greasiness of the pork cannot be overloaded by the peanut, to my taste, but exalted by a fresh noodle.Then also- chicken liver mousse(appetizer), not an easy dish, but we Tuscan gourmet people love the chicken liver crostini so that's a taste we missed here in Brooklyn. It was delicious, really. A bit too sweeter that needed, but I think this is the Chef's taste. I think he likes sweet stuff.- artichokes with breadcrumbs, in my mind I was dreaming of something fried but it wasn't. It was a boiled artichoke with some breadcrumb on top and a sauce to dip.It was ok, I am not a fan of boiled artichokes though, and I am used to the Italian ones which are really really tasty even without any dip , just with a few drops of extra virgin olive oil on topThe dessert (the only one they have I think) was good but too sweet for me, and the smell was not of a super fresh frying oil. In general a nice dinner, I give 4 stars also for the nice ambience, the service which was kind, and for that very good bottle of Lambrusco wine which is perfect when you eat fat like pig, egg, chicken liver mousse.

5.0,3/23/2015,"Fergalicious def...Fergalicious def...let me see you 1, 2 step...say my name, say my name...what a weird song selection to welcome me to this restaurant!  I didn't know quite what to expect after walking into this place, but I left after having one of the best meals that I've had in a really long time.  I came here on a date night and it was the perfect atmosphere--not too loud, mood lighting, exposed brick, candles and springs of lavender on the table, friendly staff...and clearly a memorable music selection of women from the 90s.  We had early reservations and were promptly seated in an already crowded restaurant.From what I had heard, this place was an American restaurant, but I have to correct the listing.  This place is definitely Thai or Thai fusion--I'm talking peanut-noodle, banana-leaf-loving Thai food!  After sitting down, we were given a list of wine and beer, and I assumed that they didn't have mixed drinks.  We found out later though that we weren't given the cocktail list.  Oh well.  They have a nice selection of wines and we found something that suited us.  The waitress told us that the perfect sized meal is one order from each of the three menu sections per person (appetizer, entree, and side dish).  This is a huge amount of food though, and I would advise against it.  Two entrees and an appetizer is certainly enough food.  The meal started with an amuse bouche of squash soup with chili foam...a great start to the meal!  Clearly, everyone who comes here gets the pig out, which is deliciously seared pork belly and comes with a small salad and two bowls of thai peanut noodles.  The hype of the pig out though shouldn't overshadow some of the other menu items, especially the blue crab mac and cheese.  It was a weird combination of mac and cheese, crab, and Thai curry, which was the most unexpectedly delicious combination of flavors.  Amazing!I couldn't have asked for a more delicious meal!  I would come back here in a heartbeat and try anything on the menu if my first experience here was any indication of what else is on the menu!",2,0,0,Logan J.,"Boston, MA",160,318,450
4.0,3/23/2015,"This place is amazing!! I've eaten at a lot of places and have to say that this place may be one of my favorites in NYC.I came here to catch-up with a good friend on Friday night. The weather was pretty bad outside as it was the first day of spring and it was still blizzarding like crazy. I was not in the best of moods when I sat down, so I ordered one of their spicy cocktails. Not only was the cocktail very pretty looking -- white with a thin, purple layer at the top -- it was also uniquely flavored -- a hint of sweetness with a little kick to it.For a appetizer, my friend and I ordered the crispy deviled eggs. Holy crap. The eggs were soooo good -- the outside was perfectly crispy and the inside was creamy. We were given 3 halfs, but I definitely could've eaten more.For the entree, we decided to be a bit gluttonous and get the pork belly meal for 2. We were scared the pork belly would be too heavy, but it was definitely not the case. The pork belly came cut into 10 perfectly bite-sized pieces. The top layer of the pork belly was crisped to a perfection and the bottom part was succulent and juicy -- I couldn't taste or see that much fat at all. The meat came with a salad and some flavorful peanut noodles.Since we were already being fatties, we decided to go all the way and order the Chinese Beignets. These look more like fried mantous (Chinese steamed buns) than normal beignets and tasted heavenly. The outside was perfectly crisp and the inside was soft and fluffy. The beignets also came with a marmalade, red bean ice cream, and another type of sauce.Overall, the experience was amazing and made me realize that there are still decently priced, unique-tasting restaurants in NYC.",2,1,1,Rena K.,"Dallas, TX",354,38,0
3.0,3/20/2015,"I think this place is a bit overrated and definitely overpriced for the quality.Mushroom and Chicken Liver apps were good. Pig Out was ok I guess, I liked the pork enough but the noodles were pretty greasy and too chewy. Salad is also nothing special. The place is really cramped and it's awkward when it's busy, especially when you first come in and walk over to the hostess. It'd be nice to have a drink at the bar but they cram in people to eat there, too. The music was also terrible, which I don't really care about for a restaurant, but it added to the weird vibes. The crowd is kind of UES/Murray Hill.",0,0,0,Tina S.,"New York, NY",7,73,0
5.0,3/16/2015,"BIG fan of this place.  As soon as I read about this ""Pig Out"" dish, I knew I had to come here, and it did not disappoint.  Tuome is not for everyone however there is something for everyone here.  The menu is small and focused with a couple vegetarian, fish and meat options available in all sizes.  There is no vegetarian entree sized portion but between the appetizers and sides, there are 6 options for those who choose not to eat meat.  If you're someone who likes a lot of options and a typical (read: boring) menu, this is not the place for you.  If you want to wake up your palate and show it something new, come here immediately.  Before discussing the food, I want to note that our server, Nadjma, was a delight.  Always smiling, she explained the menu thoroughly and was very attentive to our needs throughout the meal.  We had one incident where a glass of wine was tainted by the smell of the glass (dirty sponge smell) and the glass and wine was replaced, no questions asked.  It's a huge turnoff when a server or sommelier pushes back if a diner has an issue with the wine and thankfully that was not the case here.  Stellar service from when we sat down to when we paid the check.  As for the food, this is what will keep me coming back.  We started with four small plates and all but one were a hit.  The deviled eggs were panko breaded and deep fried giving them a wonderfully crispy exterior.  The yolk mixture is plopped on top of the fried egg white and a garnish of minced chili peppers gave the pungent acidic pop that was needed to set these apart from your ""typical"" fried deviled egg.  The tender octopus was served with a brown butter foam and what tasted like house made bacon bits, because bacon makes everything better.  The chicken liver mousse was a standout and I'd definitely order this again.  Creamy, and supremely rich,  it was served with milk toast and some maple syrup to balance out the salty liver with a hint of sweet.  The only miss was the mushrooms which in my opinion were a bit too salty.  On to the Pig Out!  Now $50 might seem like a lot for 10 cubes of pork belly and some noodles but I can assure you that it's worth it.  Plus, this dish is very rich and you won't want to eat more out of fear of the gout.  Each cube is well seared on the top so that fatty layer that pork belly is known for gets crisped up and you're not eating big hunks of fat.  Well, you're still eating the fat, it's just crispy now instead of soft!  Served with two sauces (one ginger scallion and one chili paste), the chef recommends you put both on each piece so that you get multiple tastes in one bite.  Sweet, Salty, Spicy & Umami, this dish is something dreams are made of.  Granted, my dreams may be a little different from yours.  Then there are the bowls of peanut noodles which was a great surprise.  Thicker than your typical cold noodles in peanut sauce, these are also served warm and drenched in a thick peanut sauce.  If you're a peanut butter lover, you will go ga ga over these.  However, these are not for the casual peanut butter eater.  Someone at our table said that they were too peanut buttery but I thought they were just right.  A hint of spice cut the peanut flavor just enough and added some depth to the dish.  A surprising addition to the pork belly which worked really well.Apparently Tuome did not previously serve dessert but now they have a grand total of one item, which is ""Chinese style"" beignets.  I guess the flour used was Chinese flour because they didn't taste too Chinese to me.  Regardless, these were nothing special and I wouldn't order them again.  Clearly Tuome knows it's strengths and dessert isn't one of them.Overall, we had a great meal here and I can't wait to come back.",1,1,1,John D.,"San Francisco, CA",127,218,34
5.0,3/15/2015,"Went to Tuome with friends last night (3/14). I recommend going with a party of four, otherwise you won't be able to get the Pig Out AND all the other great stuff.Beer and wine only, but the wine selection is pretty well-priced and pleasant.Started off with an amuse bouche, which was a nice touch. The chicken liver mousse is sweet and unctuous and everything a mousse should be (also, not cold, which is what I usually dislike about liver mousse). The octopus was well-cooked, but aided immensely by the pork XO sauce that was on a few other dishes. The mushrooms were great (for someone who doesn't particularly like mushrooms), but the mac and cheese is a skip. Needs salt, and the cheese is practically unidentifiable.Now, the Pig Out may be the city's current best medium-format meal. Easily feeds four (assuming you order all that other stuff!), and the noodles are FANTASTIC. Pretty much anything with ginger-scallion sauce is going to have my full support, but they pull off the ""shredded and compacted pork belly and cheek"" as well as any other trendy place in the city. You're really ordering it for the noodles, in my opinion.The other entrees we got were the chicken, which was perfectly cooked, if unimpressive, and the red snapper, which was also perfectly cooked, and sitting in a thick chowder cream with giant clams. Amazing. Also, the side of brussels sprouts was delightfully burnt and crispy. Highly recommended.Dessert is besides the point, but serviceable.Price was on the lower end for this kind of trendy sharing place.Here are my only quibbles:1) The people standing to be seated are basically standing over everyone with tables, it's so cramped. I assume this will be easier to deal with when it's warmer out.2) I am pretty saddened that there is no bread basket. While I love bread baskets in general, this place does so well with sauce, and then you're left spooning it up instead of mopping it up with TASTY BREAD! Tuome, my suggestion is to drop the amuse bouche and get with some BREAD! You're wasting your sauce talents!",0,0,0,Brady B.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",18,62,48

We mentioned it to the waitress when she asked how everything was, but she made sure to say ""it's the chefs curated taste"".  Thanks.  The chicken was unbelievably tender.  There were two pieces of fried chicken and two pieces of grilled.  Also got the beef which had great flavor.  The deviled eggs, side of rice (with kale, and duck fat, yes duck fat) and the beignet for dessert were amazing.  Highly recommend.    Based on my experience with the other food, I will have to come here again and try the pig out, but service should be improved upon.",2,0,0,Sarah-Jane M.,"Jersey City, NJ",40,46,7
5.0,3/7/2015,"I had read positive about Tuome since they opened not too long ago and made it a point to stop by for their famous ""pig out for two"" for dinner with a friend of mine. My friend and I had an early reservation (6pm) and were one of the first people in the restaurant which is quaint yet nicely appointed across two rooms. The entrance room has 2 window seats (we were in one - and yes it was a bit chillier there) and a small bar area while the adjoining room has only small tables. Our server was very warm and friendly and happy to be part of the Tuome team - apparently this was her first waiting tables gig and she shined at it. We ordered a bottle of wine to share - a rieseling - and decided to share a few things on the menu. After asking our server's opinion on which was better, we were a bit hard pressed to come up with our final choice (there were just too many things we wanted to try) but we decided on: the ""hot small"" mushroom app, the brussels sprout side and the pig out for two main entree. That was more than plenty of food for two people to share, and honestly, we could have been more than full if we skipped the brussel sprouts.Highlights: the mushroom hot appetizer was actually my favorite dish of the night. A variety of wild mushrooms served with a sixty minute egg (think a slow cooked perfectly poached egg). It was rich and delicious. I would go back purely to have this again. The peanut noodles which accompanied the pork belly in the entree my friend claimed to be some of the best she has ever eaten (she is far more a noodle aficionado than I am) and I can attest to their soft and stickiness, I don't have much to compare them to. Mediumlights: I appreciated the pig out for two's presentation - with the 10 peices of crispy pork belly lined up alongside a small salad and two sauce toppers - the pork was only okay. Unlike noodles, I have eaten my fare share of pork belly and I think what threw me most was the temperature of this. It was only luke warm, if that, on the plate and I felt as though the meat suffered a bit drying out as we ate it. Perhaps the drier, more crunchy texture is the restaurant's goal, and if so, then it just means it isn't a home run for my taste buds. The brussel sprouts were good and I enjoyed the addition of grapes to that dish - similar in shape yet completely different in texture and taste it gave the dish that extra mouth feel which I enjoyed. The XO sauce was understated, which I wished it not to be thus me putting it in the mediumlights section.Lowlights: The sauces with the pork belly I just did not understand. I actually felt like the dish stood better on its own with those sauces saved for a different dish or not used at all. Also, the draftiness of the seat in the window is a real thing and I did eat there in the middle of winter so I could have kept my coat on and been more (or less) comfortable.Would I return? Yes. Especially for those delectable mushrooms. I also am eager to try their version of deviled eggs (done backward) and the octopus appetizer. Our service was impeccable, the space is lovely and the menu is inventive enough. Congrats to Tuome on a job well done!",0,0,0,Lindsey S.,"Brooklyn, NY",28,158,592
5.0,3/5/2015,"One of the best restaurant experiences in recent memory. My boyfriend and I went, as we had heard about the ""Pig Out for Two"" and knew we wanted to share that. It more than lived up to the hype, and the pork just may have been the most well-prepared piece of meat I've ever eaten. We were each given a good-sized bowl of addictive peanut noodles, and while I'm someone who rarely orders the same thing twice, I don't think I could return to Tuome without getting this dish. It's just that good. We also shared some smaller sides, including the tasty toast with chicken liver mousse, and the most delicious corn with lime, curry and creme fraiche. I'm not a big fan of corn, but I could have eaten a whole bowl of this by myself. The space is intimate without being too precious, and the service was professional but friendly.

I thought the food at Tuome was all right-- the deviled eggs were SO DELICIOUS!! But I had the fish with a creamy chowder soup that wasn't that great.

First we were sat at a table that was entirely too cold to be acceptable to anyone. We went along with it, got our coats back and ordered some wine. Every single thing we asked of our waiter seemed to be a burden to him, and he was not at all educated on the wines they offered. We then asked to be moved to a warmer table, which we were also given eye rolls and attitude about. The host informed us that our request to have a fifth guest join us for a drink was IMpossible,  which I thought was strange,  but our fifth stopped by to say hello instead. The entire time she was there (all of 2.5 minutes), the host stood over us shaking his head in a huff, reminding us that our fifth guest was not permitted in their half empty restaurant. There were more than a couple times during this meal I seriously considered getting up and leaving.

The peanut noodles also balanced out the meat very well but were a bit chewy for me. The two sides we ordered were the brussels sprouts and chinese broccoli - both good and had interesting additions (grapes, sesame, etc), but I thought the portions were a bit small for the brussels (aka i really liked them. why dont the ones i make turn out like that!?).Overall, a very enjoyable meal and our waitress was extremely sweet.

3.0,1/30/2015,"Asian Fusion ...ish A restaurant that has the culinary execution you would expect from an EMP/Jean Georges alum, but not quite the innovation I was hoping for.  As someone who has travelled and eaten her away around Asia and grew up on NYC Chinatown eats, and is not afraid to spend a hefty sum on a solid meal, I am admittedly somewhat skeptical of Asian fusion restaurants. That being said, here are the hits and misses:Hits:- Egg - This was the star of the night. Perfect contrast of textures between the creamy deviled egg, the crunch of the fried panko coating and the hit of spice from the chili-garlic sauce. Sadly, I had to share this with my husband as I could've devoured this whole thing by myself.- Octopus - A great fusion dish - sake-infused octopus on a bed of pork xo for spice and crunchy fingerling potatoes. I would come back just to eat these 2 dishes again.Eh, because it wasn't fusion:- Pig Out - Ok, I love pork belly. As in, I would eat it every damn meal if I could figure out a healthy way to do it.  The solid things about this dish: it tasted good, it was crunchy where it was supposed to be crunchy and chewy where it was supposed to be chewy. It came on top of a hoisin sauce, which accompanies your typical Chinatown order of siu yook/pork belly ($12/lb mind you). But where was the fusion in this dish that warrants the $50 pricetag for 10 pieces? The side of subtle undersalted ginger/scallion sauce that usually accompanies poached/steamed chicken? The mildly spicy sambal sauce in a cute squeezy bottle? The citrusy side salad? C'mon. I created that mixture of condiments as a kid eating off Styrofoam plates at my family friends' basement house parties when everything just fell together on my crowded plate. Granted, the presentation at Tuome is much more aesthetically pleasing but not sure if it's worth the hype if you know your Cantonese roasted meats. - 'Chinese' beignets - These are basically tasty mantao. The fusion part (?) came in the condiments: caramel sauce, vanilla ice cream with red bean and yuzu marmalade. Definitely tasty but I thought it was a cheap trick to rely on the condiments for your fusion. If you want Chinese fine dining (for which there is a dire need in NYC), these are the dishes you should order. If Tuome were touted as such, I would give this place 4 stars. But Asian Fusion this is not.Misses:- Yam tater tots - I never met a tater tot I didn't like, until now. The ratio of crunchy fried goodness to yam was way off. The coating was too thin and the tots were so big that it was just kind of a pureed mess. They would probably taste better if they were half the size.One last gripe:Why are you serving casual fine dining Chinese food with cheap takeout chopsticks?!?!?!? The only redeemable quality about this presentation was that at least they weren't the pull apart ones that always come out uneven and splintery. Why are you making people eat $50 pork belly with wooden chopsticks? You may as well serve the rest of your meal with plastic forks and knives. Bottom line:Thomas Chen can make some solid tasty food, but it didn't quite live up to the Asian fusion hype. But if he wants to cook Asian-influenced American food, I think he can do better!",2,0,2,Lorraine N.,"New York, NY",15,12,0
4.0,1/28/2015,"The number of ""fusion"" restaurants opening in New York City has escalated of late, and despite my instinctive aversion to such places, there are a handful that manage to accomplish the feat with great success. Take Tuome, for example, the newest entrant in the East-Meets-West movement, headed by Thomas Chen, a young chef fresh from the kitchens of Eleven Madison Park and Commerce. He describes his cuisine as ""American with Asian influences"", and his plates have met with surprising and overwhelming acclaim. It didn't escape from my mental bookmarks, and when plans for a Friday evening fell through last minute, Tuome was a perfect alternative.Located in East Village, Tuome sports an inconspicuous storefront, blending in with its surroundings almost perfectly. The interior is similarly pared down, with minimalistic rows of wooden tables and chairs that appear more alluring in the dim candlelight. The small space and the brick walls means that it can get rather loud when the dining space is full, but it's a necessary price to pay when dining at any well-recieved newcomer to NYC's dining scene.Tuome's menu is similarly compact, split out into only four sections: Small Hot, Small Cold, Big (Entree), and Sides. Descriptions encompass only the ingredients used in a dish, so it made finalizing our choices a little harder, but we eventually decided on four plates to share for the evening.First to arrive was our lone cold plate, the Beets. They're a vegetable that I've only come to appreciate recently, but the pairing with a creamy five spice yogurt made the initial minerality in each bite much more subdued. While quinoa wouldn't have been my grain of choice, the texture was an appreciated contrast, especially with the nuttiness of the pumpkin seeds. Admittedly, the Deviled Eggs that followed were one of my favorite bites of the evening; each of three egg halves is deep-fried in a panko batter, the yolk treated to the classic mixture of mayonnaise and mustard, and topped with an addictive chile-garlic sauce. It's a textural, well-spiced bite that calls into mind Thai Son-in-Law Eggs, which might be the inspiration for the plate. Slightly more disappointing were the Oxtail Spring Rolls, a dish that appeared tempting on paper, but presented us with too-dry oxtail meat that lacked a noticeable presence of bone marrow.The unavoidable order at Tuome, however, is the aptly named Pig Out (for two), a dish that comes in a number of components that our table almost couldn't fit. First, there's the 10 cubes of bite-size Berkshire pork belly; they're initially confited and cured in a mixture of thyme, ginger, and salt before they're seared to render the skin to a delightful crispness. The result is a decadent bite, a cube of fatty, tender pork belly supported by a thick, cracker-like layer of skin - a shining example of textural contrast. Two squeeze bottles are presented on the side, one containing a ginger scallion sauce and the other, sambal; both are recommended as accompaniments with the pork belly, and give the much-needed elements of acidity and spice to counter the protein. There's a small arugula salad on the side, served with persimmons and candied walnuts, and a drizzle of balsamic, a much needed break between the bites of pork belly. Each diner recieves a small bowl of Spicy Peanut Noodles as well, which rounds out the carbohydrates in the meal. They're thick, chewy, coated in an addictive chili peanut sauce, and an option that I wish Tuome had as an à la carte Side Dish.Perhaps it's most appropriate to end on the origins of the restaurant's name, which come from Thomas Chen's parents; as first generation immigrants from China, they didn't pronounce his nickname as most would say ""Tommy"", but ""Tow-Me"". It is, in actuality, the ""correct"" pronunciation for Tuome, and the best example I can find for describing Chen's cuisine: unfussy, true to its roots, and an homage to both the East and the West.",13,4,8,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827
5.0,1/27/2015,"Even on a Monday night, Tuome was crowded. We, unfortunately, arrived 30 minutes late but the host didn't have a problem seating us. The space is gorgeous, it's very minimal with exposed brick and a combination of dark and light wood furniture. The bathroom is VERY small. It's literally a closet, it actually might have been a closet at one point. We started with various glasses of wine, which were a little pricey. I had a glass of Riesling which was $13. Beet [$12]: I was impressed with this dish. These beets were easily the best I've ever had. They were so fresh and the candy cane pattern was beautiful. The abundance of quinoa deceived me into believing I was eating something healthy. This was a good thing since the portion was a hefty size. I could've eaten two more plates. Egg [$8]: An upscale deviled egg with an Asian twist.  I was pleased with the slight heat and the fried coating on the outside. There were three to an order. This was not enough. Beef [$29]: Wow. My dining companions and I were completely blown away by the short rib. Completely fork tender and melt in your mouth perfect, you didn't even need a knife. The sweet potato on the side was more of a puree than an actual vegetable. It really doesn't get any better than this. There's no dessert menu, you really only have the option of the Chinese Beignets which comes with caramel [in a squeeze bottle!!], ice cream [drizzled with fruit], and jam. They were kind of small but a nice P.S. after a wonderful meal. We split the bill unevenly, so I ended up paying about $60. Alcohol upped the bill but otherwise Tuome is very affordable and the quality is outstanding.",2,0,0,Felisa F.,"Brooklyn, NY",52,198,192
5.0,1/20/2015,"I had been looking for a special place to eat dinner for my one night in NYC. Luckily for me, the NYMag food issue came out a few weeks prior, and after reading about Tuome, I knew I found my place. We arrived a few minutes before our reservation, but were seated right away at a little table tucked away near the bar. This was the perfect location, as it was not too close to other tables as most of the other seats in the restaurant are. I hate feeling like I am part of someone else's dinner because we are practically seated on top of them. We decided to order a bottle of Rose, because why not? Romantic dinner with my sister, check. The Rose was perfect, not too sweet, and paired well with the Pig Out, since obviously we couldn't come here and not get it. We were going to get some sort of vegetable on the side to balance out the richness of the meal, but at the urging of our server we got the crab mac and cheese as an appetizer. Again, why not? It was incredible. You should get it. As for the Pig Out, as every reviewer has already mentioned, it comes with 10 pieces of succulent pork belly, a little side salad with nuts and persimmon, and 2 bowls of peanut noodles to wash down the decadence. This is definitely the best pork belly I have ever eaten. The crispiness is unparalleled, I didin't even know pork belly could taste like that! The peanut noodles were also amazing, and while our first course was more carby noodle goodness, I easily could have kept eating the peanut noodles all night. The service was great. Not just our server, but all of them. They were fun and interactive, it genuinely seemd like they enjoyed their jobs. We asked for recommendations for nearby bars for drinks afterwards since we were visiting, and a few of them were more than happy to give some recs. I really hope to be back soon, it is on the top of my NYC favorites now!",0,0,0,Caroline K.,"Washington, DC",84,171,26

The restaurant itself is beautiful and has a great intimate atmosphere. The entire experience was great. - Deviled eggs: These come highly recommended from Yelpers. They definitely lived up to the hype. - Mushrooms: These were cooked perfectly and were a pretty large portion. They're not a must-do, however.- Octopus: Definitely recommend the octopus, although we still have no idea what pork xo is. It was very firm and flavorful. Do not miss this appetizer!- Chinese broccoli: We felt we needed a green, and this was a great pick. I loved the sesame flavor. - Pig out: Totally worth the hype. It comes with squares of perfectly cooked pork with crispy skin that are absolutely amazing. It also comes with noodles in a spicy peanut sauce. They entire dish is to die for. It's worth it to come to the restaurant just for this dish!- Beignet dessert: the actual beignet with the caramel was delicious. I didn't love the marmalade, but other than that, I thought it was great. The service was great and the waitress gave us some great recommendations.

We originally had a reservation for two, but since we added a third person last minute they couldn't sit us at a table.Good For: Date, casual friend meet up. Most tables are two tops. It's a small space.Noise Level: Not bad at all considering it is a small space. Service:  5 stars: really friendly staff. Recommendations were on point. Timing with drinks apps, mains, dessert was perfect. Ambiance: Casual and fun. Intimate but not particularly romantic. Rap music playing softly in the background was pretty awesome. Super LES. Food: Uh-mazing. (for three people) The Menu: 2 orders of Deviled eggs (each order comes with 3 egg halves) - the white was deep fried then the deviled egg goodness was scooped on top. Just get it. It is moderately spicy.Chicken Liver mousse (the boys liked this a lot! I didn't try it)Octopus- The octopus itself was typical: grilled perfectly, not chewy, it comes with a foam and this sauce on the side that is awesome. Highly recommend!Chicken- Second best chicken I have ever had in my life. (first best was JG Domestic in Philadelphia). THe chicken is tender and really juicy!! And the Sauce.... THE SAUCE. I just drooled! ha! Also added a side of Chinese broccoli which was the perfect compliment. It was more like broccoli raab fused with Bok Choy. Pig out (for two)- Pork crisped to perfection! And this comes with a side of peanut noodles which was so yummy!  I can't do this dish justice in writing. You need to try it! Dessert: They only offer one dessert but it was awesome! Chinese beignets. WIth ice cream to dip. They came out super hot! I'm not a HUGe dessert person, but YUM! Drinks: Small but great beer selection. Great wine by the glass selection. Value: Worth it!!

And thank goodness my friend & I trekked to the East Village for this. I have no regrets & I will DEFINITELY be returning.My friend & I had to wait around for about 5-10 mins although I made a reservation. But I guess a perk to working late hours is that you don't really have to battle people for a seat, haha.It was fine though - we didn't mind & the hostess offered to get us drinks from the bar while we waited a bit.There's not much seating in Tuome so it makes it a nice place for a date. Dim setting, intimate atmosphere w/ a touch of elegance & simplicity. Just the way I like it.Now let's talk about the food. All I can say is, HOLY COW!Thick noodles w/ a generous serving of spicy peanut sauce smoldering the entire bowl? Why, don't mind if I dig in! Every bite was savory & flavorful. It's a small portion but the richness was enough to keep you satisfied.When the waitress took our order, we first asked her for the pig out for 2. Luckily for us, there was one order let for the night. And hell yes, the pig out for 2 was well worth it. Perfectly seasoned squares of moist meat topped w/ a nice layer of crunchy pig skin. And a small dollop of ginger & pepper sauce? Every bite was amazing and delicious.Sometimes you just don't need a fancy dinner. Tuome brought out the elegance through simplicity.

5.0,1/15/2015,"Dinner here was one of the best surprises of 2014. My friend planned a girls dinner at Tuome. Being an occasional blog reader, I've heard of Tuome but assumed (not entirely sure why) that it was a Latin American restaurant. Little did I know that I would be going to an Asian fusion (possibly my most hated fusion) restaurant that would blow me away. Being Taiwanese, a lot of the flavors were familiar, particularly the dishes the chef, Thomas, kept rather traditional like the sticky rice in banana leaf (zhong zi in chinese) and the peanut noodles (though his are thicker and the sauce more sweet).I enjoyed the service, food and experience so much, I returned again later that month for another great dinner and haven't stopped recommending it to my friends (even via Christmas cards).Absolutely loved: Deviled eggs (could eat a dozen), Chicken (surprising flavor to the porridge), Pig out with peanut noddles, Fried mantou (chinese bun) with red bean and vanilla ice creamReally good: Short Rib, Sticky rice, Oxtail spring rollAverage: Mushrooms",0,0,0,Michelle Y.,"New York, NY",20,59,23
4.0,1/14/2015,"Went here with Kerry P. for a catch up dinner - and I would definitely come back.... but only during light/no jacket season or when there aren't as many people here. The seating is so tight that I was afraid that I would knock off people's dishes/drinks or break some plates and cups. Plus we were sandwiched between a seriously awkward date and a group of really loud and distracting guys.Despite the tight seating, the food was amazing. We had the deviled eggs, chicken liver pâté, pig out & corn. The deviled eggs were quite delicious - they're also breaded & fried which was a nice surprise. It was a really nice start to our meal.The chicken liver pâté was absolutely amazing - it was so smooth and had the perfect texture and perfect mix between sweet and salty. The bread, nuts, sea salt and chicken skins were seriously great additions to the mousse.The corn was also really good. It had a great kick... But our corn was either over cooked or undercooked - the top bits were super dry and dehydrated.But Tuome is known for their Pig Out - for $58, I expected a bit more meat. However, you could have totally just ordered this with a friend and left full... because there was a giant bowl of noodles with the pork. The Pig Out is accompanied by spicy peanut noodles, which were really tasty. So good that if you like peanut butter and spicy food, you really need to come to this place just to have the noodles. It's also accompanied by a refreshing seasonal salad, which balanced well with the heaviness of the noodles and the fried pork. The actual pork part of Pig Out comes with 10 cubes of deliciously cooked pork cubes and two sauces to play with. While the top was crispy and the meat super tasty, I definitely expected either a bigger portion or just more in general for the price.Overall a really enjoyable meal - minus one star because of the corn, tight seating and the surprisingly small pig out (with delicious sides).",0,0,0,Michelle W.,"Manhattan, NY",116,327,83
3.0,1/14/2015,"It's always tricky to take a tried and tested formula and tampering with it hoping to discover something new. I think Tuome fuses Asian and Western styles with mixed success but the dishes that are more Western are better.I came here in a group of 4 - an ideal number for this restaurant - and ordered family style. We got:Deviled Eggs: The Asian version of this classic dish had chilies which really elevated the dish. 5/5Octopus: The octopus was cooked down to the right texture (soft but not mushy) and the fingerling mash potato was buttery delicious. The crunchy bits added texture and savory bites to the dish. 4/5Oxtail spring roll: Way too liberal use of hoisin sauce made the spring rolls too sweet. The savory flavors of the oxtail and the bone marrow were lost. The cumin sauce on the side didn't bring much to the party and didn't go well with the spring rolls. 2/5Pig Out For Two: Their version of  chop shop meat at about 3 times the price. The best part was the crispy skin but the texture of the meat made it seem it was reconstituted and was mushy. The ginger and hot sauces were weak. My least favorite was the mushy, overly sweet peanut noodles on the side. If you have had good chop shop meat, then prepared to be disappointed. 2/5Beef Short Rib: There was nothing fusion about this dish and I think that's probably a good thing. The short ribs were as tender as they come and the flavor was pretty good. 4/5Rice with Kale, Sausage & Duck Fat: Their version of sticky rice. I have to say my aunt-in-law's version is much better and her's is more traditional. The biggest problem with this dish is that the rice was way overcooked had zero texture. 2/5Overall, I would say the food was disappointing but I can see how people might like it more than I did. I set the bar very high when it comes to some of those dishes. The service was excellent throughout. Our waitress was patient, helpful and our water glasses were constantly being refilled without asking for it.

4.0,1/13/2015,"This is my kind of place. Tuome serves serious food with a laid-back vibe. You're getting some of the best food in the city without any of the priss or pretentiousness. The space is beautiful and well thought-out, service is attentive and knowledgeable without the attitude.The deviled eggs are not to be missed. Crunchy, spicy, delightful. The side of brussels keeps the crunch going on and is very interesting with the addition of grapes. The presentation of the octopus is great but the brown butter foam steals the show. The octopus itself isn't awfully exciting and the pork XO is delicious but rather dry. I'd pass on the black bass - nothing to write home about here. The shortrib though... my GOD. The beef nearly caved in on itself when I cut into it, it was that tender and moist. The play of flavors and textures with the sweet potato purée, blistered shishitos, and mushrooms... a seriously fantastic dish.The dessert was one of the best and most fun desserts I've had in a while. Three crispy beignets - still warm, not greasy - served on a board with a ramekin of vanilla ice cream topped with red beans, a smear of yuzu (I think?) marmalade, and a little squeeze bottle of goat milk caramel. Build as you see fit on top of your beignet and enjoy.

Beautiful texture and flavor.OK, the deviled eggs--something I tend not to order as they mostly evoke a bad picnic, but not this time. Creamy, crunchy, spicy and not a hint of sulfur. They are wonderful. You get an order of three halves for the bargain price of $6; order enough for at least a full egg apiece if you can.We then got the Pig-out.  And it is a delicious pig-out, as others have noted. I loved the perfectly chewy texture of the noodles and the slight funk of the pork skin, and the ginger-scallion sauce is something I'm going to attempt to make at home. Fresh, simple and addictive. The persimmon/candied walnut/ arugula salad was also really good. My bitch? The three dishes together were all on the sweet side. Give me a hot-sour salad to cut the richness and the sugar of the other two dishes. We also got a side of Chinese broccoli, which was straight out of Chinatown in a good way. And the fish sauce was a nice break from sweetness.Nice, small but well-chosen wine list. We got the Fleurie, a light red which is just right with the pork.We might have gotten dessert, but the only choice was beignets. They looked lovely, but this is not an ideal ending to a Pig-out.

So good that I felt compelled to come back out of my Yelping hiatus to sing their praises.Standout dishes for us were the Octopus in XO sauce, and deviled eggs. In a completely different league of it's own is the Pig-Out for two!!!Delicious cubes of melt in your mouth Berkshire pork belly with an impossibly thin and crispy top skin. I have never seen the skin done so well - this could very well be the BEST pork belly I've ever. Needless to say my belly was quite pleased to have the acquaintance of this pork belly. The only weak point of this dish, and really the only weak point of the 7 dishes we had in total, was the accompanying peanut noodle for the Pig Out. It was a bit bland while being paradoxically heavy.That aside, Tuome finished strong with their Chinese beignets done two ways, savoury and sweet. We couldn't decide which one to get... so we just got both.And they were excellent! However, I should caution that if you're getting pretty full at this point, the cheeses that accompany the savoury beignets are enough to be shared between 2 people running low on gastric space.However. If you are a remorseless eating machine with a bit of a sweet tooth, get the sweet one for yourself. Sharing not an option. (And then eat some of your date's savoury beignets too)To cap it off, the service was efficient, the atmosphere cosy, and the maitre'd a riot.

3.0,12/11/2014,"Went here for my bday with a couple of friends. Tuome is a good restaurant but not really terribly different from a decent Chinese restaurant.  We started off with drinks at the bar-unfortunately, they don't carry liquor so they didn't have cocktails.  However, their wines were excellent and reasonably priced. We moved onto appetizers where we got the octopus, the mushrooms and the deviled eggs. The octopus was awesome-totally worth the price. The deviled eggs were an interesting spin on regular deviled eggs-the eggs white is breaded and deep-fried, adding a crunchy texture and richer taste. However, they didn't taste particularly Chinese to me. The mushrooms were also good and perhaps the most Chinese tasting IMO of the appetizers. We ordered the chicken, short ribs, scallops and a vegetarian dish for our main course. The chicken was pretty forgettable-it didn't taste Chinese at all until you ate the charred lettuce (I wish there had been more of that). The scallops and the vegetarian dishes were decent but the short ribs were excellent, tender and tasting of star anise. Beignets rounded out our evening-they were decent but I couldn't see the connection between them and Chinese cuisine. Definitely a decent restaurant. Would I come back given the price point?  Probably not-I could eat just as well for much cheaper at a regular Chinese place. It's a pity because I feel that the chef is restraining himself from a bolder menu-hopefully, he decides to amp it up (perhaps add flavor points from different regional Chinese cuisines?) and really accentuate Chinese flavors.",0,1,0,Shane A.,"New York, NY",9,29,0

4.0,11/25/2014,"KenScale: 8.0/10It's always hard to pull off the East-meets-the-West cuisine. While there may be some conceptual brilliance by combining the ingredients and flavor of two different worlds, the execution is easier said than done. I've always approached these types of ""fusion"" places with a bit of caution knowing that what sounds like a novel idea doesn't always pan out. At Tuome, Thomas Chen (a vet of Eleven Madison Park) has done a nice job of balancing both the concept and the execution. While many of the dishes looked inventive, they were also generally well-balanced in flavor and texture. I started out my dinner with a couple of appetizers. Octopus with pork XO, brown butter and fingerling potato was somewhat pedestrian despite my high expectations for how XO can add another dimension of flavor to octopus, but I liked oxtail spring roll with bone marrow and cumin, a pleasant dish each time I took a bite with rich flavor. The restaurant's signature dish is the so-called ""Pig Out"" for two that consists of ten pieces of Berkshire pork belly that came with spicy peanut noodle. Each piece was perfectly cooked without being too stuffy, and I savored every bite of the crispy edge and the soft meat. Spicy peanut noodle was also delicious, but I was a bigger fan of the rice side dish that came with Chinese sausage wrapped in kale. I generally don't like sticky rice, but this worked very well with the pork belly. Somehow, the meaty and sticky texture gave a unique sensation that I enjoyed very much. For dessert, Chinese beignet that you can combine with apple jam, vanilla ice cream, red bean paste and caramel was a delightful dish that ended my meal on the right note. The decor and vibe of the cozy dining room is pretty typical of a neighborhood restaurant in East Village. Getting a reservation wasn't particularly hard, although I think this place deserves more love. The restaurant has only beer and wine options, but a couple glasses of refreshing white wine worked pretty well with the dishes. Tuome is a welcome addition to the East Village and NYC dining scene, and I will definitely come back to try other inventive dishes coming out from the kitchen.",3,0,2,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738
4.0,11/19/2014,"While browsing the NYT, I stumbled upon the review for Tuome which painted a picture of an accountant raised by traditional Chinese parents, who decided to open up his own restaurant after working at Eleven Madison Park. I love stories like these of 8-5 workers who colored inside the lines and then decided to pursue their passion anyways, regardless of the instability, insecurity, and unknown it might give. With a little juggling, we managed to score an 8pm reservation at Tuome. The restaurant facade is how the article describes it, brick walls, but with a little flair. The lighting was dim enough to set a romantic mood, and each table was set with small jars of lavender, tres chic. Amuse bouche was light and a nice slow introduction, (papaya salad).We started with the oxtail spring roll appetizer, and while the essence of bone marrow was not obvious to me, I preferred it that way. Instead the flavors were more in line with the beef itself. The wrapper was fried lightly, without the overpowering oil that encompasses most spring rolls. Of course, we had to try to Pig Out, there really was no other option. I was however surprised with how delicious it was. Each little piece of pork belly was fried with a crispy top and soft and juicy undersurface. I've had my fair share of pork belly, but I've never had pork belly like this.  Surprisingly, I enjoyed the noodles just as much. Each bowl was a large serving of thick, al dente noodles covered in an ode to peanut sauce.We also ordered an obligatory vegetable dish (corn and curry with kaffir lime), which was just as perfectly seasoned as everything else, although it was slightly heavy with the creaminess, but I'm sure some people like it that way. We were extremely full and satisfied. Based on the other reviews, I knew I was going to get a great meal. I will say though that the food had more Southeast Asian flavors than say Chinese flavors. Go into it with an empty belly and you wil be rewarded.What to say yes to: - Early Reservations- Casual but classy attire- Pig Out",1,0,1,Mar C.,"Manhattan, NY",66,153,10
4.0,11/18/2014,"So, I think the real question is...how do you pronounce this place? Tu-ome, T-u-owe-me? OK - I digress. Anyway...I was lured here by the decadent looking ""Pig Out for Two,"" but before I describe my experience with that, I must say...1) the deviled eggs here are in a league of its own - lightly fried with a bit of chopped pickles mixed in the inside filling to give some freshness to an otherwise rich bite. 2) corn with curry and kaffir lime was also an excellent side that had well balanced flavors and textures. 3) octopus dish was well prepared, but was a bit overly complicated.The Pig Out, actually, turned out to be the most underwhelming aspect of the night. The pork are little squares of the same suckling pig you'd find in Chinatown and the flavors of the peanut noodles are pretty one note. Sure, it's tasty, but you've tasted this before if you're accustomed to eating Chinese/Asian food in general.The service and ambiance were also a highlight - you can tell the proprietors are well versed in the standards of service at a swanky restaurant, but it is translated in an approachable and friendly way here. Seriously, everyone here was super friendly.Overall, 4 Stars - I had a very positive experience and thoroughly enjoyed most parts of the meal. The Pig Out was a miss for me, but I can see most people digging it.And, for the record, i think it's pronounced ""T-u-owe-me"".",1,1,1,Melissa C.,"Queens, NY",100,108,13

3.0,11/16/2014,"We made reservations after reading the Pete Wells review in the NYT.  The food was good, but didn't live up to our expectations from the review.Food:Deviled Eggs: I love deviled eggs, and I've never had a fried one.  While it was fried in a light batter, the frying still made the dish feel heavy.  I was looking for something acidic to cut through the greasiness, but there simply wasn't enough of the chili topping to add the acidity and heat the eggs needed.  I think it could have been substantially better with more heat.Oxtail Spring Rolls: I love bone marrow.  Absolutely love it.  I could eat bone marrow on toast points all day if you offered it to me.  The spring rolls were perfectly crisp, but I felt the bone marrow-intensity was lost somewhere in the roll.  It tasted good, but it reminded me of a frozen flauta, and that's not the kind of food I had in mind when I came to Tuome.Pig Out: This was the highlight of the meal. The sear on the pork was perfect - it crunched and then melted in your mouth fatty-goodness.  It pleasantly reminded me of one cut of the best Peking duck that I've tried in Beijing.  The peanut noodles seemed like an afterthought.  They weren't spicy at all, and the sauce was bland.  They just made me want to switch them out with some Dan Dan noodles from Han Dynasty. Rice with Chinese Sausage: Was good, but not memorable.  I think it could benefit from more Chinese sausage, or using Chinese sausage that has a more anisey taste (granted, I really love Chinese sausage). Service/Decor: The service was impeccable.  Our host and waitress were both great - attentive and friendly without being intrusive.  The decor is warm and inviting, and belies how small the restaurant actually is.Overall, the meal had it's ups and downs, but I will definitely come back in a few months to see if they've made some tweaks to the menu.  Tuome definitely shows promise, but the food is a little unremarkable at this stage.",0,0,0,Michael B.,"New York, NY",275,11,0
5.0,11/15/2014,"Fortune smiled brightly upon us the evening we decided to try Tuome. I lucked out on a last-second OpenTable Hail Mary, and that solid New York Times review posted as we walked up to the door. About an hour later, the flood gates of food bloggerdom opened with boundless fury. Anyway, to the important stuff: the ambience is unremarkable, in the best way. The same with the service, save the very helpful ear of the manager, who was quick to make a different wine suggestion after eavesdropping on our server. The chicken liver small plate was terrific. Creamy, rich and spot-on. We ordered the pork entree for two, and that sealed our eternal allegiance. The pork belly was - no hyperbole, people - hands down the best I've had in my life. The outer skin was cooked to crackling grade while the inside remained juicy and soft as butter. I can't even remember the Ramen (or whatever came along with it), and I don't care.

Wine list offers a bunch of options in the $45 - $65 range, but enough pretense, let's get to the food:They brought out tiny papaya salads as an amuse bouche, which was a thoughtful and delicious start to the meal.Deviled eggs, with their crunchy exterior, were terrific.  Serving comes with three half-eggs.  We ordered oxtail spring rolls as our other appetizer (two per serving) and they were tasty, but were a clear second-place to the deviled eggs.I almost didn't order the short rib entree because of my dislike of sweet potato, but thankfully went with my gut.  The meat was flavorful and tender and the sweet potato puree was unbelievable.  If they packaged that puree for take-away, they would create an army of Thanksgiving MVPs.The missus ordered the chicken entree, which she said she loved.  (I was too busy ogling our side dishes to taste her meal.)  The corn, with creme fraiche and curry, was a revelation.  The rice, packed with chinese sausage inside a kale leaf, would be the best dish at dozens of comparable restaurants.Believe the hype and bump Tuome way up your restaurant to-try list.",2,1,1,Tom E.,"Manhattan, NY",6,47,1
4.0,11/13/2014,"I've been lucky enough to dine here twice already. The first time was a more formal dinner to discuss a little business. Luckily, I was dining with two other food-lovers and we dived into the menu with a gusto. We had the octopus and another app (can't remember it for the life of me!) to start and we all shared the Pig Out for 2 and the Scallop entree. The food was great, but talking shop over dinner leaves a lot of time for the food to get cold, and sadly my peanut noodles suffered for my non-stop conversation. The Pig Out was great, but the scallops were just okay. Not one flavor really stands out in my mind from the scallop dish. We also ordered a bottle of the Malbec. After the meal, we were talked into the only dessert option they had, which was described as Asian beignets served with some ice cream. We got it, but my group was not impressed.Although I got a nice feel of the place that first time, it was hard to really enjoy it. I was eating with professional food bloggers whom I just met, and I was trying to be on my best in terms of my table manners. I'm not big on snapping pics, so I had to restrain myself from attacking each plate as it was set down so that my companions could snap some lovely shots for their various sites. I don't blame them. The food presentation is lovely; a real feast for your eyes, and it was all delicious.I had to give this place another shot on a night I could eat unrestrained. My cousin and I started with the beet salad which was fresh with bright, summer flavors. The Pig Out came next with a side of corn and brussel sprouts. We also shared a bottle of Malbec. Being able to actually ""pig out"" on the Pig Out was a whole different experience this time. I was able to reach over to smear more ginger sauce and chili sauce over each bite of pork and I could accompany my mouthful with frequent trips to the side of greens without worrying about offending my dinner companion. I unabashedly dipped my spoon or fork into the bowl of corn and brussel  sprouts without fear of seeming rude. My dining experience was much more relaxed and I was able to enjoy the food much more. Everything was delicious. We cleaned our plates and opted to skip dessert. The service, as it was the first time, was on point without a single hitch. They were even patient enough to let me sit at the table as I waited on my cousin who was running half an hour late! I guess the only real drawback for me is the price. The price tag on my second meal was upwards of $150 for just the two of us. (Not including the tip.) While it was all fantastic food, I will say that the prices are a shade high for the portion sizes and you won't find a bottle of wine under $45. While I'd love to make this a regular destination for fantastic crispy-skinned pork, the price points will relegate it to one of those special occasion spots, as far as my budget goes.  But, hey, if money is no object and your tummy gets what your tummy wants, I would recommend Tuome without any hesitation. Great for dates and intimate dinners. It gets kind of crowded in this cozy spot, so if you're thinking of doing a group gathering, try to keep your party small. The desserts could use some work, (and if they are in the market for a pastry chef: CALL ME!!) I would suggest to skip their dessert and grab your coffee and sweets elsewhere.",5,2,2,Katherine M.,"Queens Village, NY",104,178,10

5.0,11/11/2014,"Hands down one of the best meals I've had here in NYC. I've had my eye on Tuome (pronounced Toe-may, since the chef's Asian mother couldn't pronounce Tommy) for quite some time now. The small menu was a little bit of a turn off so it took me a little while to get the urge to check this place out, but I am so glad I did.It seems like the star on the menu here is the pig out for two, but that wasn't that attractive to me and they were out of it anyways by the time we got there around 9. For starters, we shared the octopus and the oxtail spring rolls. These two dishes and the sides were what initially attracted me to come here. The octopus was cooked perfectly, not too chewy or rubbery like many places. The potato foam that the put on at our table was cool to witness and added a great variety of flavor along with the pork xo. Only complaint I had with this dish was that the pork xo was a little too salty for my liking. The oxtail spring rolls came next and these were equally great. The star of the dish was the cumin dipping sauce. It was just too good and we ended up saving it to use on our other dishes. If they bottled that sauce and sold it, I think it would be a huge hit.Next along came our entrees, the scallops and skate, along with a side of the highly praised corn. Honestly, I can't stop thinking about how delicious the scallop dish was. I am always hesitant to get them because they end up being quite boring and bland, but here it was not the case. They were cooked perfectly and served with a flavorful foie gras sauce and carrot purée. The execution of this dish totally blew my taste buds away. Now every time I see scallops on a menu at a different restaurant, I don't even bother because Tuome has set the standards pretty damn high! As for the skate, I had a little bit of my friends and enjoyed it like the rest of the food, especially because cauliflower was incorporated in the dish. The only disappointment I had with this meal was the corn. It was an attractive and flavorful combination of curry, lime, and creme fraiche, but a good amount of the kernels were dried up and chewy, so we weren't really able to enjoy the side dish. Despite that, the rest of the meal was flawless and still earns 5 stars in my book.",2,1,0,Justin H.,"Manhattan, NY",143,113,1634

I arrived in Tuome around 6:15 am on a thursday night. The place is a small brightly lit restaurant with a resemblance to typical decorated restaurants from the 20th century really stands out on the street it is also very very small there are barely any tables and space is a big issue here. Anyway I did wait for my dinner companion to show I ordered the pig out for 2, oxtail spring roll, and the chicken liver. I will start with the liver its small the tiny bits of golden toasted bread fits in your finger its real crispy the dip is made into a donut shape with a syrupy paste of sweetness. It was very enjoyable and filling. The oxtail roll was basically two thinnly shaped rolls filled ox bone marrow paired with a green dipping sauce with a touch of cumin the sauce was a little on the sweet side and the roll was heavy as well. Now the entree was presented to us on a platter evenly spaced cubes of berkshire pork with the crunchy skin along with an argula decoration of toasted honey walnuts and wedge cut baby persimmons, it was also accompanied by a peanut paste noodles.

4.0,10/27/2014,"Huge fan of this interesting new spot! I made a reservation for Saturday night at 9:00 after reading the great review on Eater a few days before. We arrived right on time to a cute, tightly packed little place on 5th street. The decor is rustic LES with the crowd reflecting that. If you have a reservation don't plan on showing up a little early to maybe have a drink at the bar and wait for your table. This place only has beer and wine and they seat diners at the bar so there is literally nowhere to stand. We were definitely in the way. When the time reached 9:15 a very nice gentleman that I think was the manager came over and offered us a glass of cava on the house to apologize for the wait, score! We were finally seated close to 9:30 at a cozy little table in the corner of the back room. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars was due to the amount of time between when we ordered and when we received our food...it was a REALLY long time but we weren't complaining because it was date night and we were enjoying our super interesting bottle of the Italian red they offer. To start we ordered the deviled eggs and if you only order 1 thing, this must be it! It was fabulous! I can't even begin to describe the intricicaies but trust me, it's a must order. All of the sides sounded so great  I decided to make that my meal, the corn with the kiffer lime and creme, the roasted brussel sprouts and the chinese rice with sausage. The corn is downright addictive, the brussle sprouts were charred goodness and the rice comes wrapped in a banana leave that when opened wafts the most lucious perfume of lemongrass, sticky rice and Asian seasonings.

4.0,10/26/2014,"One of the best new restaurants I've tried this year.  I really enjoyed every dish we had which happens infrequently.This is a great neighborhood restaurant as well as one worth travelling for.I loved all the Asian ingredients and components in each dish.  I thought every dish was well balanced...you can taste the ingredients but none were overpowering.  Amuse-bouche - I like the fine dining touch without having to go to a fine dining establishment.  The papaya salad and tomatoes was a lovely little bite with just enough fish sauce to taste but not turn pungent.Oxtail spring rolls - two cigar-like rolls with crispy, golden skin.  The meaty oxtail and cumin flavors came through and the bone marrow added richness.  The green dipping sauce was fresh and almost palate cleansing.Octopus - Yes, the octopus was tender.  But what I really loved was the pork XO and brown butter fingerling foam.  The pork XO flavor was spot on and provided crispy little nuggets of texture.  While most foams are airy and disappear, the texture of the  fingerling foam coats the tongue so you can taste the buttery goodness. We scraped every bit off the plate.  Pig Out for Two - this dish is not as overwhelming as it may appear in pictures.  The pork cubes are not as large in person but are still very satisfying.  For $49, it's worth it because it comes with a filling bowl of noodles for each person.  As comparison, other entrees range  $23-$28 depending on the current menu.  The Berkshire pork was tender and juicy with crispy skin.  The ginger scallion sauce & sambal sauce were great condiments to put on each bite of pork.  I usually have ginger scallion sauce with boiled chicken rice dishes I get in Chinatown BBQ places, so this was a new pairing for me to have it with pork.  And it was just as delicious.  The spicy peanut noodles has a nice level of heat and is not lacking in peanuttiness.  And the fresh persimmon & arugula salad was pretty and helped balance the rich flavors of the pork and noodles.The menu notes the Pig Out is limited quantity and I'm not sure how often or when they sell out.  But there were a LOT of orders for this dish.  (We got there at 6:05 on Sat. for a walk-in party of 2.) Corn side dish - the kaffir lime and curry were so delicious with the corn.  It is a very good sized portion for a side at $8 considering the quality of food here.  Definitely recommend this.Seriously a delicious meal.",7,1,3,Nicole D.,"New York, NY",20,346,225

3.0,10/7/2014,"Went there on a Friday night. The environment is nice to hang out casually with friends. A bit on the loud side, i can imagine it to be a local neighborhood gem. The service was good and accommodating as i was running late for the reservationThe menu is small and simple. For apps, we had the chicken liver spread and oxtail spring roll. The spread was what you would expect and it was good. The spring roll was also good but it seems a bit of a waste to use expensive ingredients as oxtail and bone marrow in a fried spring roll.  For entree, we had the ""pig out for two"", which reminds me a chinese traditionally prepared pork. The crispy skin was delicious and the pork was great quality. Although i have to say for $49, it was a bit pricey for about 10 pieces of meat. This place is a solid offering and would be interested to return if they change up the menu.",0,0,0,Martin L.,"Brooklyn, NY",29,147,1
5.0,10/5/2014,"What a fantastic gem of a place! The menu at Tuome is concise and tight, and to good end since every item on the menu beckons at me and every dish I ordered did not result in regret. The food is New American with a tinge of Asian - they either have an Asian staple (the chicken with porridge), an Asian ingredient (soft shell crab) or an Asian spice (beef with shishito).The space is small and cozy, and seats probably 20 people. The tables are a tad bit small, especially when the menu lends itself better to sharing a bunch of small plates, but I guess we always make do with the restrictions imposed upon us. The prices are reasonable for the meal - expect to pay $23-$28 for an entree.On to the food! Everything was good, but because some dishes were better than others, a few dishes paled in comparison but they were by no means of inferior quality.I loved the sweetness the maple syrup brought to the classic starter of chicken liver mousse, but pace yourself as it's a pretty rich dish. The soft shell crab was plenty light and crispy with a tangy lime sauce that went along with it. The scallops were cooked perfectly and the foie gras sauce was so rich and delicious. I also had the bone marrow oxtail spring rolls, but I'm not that fond of deep fried stuffed sticks in a nice restaurant.You can imagine, by this point, the amount of fat and cholesterol were getting to me and I could barely chow down the creme fraiche corn even though it was tasty.

4.0,9/30/2014,"Directly adjacent a supremely over-hyped ramen shop and across from an underrated burger joint on an otherwise unassuming stretch of Alphabet City lies the newest scenester darling - Tuome. Aside from the dim lighting of Edison bulbs casting a flatteringly warm glow off the requisite exposed brick, the flocks (the young, the wishing to be younger, the moneyed, the hangers-on to the moneyed) congregate here primarily for the pedigree. Listing Eleven Madison Park on a resumé seems to be a prerequisite to opening a well-received restaurant these days, and talking about said chef experience for the duration of the meal (and throughout the walk up the street and the wait outside) seems to be a prerequisite to being a diner at one. Given the small quarters you're confined in, this can make the ambiance a bit...strained. This is obviously not the fault of the restaurant. Asshats, like cancer, crop up when you least expect them, and are difficult to drive off once they're in. But a measure of good restaurants is how they are handled. Tuome's handling of asshats was exemplary. As M and I were leaving, one particularly ardent little tree troll grabbed his ill-fitting vest in a blustery rage, excoriating the hostess over the table she had chosen for he and his reservation-less date in spite of the relatively scant wait he experienced. I imagine he felt that hiding his bald-spot would be a rather difficult undertaking if he was to be seated in the center of the room. He was quickly and graciously whisked to a table along the wall while the center tables were hastily reconfigured for an impatient party of four. Such graciousness extends beyond dealing with shocking displays of douchebaggery. When M and I first visited, we were informed that the last order of the ""Pig Out"" had just been sold. Stunning, as the restaurant had only been open for two hours, and was not overly crowded. As that was the sole reason we had come, and given the scarce alternatives available (shellfish allergies meant that a large swath of the menu was off-limits), we left, vowing to return. Most servers would roll their eyes in disbelief and disappointment, but ours seemed genuinely apologetic, and when we returned the very next evening, was genuinely welcoming. That alone would have been enough, but the manager surprised us with complimentary glasses of wine (the wine list, while short, is rather accessible and interesting) for ""the second chance."" Unless you're in the industry (and are well-enough known), or are personal friends with the staff, such gestures are exceedingly rare. The fact that this one was made on a busy Saturday night in a very young restaurant speaks volumes, and bodes well for the service standards. Ultimately, however, food will always merit more weight in the spectrum of judgment, and unfortunately, was the sole area in which Tuome had a misstep. The fare started out promising enough, with an amuse of pickled papaya, heirloom tomatoes, and thin slivers of deeply fried taro root. Funky, earthy, acidic -- all proper notes given the idea of New American with Chinese influences. The optimism continued with our appetizer of watermelon, ricotta, farro and chrysanthemum. The creamy ricotta was the perfect blank canvas for the sweet, perfectly ripe watermelon and nutty, crunchy farro. The lightly tannic florality of chrysanthemum tied it all together, leaving each bite a bracingly cool affair. The presentation of these items, as with all the dishes, was tastefully artistic without being overly manipulated. Whatever Chef Chen retained from EMP, it was not an over-reliance on tweezers. Good thing, as the ""Pig Out"" as a dish for two, is not exactly conducive to that style. It was only fitting, in a karmic sense, that the ""Pig Out"" was the least impressive dish of the evening.  Most crucially, the pork was dry. The shatteringly crisp crust is wonderful on a technical and textural level, but when the meat beneath is closer to bagel than Berkshire, it becomes much harder to appreciate. There is also the uncomfortable reality of paying just shy of $50 for a borderline paltry portion of pork. This is a shame, as the house made sambal and peanut noodles are exemplary, if a touch sweet, almost redeeming the price of admission. The price has already been lowered from $58, but the path of redemption lies in offering richer cuts (which paradoxically may be cheaper). Go for other large dishes until then. As a side, we ordered the curried corn, lathered in crème fraiche and kaffir lime juice. The corn was another success, marrying the gentle, building heat of the curry with the subtle sweetness and firm richness of the crème fraiche, kaffir lime providing the necessary acid, leaving three out of our four dishes as great.Pedigree, however highly valued, does not always equate to prowess. But it can, and does at Tuome.",7,2,6,Jordan S.,"Manhattan, NY",865,273,672

4.0,9/25/2014,"Come here and do the Pig Out for Two. It's hecka good. I could go into detail about how wholly well-constructed this dish is, but you should just eat it. Peanut noodles are chewy and rich and (maybe too) heavy, but you're a pig anyway, so enjoy. Also recommend the octopus appetizer (in a chunky xo sauce that I could've eaten by the bowlful). They do that BS thing where they siphen foam onto the dish in front of you, but I forgive them because it was some of the best octopus I've had in the city.I'm giving it four stars because there was only one other couple in the restaurant when I came in (at 8pm on a Thursday) and, besides the Blackstreet and Outkast soundtrack, it was painfully quiet for like half an hour. The space is beautiful though, really warmly-lit and perfect for a date, even though my date was a total dud.

4.0,9/23/2014,"The Pig Out (for two) was what we went to Tuome for and when we were seated at a table at 8pm, our server quickly informed us that they had run out of that popular dish. After just two hours! The opposite of the Guile theme flooded our minds, so we went back (!)...the very next day (!!)...because we're the most level-headed people ever...? We're probably just crazy. We went back right at 6pm the next night and were thanked profusely for coming back. We were even given complimentary glasses of white wine as a token of their appreciation which was such an unexpected, kind gesture. So, folks - go as close to opening time as possible if you're interested in getting the Pig Out. We started with the watermelon salad appetizer after an amazing amuse bouche of pickled papaya and tomatoes. The watermelon salad's four huge chunks of juicy, sweet watermelon were served on top of creamy ricotta with a generous sprinkle of crispy farro and a less generous sprinkle of chrysanthemum. This was a refreshing, summery appetizer, and the different textures worked so well together. We also ordered a side of corn topped with kaffir lime, curry, and crème fraiche. I couldn't really taste the curry, but it was a very rich, creamy dish. It was surprisingly quite large, though. Only for hungry folks!The Pig Out included pieces of cut Berkshire pork served with two condiments: a ginger scallion sauce in a mortar, and a lime sambal in a small squeeze bottle. There was also a small peach salad on the side with a scattering of wonderfully candied walnuts. The presentation was incredibly artistic and appetizing and I couldn't wait to dig in. Unfortunately, the pork pieces, though having been cooked for 15 hours, were not as soft as I had anticipated nor did they have an element of oomph I was looking for. There was a great crisp to the tops of them, but there seemed to be very little meat. Maybe I just like my meat a little fattier and less crispy? I did appreciate the flavorful condiments and the bowl of peanut noodles (two bowls came per order). Each spicy bowl was also very generous, so we definitely left stuffed. In true East Village form, Tuome has a rustic feel with one marvelous light fixture over the bar. Likelihood of another visit:Perhaps.

Yes, I did eat prior to arriving but to get the feel of a new restaurant I prefer to have a few drinks at the bar, chat up the staff, and peruse the menu.I attempted to sit at one of the empty bar stools when a staff member informed me that ""chef"" prefers only diners at his bar.WHAT? It's the bar I wanted to sit at, not a table, and the restaurant was just about empty!I thought to myself: chef should then remove the bar and replace it with tables.While deciding what to do I was given a brief speech about the restaurant by a knowledgeable employee.I checked out the menu to see if there was something light I could order and immediately noticed the high prices, especially for the East Village.An owner should know that just because you hire a line cook from a Michelin restaurant, that doesn't mean you're a Michelin restaurant and can charge the same.

I really only want to give 2 stars because the chef/restaurant refuses to make any adjustments to their menu even for allergies. My boyfriend is allergic to dairy and if a fish or meat is cooked in butter, usually a chef/restaurant will adjust to cook in oil. They wouldn't do that. We asked if they could serve a few of the entrees without the part of the dish that had dairy (like potatoes under the chicken) and they wouldn't do that, they wouldn't even agree to bring all elements just serve on different plates.

It was that good). Chicken Liver: Great but nothing to write home about. Plus we thought the bread to mousse ratio was a bit off and wished there was a bit more bread to slather on some more of the chicken liver mousse. Oxtail Spring Rolls: The creamy cilantro sauce really put it over the top. I'd get it just for thatPig Out (for 2): Loved it- the crispy crispy skin on the pork with the delicious ginger/scallion condiment with the spicy peanut noodles... yum A+! Corn: Kaffir Lime-y, curry-ish goodness. Unexpected flavor profile in a seemingly innocent side dish. Packed a flavor punch and was quite deliciousSummer Sundae: Citron was an interesting touch. For me, the texture of the ice cream was the star of this dessert The service was awesome and I thought everyone was super personable and friendly. The food has a lot of Asian flavors [Pig Out reminds me of Filipino Lechon Kawali, while the noodles remind me of something I've had at my boyfriend's house with his family (he's Chinese), and I feel the corn had definite Thai influence] and was executed perfectly. The ambiance is great and the venue has a lot of personality. Ok I'm going to have a fangirl moment now-Chef Chen (say that 5 times fast, I dare you) came out to speak to us. He's young, he's cute, and he can cook. HAYYYYY ~~(sorry, boyfriend)  He was so humble and clearly cares about his menu and his patrons' experience. I think I might have scared him a little bit when I blurted out ""THOMAS CHEN?!?!"" when he came over to our table. The highlight of my night was his answer to one of my questions. Me: The menu clearly has a lot of Asian influence.. would you say your food is remotely fusion-y? Chef Chen: I don't really like the term ""fusion"". I like to call it New American. Couldn't have said it better myself.

4.0,9/6/2014,"Saw this new place on Yelp, decided to try it out. After a bad experience at a newly opened restaurant recently, I was pretty skeptical about trying out anything opened for less than one month. However, A group of five went there on a Saturday night and the experience was beyond expectation. After being seated promptly, our waitress was helpful and recommended several very good dishes. We shared Deviled eggs, soft shelled crab, and octopus as starters. Deviled eggs were fried on the outside, very interesting texture contrast and who doesn't like fried eggs? Octopus was tender and flavors were spot on. We also got all four sides to share along with our main dishes. Rice was unanimously the favorite of the table, so do get that if you only want to order one side. For main, I had Skate. I can see the plate being very yummy because all the veggies on the plate and the sauce worked very well together, but the more I ate the skate, the more I caught this ammonia taste in my mouth, so unfortunately I had to leave more than half of the fish on the plate. It's partially myself to blame because if I remember correctly skate, rays, etc. excrete urine through the skin, so unless it's being prepared properly, you would get some weird taste to it. The Skate dish was the sole reason I took one star off the review, hence a 4. I tried my husband's scallop and it was cooked perfectly. Our cousin's Short rib plate also looked amazing. Also even though they don't have dessert on the menu, our waitress did tell us they have some special dessert sundae, which turned out to be a huge hit. All in all, very positive experience, Eleven Madison Park-trained Chef Thomas Chen obviously know what he's doing (minus skate...).",3,0,1,Lu H.,"New York, NY",294,570,1967
4.0,9/5/2014,"Excellent food and service, very pretty decor and quiet (we were the only table on a Wednesday night until about 20 minutes into dinner when two more filled). We had the deviled eggs (covered in breadcrumbs and flash fried) which were really good.  The soft shell crab was delicious and perfectly cooked. Same for the skate, which had amazing flavors/sauce. The only negative is that the skate serving was small and there were hardly any veggies with it. Like a tablespoonful of cauliflower purée and literally two pea tendrils.  Delicious but measly.  Luckily we got the side of snap peas which were incredible!  But, I really feel if you're paying entree prices that it should come with more veggies, especially if they're described as accompanying the dish. The menu has almost non existent vegetarian options aside from the eggs and a couple side dishes.  Disappointed in that.  But if you eat and like pork (which I don't), you're in luck as many of the dishes have it. Really weird thing was that someone started mopping the floor in the middle of dinner. Not because of a spill, just mopping the entire floor including in between our table and the next one.  Very strange, particularly for a higher end restaurant and chef.",0,0,0,A T.,"New York, NY",1,70,1
5.0,8/30/2014,"Let me tell you something. I had this place (Tuome) on my Fatboy radar for a couple of weeks ever since I saw a picture of their Pig Out (for 2) a couple of weeks ago on some website. I told my girlfriend that we have to go here before they get too popular and cut the portion size in half like most new restaurants do after the beginning stages. I'm not gonna drag this out. The Pig Out is a must if its 2 people. It takes around 25 mins to make so be ready to wait or get an appetizer of your hungry. Although its smaller than I expected that pork was crispy on the outside and soft and mmmmm on the inside. I couldn't stop smiling. It came with a ginger sauce, some type of spicy red pepper sauce an a salad with candied walnuts and apples. PURE MOUTH SEX!!!!! The Pig Out also comes with 2 bowls of spicy peanut noodles that I inhaled LIKE A BAWSE. The corn is also a great addition with its curry, cream fresh and lime flavor. They also start you with some sort of palate cleanser that I think had pickled papaya, tomato and some crispy shit. Oooooh my nipples are getting hard just thinking about it. It's a smallish place and Im sure glad I went with just one other person. It was getting pretty busy a couple hours after it opened so GO EARLY. Servers were great and always around.

4.0,8/27/2014,"Early Wednesday night dinner choice was to try Tuome cause 1) past kitchen credentials of chef 2) passed by last week & was inviting c) menu was intriguing. We tend to have a smaller appetite than most so we went in focused. The menu had a lot of choices for the adventurous. So we (2 diners) chose the watermelon & chicken liver starters. These were preceded by their amuse bouche of green papaya with tomatoes salad. Great & refreshing.The cold starters were fresh & delighted our palate with contrasts. Watermelon with ricotts & hint of mint was lovely. Then to switch to the savory chicken liver mousse was so enjoyable, probably because we love chicken livers. But to combine bits of garlic, pumpkin seeds & salt was a little work to get us thinking.The main came, their short rib with sweet potato puree (so yummy) and shishito peppers. This was a delicate short rib but we wished for more puree!!! We also ordered 2 sides which were their corn in curry yogurt and sticky rice with kake & chinese sausage. The corn had an unexpected twist with the curry yogurt but we were more surprised with the hint of heat in the rice. We asked and it was sambal lime!! I love spicy so this was a baby kick that we didnt mind at all. Their dessert choice seemed like an afterthought. It was vanilla ice cream with seasonal berries and what tasted like kumquat syrup. It was refreshing because it was a 90 degree day (we chose a dry rose bottle for that reason) but was just enough to share. I ended up eating most of it because i wasnt as full (ahem).All in all, we were happy with our dining experience and hope people dont catch on so this place stays airy & relaxed.",1,0,0,Mary M.,"Queens, NY",4,15,43

3.0,8/23/2014,"It is 3.5 but I tend to leave it as 3 stars.Frankly, I was a bit disappointed. Prob because I had a high expectation based on the chef's background -EMP vet and Mike C's review. And probably because I picked the wrong seat - at the bar as I usually did when dinning alone: since the restaurant is small the kitchen entrance was right in front of me so the whole night I was watching people running around. Not what I expected while I want a peaceful dinner.I stop whining here, onto the food. Overall is good with space to improve. I got the watermelon salad with ricotta and crispy farros to start, which was one of the most creative dish of that night. The watermelon was, well, as watermelon should be - juicy, sweet and fresh, and perfectly balanced with the creamy ricotta and crunchy farro. Only small complaint, the chunk was too big that I had to cut it into 4 smaller squares. Not a deal breaker. I could not finish as I was saving space for the two small dish - softshell crab and octopus. The softshell crab looked lovely until I start cutting it - the batter was too thick and too crisp that I could not taste the crab at all. The burrata, as a side of the dish, however, was the highlight.  I had better softshell crab else where.  Charred octopus with pork xo, brown butter foam. This dish was well executed. The pork xo (I think is some sort fried beacon crumb) was slightly crunchy and very savory. The brown butter, rich and buttery. Good, but not good enough to draw me back on its own. Dessert, yeah they just added to the menu, was sundae with yuzu peel, berries. Honestly, passable. I do like the decor, especially the Edison light bulbs hanging in the dinning room. The vibe is typical alphabet city type, lively, eclectic. Service was attentive though felt lukewarm at times. One thing I want to call out, they did not recommend me to switch wine after the salad, though a good manager should know the food coming the table did not go well with the first wine I ordered. It was myself told them that I needed to switch wine. I am not trying to pick on anyone but a good restaurant should know that. Being new is not an excuse. All in all, was a fine.

Friend mentioned the Skate for her entree was buttery and flavorful. My Short Rib with Sweet Potato Purée and Shishito Peppers was moist and delicious. Just the perfect amount and a must try!

5.0,8/17/2014,"This was one of those meals where everything was so delicious and the service was so perfect that you could forgive how expensive it all was.It's a very small menu, with a few choices of hot and cold starters, entrees and sides. We had a good sampling of the menu, including the larger ""for two"" entree:- Chicken Liver ($13)This was good, but the only thing here that didn't really blow me away. The mousse was accompanied by some nuts, chicken skin and sea salt, which combined together and spread on the milk toast was quite tasty.- Oxtail Spring Rolls ($13 for 2)These were excellent. Though they just looked like two very long but ordinary spring rolls, they were incredibly flavorful. Stuffed with plenty of juicy oxtail and bone marrow, I couldn't get enough of this and wished there were more of them.- Pig Out (for two) ($58, including peanut noodles)Given the name and the price of this dish, I expected much more (in terms of quantity), but the quality was all there as the large crispy cubes of pork were amazing. They weren't even too fatty, like this type of dish often can be, where you pay through the nose just to eat fat. The pieces were so meaty and soft and went so well with the impossibly crispy skin on top. Along with the pig were two bowls of spicy peanut noodles, which were so good they practically made this dish worth it to get to try them. Any peanut butter fan must try these, as they were so thick and coated with delicious peanut sauce that you could barely slurp the noodles (which is good, since it's a nice place and you probably shouldn't be slurping your noodles anyway).- Corn ($8)This was some of the best corn ever. Topped with kaffir lime, curry and creme fraiche, it was so creamy and satisfying. It's definitely a good way to get your vegetables even though it's not even close to healthy with all that excellent creaminess.- Rice ($9)Another excellent side dish, this was an incredible bowl of leaf-wrapped sticky rice, studded with kale and Chinese sausage. It was super sticky and rich from duck fat, and was another excellent starch to complement the previously mentioned pig.Sadly, there was no dessert, but it was ok since we were extremely satisfied from the perfect dishes we tried (and luckily there are plenty of dessert options nearby in the East Village). Service throughout was perfect and everybody we came in contact working here was very friendly. I would love to come back for the inevitable menu expansion. Hopefully they will start serving dessert, and probably brunch, as these restaurants often do after awhile. I am confident that it would all be good after this incredible meal.",27,7,15,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834
4.0,8/14/2014,"My girlfriend and I went to Tuome on opening night last night for our anniversary. I had flowers with me and the staff was very accommodating, offering to store them in a cool spot in the back.The decor is rustic with much of the paneling, fixtures, and decorations coming from old Philadelphia factories (our server was kind enough to educate us on the wall of wool spools behind us). Tuome's ambiance is not dissimilar to a West Village wine bar: candle-lit, chock-full of well-heeled 30-something couples, and long on exposed brick and reclaimed wood. Perhaps in ironic acknowledgement that it is very squarely in grungy hipster territory and far from Greenwich's angular cobblestone streets and $10mm lofts, Tuome's playlist ran the gamut of 80's high school dance classics - from Asia's 'Heat of the Moment' to Abba's Dancing Queen. Somehow it worked marvelously.The wine list is well-considered with relatively affordable selections and a token rose for girls' night groups that couldn't get a reservation in Midtown. In our own irony, we ordered beer ($7, from a short, but remarkably well-curated selection) and the Mexican Coca Cola ($4).The chef's amuse was delightful - a well-balanced, subtle offering of pickled vegetables with an Asian touch. Restaurants that resemble any relation to the bygone fusion era are always at risk of producing flavors that conjure memories of some panko-breaded slider with teriyaki dipping sauce gone awry. Luckily Tuome avoids this gracefully. The ginger-scallion sauce is just right.Our next dishes - watermelon with farro and chrysanthemum ($12) and chicken liver with milk toast, sunflower seeds, and local maple syrup ($13) are marvelous. They embody the inventive yet harmonious combination of familiar flavors in crisp, bright, unique preparations that is the greatest hallmark of modern cooking.After a long lull (a bizarre pause to an otherwise good tempo of service), we received our mains: scallops with carrot puree and maitake ($25) and beef short-rib with sweet potato puree and grilled shishito peppers ($28). Diners have long come to expect a standard of perfect or near-perfect protein preparation and Chen does not disappoint here. The beautiful sear on the scallops does not come at the expense of its smooth, tender flesh. Likewise, the braised short-rib maintains its form long enough to stand upright on the plate but absolutely melts in your mouth. Chen tends toward the sweeter end of flavors on the proteins but this is a minor shortcoming and easy to forgive. Where Chen excels is his obsessive attention to texture - our side of snap peas ($8) was crisp yet tender with peanuts for additional crunch, and the sweet lotus root chips perched atop the delicate scallops provide the perfect contrast.We were disappointed to learn that dessert was not on the menu for the evening, but after such a wonderful first experience, we'll surely be back for more.",1,1,2,David M.,"Manhattan, NY",19,10,0
