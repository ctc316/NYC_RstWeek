1.0,2/28/2019,"Probably the worst steakhouse you could go to in the city. It took them 2 tries to get my steak medium rare and my friend 3 times and by the third time the outside was so burnt and inside was still extremely purple, it was not even worth it. I can go on and on how about how bad this place is, but i can sum it up in two words. Overpriced and disgusting.",0,0,0,Sean K.,"Middlebury, CT",1,13,11
1.0,1/26/2019,"This review is based on Restaurant week.  Thursday  January 24th at 12:30 pm My friends and I decided to do lunch at this restaurant. The restaurant was completely empty. The waiter was in a shitty mood his mood changed for the worst once we ordered from the Restaurant week menu.  Two of us ordered the steak and one the salmon.  We ordered the ""green salad"" as the appetizer. The salad was horrible and it was not fresh at all. The Pettit steak was decent but the steak knives provided were not sharp and my friend and I had a though time cutting it.  The salmon looked good and my friend said it was decent but had better. When we got the check he just threw it at the table and left. Overall they have very poor customer service and shitty food. I regret spending my money at this place.  They should not be participating in Restaurant week. My recommendation is:Don't order from the restaurant week menu.",1,0,0,Dulce Q.,"Manhattan, NY",13,89,22
2.0,1/14/2019,"I was disappointed that this ""Steakhouse"" cannot cook a steak properly. My son ordered the 12oz filet medium-rare and it came out raw (deep purple) in the center. We sent it back, but when it came back out the outer 1/3 was well done and the center was still purple. It was so gross looking. His friend ordered the NY Strip and it came out too rare, had to send that back. Both boys had to wait for new meals. We were not happy!!",0,0,0,Rose B.,"Middle Haddam, East Hampton, CT",0,1,0

I've been coming to the steakhouse for many many years , I knew something was amiss when I walked in . The hostess was pleasant , manager was reasonable , but the waitress clearly was not a happy camper , not to mention she handed me a steak knife point first , that went by my girlfriends ear . Food was decent at best . Price was expensive to be sure .

5.0,10/9/2018,"I brought my mother here for her birthday. We planned to share an order of the shrimp scampi and sirloin steak. I love shrimp and seafood, I am not so big on steak... but since we were at a steakhouse, I thought it was appropriate. I expected to only have a taste of the steak...  but I ended up ordering my own.  The medium rare is a perfect balance of juicy flavor and cooked meat. I really enjoyed it with the veggies on the side. The shrimp was also good, but I was really impressed by the steak. I never expected to like it so much. Very kind service and explanation of the menu by our servers. Definitely worth another trip. And most importantly, my mother was very happy too! thanks again!",0,0,0,Alma O.,"Bronx, NY",62,5,0
3.0,10/7/2018,"Frankie and Johnnies is located across from the hotel which I stayed so I tried it out. The atmosphere is nice. It gives you New York theater vibes definitely. It's pretty small and quiet inside. We were seated for our reservation immediately. The service was wonderful the entire time. I ordered the filet and lobster -- medium rare. It came out looking well done which was disappointing since I eat steak frequently! Lobster was very tasty. We also ordered the calamari, I highly recommend!! My aunt had the seafood fettuccine with Alfredo sauce, instead of the traditional red sauce the menu offers. The wine options were pretty nice as well. For our appetizer, entrees, 2 glasses of wine, and 1 side our bill was about $170 for 2 people. A bit pricey but good for New York! Our waitress messed up our bill in the end which wasn't pleasant but the overall experience was pleasing!",0,0,0,Kayla J.,"Baltimore, MD",191,6,11
4.0,9/30/2018,"Very attentive and knowledgeable service.  The food was all very good and prepared as we had asked.  The side orders were huge and were more than enough for two people.  $90 bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon was superb.  And both desserts were fantastic.  The pistachio gelato dessert I ordered was one of the best desserts I've ever had!  Finally, we sat upstairs with a commanding view of the restaurant and commented to each other how low in the noise level was despite being a busy Saturday night.  It's not the same quirky & nostalgic Frankie & Johnnies that was on 45th Street, but time marches on.  And, yes it's a bit on the expensive side, but good NYC restaurants generally are.",1,0,1,Pete B.,"Garfield, NJ",28,14,0
1.0,8/8/2018,Awful service. Awful crab cakes. Literally gave us a salad came back to our table as we were cutting into it took it without saying anything and gave it to the people next to us. The person next to us then had an awkward time because he didn't want to eat the salad we were eating. They took 45 mins to get us an iced tea. Where's Gordon Ramsey. This place is a kitchen nightmare portion size is awful. The broccoli takes up half my plate no meat or shrimp. The meat was badly cooked the shrimp was not edible. The potatoes were okay. Dessert was also not great. Over sugary grossness no real flavor.,0,1,0,Liam M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0
3.0,8/7/2018,"Came during restaurant week when the special was $42 for the full dinner, appetizer, entre and desert.  Excellent warm bread.  Very good salad and crab cakes as our appetizers. We chose the shrimp scampi & steak for the entre. While the shrimp was excellent, the steak was nothing to write home about. For a fine steak dining establishment, I expected melt-in-your-mouth steak, even during restaurant week. Afterall, aren't they trying to lure new customers in with the restaurant week specials ?  Perhaps, their regular priced steaks are of a better quality?  Also, just about when I finished the steak, I noticed steak sauce on an adjoining table and asked for some. Shouldn't they have brought this out from the get-go?  The deserts, cheesecake and apple strudel were excellent.  Expensive restaurant and I didn't get the wow factor.",0,0,0,Rhona P.,"Delray Beach, FL",0,130,5
5.0,8/5/2018,This restaurant has been a long time favorite of mine since they moved from 45th St. to 46 street it took some time to get the restaurant working smoothly at the new location and is now in my opinion the best steakhouse in New York City a great selection and a terrific preshow price fixed menu they had always been known to get their customers out in time for the shows that are nearby and you can get a full three-course menu and a very very good price There are Many items on the menu and then it worth tryingMy wife starts with crab meat cocktail which she swears is the best that she's ever eaten and we do a lot of traveling and have been all over are usually like a tomato and onion salad for open this we then go right to the entrée with a sirloin steak which are usually have cut at the table my wife usually has a filet mignon and sometimes we will come back after the show that we are seeing in New York and have  our Dessert,1,0,1,Israel S.,"Asbury Park, NJ",0,6,0

3.0,7/22/2018,"My wife and I took a trip into the city and wanted to indulge in a nice steak dinner. We searched the streets and finally came upon a street that had a nice variety of steakhouses. We chose Frankie & Johnnie's for the atmosphere, delicious menu options, and layout of the restaurant. We didn't need a reservation and walked straight in from the street. The service was incredible and that is why the 3 stars are warranted. Everything pertaining to the service was 5 stars across the board. Eveything was extremely organized and flawlessly executed: Plates were cleared off, crumbs removed from the table, glasses refilled, and orders taken promptly. They truly work as a team.The price cost compared to the quality was what seemed a bit off. I ordered a grilled chicken Caesar salad as I was not very hungry. I could have sworn the price was $19 from the outside menu, but it was $28 when the bill arrived. The menu stated the salad was $14, so I guess they added another $14 for the chicken. It was a massive salad with a nice portion of grilled chicken that was juicy and seasoned well, but the $28 seems to be a bit much for a salad. My wife ordered the petite filet mignon. The price was $41 or $42. The steak did not come with sides, so she ordered the garlic mashed potatoes that were $11. The potatoes were amazing, but the steak lacked a bit of flavor and was mediocre at best. Definitely not a bad place to visit and try, but the meal was average.",2,0,1,Jason D.,"Marlton, Evesham Township, NJ",301,191,323

5.0,5/27/2018,"The truest measure of a steakhouse is of course, the steak. We had the rib eye. It was. By far, one of the best steaks we have ever had. It made The Old Homestead feel like The Sizzler. Our steaks are perfectly prepared, perfectly seasoned and each absolutely the right temperature.  And that was just the steaks.The service was perfection. Barbara, our server, was attentive and kind. We enjoyed the buratta appetizer, and three sides, baked potato, creamed spinach, and potato latkes that were outrageously delicious-- fluffy like potato croquettes. Sorbet dessert completes our meal. This steakhouse has it all. If you are searching for a fine meal its location in the theatre district in restaurant row is perfect. Since 1926, this fine restaurant has stood the test of time.  We are fortunate to have loved every minute of our meal and can't wait to go back.",1,0,1,Stacy K.,"Oceanside, NY",300,203,217
2.0,4/14/2018,"We ate here for dinner, and had a filet, sea bass, au gratin potatoes, and garlic mashed potatoes between us. Some of the food was very good, and some of it was disappointing. The steak didn't seem to have been seasoned at all, but was well cooked. The au gratin potatoes were also extremely bland - so much so that the were basically flavorless. The garlic mashed potatoes, on the other hand, were amazingly well seasoned and flavorful. The worst part was easily the service. After the food came, the waiter never came back. We didn't get any drink refills, get checked on, or have any service at all. When we were done, we couldn't get anyone to bring the check. Our waiter went to the table behind us literally eleven times while we were trying to get the check. We even asked for the check twice. Then someone other than the waiter came to clear the plates. We asked him for the check, too, but nothing. We finally got a manager to to get the check for us so we could leave. I don't know why the other tables were getting such attentive service while we were ignored. I'm not sure if it's because we're a same-gender couple, because we not local, or what. But it was ridiculous and we sat for over half an hour after the meal was done. I recommend finding one of the dozens of other steakhouses nearby.

1.0,3/24/2018,Had two Fillets ordered medium rare. Both were a little overdone and very tough for fillets. Waitress was a little grumpy and argued with me about the doneness of the steak.

1.0,3/17/2018,"Perhaps one of the worst Steakhouse experiences I've ever had. As a New Yorker, we eat a lot of Steak and have some of the greatest Steakhouses in the Country. Went to Frankie & Johnnie's for the very first time last night. Ordered the rib steak medium, hash browns, fried onions and sautéed mushrooms. Let's start with the steak: asked for medium, got a well done brick of charred meat with the tiniest pink center. It was most certainly NOT PRIME. It was as bad as a cheap supermarket cut. Hash browns: LOOKED great but tasted like yesterday's leftovers. They had an old taste to them almost rubbery. Fried onions: Again, LOOKED great but were a mess of non drained old fryer grease, no flavor. The Sautéed mushrooms: I absolutely LOVE mushrooms but these were a few halved button mushrooms with a bit of seemingly raw garlic and they were cold. Not even a few specialty mushrooms mixed in for flavor. Clearly not a good steakhouse experience, disappointing at best. The place was literally empty, maybe 4 tables taken around us and the waiter kept asking if we were finished although we were clearly still trying to choke some of this food down, simply because we were hungry. So all in all, not worth the kind of prices they charge and the wait staff certainly didn't help the experience. It was as good as cheap bar food and not pleasant at all.",0,0,0,Kristine R.,"New York, NY",0,8,0

Not bad, not great, just fine.I wish i could give the perfect 5 to this classic joint. I love the service. The vibe is great. I even love the music.

4.0,1/26/2018,"I have to preface this because I didn't have a steak. My husband had the filet and enjoyed it.   We split a Caesar salad and the dressing was really good and authentic. The croutons sucked. I'm super picky about Caesar salads though.   I really enjoyed their shrimp scampi, appetizer size and the potato pancake side. They have good glasses of wine so no need to get a bottle unless you're eating the same proteins. The Irish coffees were awesome too.    Definitely a gem in the wasteland that is Times Square.",2,1,2,Meredith S.,"Morristown, NJ",50,116,26

Be sure to get the Sirloin steak (it's not the same as the NY Strip) and the Frankie and Johnny's special salad. Enjoy every bite.

Two of us had the salmon which was fine but my friend had the surf and turf and her steak was served in a pool of blood and the shrimp had a weird smell and sour taste. She didn't bother to send it back because she didn't want to make a big deal but I thought it was worth mentioning because they can't fix what they don't know about.

1.0,5/8/2017,"By far the worst experience I've ever had at a NYC Steakhouse. And I've been to all of them several times each. My brother who was with me, worked as one of the head waiters at the Old Homestead. He couldn't even look the waiter in the eye when asked how everything was.

We both ordered a fillet and sides of creamed spinach and hash browns. The fillet was bland and after chewing had a strange aftertaste. The creamed spinach was pale green in appearance and watery in taste.

He never came to us even while our water was gone. In addition, he asked ""how is everything?"" to our next table but not to us. At that time, my water was still empty. The thing made me sure he was discriminating was that he was helping other table's steak cut. He was very nice to other table.

We ordered fried calamari and crab cakes for appetizers. The fried calamari was lacking in flavor and way too chewy even for calamari and the crab cakes were fine. My mother and sister ordered fish, Chilean sea bass and salmon. Neither was really cooked right and neither was very tasty. I ordered a steak and took a recommendation for those who like lean meat. There was a huge chunk of fat on either side and it was a really tough piece of meat. Also their steak sauce is just BBQ sauce with a fancy wrapper. The sides are served family style. We ordered asparagus, broccoli and potatoes. Even though the potatoes supposedly had onions and seasoning they were completely devoid of any flavor. The broccoli was so hard to cut through we passed my steak knife around to cut through it. The asparagus was good but for a table they only brought 5 pieces. We also ordered the tomato and onion salad. The tomatoes were mush and the onion was served in slices that were ridiculously thick and really not tasty. We left almost the entire dish untouched. Dessert was better but nothing spectacular. This is the first restaurant we've been to that we would not consider coming back to. Skip this place and save your money.

This one is a miss, and what it needs is a new chef - particularly one that knows how to properly cook steak. We ordered a Porterhouse and steamed broccoli. Normally the steak would come out sizzling and properly cooked. It was on a cold plate and the inside was raw. The broccoli was cold. Sent both back and again raw inside. I rejected it. They suggested a surf & turf. Not sure why if they couldn't cook a Porterhouse that they would be able to cook a Filet any better? But I ordered it, and unfortunatelyI was right. Undercooked and the lobster was over seasoned. We all rolled our eyes and they knew they blew it. They only charged us for 2 plates of broccoli but what a waste of expensive meat and a loss of a customer. They were very nice and apologetic and thus the 2 stars. But I still left wondering how do they have a chef in a midtown steakhouse who doesn't know how to cook steak? There are plenty of other fine restaurants in the Theater District.

4.0,4/29/2016,"I really loved this place. Now i really like this place. I will tell you what I really like. It's an old school New York City Steakhouse with an old school mystique as it is evolved from a speakeasy. The waiters seem as though they've probably been there since it opened, although naturally that's an impossibility(I think). But I find them to be professional and courteous. It's refreshing how they operate because it isn't a@# kissing, they are just getting it done the right way. Now about the food. I have had many debates about who has the best quality steak in the city.  This restaurant is among that group. The steak here is better than Sparks, Smith and Wollensky, Craft, Old Homestead, and a whole lot more. The quality of meat and the perfect aging is almost second to none. I feel that because it's now smack dab in the abyss of the NYC tourist stomping ground that it has taken a hit on credibility because at any given time you can certainly be camped next to some tourists from Missouri. The chopped chicken liver is awesome and all the sides are great too. The lamb chops are the second best in the city next to Keen's Mutton Chop. What a loved about it that's different now is the people who greet are not even remotely courteous as compared to the people receiving the guests several years ago.

Smiths location and have increased greatly in size with a balcony and lost all of the charm of the original restaurant.My friend who made the reservation the night before last said all  bookings on Open Table were full.  She decide to call the restaurant and they took her reservation and promised her her open table points which I am sure she will never see.I arrived at 7:30 prompt and was greeted by a hostess in a ""Charo"" like dress that was way to tight for her age and her accent was almost unintelligible.  I gave my name, my friends married name, my friends maiden name and there were no reservations. (This made me think they went to the other Frankie and Johnnies in the West 30s by accident but that was not the case).The hostess swiveled the screen around for me to see that she had no reservations in any of the names I gave her.  I asked her is anyone was waiting on someone, she said no.After waiting 15 minutes after calling my friends and textiing them, there were waiting at the back of the restaurant!!!!  What a trainwreck at the host/hostess station. It turns out ""Charo"" was the coat check girl as the person who was supposed to work the front was not there last night.I was really annoyed and asked for the Manager, and asked him, no demanded  a round of drinks which he complied.Well,  then it was time to order dinner., 2 of us ordered steaks, my friends steak was full of fat, my steak was okay but nothing to write home about.  The creamed spinach was truly the onlygood item on the table.   My other friend ordered pork chops, the waiter came back a few minutes later to tell her they ran out.  This was at 7:50 p.m. on a weeknight!Anyway, already annoyed with my entrance to this restaurant, the fair service at best, the mishap trying to find my friends and the lack of ambience to what was one of my former favorite restaurant and knowing that we would be shelling out nearly $ 100 per person (before the drinks were written off), I was not at all pleased.The waiter kept apologizing telling us that they have only been open a week.....Sorry, lame excuse for a restaurant that has been open for several decades.One of the finals straws came when I ordered decaf and would like Splenda with it.  The waiter asked me if Splenda is blue or pink!  That's it,  I told her it was yellow!Perhaps they need more growing time, but I don't want to be a part of the process.Just, STAY AWAY AND AVOID, unless you enjoy paying high prices, mediocre service and non descript ambience.  It's truly sad to see a fine NY institution heading in the wrong direction.PS-  Something I have never seen on a menu before....In addiiton to a sharing charge, if you don't order a main course, there was something like a surcharge on top of the price of the appetizer.They are doing everything they can to steer business away, perhaps the can sail away into oblivion past the Husdson River!",2,3,0,Alan M.,"New York, NY",89,5,0

Upstairs is very crowded (to the point that I heard a hostess tell a customer she had to take off her coat because there was no room for it upstairs) but we were seated downstairs since we didn't have a reservation, and there was more than enough room.We ordered the jumbo shrimp cocktail as an appetizer (4 large shrimps), which was pretty good! But we got the appetizer and bread at the same time, and our meals came out about 3 minutes later. Way too fast!! We felt very rushed and there wasn't enough room on the table for the food so we had to put the bread on the empty table beside us. Despite saying we still wanted it, she came back a minute later and took it away.The steak was tasty, but overcooked. Judging by how many people have said that, you'd think they'd catch on by now!! Mashed potatoes were excellent, but the creamed spinach was vibrant green and did not match quality for price.Dessert: we ordered a chocolate mousse cake and a raspberry cheesecake. Mom loved the mousse cake! But I had a SEVERE allergic reaction to the cheesecake!!!!!!! I told the waitress about my allergy ahead of time and she said there were no nuts in it, but warned about ""may contain"" (she did not check with the kitchen, just said that right away). I've never reacted from that in my life so I ordered it. Despite telling the waitress I was reacting to the cake, she insisted it did not have nuts.

Dinner in the dining room upstairs - nice vibe. Not too loud, but not deadly silent. Servers very knowledgeable about the menu and wine list. Servers always there when you wanted them but didn't hover. We had chopped salad and rib eye. Rib eye flavor was amazing - just great steak. Bone in - so expect it to be marbled and big. Good thing we shared... Dessert was molten chocolate cake for me - piping hot with ice cream. Delish.  My husband had key lime pie. Not spectacular, says my husband, but good. Would we go back?

We were seated almost immediately. It was a bit uncomfortable as one patron, w his wife or lady friend just kind of glared at us. Nonetheless, we remained. Then there was sticker shock because the least expensive steak was around $45-- and that was a la carte. Everyone else ordered a sirloin and I got a ribeye. They were gorgeous and charred to perfection. My Caesar salad was delicious, tho a little heavy on dressing. Additionally, it had anchovies.

I love how they kept to the original speakeasy feel, with the dim lighting and rich wood tones.The steaks were exceptional. I had a ginormous ribeye cooked to perfection exactly as ordered. From the perfectly charred shell to the infused butter lending the perfect amount of herbs and seasoning. This was a steak to really take your time to enjoy.The atmosphere was intimate. The noise level ranged from quiet to average. The restaurant was somewhat empty on our last visit so we had some space to ourselves. However, it can become quite crowded during peak Broadway show times.

Being an office worker in this area is at times a test of patience; due to a tendency for rushed and poor service and food.Frankie and Johnnie's fixes this. I went out with 2 coworkers, and we got a seat upstairs in the otherwise completely empty dining room. It was nice and quiet and with an open window, allowing for a fresh breeze. Simply awesome and something you never see around Midtown.The beer selection was mostly the rather bland and low quality Anheuser-Busch selection, but with a Big Daddy Speakeasy IPA being on the list - a good and solid go-to beer if in doubt about what to order when going out.We all went for the prix fixe, and all had a salad and a petit filet mignon; salad was good and unexpectedly large and the steak had a good crust - maybe not perfectly rare, as ordered, but still delicious and something that I just want to suck up since it otherwise was just a plain great experience.Our waitress was simply awesome, she asked questions and yet provoked us ever so slightly; the same level you would expect from your local diner.

Seeing our frustration, another employee got involved and everything turned out well. That 2nd employee, female, was doing a lot and making drinks, but she made my day when she topped off my martini with extra. Upstairs, the dining area is tiny, but the service is exceptional. I ordered the lobster ravioli and asparagus and both were delicious. The asparagus was my overlooked and done to perfection. However, they tell you sides are shareable - not the asparagus.

The chip style fries were not well seasoned and overcooked. The mushroom on my plate did not even serve well as a decoration it looked much like a forgotten dirty shoe and tasted similarly.

She was also the bartender, bus boy and server for the first floor.  She didn't take our order for 25 minutes.  No water.  No anything.  She finally took our order and brought our drinks back about ten minutes later.  She also brought us some bread, most of which was stale.  It took an eternity for the food to arrive (chicken with mushrooms, a sirloin and fries). After we finished eating we waited for 20 more minutes for the check.  For the price that we paid I would have hoped for a better experience.  My son was happy with his steak but I thought that my chicken was mediocre at best.  I wanted to treat my son to a special meal for his upcoming birthday and was very disappointed.  I won't be returning.  Shame because the place has such a cool history.  It wasn't all the fault of the server as I believe she was more comfortable behind the bar slinging drinks.

We also had hash browns, creamed spinach, au grauten potatoes, and potato pancakes. The sides are served family style.  The creamed spinach was excellent but the portion not very generous. The potato pancakes were large and so was the portion.  Same with the hash browns.  The hash browns and the bread were nothing at all to talk about except to say they weren't special at all.  Potato pancakes are sinful. They are spectacular.  One of the filets was over cooked. We sent it back. The cooked another and all things went just swimmingly.  I'd order your steak cooked one notch less than your usual order and you'll be fine.  Great service from the staff. Our waitress was experienced, knew how to use it, and wasn't afraid to do so. If you were choosing a dream meal here go with the sirloin ($47 but worth it), potato pancakes, and creamed spinach.

F@!*!!  F@!*!!""  venting some sort of frustration about something or other.  We're completely ignored so one of our party goes to the back of the bar to the shower curtain rod to get our coats himself.  The woman behind the bar goes bananas and starts screaming at him to get away from the coats.  So the hostess finally gets up, gets our coats, and facetiously says something like ""Thank you SO much.""  This is after spending over $400 on dinner.  Then, as we're walking out, the woman behind the bar shouts at us ""Don't forget to tip your hostess!!  HAPPY F@!*ing NEW YEAR!!""We phoned to complain to the manager and his response was ""Well what do you want me to do about it?  You should have tipped her.""  Seriously.Appallingly rude service, which is a shame because we all enjoyed our steaks.  Do not waste your time or money on this dump, there are hundreds of better steakhouses in NYC.",1,0,0,Derek D.,"Manhattan, NY",1,5,0
4.0,1/4/2015,"Some of the lower rated reviews here are a little baffling. I'm imagining these are perhaps from people who have never been or perhaps envisioned it as something else.With Frankie & Johnnie's, you first have to understand that it's a super OLD SCHOOL ESTABLISHMENT and befitting its former speakeasy status -- ""Frankie"" was the password when it opened in 1926 -- it is admittedly cramped with stairs that can be a little tricky to navigate. That said, I've always found the place very comfy, especially if you are able to snag one of the corner booth tables, as my wife and I did last night. It's been years since we'd been there, but the waiters instantly recognized us, delivered typically perfect service, and even treated us to two glasses of wine, on the house. Not necessary but certainly appreciated.Cocktails (strong, cold martinis) and apps were great. We had the shrimp and crabmeat cocktail -- it was fresh and just delicious! For entrees, it was sirloin, cooked perfectly with a char that is an utter feast for the senses. For sides, we had the creamed spinach and Lyonnaise potatoes. Delicious! One small criticism: the bread could certainly be better, though the butter served was not ice cold and wrapped in foil, as some have mentioned. No doubt the city has higher end steakhouses -- The Strip House being my personal favorite -- but for old school New York charm, great steaks and drinks, I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for Frankie & Johnnie's.",4,1,1,Mark M.,"Brooklyn, NY",22,10,0

He told us about all the types of homemade ice cream they have, which is exactly when I started to think, ""I need to return ASAP!""",2,1,1,Darya S.,"Manhattan, NY",978,2060,1393
3.0,2/26/2014,"On paper, Frankie & Johnnie's sounds right up my alley - an old school steakhouse with a bona fide speakeasy past. In reality, however, it's an out-dated restaurant with a tight layout and Grand Pending sign in the window.Thankfully, the food here is its standout (relative to its other questionable elements, at least, but more on that later). The Jumbo Shrimp and Crabmeat Cocktail appetizer was very fresh and clean, the closest thing to a must-order here. As for steak, I went with their Sirloin, cooked medium. And while it definitely came out medium well, it was a super-sized slab of beef, tasty but also somewhat grizzly (and kind of in a good way). As I have a strong stomach for that sort of thing, I came out of the meal more or less satisfied with my dinner, though certainly not over the moon.Frankie & Johnnie's does boast exceptionally fast service. Given the neighborhood, this must come in handy for the theatre-going crowd.My biggest turn-off was most definitely the tight quarters. The passage space for the servers and bussers is beyond restricted. Hot dishes are always being passed directly over your head. Just to get to the bathroom, I felt like I was literally hurdling over some unfortunate dude trying to eat his meal just to clear the bend. There's intimate dining, and then there's cramped seating. Frankie & Johnnie's is most definitely the latter. I know what you are thinking - this is New York, and a lack of personal space is to be expected. But Frankie & Johnnie's really takes this notion to the extreme. This isn't the rush hour L train. This is a place that serves a $44 sirloin. Call me crazy, but that should buy you an inch of elbow room here or there. Or at least allow you to take a leak without straddling some bros in the process.",3,2,0,Dan R.,"Brooklyn, NY",633,551,148

4.0,1/22/2014,"Just went to this place with my family after seeing a Broadway show, and let me tell you--what a way to end the night!This is by far the fanciest restaurant I've ever been to. We walked in after the show, around 4:30pm. When we came in, I felt a little out-of-place. A man in a fine suit said to us ""You didn't make a reservation?.... okay, well we need the table back by 6."" Didn't feel terribly welcome, but what can ya do? I guess they aren't used to last minute drop-ins. I also felt way underdressed, seeing that the staff were all wearing their finest, and the place is covered in white table linens and fancy-folded handkerchiefs galore.The service was wonderful. People kept coming over for refills, fresh pepper, etc. The food is absolutely amazing. Amazingly expensive as well, especially that everything is a la carte, so they force you to open your wallet a little wider if you want a potato or vegetable with that steak. That part turns me way off, but to their credit, their portion sizes are very large and the quality is undeniable. I have plenty left over for tomorrow.So if money is no object, and you love a great quality steak or fish, this place is wonderful. ...Just expect to drop a good chunk of coin.

Anyway, when we walked in there wasn't much of a wait, so we were a little hesitant, but after we sat down it was like the flood gates opened and the place filled in quickly. My fiancé had the T-bone and I had the filet. Both were cooked perfectly and tasted AMAZING! I don't think we even needed a knife! We love steak and if you look at the places we frequent we definitely have had our share of quality steak, but this was probably in the top three of all time. Sides were good and plentiful. I've had better baked potato, but the steak was so good who cares about a baked potato? We had plenty to take back to our hotel for our late night munchies. Needless to say, not a scrap made it to see the light of day.All around a cool place (was once a speakeasy).

3.0,5/2/2013,"You're not going to impress anyone by taking them to Frankie and Johnnie's, with its worn-out carpet that looks like it came out of a movie theater lobby somewhere and its cracked ceiling and sponge-paint wall coverings. However, what they do offer is incredibly fast food preparation and convivial waiter service. The onion rings are also really good, and they'll make you a half-size ($5) upon request if you don't want the full order ($10) that is more appropriate for 3-4 people at a table.The place seems good for groups, and the type of people it attracts are certainly the outer borough and Long Island or NJ types. When I ate lunch there, there was one large table that sounded like they were from Queens and at another table were some guys putting a deal together after 'dey gawt to tawkin' 'bout da real estate business'. My waiter reminded me of Father Guido Sarducci from SNL.The lighting and ambiance are bright during the day, and the place does not have the dark cave effect you'd find at Keen's. Lunch specials are good: you can get two filet mignon medallions and a side for $26, making F&J about 15% cheaper than Keen's for a comparable menu item. However, F&J's beef quality is markedly beneath that of Keen's, with F&J serving beef comparable to what you'd find at Pig & Whistle pubs in Manhattan or a Texas Roadhouse in the suburbs.",1,1,0,Pedro S.,"New York, NY",73,173,0

I was pouring this sauce on just about everything! I almost purchased a bottle but I didn't want to carry it into the theater-Big Portions: Come hungry-The Potato Pancakes are craveable! Frankie & Johnnie's puts a twist on the standard greasy flat pancakes by making them fluffy, round and light. They reminded me of the doughnut version of potato pancakes. -The low point of the night was the garlic mashed potatoes. The potatoes were very thin, soupy and on the verge of tasting like they came from a pre-made box mixture that one can find at your local grocery store. -The Grilled Breast of Chicken was forgettable. Not good, not bad. The meat was thin and a tad dry. -The bacon tasted funny. I can't pin-point what the ""funny"" taste is, however it may have been seasoned or smoked in a weird / non-traditional way. -The ground Angus beef was juicy, cooked well and beyond filling!

Lugers gives u slice 4 slice.  And lets be real, onions r cheaper than politicians, so y sacrifice presentation?CREAMED SPINICH - the color will knock you out because outside of F&Js it only exists in LOONEY TUNE CARTOONS!  Its a NUCLEAR MINT because it's all cream and no spinach.  If Popeye ate this Olive Oil could kick his ass in a heartbeat. LUMP CRAB & JUMBO SHRIMP APP - WOW a big pile of meaty fresh crab meat - DELISH!  But only 2 medium sized shrimp.  Jumbo is John Holmes, these shrimps r somewhere between hermaphrodite Lady Gaga and Obama - that is if Obama had a pair.  And what's up with one wedge of lemon?  When you generously pile the crab why cheap out on the lemon? Again, presentation is sacrificed for the cost of nothing. GARLIC MASH POTATO - FALSE ADVERTISING ALERT!  Where's the garlic?  I dont know, but it wasnt in our spuds.  They were ok, creamy like nuclear mint creamed spinach.  However, I like my mash a little tighter, firm - as in Jessica Biels butt firm!  TIMBERAKE UNWORTHY!PETITE FILET MIGNON with mushroom caps - False advertising alert again - only 1 cap.  Me  and mom ordered the same, one in each dish, whatever.The 8oz mignon was very good.  We both ordered medium and it came out perfectly w/a slightly red center.  It wasnt like butter which wouldve made a GREAT mignon, but it was a nice cut, tender, bronzed well on the outside & juicy on the inside.DESERT - DISASTER!  The desert menu is a laminated PICTURE DESERT CARD  - classless for a joint of this  caliber.  This is crap you expect to get at some Jersey boardwalk shack  - but who knows,  maybe the IQ of tourists have sharply declined due 2 the purposeful DUMBING DOWN of our education system by THE MAN 2 drone us more easily or maybe - its just more crappy presentation.Typical pictured deserts - the sorbet that comes in hollowed out fruit rinds, like oranges & lemons -which always makes me wonder if they recycle these babies by filling them up again?   Nothing fresh, its all purchased from an outside conglomerate that probably makes toothpaste and cement too.I ordered the crème Brule and because I didn't fully read I was surprised that a crème brule ice cream arrived.  Looks like the real deal but isn't.  It was so-so, my mom ordered some RICOTTA ICE CREAM topped with nuts - eh' to that too.COFFEE - Ive gotten in the habit of ordering a single espresso even tho I want a double because many places  over pour - needless to say F&Js didn't disappoint in disappointing me - a double of dirty dishwater arrived.The smart move is to grab desert elsewhere because its not like your losing out on any ambience and really, its typical steak house service too - Carnegie Deli waiters wearing tuxes is the service you get here.   So 4 all that + two glasses of wine & a beer - Belgium Delirium, my current fave, it was $186  before tip.  Macys quality at Tiffanys pricing.So like I said, if Luger's is 2 far off - Hop the L train 2 Lugers immediately!",5,11,5,Johnny T.,"Brooklyn, NY",441,29,4
2.0,12/19/2011,"We were told about Frankie and Johnnie's by some friends that recommended it and told us that the service was professional and they have outstanding steaks.My experience was the opposite.  Our reservation was honored and we were seated promptly.  We were assisted with the wine list and given some great recommendations and really enjoyed the Cab we selected.  I think we ended up going through at least 3 bottles for the 5 of us that were enjoying it.  We started with the cold seafood appetizer which was quite good.  A whole lobster halved and claws were started with small cuts to ease the mayhem that is removing a lobster shell.  There were also clams, oysters, huge shrimp and lump crab-meat.   It was more then enough for the 6 of us.  Some of us ordered salads and soup to start and there was at least a 15 minute lull between when the food hit the table and the main course was served (remember earlier when I said we told them we had theater tickets?).  When the steaks arrived I was pretty excited and hungry.  I went with the rib eye....as I always do at a steakhouse.I always order my steaks Medium and tell the waiter/waitress that I prefer them to err on the side of medium rare and there will be no issue if it is a bit rare, I just like a warm pink center.  Honestly...who doesn't?My poor rib eye was killed twice.  It was only slightly pink in the dead center and most of it was gray.  Actually all of our 6 steaks were all over the map with regards to cooking.  Some were a light medium rare and some were very done.  Half of my wife's poor fillet Mignon was inedible it was so charred.  I'm honestly at a complete loss at how a steakhouse managed to cook all of the meat so differently?   I cut open the center of my steak prepared to show it to someone, but noone came.  I know sometimes the waiter or manager or even chef likes to see what the guest is complaining about to educate or inform, but this didn't happen.  I guess they didn't care enough to bother.  The manager never even came over.When the waitress asked how everything came out (about 7 min after the steaks hit the table)  I told her it was all over the place and mentioned how everyone's food was cooked.   She didn't even look.  Her face showed a look of horror and she vanished to come back about 5 minutes later and told us they would have a limo to take us to the theater.  That's ""nice"" but I'd rather you do something to make a bill a little easier to swallow considering I just dropped FOURTY SEVEN DOLLARS on a steak that is no better then anything I've cooked at home.Our sides were decent, the asparagus was the size of a baby arm which amazed us but the hollandaise sauce broke and was so peppery it was surprising.  I'm not sure if they would have made it right if we had time.  But we had a show to get too which we did tell them at the start of the meal.  So we didn't have the luxury to wait.  Given that friends recommended it I was so disappointed I can't even related it here.  This was so far below my experiences at Smith and Wollensky I can't even put them in the same city.The only thing that makes me give 2 stars was the wine recommendations and seafood platter.",2,2,0,Nick L.,"Herndon, VA",33,189,7
4.0,11/26/2011,"I've been hearing about this restaurant for years and never had the opportunity to visit. It isn't near my usual haunts or hotels; however, I wanted to try out a new hotel this weekend to check it out for an upcoming family trip, and lo and behold Frankie & Johnnie's Steakhouse was across the street. I had the hotel make reservations for 6:30.  I walked across the street from the hotel and introduced myself. I was alone but they still offered me a choice of the formal upstairs dining room or a table in the bar area. I looked at both and chose a bar area table.  My waitress/bartender was fantastic. She took care of the bar and about six tables in the area. I ordered a pinot noir and table water, as I looked at the menu. The bread was super, especially the garlic bread. There were a lot of tasty items on the menu and I had a hard time deciding on cocktails and apps. But there was no doubt about my main course. I ordered a chunky crabmeat cocktail to start.The presentation was terrific and it tasted great. My next item was the Frankie & Johnnie Classic Salad with their own dressing. It is a chopped salad with Caesar's dressing on it, and it was very good. For my main course I ordered the 14oz Filet Mignon, and I was very specific as to how I wanted it cooked. I asked for it to be cooked black and blue and I wanted it to be seared with crushed peppercorn. I also ordered a side of asparagus with the steak. The steak was perfect, and broiled to my exact specifications. I had no room for dessert, though some of the items looked very tempting. Everything was great: the food, the presentations, and the service. I am glad that I was finally able to visit this wonderful restaurant. After looking over to my right on the yelp page, I read a ridiculous review that was the polar opposite of mine.  I am tempted to give F&J's 5 stars to counter an obvious competitor's review, but I can't do that.

5.0,2/21/2011,"F&J is THE place to go for the best tasting steaks in the city. Took my bf here on a Saturday night for his 27th birthday. We ran 20 minutes late for a 6pm reservation. When we got there, we were greeted by a young lady at the door. I gave her my name and she told us there would be no problem getting us a table. Five minutes later, we were notified that our table is ready.We took a flight of old black-and-white checkered stairs up to the dining room, which must've had no more than 15-20 tables packed in close together. The place was bustling with theater goers and an older, more sophisticated crowd. We were initially seated at a table close to the stairs, but were then relocated to a much quieter and more intimate table in the corner, where we were able to sit closer to each other instead of across.It took our waiter about 10 minutes to come to our table to take our order. I do not want to assume it was due to the fact that we didn't come across as wealthy looking as the older diners in the restaurant, but this didn't bother me, since it was also pretty busy. Every single table in this place was occupied. Definitely make a reservation if you are coming on a weekend. We placed an order for two filet mignons- I ordered mine medium rare as I like my meat more bloody, and my bf ordered his medium. We also ordered a side of potato pancakes.About 10 minutes later, our food arrived. As I gazed upon this heavenly-looking 3-inch slab of bovine goodness, I could not help but think that I wasn't gonna finish the whole thing. Boy, was I wrong! I cut my steak open and took a minute to admire the perfect reddish pink filling that is medium rare. Took a bite, and it literally melted in my mouth! The inside of the steak was super tender and the slightly charred outside gave it a nice contrasting firm texture. It was absolutely delectable and a delight to eat - I savored every bite down to the last. The potato pancakes came in the form of four oversized hush puppies, which were very good too.If you are a steak lover like I am, this is a place you can not miss out on.

Just about any good steakhouse in NY ages their steaks, but they can vary in what they consider rare/medium/well.  I think F+J is off. The meat was not bad otherwise, but nothing special. My medium-rare was cooked medium. My friend's rare was between a medium-rare and a medium. The sides were not impressive at all, either in portion or quality.  I really do not get how this place is so popular, its not even in the same league as Luger's/Wolfgang's/Angelo&Maxies.

My server insisted that I go Medium but I held off, noting that previous yelpers have indicated some meats were overcooked. Along with some asparagus and a nice Cab. The bus boy was great about keeping my water full and from what I could see all the other servers were right on top of their game. My server however kept disappearing and I had to asked someone to go find him twice. My Veal Chop came out Medium Rare, and it was perfect. Melted right in my mouth. The flavor through out the cut was amazing and the size was unbelievable (if this was a baby cow, it was a BIG baby cow!). My server came by and offered coffee and dessert but I requested the check.

So negative points for that.We sat in a corner table (I love these because I can sit next to my bf instead of across), and took in the low-ceilinged, warm decor. Our waiter mentioned that the restaurant was a speakeasy back in the day! That explained the long stairs leading to an enclosed, smaller space.  The historical detail made the place a little more special.Food came out, and both our steaks (Prime Rib and Filet Mignon/Lobster combo) were deliciousss. I think my Prime Rib was slightly overdone though, so maybe ask for one level less than what you normally order? Also, it wasn't the juiciest piece of steak I've ever had (I think Ruth's Chris and AJ Maxwell's fared better in that department), but overall very satisfying steak. I think we had a side dish also, but forgot what it was. But my general memory of this place was that it was a great steak place, and we'd definitely recommend it to friends and Yelpers, and come back ourselves.",1,0,0,janice l.,"New York, NY",5,16,0
3.0,11/17/2008,"I met up with some cousins who were in town for a show, initially just to get a drink or two. They had dinner, and I just got a shrimp scampi appetizer and a whiskey sour. The shrimp was seasoned and fanned out over rice. For an appetizer, it was fantastic and quite filling. The whiskey sour was alright. I had a glass of wine from the bottle on the table, but due to a recent obsession with the show Mad Men, my hunt for a bar that would make an ""Old Fashion"" proved successful, as they were glad to make one with scotch or whiskey. I went with the scotch, and it was delightful.The menu was pricey, and the attire a little more casual than I was dressed (thank god I wasnt wearing a t-shirt). What I found most interesting was the fancy waiter staff and clientel, but the place itself looked like a run-down TGI Fridays, and it was so close together in there I was afraid of knocking people over on my way out the door. Overall, I can only give 3 stars even though the food was great, as well as the drinks, but the ambiance was really a turnoff and the service a bit too fancy for me. And as far as the comments about being one of the best steakhouses... certainly not. I had a bit of my cousins Filet Mignon, and honestly the shrimp was better.",2,1,2,Corey C.,"Albany, NY",8,16,0
4.0,10/10/2008,"2nd Best steakhouse in New York for me.  My fav is still good old Peter Luger.  Came here with friends from work after a  night  on Broadway.  We entertained a couple of foreign executives who wanted to try New York steaks and suggested this place.  I love their porterhouse & T-bone cooked medium rare. I heard it was what Frank Sinatra always had when he was in town.  The Shrimp Scampi, Lobster Bisque and Cesar salad was very good.  .One  thing you have to climb this narrow stairs to get to the place. You'll be greeted w/ pictures of celebrities who have dined there on the walls. The waiters were extremely nice.  Our guests were happy.",1,0,0,Olivia M.,"Elmhurst, NY",427,482,13
5.0,10/1/2008,"Best steakhouse.  Ever.  My favorite is to sit at the bar with Bobby.  Although the dining room is good too, especially if there are more than 2 in your party.  I've eaten every type of steak they have, and they are always grilled to perfection.  Favorite are the T-Bone and Porterhouse.  Love the cream spinach for my side.I'm a west coaster but I travel quite a bit for work, and make it into the City about 2 or 3 times a year.  They always remember me, and Bobby has my perfect martini (shaken, not stirred) waiting for me when I sit down.  He'll even take my bar peanuts away from me if I order the T-bone because he knows it would be too much food for me.In my travels, I am always looking for the perfect steak house; Kinzie's in Chicago, Nick & Stef's in LA, Hy's in Honolulu, but F&J tops them all.",6,0,2,Jim G.,"Garden Grove, CA",117,106,0
2.0,5/31/2008,"Best steakhouse in the city? Seriously? I hope not because it was nothing to write home to momma about...not even from across the table.My mom and I were in the city over Memorial Weekend 2008 - never again to a holiday trip to the city but I digress - we ended up at a pre-theater dinner before heading over to see Ms. Linney in Dangerous Liaisons. I made the reservations at the beginning of the week for a Saturday dinner rez with no trouble. We arrive and walk up the many steep steps to the tiny restaurant on the second floor. My kind of place - small and cozy. Tables squashed together. Waiters in black tie. Nice. From the looks of things, it should be a great meal.We settle down to our table and look over the menu. Pretty basic. Salads, steaks and 7 ways to cook a potato (the latter was the reason I chose the place over another. any place that cooks pots 7 different ways speaks a language only my heart can hear). I ordered a $39 filet mignon and my mom had a T-bone. We ordered the classic salad which was basically iceberg and tomatoes and onion in a vinigrette dressing. Meh. Iceberg is cheap and basically sandwhich material in my book and belongs nowhere near a salad plate unless it's the ""wedge"" from Flemings covered in blue cheese - yum.The steak was pretty decent and huge. My mom's t-bone looked really strange but she claimed it good. She had the worst time cutting it and the waiter even at one point after watching her struggle offered to cut it for her. She took it as an insult until we later saw him immediately dig into two other patrons t-bones with his fork and knife. Apparently that's what they are supposed to do. To say we had some issues with our service is putting it mildly. You know how sometimes waiters decide not to wait on you? That's what happened to us. Everyone else seemed to be getting attentive service while we were continuously overlooked. They never even asked how our food was once it was brought out. We got more love from the water boy than anyone else in the room.Now about those pots. YUCK. Gross. Of all the variety of potatoes I went with the Au Grautin. Apparently I should have gone with the fries or the baked pot seeing that anyone can cook those but these pots were horrible. I tried to smile through each bite not wanting to mention how effing shitty they tasted. It was our first night in the city. My mom's first ever and I didn't want to spoil it by whining about the food. But. Come. On. Ew. Something tasted bad. Later my dear friend who has worked in restaurants for over 10 years quoted a little diddy the restauarants world loves to use ""If it's rotten, do it au grautin."" Fantastic. While I love steaks, I really go for the delcious side dishes. This experience left me a very sad person.I had a glass of wine and my mom just had some tea. For you sweet-n-low lovers, they don't have SIL in NY. You can find splenda, equal and the real deal (my personal preference) - but just a little fyi. It was a constant peev for my mom.The bill came to about $150. Wasn't worth it. Quaint place. A classic steakhouse but for $150 I want it to be really good.We did meet some lovely people dining at the tables next to us. A stagehand on Wicked and his beautiful wife from New Jersey and a famous character actor named Tony Roberts.  It seems some big names like to frequent this joint as it is right near the theaters.",5,0,2,Kristi W.,"Austin, TX",91,86,14
4.0,4/30/2008,"Frankie & Johnnie were lovers, oh baby how they could love...Would I go back, probably not, would I give up having gone? Not for anything!  It was something else to experience this very old and famous steak house and to realize that many years ago, only the wealthy or the Mob could afford to go there. This speakeasy opened in 1926 and is one of the oldest steak houses in NYC still alive today.The waiters are as old as the restaurant, I think or close to it. The restaurant has won best of NYC several times and they are proud to only serve prime dry aged cuts of beef.They have the very old fashioned set up with the waiters stations and their service was to behold.  This is the original Frankiei & Johnnie's, they have two other locations, all in NYC.You do climb stairs to get to the restaurant and then again, if you need to use the restroom. We do not want to talk about the restroom and watch your step or your dining partner could find you gone for good. Very old narrow and steep stairs, but this tends to be the norm in a lot of NYC's older buildings. The waiters change your silverware, course by course, leave your hands on your lap unless eating, because they will be insulted if they do not have the privilege of putting your napkin on your lap and they cut your steak for you, right in your place setting, not on the side! The steak is prime and the restaurant is old and eye opening, in a good way. Very expensive, go there for the experience, at least once.A really cool story!Not handicap accessible.",11,8,10,DJ M.,"Feasterville-Trevose, PA",453,794,3722
3.0,4/7/2008,"this review is on behalf of the non-steakhouse frequenters, so please keep that in mind.walking into frankie & johnnies was like walking into a time warp. if you have ever wanted to see the kind of steakhouse joints that old broadway stars, producers, and audience members hit after the show, where the waiters wear bowties, the steaks are ginormous, the salad is of the iceberg variety, the reservation book is actually a BOOK, and the ceilings are dropped, this place is for you.on the other hand, if you are not really into beef, highly into ambience, and generally are used to a 21st century dining experience, be warned. i went here on saturday night on someone else's dime, so i just tagged along figuring that i would find something to enjoy. i have to say, there was definitely something charming about how small and throw-back it was. i just couldn't believe a place like this existed, so i guess i appreciated that. like i said, i'm not a steakhouse-connoisseur, but i've had my fair share of steaks in my lifetime. the porterhouse for 2 we ordered was decent, but i have definitely tasted better beef. my date, who IS a steakhouse connoisseur, gave the joint a B- and said that the beef at Ben Benson's was better. *shrug* the garlic mashed potatoes, which i basically polished off on my own, were excellent. they were exactly the way i would have made them myself. since we were pretty full, we forwent the cheesecake/chocolatey desserts and ordered strawberries and cream. DOH. i should have known better. half-ripened berries and whip-cream from a can. hahaha. i didn't know that canned whip cream was legal in NYC dining establishments =)overall, the steak for 2, a salad, a side of potatoes, a bottle of wine, and crappy dessert came to $180 before tax and tip. i wasn't completely displeased with my meal because i got to experience a piece of old skool manhattan, but trust me, once was enough.",3,0,2,Miri P.,"New York, NY",31,34,0

4.0,1/8/2008,"This place is so old school. You walk up a flight of stairs and you see framed photos of celebs who have dined here. I only really noticed the ones of Michael Douglas back when he was young. He wasn't even hot back then! The waiters are older gentlemen and they wear tuxes, which is so cool. But the place looks like you're in someone's wood panel sided TV room in the 70's. To put it simply, this place doesn't have a tuxedo look to it. The prices however, are tux appropriate. It's an ancient place with character and charm, but at $39 per filet mignon the prices are on par with any modern steakhouse. Add in $7 for a baked potato and up to $10 for other various vegetable sides and you've got yourself one pricey meal.But, it's oh so good and worth every penny. My filet was cooked perfectly inside (although a little more charred on the outside than I like it). The charring is intentional though - that's the way they cook em' here.   The people watching is the best part. We were there late Sat. night after a Broadway show (Spamalot by the way, which I highly recommend).  You had your table full of high-rollers who demanded they meet the chef, a young couple who were in a fight and the guy didn't touch his food. Not one bite of his $50 plus meal. He sat there in silence while his girlfriend self-consciously worked at her plate. Next to us was the table of 2 gay much older gentleman (and by that I mean in their 80's with canes and shaky hands). It warms my heart to see really old gay people, what can I say. And then there was the table of boisterous (and Southern) drunk businessmen. One of them didn't realize that it's rude to yell into your cell phone in your best ""whiskey whisper"" in a place this small with so few tables. After all, it was a black tie affair for some.",5,3,3,Debra L.,"Hingham, MA",342,540,6
2.0,12/13/2007,"A restaurant doesn't have to do much to keep me from coming back there again.  All it has to do is make me uncomfortable, be too expensive, and have bad food.  Frankie and Johnnie's had this in spades.  I came for lunch during the stage hand strike and had to steel myself to go up a flight of stairs to get there, one of the things I tend to avoid in a restaurant because less people come and you can get assailed by overzealous personnel quickly.  Sure enough I opened the door to an empty top floor restaurant with kitschy decor and autographed photos all around.  These visual cues mean that they're known for their service and lucky me, I was the only one they could lavish it on.  The bane of my existence for that hour was the overzealous waiter, an older man who I think was Cuban with a pencil mustache and a tux.  Normally I would appreciate the friendly service if it wasn't overbearing and ass-kissing.  He kept trying to make conversation with ""the young lady"" while she was eating, did everything short of taking off my shoes to make me more comfortable, and demanded that I finish what I ate or at least wrap it up.  Luckily I was armed with the hostile social cue called the cell phone and had people I could say, ""The waiter is really annoying"" to in Russian.  At one point both he and another waiter were taking the two plates from my table.  They all but watched me eat as I grew more and more sheepish.  I couldn't finish the hamburger I ordered, unfortunately, because it was half raw instead of medium rare.  The pointless onion ring looking things near it were greasy and difficult to eat and the French fries, sub par.  The eight dollar creme brulee ice cream dessert (my first creme brulee and I didn't even get to crack it) tasted a little like gasoline.  I actually had to eat out of politeness.They need to learn that the art of the waiter is knowing when to leave one alone.",1,1,1,Dian L.,"New York, NY",96,235,39
