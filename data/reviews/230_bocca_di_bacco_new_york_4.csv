4.0,2/16/2019,"Ended up at Bocca Di Bacco after our reservations at Pastai could not be honored (will not go back there).  Food was very good....the staff totally professional, and easy on the eyes and the atmosphere was homey and not stuffy.  I am going back to this restaurant and soon.",0,0,0,Nicholas P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,17,0
1.0,2/15/2019,Came here for Valentine's Day+ they had a pre fixed menu but also allowed you to order from the regular menu - slowest service ever. Such a turn off. Had to ask for bread 4 times. It finally came after our entrees were served (we even got an app). The table next to us had very timely service (I observed it) so.... beware - food didn't agree with me. I felt terrible the rest of the night and following day. - sure says sparking water is complimentary by the pelligrino was $8 - I can't get over the terrible service. Waitress never checked in on us. I would never recommend this place or go back.,0,0,0,Jessica E.,"New York, NY",0,10,2

4.0,1/25/2019,"Checked it out for restaurant week. The gnocchi feel (feels?) like tiny pillows in your mouth. So good! The waitstaff are also super attentive and the ambience is really nice and candlelight-y for dinner. It's pretty quiet until 7 pm and then you kinda need to start speaking up to hear the person you're with. Overall, would recommend!**knocking down a star because we went for the three course restaurant week meal but they forgot the third course and so did we - guess it was our fault too for not saying anything.

3.0,12/9/2018,"The waiter showed up with a greeting in Italian tailored to suggest authenticity. Yet the pasta was gummy and greasy, the fried calamari rubbery and sub par by most standards.

4.0,9/29/2018,"We randomly passed by this restaurant while exploring the area on our first day in New York. They only opened at noon sharp and we could only get the brunch menu (not lunch). Bit of a turn off to start with but we gave it a shot.We had the Prosciutto E Melone, Linguine ai Gamberi and Eggs Benedict. All three dishes were wonderful. Ample portions and nicely presented. Staff also made sure our drinks were refilled in time. Prices were very fair for what we received.The restaurant itself is modernly decorated. The windows can be opened up so the indoor restaurant area connects to the outdoors. The street that they are located on is pretty quiet and surrounded by typical oldschool buildings, so we enjoyed the view very much.",1,0,0,Ilse V.,"Murrieta, CA",96,259,496
3.0,9/25/2018,"I think management should take a hard look at this restaurant to make it an ""average OK' place to a great place. It has that potential. The ambiance in the Chelsea (9th Ave) location is quite good - it's cozy, romantic, and good for large groups. However for a large group, we had an overwhelming consensus that the food was (i) over-salted and (ii) over-oiled.  The veggies, fishes, pastas, drenched in oil.  I am not expecting anything Michelin, but something that you don't feel heavy after eating 1/2 a plate. The salads like the fish were over-salted -- please cut these ingredients in half.  Consider cutting the menu size in 1/2 and making truly excellent dishes. I find it interesting that someone else here on Yelp pointed out the discrepancy with the bill and the menu prices, with the bill being incorrect - we noticed that one too and diners at this location should be wary to check their bill at the end.",0,0,0,Sofia M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,20,1

3.0,9/11/2018,"Overall not a bad experience, just not an outstanding one. For starters I'm pretty sure there was only one server the day I was there. The restaurant wasn't slammed but obviously one server to 7 or 8 tables is quite a bit. Upon first being seated we were offered still or sparkling water. After we got our water our server didn't come back to us until we asked for him which was kind of annoying, but again he was alone so we were a little more understanding. Then we ordered drinks, I asked for a Bacardi and coke, and what I got back was not that. It was really bitter, I'm not a huge drinker so I couldn't tell you what it actually was. I was so taken aback by the flavor that the bartender across the room actually saw my facial expression and waved our server to us. When I told him I ordered Bacardi he told my they didn't serve rum, bummer. So I went to for a Tito's and soda and that was fine. We ordered the rosemary chicken, and a salad. Both were great, especially the chicken. Well cooked and the sauce it was topped with was phenomenal. I could've had 8 more plates of it. We didn't stay for dessert but if it was anything like our dinner it was probably fantastic. This is a great space for a larger party as the restaurant is pretty large. Server and drink aside I will definitely be coming back!",0,0,0,Samantha G.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,5,1

3.0,7/16/2018,"Came in on a Sunday afternoon. When asked for the prixe lunch, I was told that it was only Mondays to Friday. That's fine but it would be nice if somewhere on their website or something had that to avoid complications. My friends and I ordered linguine with shrimp and spaghetti carbonara. The linguine was highly praised by my friend. The spaghetti carbonara was good too and it's really filling. I was actually really full when I had my last bites. They do give you these muffins which look kinda cheap in all honestly... for a place in Chelsea. The service was fine. They refilled water consistently. But it was a bit weird that we got our complementary muffins and food after a table that came after us.The main reason I won't be coming again is the FLIES. When I walked in, I noticed that they got a B from the Department of Sanitation. As we sat down to eat, the flies were flying all around us because of the food. Although sunlight is nice, I think they should close their doors to prioritize cleanliness. In addition, they charged us more than the price written on the menu. I mean it's fine if your prices increase but at least change it on the menu. Every item was charged an extra $3. Overall, I wouldn't recommend. There's a lot of Italian restaurants and many other options in the area.",0,0,0,Carrie Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",123,60,63
3.0,7/15/2018,"I can to Bocca di Bacco recently for a friend's birthday brunch - we were a  group of 20, which, for a restaurant this size, seemed a bit big, but it seemed like we pretty much had the venue to ourselves.  Service was a bit slow at first - somewhat forgivable given the party size, but a cup of coffee took well over a half hour. The drink situation was also a bit iffy - we basically stuck to pitchers of mimosas, bloody mary's, and screw drivers. The bloody mary's took substantially longer to come out then any of the others. I opted to get in on a pitcher, which was served by the waiter...but the thing was not mixed...aaaaat all. So, two people basically got glasses of vodka, two people got bloody mary mix. That...was pretty disappointing. After some ad-hoc mixing, we all sort of made due and switched to plan champagne after that.The brunch menu itself is a bit limited but has something for everyone. I opted for the white egg omelet with sauteed mushrooms and goat cheese (self-admitted fiend) with a side of turkey sausage. It was actually very good, and I really enjoyed the side of potatoes, which weren't hashbrowns, but cooked potatoes with a tomato-based sauce/ratatouille. Very nice. Didn't feel super stuffed after either.All in all, I might come back to give it another shot in non-massive-group form - the food was pretty good, the service...had an odd day.",0,1,1,Steve L.,"New York, NY",157,309,1204

1.0,1/21/2018,"Main question: who is the idiot that is supposed to run this place? Better question: who is the idiot that hired that idiot that is supposed to run this place? Probably I will never know, maybe because when I asked the busboy to bring the manager at the table, I got the dessert menu instead (while I was still having my maine course). I know it's NY, I'm all up for variety, buy is it really too much to ask to have an italian waiter in an italian restaurant? Or at least someone competent enough that when I ask for the manager I don't end up with the dessert menu....speak english anyone?  Thing is that when I go out for dinner, like the majority f us I suppose, I don't eat for free, I spend money for the food I eat and for the service that I'm supposed to get. Bottom of the line is that my waiter, some guy probably from some place from North Africa, dressed like a bum, with no table serving manner at all, was too busy hugging and kissing the other waitress and making comments of how sexually aroused he was by the hostess's boobs, to actually find the time to give some sort of service to our table. He clearly didn't have any knowledge of wines and , after finding that out I was afraid to even ask for suggestions on the menu. Funny thing: he told us the specials, and then told different specials to the table next to us. The food was ok, but clearly we were not expecting much after the display of unprofessionalism we just witnessed. Too bad because the place is nice...but that's all, nothing more than that.",0,0,0,Susan R.,"New York, NY",0,11,1

5.0,11/4/2017,"What an amazing experience we had here for dinner (actually dinner menu at lunch time by our choice)!  We had a Gilt City Voucher, which we almost regretted because they had a beautiful lunch menu at a crazy price.  So first let me explain the lunch menu-a starter and an entree for $19.95.  We saw a lot of food go by and the portions were very generous and everything looked delicious.  Great presentation.  But our voucher was for a specific dollar amount and this would actually have been too cheap.  So we ordered off the dinner menu.I had meatballs-they were served very hot, plenty of sauce the way I like, and were quite large.  I ate every drop and enjoyed it.  She had the mushroom bruschetta which was HUGE and very unique.  She enjoyed it and had some to bring home.  For the main dish I asked them to make gnocchi with bolognese which they happily did and it was delicious.  The gnocchi were light, like I have had in Italy, not little rocks like some places.  She had the roast chicken with rosemary sauce.  Again very generous portions and very tasty with mashed potatoes and broccoli.Now let's talk service.  When we first saw our waitress Denise we thought she was kind of serious.  Turns out she was just busy.  She was very helpful and friendly and made it quite a pleasant experience.  The woman who was either a manager or maybe an owner named Bobby (forgive me if I got that wrong, but I wasn't hearing that well for some reason) went above and beyond.  If she isn't an owner she certainly acted with the care and pride of someone who truly wanted the customer to have a great time and enjoy the food and ambiance.  There had been a mixup with one entree causing a delay.  She was very apologetic and brought my pasta back to the kitchen to keep it hot.  When the food came back out later I swear mine was a new dish entirely because it looked like I hadn't eaten any but I had actually had a little before it went back.  Everything was hot and fresh.  She also bought us desserts to make up for it despite knowing we were already there on a discount.  To give you an idea about the level not just of service but of kindness, she also talked with us about options to help with storing our leftovers because we had mentioned we were in the city all day and into the late night for a concert for our anniversary.  Who would be that thoughtful?  It was very much appreciated.So, with the delicious food, amazing prices, great ambiance, and awesome service you can imagine how much we can't wait to return!  We highly recommend this gem in Chelsea.",0,0,0,Susan K.,"Franklin, NJ",0,40,2

She had no patience at all and a horrible tone to her.  She also informed us that there was no bread.  Really-no bread in an Italian restaurant on a Saturday night.  Then the manager brought a small basket of cold bread and slammed the olive oil on the table.  We paid for the drinks and left.  This is the rudest staff I have ever seen.,0,0,0,L X.,"Englewood, NJ",0,35,0

2.0,5/22/2017,"Oh man, I really don't know if I have anything good to say about my experience here. Not only was service terribly slow (even for a time where there were at max 10 tables in such a huge space), but the food did not satisfy at all.You get complimentary poppy seed muffins to start out. Not fresh, kinda old. Comes with those orange marmalade in plastic containers. Looks like something you'd buy from a discounted grocery store, to be harsh. These muffins took a while to come, and so did the water. After it took about 15/20 minutes of getting seated for us to get water, they were a bit more diligent about refilling our glasses.The calamari was probably the best part of the meal. It comes with fried zucchini noodles, but the zucchini is sliced soooo thin, it crumbles because it's fried and doesn't really taste like anything. The marinara sauce is watery also. I went for Sunday brunch and a lot of the menu comes with fries. And I love fries, so I got excited for that. Unfortunately, the fries tasted like they had been fried early in the morning and simply got reheated in the microwave prior to serving. They were very hot to taste, but pretty soggy.The panini I ordered came with eggplant, tomatoes, pesto, and some other vegetables I believe. The vegetables were sooo greasy, and the pesto barely had any flavor in it. Almost no garlic, I really felt like I was eating a sandwich with an insane amount of grease in it. Because of this, the bread also came out extremely soggy. The bread also tasted a bit stale, not toasted. It's quite sad because the interior is beautiful and there is also outdoor seating. I think most people who come to dine there do so because of the aesthetics, not for the quality of the actual food.",5,2,1,Hannah C.,"New York, NY",661,433,1108

I went to the Chelsea Bocca di Bacco with a friend from out of town that I studied abroad with in Italy.One of the main reasons I picked this restaurant was because it has lots of Sicilian dishes on the menu featured on their website. We had 8:30 reservations and checked in promptly with the hostess. She led us to a table that wasn't yet set and she said someone would set it shortly. As we were taking off our jackets, a nearby waiter HURLED a menu at us as if he was playing a violent game of frisbee. The hostess looked mortified and apologized and brought us to another table, we could hear here complaining to the manager about what happened.As we sit down there are paper menus on the table with completely different options that they had on their menu online. The paper menu featured about 4 pasta dishes which neither of us wanted and completely different options than the regular menu. I assumed it was a specials menu and asked our waiter for a real menu... he said it's only one per table... what...? We get our hands on a regular menu and the waiter says no no no you can't order from there, only the paper menu. So I flat out asked him ""what is this menu?"" ""Is this some sort of special menu?"" He rolls his eyes at me and says ""what do you mean this is out menu and gives me a look like I had just killed his first born. I haven't been given a look like that or made to feel that stupid since middle school with mean girls. I told him this is not the menu I saw and there's no way this is their normal menu with 4 things on it... he grabbed the paper menus from us and I said we were going to leave. So we left...On our way out I called the hostess who had witnessed her staff flinging menus at us and she explained there was something wrong in the kitchen and it absolutely wasn't their normal menu at all... She was very gracious and very apologetic, I explained how rude our waiter was and how he rolled his eyes at me and how dumb he made me feel for being confused. The waiter should have told us from the beginning something was wrong in the kitchen and yes this is absolutely a special menu. We ended up leaving and had a great Italian meal elsewhere, no menus were thrown and no waiter rolled his eyes at me.  But shoutout to the wonderful hostess.",3,2,0,Alexandra M.,"Manhattan, NY",184,100,61

1.0,8/8/2016,"This restaurant is in my neighborhood.  I have been multiple times over the past few years.  Net-net, the food and setting were decent.  Notice that I used the past tense.  On my last dining experience, the service was pretty abysmal, and the food was off.However, this is not why I am writing this review.  The day after dining at Bocca di Bacco, I was on-line reviewing my credit card charges, and my dinner charge was over $70 more than my total with tip!  In all honesty, I do not review my credit card bills on a regular basis, so it was pure luck that I caught the error.  I was absolutely appalled.  The following day, I went into the restaurant to speak with the manager.  He reluctantly spoke with me.  At first he seemed hesitant to believe that there was an error, but after some time digging around in a back room, he ascertained that I was indeed correct.  Thank God, I saved my credit card receipt.  So now, I have been overcharged after a marginal dining experience.  I then had to spend time reporting the error to my credit card company and ultimately had to go down to restaurant on a summer Sunday afternoon to address their mistake.  I had now spent an inordinate of time dealing with this issue, and I was pretty angry about the whole situation. The server supposedly mixed up the charge amount with another customer when entering the totals into the system.  Ultimately, the manager's response to me was, ""Mistakes happen,"" with a shrug of the shoulders.  He then said that he would fix it.  Gee.....thanks. I won't be back.The lesson learned here people is watch your credit card bills.  If I had not reviewed my credit card statement, they would have gotten away with it.  From reading reviews below, it appears this restaurant might have issues related to credit cards.  For shame Bocca di Bacco,  for shame....You've Been Warned!",0,1,0,Tim S.,"New York, NY",3,100,0

The appetizers were all good, I had the Caesar salad which had a nice anchovy flavor to it (beware if that's not your thing). I had the lamb ragu for my entree and it was alright, not fantastic. Some others orders the gnocchi and they really liked it. The chicken wrapped around the salad was pretty cool.

We had the Quaglia E Polenta and, although I don't like polenta, loved everything else. My boyfriend ordered the Taglierini Neri Con Grancho (ordered it because we thought it would be a cool thing to try the squid ink pasta name and all). We both thought it was pretty good, a bit on the salty side but not a big problem with the amount of bread we got. I got the Costoletta D'Agnello which is probably on of the best things, very juicy and tender. The Profiteroles are probably the BEST things I have ever had in my entire life.

He took us through Bocca Di Bacco's specials, including a seafood pasta that would up being by entree. We did make our way through some appetizers and a bit of wine during the meal as well.

I had the Eggs Benedict, with spinach and salmon (yes, you can do that). Not much to go wrong with that. My brunch partners didn't fare as well. One had asked for eggs, fried, not runny. Well done. And potatoes, bacon well done, salad. No bread please, needs to be gluten-free. They brought her some kind of not-sure-what. Sort of like a roll of scrambled eggs wrapped around something with bacon and mushrooms. And of course, white toast on top of it all. Sent it back. The waiter then returned with what appeared to be a plain egg white omelette (imagine how that looked), with bacon on the side. Rather than return it again, we just had that meal deducted from the bill. She ate the bacon. And our third bruncher today ordered the spaghetti alla carbonara. Seemed to be made with fresh pasta, which was nice, but it wasn't seasoned. Maybe they're trying to be careful with salt, but something like this has to have taste! So at this point, I guess we're down to two stars. It's just, again, that there doesn't seem to be a ""foodie"" involved anywhere here. There's no evidence of anyone who cares about food, at least not for the early part of the day.

Atmosphere was a tad loud, but that could be because the bus stops right in front (and because of all the Italians eating there). We started with the mushroom bruschetta and the special of Buratta cheese over tomatoes and prosciutto. I LOVED the Buratta dish. The mushroom bruschetta was like French onion soup on bread. For entrees, I ordered the special of shrimp scampi risotto. Had just the right amount of lemon zest in it that really took the dish to a whole new level. There was a good shrimp to risotto ratio as well. Boyfriend ordered the squid ink pasta with crab meat. Nice chunky pieces of crab meat, evenly dispersed throughout the dish without it being too much. We also ordered the spinach as a side but it wasn't necessary, as our appetizers plus entree was enough to fill us. For dessert we shared the tiramisu, which was light and airy and delicious!",0,0,0,Danielle D.,"Bronx, NY",5,75,9

Of course by then the entree had been completed and the potatoes were dessert.What a shame for this restaurant.  It's an attractive interior and the food is well prepared.I would suggest to turn the music down and speed up the service.",0,0,0,David S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0

It was a busy night and even with reservations had to wait a few for a table.The crowd was typical mid-town. Men in leather loafers or business attire. Women all dolled up for the evening with their Coach bags. Most if not all eating before their Theatre. Well, some might not make it.. One lady in a chic attire only a mid-westerner thinks what one should wear to a NYC show was so plastered she could barely stand. She just decided to sit back down....there goes Mamma Mia at 7pm.We got a nice cozy table only by squeezing through a mass of people between the bar and people eating on the other side. The waiter was quick to get to us. The menu looked good with assorted meat, seafood and pasta dishes. We started with some cocktails to jolly up the meal. The grilled octopus appetizer was very well flavored tender.  The seafood special past came with half a lobster and  I got the grilled Branzio(Not the whole fish. Just the fillet). I'd have to say food wise was very good. The server was attentive water always filled.I'd have so say while the many Italian restaurant in the city.

Lastly, the noise: the table next to us was full of screeching women who frequently cackled at an ear splitting level.  One or two had laughs that sounded as if cats were being strangled.  It was necessary to shout our order and plug one ear as the noise level reached intolerable levels.  Overall a hideous experience given what it once was...",0,0,0,Danica A.,"Manhattan, NY",21,117,15
1.0,1/8/2015,"I came here on new year's eve with my boyfriend and it was possibly the worst way to end 2014. After waiting 20 minutes for a waiter to come, we placed our orders and waited another 40 for the food to come. The lobster bisque they brought out should have been called tomato soup with a sprinkle of lobster. About 30 minutes later, they brought out the main dishes. The meat was overcooked and dry, and the gnocchi was overcooked and soggy. Another 20 minutes later came the creme brulee, which was probably the best part of the night but even then was relatively flavorless and not worth it.Throughout this entire time we were seated downstairs with terrible lighting (probably to hide the fact that the wallpaper was peeling and a few of the ceiling tiles were broken). The music downstairs would play very loudly over the stereo for about 5 minutes, then stop for 15. Then the manager would come downstairs and turn it on for another 5, before someone turned it back off. I would be fine with the loud music or the lack of music, but please just choose one option and stick with it.We would have been out there in as little time as possible but the service was so slow that it took us over 2 hours to get in and out. Now, I understand that new year's eve is very busy and it was painfully obvious that the restaurant was understaffed, but this was still one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had.

Delicious._________________THE STORY:A first time for me, I had stumbled into Bocca without any previous knowledge or recommendation. It was a gorgeous night and the outdoor seating area, glowing candles, and lovely mood had influenced my choice. I had the DENTICE CON COZZE E VONGOLE which was contrived of pan-seared red snapper, mussels, clams, white wine, and saffron. I must say, at this first glance, it was somewhat disheveled on the plate. A large portion, it was a bit piled up onto itself and was slightly embarrassing to claim. After taking a bite, it was nothing more than ordinary. The snapper, mussels, and clams were cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth, but there was very little seasoning to lift the natural flavors of the proteins and saffron. The Tiramisu was phenomenal! Of course! The shaved chocolate on top gave it a nice crunch for texture. After dessert, I had finished my wine, entree, and dessert but was disappointed to have to wait at least 15-20 minutes for the bill with nothing to distract me. As an ex-server and mixologist, it made me sad to leave with that frustration. Service before that point was perfectly fine... it was only in the last half hour with many missed moments for eye-contact and finally flagging down our server. _________________OVERALL SUMMARY: I would certainly go back to give it another go... sometimes, there are off nights.

We had grilled octopus salad and calamari for appetizer. the octopus was nicely done. calamari was a-ok not particularly flavorful or soft.

We started at the bar with some wine until everyone who was coming to dinner got there. The bartenders were friendly and knowledgeable and really wanted to make sure that you liked your wine. They let me try one before I ordered, which was a very lucky thing since it was far too dry for my tastes. After we moved over to the dining area, everyone was super classy and professional. A bartender brought our wines to us at the table, and all the drinks were quickly refreshed. I had the Formaggi Misti ($17) to start, and made use of the fresh bread to munch on it with. None of the cheeses were really epic, but they were good. I do wish the waiter had told us what they were when he brought the plate over, but he stopped back a few minutes later and we were able to ask him then. They were served with a berry spread and honey, as well as grapes. My coworker got the Caesar salad and it had actual anchovies in it, so beware if that will freak you out.For dinner, I had the vegetable tortelli ($23) which had these crazy dried leaves of some kind on top that made it really delicious. The asparagus that was in the pasta was cooked perfectly. The pasta itself was fresh and likely homemade. And what is an Italian dinner without some Tiramisu and Chocolate Cake?

Food was good, started with the fried calamari which was cooked well & followed it up with the orrechiatte with lamb ragu, pretty good.

Even went in to tell someone and still no one came out to take orders. This is actually the second time here, last time was similar, extremely slow service but at least we had food!

4.0,8/4/2013,"Happy hour oysters ($1) drew us up the street to Bocca di Bacco. Alright, so did an episode where I saw La La and her gay business partner eating here. But more so the oysters.We each had a glass of wine - both red Cabs, but each was good and a decent price by the glass. My boyfriend had oysters and I ordered a pot of mussels. The mussels were nice, none of them were closed or grainy, so I was satisfied with my choice of food. I'd like to come back here for dinner, but for a standard Chelsea restaurant, it's on the pricey side, so we'll most likely come back on the weekend or for a semi-special dinner.",0,0,0,Lauren C.,"Norwalk, CT",364,228,74
4.0,7/31/2013,"Stumbled upon this place and really happy I did. The vibe is very chill. They are located on the corner and both sides were totally open, great for the summer. The wine is definitely pricey but they have an extensive list and the wine is in special coolers that perfectly portion the pour, and you can even get just a taste of a more expensive wine. The bartender was friendly and I think it was the owner that also came around to check on us, even though we were only sitting at the bar. I thought that was a nice, personal touch.",1,0,0,Marisa L.,"Brooklyn, NY",100,614,683

4.0,6/16/2013,"My friend and I came here on a mid-Saturday afternoon looking for a relaxing place to have a couple of drinks -- Bocca Di Bacco delivered. All the windows were thrown open so the ambiance was certainly wonderful. Great place to bring a date or catch up with friends. They only had one beer on draft (I forgot it's name, but the waitress described it as a Corona with sweet undertones and she was right on), but it was $7 for a tall glass, which I thought was pretty reasonable. They had $1 oysters at the bar from 4pm onwards, which we thoroughly took advantage of. It was a market selection, so you don't have much say on the type of oyster but they were all delicious, savory, and well-prepared. The special is only available at the bar, otherwise a dozen oysters puts you at $18 on the floor.Service was great and so polite. We rotated between a couple of bartenders and servers since they were changing from lunch to dinner staff. They were attentive without being too in your face, and the bartender even let me use his iPhone charger! I'll definitely come back for the $18 all you can drink bloody mary's/mimosas soon.",2,0,0,Karina L.,"Boston, MA",184,456,180

2.0,5/27/2013,"We were on our way to Serafina MPD and decided to go off track once we walked passed Bocca Di Bacco. Being from the area, we're always looking for neighborhood spots so this felt like the perfect opportunity to give this one a try. We walked inside, sat down immediately - which meant we were already off to a great start. The decor was slick without trying too hard - the walls were dressed in a dark brick and there were long black masculine couches. I was quickly impressed with how it all looked, and the huge open window at the front of the restaurant which allowed you to eat inside while feeling like you were outside. And then for 10 minutes after sitting down, nobody came over to us - not to show us the menu, bring us water or even check our pulse to see if were alive. I had to summon a busboy to get us water. Finally, the waiter greeted us with about as much charisma as a doorknob - guess he wasn't in the mood to set the world on fire. We ordered fried rice balls to start, a spinach tortellini to share, then we each ordered our main dishes - I got the lamb shank, and she got the eggplant, to close it off, we ordered a side of brussels sprouts. Within seconds, our fried rice balls came out - they were tasty, totally a solid choice. Our pasta dish never came. And then our mains came which were also tasty. As we're finishing our main dishes, the side dish decides to come out. We complained to the waiter and right as we're finished complaining - the check hits the table and the waiter walks away. He was rude - he didn't feel like offering (or asking if we wanted to order) us a desert for the terrible service or missing dishes.All in all, the food was fine - for that reason alone, we would consider going back. The service was pathetic though, and it's sad to see a restaurant that has potential fall to the wayside because their operations are short a few chromosomes.",5,0,0,Sary A.,"New York, NY",368,67,3

5.0,5/14/2013,We came here for a double date on a Saturday evening.When you enter you can take in the decor and enjoy it. It's not 'trying too hard' which is well appreciated. I don't think it could offend anyone.The service was incredibly on point. Living in Brooklyn you get used to good-looking waiters who really don't give a damn about your evening but here I didn't feel uncomfortable asking questions and was never thirsty. Now it's nice to say all these positive things about the ambience and the servers but let's get down to the nitty-gritty: the food. Eat here. Spend the money because it's worth it. Just eat here.My gnocchi entree was simply perfect. A nice balance free of aggressive flavors and it made me full and cozy like a gnocchi should.  My man got one of the specials and couldn't stop gushing about it (and he wasn't THAT drunk.. it was just that good). We ended with dessert and Grappa. Their Grappa menu is extensive so have fun and order something.  All in all it was an amazing experience. Deserves every star.,0,0,1,Jensen E.,"Miami, FL",240,212,2

1.0,3/4/2013,"Truly one of the worst restaurants I've been to in years - both of us thought we'd get sick. First off, service was very cold, uninterested, and uneven. Some tables were offered fresh ground pepper and a list of specials but most weren't - was it only offered for regulars? Staff was clearly annoyed about something with our waiter cursing as he walked by us when returning a plate of food that another table sent back. BUT the worst was the food:1. A poached pear and arugula salad had no discernable pears and was swimming in dressing.2. A beet salad with beans had an uneven temperature and was topped with a dry disk of goat cheese - a very inartful display and tasteless.3. Rosemary chicken had no reosemary and the chicken was dry and overcooked.4. And the worst was red snapper with shellfish which arrived skin side up and consisted mainly of tiny shells that were empty! The fish was similarly tiny and COMPLETELY dried out, which is probably why they had it skin side up.Both of us felt sick afterward - luckily we survived the night with no major problems.On top of this, the wine list by the bottle is way overpriced - few bottles of red below $50 and if below $50 the wines are weak and watery.The best part of the meal was the iced tap water!DO NOT EAT HERE!",0,0,0,John S.,"New York, NY",0,1,0

First of all, when I got here they did not have my reservation recorded so we were forced to wait at the bar, which didn't turn out so bad because the bartender was a total hottie- really nice pecs! THEN, when my partner and I were seated and placed our orders, the waiter passed gas and was joking about it! Later in the meal he made another remark about ""explosive diareah."" Bathroom humor at dinner?? GROSS! So, we split the octopus and eggplant involtino to start. The octopus was lukewarm and the eggplant was mushy and tasteless. Should have cut our losses right there! For our entrees we ordered branzino and my partner ordered the tortellini. The fish was dry and utterly tasteless. The tortellini was unremarkable. I stared into my lover's eyes and knew he was dissatisfied (a look im certainly not used to ;)The service was slow (and gassy!) and further detracted from a very disappointing night. You would think that would be rock bottom, but no, less than two hours later I was very sick from the food. Hard to pinpoint which dish caused it, but needless to say I was choking the toliet bowl worse than Harry Dunn! I only wish I could have punished Boca Di Baccos bathroom instead of my Partners!
