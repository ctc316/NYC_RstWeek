2.0,4/14/2019,"Tiny portions.  Bland food.  Overpriced (higher than their online menu prices).  It's just not worth it, but I had it after a show since it's close to the theaters.  The reviews of this place are bizarrely high online.  For what?  I don't get it.  Look at the pics.  Each entree was about $30.  Fortunately, I'm going back home to Chicago where I can get decent Italian food at normal prices. One of my grandparents was Italian, and he spent hours in the kitchen making vegetable and bread soup, among other things.  I ate food like that for the first 20 years of my life.  This is not that kind of food... among a few other NYC failures I didn't even bother to review.",0,0,0,Bryce M.,"Glencoe, IL",0,9,10

Every single time the food is consistently excellent and the service beyond excellent. The prices are incredibly reasonable for being on Broadway and the food selection is amazing. Try the pasta with sausage short ribs and grandma's sauce it's incredible! If you're heading to a show before dinner they will move you in and out of this place in record time yet make you feel relaxed and not rushed meanwhile you get a great dinner before you head to your Broadway show.

5.0,3/14/2019,This is a great pre-theater dinner spot. The food is delicious! The service is wonderful and very attentive...we did not have to ask for anything as our needs were anticipated and taken care of immediately.  We had the fresh pasta special which was delicious and we were guided in our selection of a great bottle of Italian wine.  Do not miss the cheesecake - soooo good!!! True to NYC the restaurant is crowded so be prepared to be cozy with your neighbor.  Even with the crowded space it still is not too loud and easy to enjoy dinner conversation,0,0,0,SMP M.,"CORONA DL MAR, CA",0,82,27

For my entree, I had the special.   2 types of fish (one was snapper I believe), and 2 jumbo and I mean jumbo, prawns.    It was fantastic.     I try not to eat bowls of pasta but I did need to try their red sauce as that's my measure of an Italian place (I know, I know...red sauce is really just in the South), so I ordered a side bowl of pasta.    Excellent!  Not too sweet.  For me it was perfect.    I saw others ordering Veal Parm and they all barely had half as the entree was huge.Finished off with an amazing cappuccino.Overall a fantastic meal and experience.",0,0,0,Keith B.,"Pompano Beach, FL",155,540,3

4.0,2/12/2019,"I decided to stop by multiple times but a table was not to be had. I went one Sunday afternoon and they told me if I could eat and they could have the table back for a reservation by a certain time, they could seat me. I agreed to this and kept my word. I was seated in the middle of the room and the menu and wine list arrived along with tap water and Italian bread and EVOO with capers. The Italian bread was a meal onto itself-crunchy and delicious!  I ordered a glass of the Rampicollo and decided on the ravioli angelina. Ravioli with a red sauce which were hot and delicious. It is a very large space and I think there was even upstairs seating and a great deal of help. I finished my meal and ordered a double espresso which finished the meal nicely. The restroom is clean and well maintained. La Masseria is pricey but has a wonderful ambience and my waiter Vincent was attentive and accommodating.

4.0,2/4/2019,"One of my favorite Italian spots in NYC. Reservation for pre theatre dinner for 5 last week when it was 4 degrees outside, brrrrrr! Seated promptly on arrival, and waiter immediately cam to describe specials and take drink orders. Consistently outstanding service. Seating can be a bit tight and close, but after al it's NYC. We did an assortment of appetizers to share. Fried calamari is not a particularly unusual dish, but their's is special. Fresh, lightly fried and seasoned to perfection......no marinara coverup needed. My table ordered 3 filet specials, a pasta dish, and I had one of the fish specials with a customized finish I requested. Everyone was very pleased with their selections. I have to have the sautéed spinach in olive oil and garlic.My group had not been together for years and so the conversation was intense and engrossing.

We really didn't want to rush, so we opted to sit at the bar. So glad we decided to do so!

5.0,11/21/2018,"Right off the bustling streets of Times Square, La Masseria is a tucked away taste of Italy. The interior is clean and cozy, and comes across as an upscale eatery. While the menu is a little pricey, you get what you are paying for. The food is extremely high quality and tasty. Coffee- The coffee is fresh and hot. The staff will bring you cream and honey upon your request, but I believe they do charge for refills. Complimentary bread- The bread is high tasty and comes with two different loaf types along with bread sticks. Pasta Special- Our first entree was a linguine with fresh, light, tomato sauce along with shrimp and fresh crab. I am usually not a fan of red sauce, but this was so fresh that it hit the spot. Salmon- This was my favorite part of the meal. The salmon was cooked perfectly at medium and had a beautifully crunchy side after being grilled. It also came with a mustard sauce, which I was worried about but turned out to be very pleasant and not overpowering at all. I am excited to come back and possibly try their dinner menu!",2,1,1,Tara N.,"San Diego, CA",68,209,1090

1.0,9/8/2018,"I've been here two times. My first time here was okay, nothing bad, nothing noticeable, but the second time I was here, our waiter was very rude. It is very unfortunate that I recommended this restaurant for my friend's 28th birthday celebration. We had a group of four and from the beginning, I could tell there was something off about their service: not being careful about where they put the menus, waiter shushing me while pouring wine when I was trying to ask for a dish recommendation, etc. While we were eating, the waiter started taking away our dishes without asking us and started making lots of loud clanking noises (right next to our faces) from stacking plates. Some of us were still eating and just exchanged awkward looks. Then, the waiter actually hit my friend's shoulder really hard from moving toward the table too quickly. I talked to the waiter about how he should slow down and wait until we were done eating before cleaning up. The manager came up later and apologized but I will not be returning.",0,0,0,Soph J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0

I ordered the giant raviolis stuffed with ricotta and a runny egg. There were three on the plate and they were fabulous. I know there was balsamic and garlic in the sauce but not sure what else. Also shared an appetizer of mozzarella wrapped around eggplant, sun-dried tomatoes, olives, and onions. Very tasty. Ended my meal with Nutella crepes.

5.0,8/7/2018,"I should first note that I have been using Yelp to find restaurants for a long time, but have never felt the need to review a restaurant before. La Masseria was hands down the best Italian restaurant I have ever been to, and among the best restaurants I have ever been to generally speaking.My husband and I had dinner here for our anniversary. After spending far too long looking for a restaurant, we decided on La Masseria, and it turned out to be the perfect choice. The ambience is perfect for a special occasion. It is classy but not stuffy. The service is wonderful, and our waiter in particular was very kind and considerate. The food was simply amazing, from presentation to taste and quality. We started with the fried seafood appetizer (calamari, shrimp, scallops). They were very nice and split the appetizer into one plate for each of us without us even asking! The seafood was incredibly fresh and delicious. I usually am not a big fan of scallops or calamari, but I couldn't get enough of this!I had the ravioli and my husband had the pasta with smoked mozzerella and eggplant. Both were scrumptious. I only wish I could have had more! Finally, we ended with a creme brulee, which, like everything else, was splendid.We don't have any desire to try and find any other Italian restaurant in NYC--we don't think anything can be better than this!

So I decided to order a salad, because it was the cheapest thing (14$). When I got it it was terrible! Very bitter. So I ordered a different dish. It was way better. I had a good meal but it was expensive. I honestly would recommend not coming here for a couple reasons. One, it is very expensive.

When my husband left the table for the restroom the waiter came and folded him napkin neatly.Food - I like how when you order starters to share, they split it into 2 plates.

5.0,6/27/2018,"The dishes enjoyed by my husband and I last night were hands-down the best and most authentic Italian dishes we've ever had in the states. The portions were perfect - not grotesquely oversized or forced family style as you find in many restaurants these days. The Tagliatelle Alla Bolognese was balanced but intense - the sauce full of flavor in every bite but not overpowering the delicious homemade fettuccine. The light red sauce of the Tagliolini All Astice was a perfect play with the delicate lobster. Every bite was fresh, warm, and loaded with flavor. Not to mention, the presentation of the lobster shell on the dish was a delight. The tiramisu was also some of the best I've ever had. Perfect bite and sweetness, creamy and moist but not too wet. Perfection. Our server was excellent as was all of the support staff. They made thoughtful recommendations, from drinks to whether a dish would benefit from pepper or cheese. Our drinks were always full, the tables kept tidy. Our server was warm and professional - friendly without being an overbearing presence. Additionally, we requested a specific table (a four seater for only two people) as it was our anniversary and we were happily accommodated by the host without any fuss. (We actually left Trattoria Trecolori a few minutes earlier because they refused that accommodation despite being only 25% full and having a reservation.) The host and the restaurant were smart to accommodate business at your doorstep instead of hoping for sales that may never arrive.

First off, the snooty hostess totally gave me a body check.  Head to toe.  I almost left then, but another guy stepped in and offered us a table.  If we were dressed inappropriately, I really wish they would have said sorry, but we are booked, since we didn't have reservations.  Secondly, the food was very average at best.  We are from New Orleans and used to flavorful foods.  Ours was quite bland.  But my daughter liked her food and was super excited to be there.  That's the only reason I added a star.",0,0,0,N S.,"Madisonville, LA",0,8,0

I was able to enjoy a glass of red wine, an entree, a dessert, and give about a 30% tip for the cost I quoted. I was trying to decide between two meals, and the server helped me to choose wisely- ""Perhaps the Bucatini Vecchia Roma would be a bit heavy for this time of night [11:15 p.m.], so the Ravioli di Angelina may be a better choice."" Excellent advice. The ravioli pasta was Capri style (simple, very thin and light tasting, nothing like the thick dough used in many American Italian restaurants). The cheese filling, caciotta - local to the island of Capri, Italy, was new to me, but was very subtle. The red sauce was very light and complimented the ravioli well. I had eight raviolis, which between that and the bread basket with olive oil dip, was plenty of food for me. For dessert I took to-go some Tiramisu. It was homemade and delicious!

5.0,4/17/2018,"We usually don't expect much from a Theater District restaurant but La Masseria can stand on its culinary merits alone. We arrived a half hour before our reserved time but were seated promptly anyway. Decor is Italian farmhouse with wooden beams, rustic stucco walls and huge floral displays, both inviting and luxe. House martinis were potent, crunchy bread sticks and garlic dip soaked up the alcohol nicely. We shared the burrata appetizer, the most creamy delicious version we've ever had. Branzino special was fresh and succulent. Warm apple tart with ice cream finished things off nicely, hubbie said his tartufo was delish. Service was friendly and well paced even though the place was hopping. Try calling for reservations even if Opentable shows no openings, worked for us.",1,1,1,Linda K.,"East Meadow, NY",64,187,49

3.0,4/15/2018,"Everything we ate here was amazing. However, I'm putting only three stars because the service was pretty terrible. We had the scallop and artichoke appetizer. The scallops were perfectly grilled and the whole dish was very tasty. For entrees, I had the tagliatelle bolognese. The pasta tasted fresh, and was very delicate and flavorful. The sauce was rich and not too thick. The other pasta dish we had (I cannot remember the name, but it had bacon and onions in it) was also very good, though those noodles were a little harder to eat as they kept slipping off the fork, no matter what method we tried. But the pasta was still delicious and fresh. However, the service was awful. We made reservations, and were seated behind the host stand. That meant there were constantly employees standing almost on top of us, and I kept getting knocked into by the staff. Our waiter was very brusk, even to the point of being rude. Even when we placed the order he would interrupt and talk over us. Then we had a hard time getting the check. Luckily, because of the 3-4 staff constantly standing within an inch of me at the host stand, we were able to get one of them to go get the waiter to bring the check.

If I go out, I like to get something a bit unique, that I can't make myself.  I can cook a good steak au poivre any night (and do, occasionally).  The manager offered to replace my meal, very graciously, but I declined due to my disinclination from the menu offerings.  He then refunded the cost of my entree- very professional.  Others in my party fared better.  I am very disappointed, as the location is convenient to City Center and Carnegie Hall, but I'll be sticking with a favorite across Seventh Avenue.",0,0,0,Sarah S.,"New York, NY",0,21,9

We were seated promptly. The decor was beautiful and the space is large. I understand we were in the city, and perhaps my opinion is slightly more biased being that I'm not from the city, but the tables are so close together. Uncomfortably close. Our waiter was extremely attentive! The staff is educated in knowing how to properly take care of their patrons, which I really appreciated! My husband and I split everything including a glass of wine. Instead of bringing us one plate and then sharing plates, the staff took it upon themselves to split everything for us. Amazing. Details like that make me want to go back! The food was very good! We enjoyed the octopus and salad. My husband ordered pasta and finshed the whole plate! That's unheard of for him. I ordered the ORATA whole fish which does come with a side even though there is no mention of it on the menu. My sides were cauliflower with cheese and butter and mashed potatoes.

The dining room is pretty, BUT the tables are much, MUCH too close together with little space for waitstaff and patrons to maneuver, leading to a not quite comfortable dining experience. The food runs the gamut from delicious (the pasta with clam sauce was truly outstanding, al dente pasta cooked to perfection with tender clams prepared with a scrumptious white clam sauce) to very good (the gnocchi or grilled chicken with leeks) to mediocre at best ( the rabbit was not de-boned properly and was not tender and the veal Milanese was flavorless). The desserts and Cappuccinos were very good (ricotta cheese cake and chocolate cake were creamy, not too sweet and yummy).  We like La Masseria, but they must remove a table or two as it borders on the uncomfortable.... and the pastas are too good, the room is too pretty, and the service is too attentive to spoil it all by being packed in like a rush hour subway car.",2,0,1,Robin K.,"West Nyack, NY",0,13,0

4.0,9/27/2017,If you're in the Theater District looking for outstanding Italian cuisine you need go no further than La Masseria on 48th Street.... we've dined there pre-theater  and post theater multiple times and have never been disappointed. Prices are fair allowing you to stay under $125 for two if you don't go overboard on the wines and if you tend to share your appetizers and desserts.... we have found that  the staff  was very accommodating in that they provided us with last-minute  outdoor seating when we tried to make reservations approximately 45 minutes before arrival time.As for the cuisine my wife and I shared a very generous seafood salad( Terra Mare Tavoliere) comprised of baby octopus and cuttlefish with fava bean puree and broccoli rabe. Since the portions are very generous I would suggest at this be shared as an appetizer or otherwise you will have no room for the entree. Being in the mood for pasta I opted for their gnocchi prepared with radicchio and a wonderful taleggio cheese sauce.... not recommended if you are on a Statin .My wife thoroughly enjoyed her ravioli also made with cheese in a light tomato sauce... another member of our party thoroughly enjoyed his calves liver made with onions and a blueberry vinegar preparation. I sampled the dish and felt that blueberries should be relegated to my breakfast cereal and not calves liver.As for dessert I wanted to share the tiramisu which I've had in the past and can say it's wonderful..  but I was forced to share a tartufo which sort of did the trick... bottom line is that La Masseria is a wonderful Theater District Italian restaurant with a great staff which will bring you  wonderful sophisticated Italian cuisine without breaking the bank.... which presumably has already been broken by outrageous Broadway Theater prices.,1,0,0,Jacob B.,"Boca Raton, FL",65,272,38

3.0,8/28/2017,"First off, let me start with the positives.  The food is excellent (although prepared amazingly fast, from ordering to table under 5 minutes at every table I observed).  We started with the meatballs as an appetizer, delicious.  My wife ordered the Tagliolini All Astice, the pasta was perfect and the lobster perfect.  I enjoyed the Bocconcini Di Pollo Al Vin Cotto, Funehi E Salsiccia, the chicken sausage and mushroom were very tasty and well prepared in a very nice sauce.The service was very rushed and our waiter kept circling for us to order.  First we did drinks, kept circling.  Then we order our appetizer. No sooner did I put my fork in my meatball he was back, 'are you ready to order dinner'?  I looked at him like he was crazy and he backed off.  The rest of our dinner went the same.  We were in and out in 55 minutes, not a relaxed dining experience, and for no apparent reason.  When we arrived we asked for a table outside in front of the restaurant.  Even though there we abundant empty tables we were told they were all 'reserved' and unavailable.  Since I did not request an outdoor table when I made my reservation I accepted the explanation.  The entire time we were in the restaurant there remained empty tables outside so obviously I was very disappointed with the attitude.  Upon seating we were put at a very small table for two, even though I asked for a four top that would have been more roomy and private.  Again we were told they were reserved however not only did they not fill up they actually began seating two's at those tables.  Again, very disappointed.  My dish was served with mashed potato and zucchini and I asked for pasta instead and was told the only option I had was to order an additional 1/2 portion of any pasta on the menu.We would definitely return to La Masseria but it will be I who comes with the attitude next time.",0,0,0,Robert W.,"Northport, NY",0,2,0

1.0,5/5/2017,I can't review the food because I did not have any. My son and I had heard a lot of good things about this place. Since we were seeing Hello Dolly on May 3. I called about a week before to make a reservation for dinner . I was given a 7:30 time.  On May 2nd I called to confirm the reservation and make sure they noted my son was in a wheelchair.  No problem they had the reservation. About an hour or so later I got a call from a woman at the restaurant asking if we could come in at 7:00. This was no problem because we were going to a 2:00 show. At 7 we arrived at the restaurant .  We were greeted then told we did not have any reservations! I told the Host a few times our reservation story but he seemed to think I was making it up. He did offer to put us on the list for a table but it would be at least 45 minutes. We did not want to wait . Why give our business to a restaurant that did not want us?

4.0,4/17/2017,"We did an OpenTable reservation, never having been here before but appreciating the positive reviews as well as the convenient location in the theater district. I found this place to be authentically Italian. I think every staff member, from the maitre'd to the water server spoke fluent Italian. And not 5th generation American, NY born and raised Italian, but like I was transported to a quaint mom-and-pop establishment in Italy.We were immediately seated upstairs in this little balcony/nook that overlooked the entire dining area. It was small and not for the claustrophobic, but I found it quaint and cozy. You do have to walk up a small flight of stairs (as do the poor waiters every time they service a table up here), so please keep that in mind if you have physically-impaired guests in your party.We had dinner at 7pm on a Saturday night, and there were only a handful of empty 2-seater tables throughout the entire place. We chose 7pm because it was in between the matinee and evening performances, and we thought it would be a good time to avoid some of the rush. (We had already seen a matinee.)They asked us what kind of water we wanted (we opted for tap). They brought a basket of bread - cold, not warm; but it contained some parmesan crunchy thin bread sticks that were surprisingly addictive. One unique/different thing - they brought a small bowl of cold lentils in olive oil. I had not encountered this as a bread/starter option before in an Italian establishment. I piled some on a piece of bread and found it tasty, but my friend and dinner companion was not a fan of beans (let alone cold ones), so she stuck to the breadsticks. I think I would have preferred an oil/fresh grated cheese plate along with the lentils so we had bread dipping options. We ordered the Carpaccio di Manzo as an appetizer to share, and they were kind enough to split the order into two *very generous* portions on individual plates for us. They came by and offered freshly ground pepper for the dish. The beef was sliced very thin and was very tender. We had 2 hearts of palm per individual plate, and three HUGE shavings of thinly sliced fresh parmesan that just danced on my palate - so scrumptious. The arugula bed had a very light dressing that didn't overpower the other flavors of the dish.I ordered the Tagliolini All 'Astice, as I was inspired by a diner two tables over that had this delicious bed of thin fettuccine pasta, lumps of lobster meat in a not over-sauced/over-soaked red marinara sauce, and the shells of the lobster (head and tail) at the 9 and 3 pm positions with the bed of pasta as the lobster ""body"" in the presentation on the plate. The lobster tasted very fresh, the marinara was very light and inviting - not overpowering at all. I also enjoyed fresh parmesan cheese that was offered by the waiter, and signaled him back halfway through for a fresh sprinkle. My friend had the Bocconcini di Pollo al Vin Cotto, Funghi e Salsiccia, which was a dish featuring chunks of boneless chicken with mushrooms and sausage in a red wine and shallot sauce. She generously shared some with me, and it was divine. Reminded me of an excellent marsala sauce, and the chicken/mushrooms just melted in your mouth. It had a small dollop of mashed potatoes as well. Generous portions; we opted to take 1/3 of our meals home as leftovers so we could save just a little room for dessert. We had two cups of coffee (Lavazza brand per the ceramic cups they were served in), and I had the tiramisu based on Yelp recommendations and she had the warm apple tart with raspberry sauce and ice cream. Both were delicious. The tiramisu tasted homemade and authentic with equal parts espresso and cream and ladyfingers.Highly recommend this place, especially if you're in the area to catch a Broadway show. I bet in the summer, the outdoor tables are also great dining and people-watching options.",0,0,0,Jill C.,"Herndon, VA",5,55,40

2.0,4/2/2017,We ordered the burrata appetizer. It was alright. Since it was a special we hadn't seen the price on the menu - boy was that a shock! It was $35! For an appetizer! For that kind of money it should have been covered with lobster and caviar! It was not worth it all. Not even worth half that price. Never would have ordered it if we knew the price. Had the penne masseria for my main dish. Did not like it. The pasta was very hard and chewy. Too aldonte! Also got the special pasta with swordfish and shrimp. Enjoyed that pasta more since it wasn't so hard and it had a fishy flavor. Wasn't a fan of the swordfish or dry shrimp in it. Ordered a coffee and it was the worst coffee ever! Tasted exactly like the really bad watered down coffee you get at a diner. I was shocked at that. $100 lunch for two and didn't even drink alcohol. So overpriced. Be warned - they charge crazy for the specials to take advantage of the fact that you haven't seen the price!,0,1,0,Amanda S.,"Brooklyn, NY",11,109,121

Both of the appetizers were very good, but I thought that they way they served the burrata to each person separately was a bit odd.Nevertheless, for my main entree I went with the bolognese at the waiters suggestion. This dish was not the best pasta I have ever had, but it was solid and the sauce had good overall flavor.To end the meal, we ordered a couple of tiramisus for the table and they were decent as well--just about what you would expect from an Italian restaurant.Overall, the food here was decent, but the prices were very high.

I started with a pomegranate lemonade cocktail with just the right balance of tart and sweet, then had the octopus appetizer with green beans, artichokes, and avocado. I followed that up with a main course of rabbit, which was phenomenal. It was served in a Le Creuset pot with a light herbed sauce and some Brussels sprouts and mashed potatoes as sides. The rabbit had a crisped skin, but the meat was incredibly tender. It was a fantastic dish all the way around. I should note that the appetizer and the main were both pretty large courses and I would have been full with just the main, but I wanted to sample a couple of things and they were too good not to finish. Oh well, these things happen.Food, service, atmosphere, and location are all winners here. Highly recommended.",2,0,0,Adam B.,"Durham, NC",195,368,1331

1.0,10/30/2016,"Went with my girlfriend and received potentially the worst customer service at a restaurant. We're a young couple (think under 23) and we were looking to get dinner at a fancy place to celebrate an occasion. However, we were greeted with snobbish waiters who made it very clear they wanted us to get our food and leave. Sensing this, we opted to share  a plate. However, the waiter rudely told us that the ""policy"" was one plate per person. At this point, we told them we would just eat somewhere else, to which he replied ""Oh let me see what I can do about this..."" and brought out our dishes. To their credit, the pasta was fresh and cooked properly. However, the flavor was definitely lacking for the price we paid. TL;DR  --- Would recommend other Italian places.

There were at least a dozen empty tables, we were not going to be accommodated by the rude man in a suit at the front door. Plainly put, this prick should NOT be in the hospitality business.

We were very fortunate to experience warm weather in October so that we could enjoy our meal al fresco. The wine list by the glass was not large, but offered variety. Both our choices, Chianti and Montepulciano, were satisfying. For an appetizer, we shared  a spinach salad with pears, walnuts, and Gorgonzola dressing, simply scrumptious. The basket of bread and bread sticks which accompanied our salads along with  our request for olive oil embellished the appetizer. We then decided to share an order of tagliatelle bolognese along with LaMasseria's delicious broccoletti agllio olio with garlic.  Service was fine - actually sometimes too good as servers were too quick to  remove items!  Our evening ended with a pleasant touch  - two glasses of Limoncello.",0,0,0,Christine D.,"Warwick, RI",53,231,19
5.0,10/16/2016,"Came here by recommendation of a coworker, and it's a sister restaurant to one of our faves, so we decided to give it a shot when my boyfriends parents were in town. Hello new favorite spot!They start you with an assortment of bread and breadsticks with lentils in olive oil, so classic but simple and yummy.  I split the eggplant rollatini with my sister which was perfect - just enough so that we weren't full before our entrees came and cooked beautifully: a little creamy, a little salty, a little crunchy. Love! Other spectacular appetizers included the burrata - pic below but they gave you the WHOLE HUGE BALL!! That's what I am always hoping for when I order burrata but it's rarely the case.For dinner I had the bolognese with homemade fresh tagliatelle, so good but i wish it had a little more sauce on top. My sister got the orchiette with sausage & broccoli rabe which was really good, I think because it was much less bitter than usual. Finally, my boyfriend got the bucatini vecchia Roma with onions, bacon, and pecorino which was creamy and really amazing. Pasta was definitely the way to go for the main course, so many of them are homemade fresh pasta which makes a world of difference for sure! Portions were great and we had plenty of leftovers. The wine was fabulous as well. We unfortunately did not have room for dessert, but I'd love to try it next time!! I have to say with its proximity to Times Square & the theater district I was surprised at just how delicious and adorable this place was.

5.0,9/5/2016,"I've been coming here for years, as I've worked across the street since 2007.  After so many lunches and dinners, I can safely join the ranks of those proclaiming this the best Italian restaurant in Times Square.   Whether for a business lunch or pre-theater dinner, I have never been disappointed by the food or the service here.  The pastas have never disappointed but neither have the steak (although you can pass on the so-so but plentiful shoestring fries), the fish (as has been reported by more than one dining companion), the chicken (scarpariello is always my favorite) and the always reliable salads and  appetizers.  The farmhouse atmosphere belies the restaurant being situated at the base of a 1980s-era tower.  Are the prices too high? Probably. But that is part of the bargain in eating out in this neighborhood. Plenty of options have the high prices and food that is unreliable or worse.   At least at La Masseria you always get a good meal.  Out of town friends, family and dates alike have always had a great time here.",0,0,0,Jon S.,"Manhattan, NY",30,10,0

The atmosphere was so nice, low light, dark wood, fine tablecloths, the service was gracious and knowledgeable, and I loved the menu. So much to choose from, from starters (cheese or vegetables or protein) to salads, to pastas to entrees, I would love to come back every night and try something different.

3.0,8/27/2016,"It's not that easy to find anything better than a sub par restaurant in the theater district, but this restaurant seemed to be better than your average pre-show haunt in Times Square. Started off ordering some wine. Ordered a glass of Chianti as it was was one of the only glasses of red that weren't insanely priced, but that was probably my first mistake. It was not a great glass of wine, rather light, even for a Chianti, but drinkable. Might have been better off getting a glass of something pricier if I thought it would taste better. Started off with an order of fried zucchini. I read that it was good, and it was. They were light, crisp, perfectly salted and a good sharing plate, easily enough for 3 people who want a little taste. We also ordered the veal milanese, served with some mixed greens, and the fresh pasta served with eggplant and smoked mozzarella. My friend seemed to enjoy the veal, it was a decent sized portion and crispy, without being overdone. I, on the other hand did not really enjoy my pasta. It sounded like it was would be good, as I love fresh pasta and eggplant, but the pasta itself tasted raw, gummy, and oddly metallic. I'm not even sure if metallic is the right description, but it definitely had a very odd taste, additionally it was lacking salt. The sauce and eggplant were decent enough, but the odd pasta taste was over powering, so I did not eat more than a couple bites. The menu looked good and it seems to have a good crowd, so I would potentially come back again if I needed to grab a quick meal before a show. The service was good and some of the dishes were decent. However, I cannot say that I would head back for any other reason as it is incredibly over-priced for what you are getting.",1,0,0,Carmella C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,34,51

The portions were pretty big- three huge pieces, topped with tomatoes. - Coniglio Alla Caprese (oven roasted rabbit): wow it was amazingly tender! I'm always skeptical in ordering rabbit because it's such a difficult meat to tenderizing, but I'm impressed. Beware: they serve a WHOLE POT of rabbit and yes, I finished it all and ordered dessert. - Torta Di Ricotta Alla Vaiglia (vanilla ricotta cheesecake): because it's not baked and they used buffalo ricotta, it's especially smooth and rich while light and refreshing in flavor.The service was very nice.

I feel like I maybe should have gone with one of their more known dishes, such as the gnocchi or the ravioli.

For our entrees, we had the Battuta Di Pollo Alla Griglia Con Porri Brasati and the Sea Bass (I don't think this is on the normal menu, maybe only on the Restaurant Week menu or the specials). My boyfriend enjoyed his chicken (Battuta Di Pollo), although it wasn't the best chicken he'd had. My sea bass was better than his chicken - we both agreed. My fish was tender and seasoned well - but not too noldly. Very well cooked. Service: The service was good - our waiter was friendly and accommodating. His accent was a little bit difficult to understand, at times, but he was still wonderful. He was able to recommend a bottle of wine that paired super well with our food - we both enjoyed tremendously. Definitely ask for wine recommendations with your food selections. Other than that, the service wasn't suuuper quick, but definitely kind, accommodating, and likeable. Ambiance: B+The ambiance was romantic and intimate. I would definitely recommend for a date night. Everything was very authentically Italian (at least in my perspective) and not too mainstream, and it was great. The lighting was just right - not too dark that I couldn't see, but not too bright that it didn't feel romantic. The wait staff was also subtle so that it didn't ruin the mood.

5.0,2/25/2016,"Because there are a countless number of Italian restaurants in Manhattan, one may overlook this one since it seems rather small from the outside given its humble appearance. However, once you walk in you'll find that it's fairly spacious and spans a good length from the front to the back of the establishment. The lighting and vibe in here is wonderful, it's very classy and elegant which is probably why the crowd tends to be more on the older side. Definitely not a jeans and tee environment. I had such a great dining experience at La Masseria. My friend and I were greeted warmly by the hostess and reservations are easily done online. We were seated right away and were given the menu promptly. I ordered the sea bass with mashed potatoes and clams from their restaurant week menu and it was amazing! The sea bass was cooked to perfection and same goes for the clams. My friend ordered the gnocchi and that was so flavorful that I wished I had ordered that instead lol. Service was impeccable. The waiters were so friendly and polite. They were attentive throughout the whole meal and my water glass was never empty. They were also extremely helpful and patient when we asked about certain entrees and what they would recommend. When waiters exhibit such great personality, it really makes customers enjoy their meals even more. It makes me so happy to see that there are waiters who genuinely care about your dining experience and do everything to the best of their ability to ensure you have an enjoyable meal. I'll definitely be coming back!",5,0,0,Lena S.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",134,81,148

5.0,1/28/2016,"Found this place after a lot of researching Italian restaurants near the theater district. Narrowed it down based on an extensive restaurant week menu and excellent reviews on tripadvisor/yelp. We showed up about 45 minutes prior to our reservation because our show got out much earlier than expected but the staff were kind enough to seat us down immediately anyway. Our sever (who was excellent) rattled off an extensive list of specials, all of which sounded delicious, but we decided to stick with the pre-fix restaurant week 3 course menu. Ordered a bottle of Gragnano wine to go with in which ended up being a great pairing. Being a vegetarian, I started with the minestrone soup and followed up with the pototo gnocchi which was absolutely delectable! The wife started off with the stuffed mozzarella and then chose a grilled chicken breast for the second course. The mozzarella is made in house and was to die for! Brilliant in texture and flawless in taste, it was completely the star of the show! For desert we had the lemon sorbet which was alright and the almond chocolate pastry which was much better.All in all a fantastic dining experience, wonderful service (except for one guy who carried my wife's dessert away before she was done with it, but we'll let that slide) and delicious delicious food. Not the cheapest at around $150 for the two of us but the food is worth the $$$.

1.0,1/24/2016,"The worst dining experience of my life!  Our 3 course meal was served to us in under 1 hour. Our plates were taken away as our next plates were being put down. When 2 of us had finished dessert, they tried to pick up the plate from the 3rd member of our family while half of his dessert remained. The bill was put down while we were eating dessert, sipping coffee, and still finishing our glasses of wine. A waiter literally reached under a family member's arm to remove the dessert plate as he was drinking.The grilled chicken dish was bland. The food, in general, was unremarkable. We ordered off the restaurant week menu-- if they don't want to serve people who are ordering off this menu, then they should not offer it.

The food is homemade and made fresh each day!  Nothing is cooked prior to your order. That's what makes this Italian food to die for!  I crave it! This place is great for a nice dinner before a Broadway Show, or any celebration.  Although, I do recommend making a reservation because they do book up super quickly.

1.0,10/3/2015,"I'm visiting New York from out of state, and I came here with my fiancee for a business meeting with his work. We both eat vegan, so I chose to prepare ahead of time and make sure they could accommodate our needs. I emailed them twice, one week in advance, (contact@lamasserianyc.com and  peppe@lamasserianyc.com) to see if some of the vegetarian dishes could be made vegan. I never heard anything back.We arrived last night with our large group of people, and my fiancee told the server that we were vegan. He ordered the Spaghetti with marinara and basil, and I ordered the whole wheat pasta with mixed vegetable sauce. I asked the waiter if there was cheese in the dish, and he replied there was no cheese, in a brush-off sort of tone. Our food arrived and it looked delicious. Of course, my partner and I took no freshly grated cheese upon our dishes, but a few bites into mine I saw stringy-ness of cheese mixed into the dish, and I was able to taste it. I didn't eat the rest of the dish, shared my partner's, and it was fine. Unfortunately, the server never came back to ask how everything was, which is when I would have told him there was cheese in my dish. He only came back after all the plates had been cleared off the table to take dessert orders.I stayed after to talk to the manager to tell him what happened. He kind of said sorry and proceeded to tell me how they get vegans and vegetarians in all the time and love to accommodate them. He then proceeded to tell me how some cheese comes from dead cows and other cheese comes from alive cows (seriously?), to which I replied that it didn't matter to me at all where the cheese comes from because I still do not eat it. He gave me his card and told me to contact him directly next time I come in (apparently they never received either of my e-mails), but ultimately he didn't really do anything to make the situation right.

Then I was treated like a child by the waiter (""hello young lady...oooh are you old enough to have a glass of wine?"") until I informed him that I'm in my 30s, thanks. Service aside, the bread was stale and one of the orders was not good at all. No real acknowledgment that it was barely eaten, or when we asked for a side of different sauce to make the dish marginally better, there was no inquiry as to why, or offer to get a different dish prepared. I'd asked if they had angel hair pasta, and the waiter said yes, of course - then brings spaghetti. Not a big deal, but just say you don't have it, you know?  Bolognese and ravioli are good; caprese salad is only partly edible - the mozzarella was a runny mess, like milk; the orecchiette broccoli rabe and Italian sausage was just bad.Just overall mediocre and clear that most people are tourists so this restaurant doesn't really care.

It was ultra soft and the powerful cheese sauce complemented it beyond well. Since I live in NJ I didn't come back for quite some time. When my other cousin arrived in town (ironically enough her sister from above) I knew I had to take her here as well. And both of us definitely enjoyed the dining experience. I'll certainly not wait as long to return that's for sure!,1,0,0,Jonathan W.,"New York, NY",32,65,28

5.0,8/13/2015,"I received an email on Monday from NYCgo.com about this week being the last week of NYC Restaurant Week.  Perfect timing as my friend and I were going to be in NYC yesterday to see a play.I did a bit of research, as I am a vegetarian who is allergic to eggplant, and found a wonderful lunch menu for three courses for $25.  I was unable to get the time I desired when I called the restaurant, but the woman who answered said it shouldn't be a problem to be seated at noon.Luckily, when we arrived, we got the last table outside! It was a glorious day- perfect temperatures and a great table.  Our waiter, Joel F, approached us with a smile and a ""chipper"" attitude- nothing was going to be a problem with my food allergy, as he promised to speak to the chef as well as mark it on our order. (he did come back to let me know he had spoken to the chef- as I explained I have a severe allergy where even contact with cooking utensils and eggplant is a major problem)My friend ordered off of the luncheon menu, and I ordered the restaurant week special.  Fresh bread, breadsticks and an olive oil/lentil side dish were served first. My salad course was an arugula, radicchio, endive, mushroom, olive, tomato and roasted pepper salad.  It was huge, and I split it with my friend  I had the gnocchi with fresh cubes of mozzarella cheese and a scrumptious homemade tomato cream sauce. Yummy and also very filling.  For dessert, I had a moist, very tasty chocolate almond cake which was served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and decorated with a chocolate sauce.  Also included as my coffee.  WOW!

I think my tastebuds died and went to truffle heaven. I love everything truffle - truffle fries, truffle grilled cheese, truffle Mac and cheese. Truffle, truffle, truffle lovers this is the dish for you. My favorite part was when the waiter shaved the fresh truffles onto my pasta. It felt interactive and fun, like I was seeing the finishing touches of my dish! Although the dish was on the specials menu so I'm not sure if you can get this gnocchi regularly - it's worth asking! In general, the gnocchi at this restaurant is out of this world. Soft and dense, it melts in your mouth. My friend tried the regular tomato sauce gnocchi which was also delicious.

Calamari was so fresh and lightly breaded, and the salad had an equal balance of of acidity and saltyness. They also gave us an amazing spread of different breads to start with oil and capers.

The hostess and the servers are extremely nice and make sure to check up on you frequently. I started with the mozzarella and it was sooo good. My main dish was the gnocchi, and it was literally to die for. I've had gnocchi at so many different Italian restaurants, and I must say this ranks up there, along with Giano down in East Village/Alphabet City. Their portions are perfectly sized, and that gnocchi literally melts in your mouth. They put chunks of mozzarella cheese in the gnocchi and it melts quickly. So delicious. So stringy. So fresh. Oh, is it fresh. Finished off with the gelato, and it was extremely refreshing. Great way to end the meal.This is an example of a restaurant that I probably would not have visited had it not been Restaurant Week (conveniently located near my office), but dazzled me with their care and amazing food to the point where I would definitely come back, many many times.

5.0,1/4/2015,"EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS! My gfs brought me here for a belated birthday dinner and we had quite the meal. I felt like Goldilocks in here, it wasn't too big, it wasn't too small, it wasn't too quiet and it wasn't too loud - it was just right. The atmosphere is cozy and the waitstaff (especially Milton & this other tall fellow) were wonderful. They have a really cute rustic theme going on, and of course the Christmas decorations made the whole restaurant sparkle. Okay down to the food: We started with the crispy fried zucchini, (which I could eat instead of real fries any day), bruschetta (which was delish, just the right mix of fresh ingredients and basil), and the fritto misto del mare, a mix of fried calamari, shrimp, and scallops- soo yummy! For dinner I ordered from the specials, the sole with jumbo shrimp in a lemon butter sauce. The jumbo shrimp that came on top was the biggest shrimp I'd ever seen in my life, it was just one but it was as big as the fish itself. The fish was melt in your mouth perfect and as hard as I tried to eat the entire thing I was so stuffed at that point that I couldn't. One of my gfs is a vegetarian and ordered the ravioli stuffed with mushrooms, asparagus and ricotta, with black truffle. This was delicious! And my other gf had the risotto with shrimp instead of scallops - hers was amazing too! For dessert we had the best tiramisu I've ever tasted - i'm not normally a fan but theirs is light, creamy...absolutely perfect. We also shared the warm apple tart and the ricotta cheesecake - both really great, but all of our favorite was the tiramisu. We also shared a bottle of chardonnay on recommendation from the waiter that was dry and crisp, exactly how I like it. Overall, a great dining experience, I would definitely recommend.",1,0,0,Steph B.,"West Orange, NJ",23,63,3

Two of us had the Broccoli Rabe and Sausage Pasta dish, which was divine. The vegetable so well sautéed and flavorful contrasted well with the fresh ground sausage.

We ordered beef carpaccio as an appetizer and the special soup of the day which was a potato soup with bacon. Both of the dishes were very good. The carpaccio was nice and cold and the Parmesan cheese was nice and sharp. The dressing on the arugula complemented the beef perfectly and made for a very appealing dish. For the main course I got the special risotto of the day which had black truffle puree in it. Boy, it was as good as it sounds. The truffle flavor permeated every bite and that was one of the best risottos I've had in a very long time. For dessert we ordered the tartufo ice cream with raspberry sauce which was decadent.

4.0,3/30/2014,"This restaurant had a cute atmosphere, as well as great food. I had the gnocchi, and it was phenomenal. It was a heavy and cheesy dish served with mushrooms. The only complaint I would have on the dish is for it to have more salt which would give the dish more flavor. As an appetizer I ordered the stuffed mozzarella. The mozzarella was stuffed with zucchini and prosciutto with a drizzle of Olive oil. I was a little hesitant about the zucchini with everything else that was in it, but it was delicious. All of the flavors of the dish were well put together, and the mozzarella was fresh. The pork chop was the special, and it was not my favorite. It was stuffed with prosciutto and cheese, and sounded mouth-watering. The pork chop was served with mash potatoes ( which were delicious by themselves ) and spinach. The flavors that were mixed into the pork chop, that I thought would be out of this world, turned out to be a little disappointing. It lacked that ""it"" factor that the rest of the food had here. For desert, I had the vanilla flavored ricotta cheese cake. THIS WAS THE BEST CAKE I HAVE EVER HAD. It was amazing the cake was light and a perfect desert for after my heavy meal. It was not too sweet and the flavors of the whip cream mixed with the sweet ricotta cake were amazing. This desert was a great way to leave the restaurant completely satisfied.

2.0,3/4/2014,"I came here with a few friends for a birthday lunch during Restaurant Week 2014, and I was pretty disappointed. Admittedly La Masseria was a compromise choice after my first two choices were vetoed, but I've had some exceptional RW meals, and La Masseria was deeply, deeply mediocre.The RW menu was surprisingly limiting for someone like me who keeps a casual Kosher, as the 2 appetizers I wanted each had either ham or shrimp in them (the stuffed mozzarella of the day and soup of the day). Since they were ""of the day"" dishes, the details of the dishes weren't on the publicly posted RW menu -- if they had been, I wouldn't have come at all. It seems strange to me that, when choices are so limited, they would choose to leave only one option for a huge group of people. And they couldn't take the ham out of the mozzarella, as they had all been pre-prepared -- I guess that should have been my first red flag.I had to order a very disappointing and unexciting salad as my appetizer, and I ordered the pounded chicken as my entree. Again, really disappointing. The chicken had been grilled, but it mostly just tasted burned. It came with a tiny side of mashed potatoes and a mushy veggie ""ratatouille."" For dessert, I had the chocolate almond cake, which wasn't great but was easily the best of the 3 courses.None of my companions had any better luck with their orders.After so many wonderful Restaurant Week experiences, La Masseria was a real let-down.",1,0,0,Katie F.,"New York, NY",0,54,2

I'm talking about low quality food at a steep price with some sort of gimmick. After reading reviews about this place, we decided to give it a shot. I made the reservations on opentable at around 6pm.When we got here the restaurant wasn't super crowded. Service was great at first but then waned off a little once the place got a bit more busy. We split a bottle of wine and ordered the grilled baby octopus and octopus. They actually brought out two plates with the dish already split. At first we thought they thought we had ordered two, but on the bill they only charged for one. It was really nice of them to do that so we didn't have to fork and divide the dish.BACK TO DAT PRAWN DOE. I ordered the prawn over the salad and the prawns were like the size of my head. They were enormous and had great great flavor. They were grilled and cooked so well and I enjoyed eating each of those gigantic creatures.For dessert, we split the tiramisu and it was justtttt okay.

3.0,10/4/2013,"This place came recommended to me while I was recently in Italy where two of the restaurant's owners come from. I went with high hopes of finally having a place where I could eat the food that has become so familiar to me over the years.Unfortunately that wasn't entirely the case. You can tell that the food is more or less authentic Italian, but it left me with the feeling that if the chef were really that good, he'd be making a good living back in Italy.The meatballs were not bad, just not exciting either. The crispy fried zucchini was actually really good, but I don't know that I would have stayed for the rest of the meal if they managed to mess up fried zucchini.The bucatini was not bad; cooked well (al dente with a little chew), but the sauce was somehow lacking. It could have used a bit of a kick, like you might find with an alla'matriciana. The scialatielli on the other hand, the sauce was not bad in that it was pretty much what I expected it to be, but the noodles were so mushy that it was reminiscent of mashed potatoes. I actually ended up sending this back and while they were super accomodating, I really don't like sending things back -- I'd rather just have had the dish be good in the first place.Skipped any kind of entree and went right for the chocolate dessert, which, thankfully, was pretty good.All in all if you're in the area and dying for a cute, more or less authentic Italian, then this is a place, although there are better Italian restaurants in the area.

4.0,5/26/2013,"For an ""authentic"" Italian restaurant in heat of Times Square, this place is a reasonably priced option for a show-goer. It's a busy place so plan on making reservations early in the day of your visit at the latest. When you call, you'll hear ""buongiorno!"" which may cause some to shy away thinking this is a tourist trap faking Italian accepts but I guarantee you, the food will justify any exaggerated & possibly fake Italian accent you may encounter. The service is superb here from the time you are seated to the time you leave. Everything is quick: orders taken, food prepared, check brought & processed, water glasses filled, you name it. On the night I dined, they had a special pistachio salad that was packed with avocado, pistachios, lemon juice (I believe), and it was served under large shreds of fresh parmegean. This was the tastiest creation that has ever laid on my taste buds. It was heavy but I couldn't help but not devour every single ounce of its goodness. For my entree, I had boneless chicken & sausage which for $19 was okay, not memorable by any means. For dessert, I had a canolli which was served in a fresh shell so it was very crunchy but they edged off the cream on the ends so there was no extra cream puffing out. (Sadface.) I'm a big tea drinker so it was special when I ordered green tea because not only did I get served loose tea but loose tea in a mini french press! It was so cute! Oh, and also, they had honey too which is always a plus in my book!Given that the pasta dishes don't exceed $20 here and that the service is exceptional, this is an ideal restaurant to eat at before going to a show.

However, we were seeing a show nearby and meeting friends who were at another show and it happened to be located in the middle. It was full of tourists (of course) and trying soo hard to be Italian. I ordered a benign salad, which was fine and then against my better judgement ordered the 3 fish special. It wasn't the worst food I've ever had, but it's up there. Our service was good- attentive without being annoying. My husband couldn't even eat his cheese ravioli and he was hungry. (he's Italian, so he couldn't even fake his disdain for the food) When I checked in via foursquare someone had left a tip to get the cheesecake because it was, ""the cheesecake in the world."" Um... not sure where else she's had cheesecake, but this is not it. I feel bad writing a bad review, but it had to be done since there are soo many great reviews.

I held an engagement party at La Masseria for a party of 26 (not including 2 well behaved 5 year olds). Maya from the resturant was very pleseant at answering my tons of questions. Although the reason for not giving the 5 starts was in part of poor execution. I had repetitvely mentioned the specific instructions on how many people and what is to be layed out and to my disappointment it was not done so. Elio the manager was very helpful when the seats were not arranged to what we had mentioned when we reserved the party, but he was very attentive and had changed the seating arrangement as requested. The party of 26 had waited an additional 10 min for the change.

My friend made reservations for 9:30 and we were immediately seated. The place is spacious and rustic. Very cozy and comfortable.. We skipped the appetizers and went straight for the main course. I had the special of the day which was seared tuna, with mashed potatoes, and a side of tomato/olives relish. My friend had prawns over a bed of greens. She said the shrimp was excellent. I also thought my tuna was excellent. It was extremely juicy and tender. The sides were also delicious too. I inhaled the relish in no time. For dessert, we shared a flourless almond chocolate cake and it was wonderful. I usually can't stand flourless chocolate cake as I find it dry and too dense, but our cake was light and very flavorful. Excellent way to end the meal.

Food was terrific. Should note that there were entrees we didn't  have that were very expensive. House wine was surprisingly good, considering it was not much more expensive than elsewhere.  I had the sense that the Maitre d' seemed a bit put off by our informal dress--we're central New Yorkers with small suitcases--but our servers were attentive and gracious.

4.0,1/2/2012,"Magnifico.  What a spendid experience we had.  I actually found this place through Yelp and made my family's Christmas Eve dinner reservation here.  The location of the restaraunt is perfect for after seeing a show or just meandering around Times Square.  It is down 48th and just far enough away from the main hustle and bustle.  We were seated right away and the place was buzzing with families and couples.  Even without the wine, the overall feel was so warm, inviting and cozy.  The decor was perfect, not too understated and not too overbearing or distracting, even with the christmas lights around.  Looking over at the bar, it also was a place I'd like to sit at and sip a cocktail before a show.  The servers were friendly and helpful, and very fast talkers.  There was fresh bread and capers in oil to hold us over and even that was so yummy.  We had a bottle of wine and our food came out after the first glass and the aroma was intoxicating.  Our table heald the LINGUINE ALLE VONGOLE Linguini with fresh baby clams, garlic and white wine sauce; TAGLIOLINI ALL` ASTICE Home made fresh thin fettuccine with fresh lobster and light tomato sauce; and INSALATA RICCA Friseé salad with parmesan cheese & crispy bacon.  Wow.  EVERYTHING was delicious.  We all tried each other's.  There was broccoli sauteed with garlic that was not cooked enough - for MY taste or seasoned enough.  I politely mentioned this and it was promptly reheated and came back perfect.  The portions were just enough, satisified without being stuffed.  We dined slowly and didn't feel rushed or bothered by staff.  We also had a desert that we all split, CROSTATINA DI MELE CON GELATO ALLA VANIGLIA Warm apple tart with raspberry sauce and vanilla ice cream .  My only complaint was having to share it. The bill came with no surprises, a festive fancy dinner price.  A truly lovely experience and worth taking the time to write a lengthy review.  I am thankful they were part of our holiday evening.",0,0,0,Brittany L.,"North Brunswick Township, NJ",202,461,28

Despite not having a reservation, we were seated right away & the staff was beyond friendly.

But while the restaurant was packed to the brim, it didn't seem too loud and maintained the 'charming Italian' feel you'd expect.

The lighting, subtle background music and mature crowd created an excellent atmosphere for the evening. Servers were very good - they helped one of us select a dinner and discouraged us from ordering two appetizers which were very similar in nature, I appreciated their recommendations. Most of all, we weren't rushed at all - something I feel at some restaurants in NYC. As for food, I give it a 10/10 - it really was amazing. I was so pleased with my appetizer (fresh bufalo mozzarella, tomatoes, prosiutto) and main course (cognilio - rabbit). Now, coming from a Portuguese guy who knows what a good rabbit dinner tastes like - I have to give them credit - this was well done - the meat literally fell right off the bone because it was so tender. In addition, the sauce it was served with was so fresh and flavorful. The other diners ordered grandmas pasta - a wonderful combination of meats with freshly made rigatoni - honestly, the best pasta I've had in years...in fact, since I lived in Florence during a semester abroad. The 3rd diner had lobster fettucini, which wasn't as impressive as the other dishes, but still something I'd be perfectly happy eating. I highly recommend this place, but do make a reservation.

My husband asked if they had a martini list or specialty drinks... What attitude they gave him. The waiter was frustrated that we asked about drinks. Ok so we order dinner. Yeah we asked to make a pasta dish red instead of white. What's the big deal adding tomatoes or tomato sauce? Ok so the food came out fast but after a few bites I realized my pasta was missing the main ingredient (pancetta). It was basically marinara sauce instead of shallots, mushrooms and pancetta over bucatini. Big difference right? Waiter was called over n with indifference he went to check with chef. He comes back with no apology but admitted my dish was wrong. He removed my plate n came back with the right dish. Everything was effort!!! Honestly why go there to get attitude?

Again, I wish Yelp let us rate 1/2 stars because this place was better than 3 but not a 4.  Walked in without RSVP and was politely told the wait would be approximately 10 minutes and that it was.  I am always interested in restaurants and what they put out on show for their RW menu.  To start I had the Home made Stuffed fresh mozzarella. I love cheese and especially Mozzarella.  It didn't disappoint, the cheese tasted very fresh and was a perfect size for an appetizer.    For the main course I chose the Filet of Mediterranean Sea Bass in a light broth with Clams, Arugula and Dry Roe fish.  I believe fish is tough to mess up, but hard to perfect.  This was pretty dam good.  The Sea Bass was cooked right on point. Not overcooked and tough and not undercooked and raw.  They placed it on a bed of fresh arugula which soaked up some of the sauce which was a very light butter, lemon sauce and is usually a great sauce for any type of fish, but worked very well with this.  The clams were pretty dam small and there were about 7-8 of them.  It accompanied it nicely. The portion size for me was just right, you felt full but had that room for dessert if you wanted.  Dessert was lemon sorbet, and was a nice cool refreshing dessert after a light meal.  Overall the RW menu didn't disappoint in this place and even though we didn't order from the main menu I was checking out other peoples dishes as they came by and everything look great!

Delicious.I ordered minchiarieddhi te farru dell'ortolano (whole wheat zita with mixed vegetables). It was absolutely delicious.

I had called twice to confirm they would bring a candle and be singing happy birthday to my daughter. I know this isnt applebees but they assured me twice they would do this.  Our waiter was efficient but not terribly friendly. Important richies were pouring in the place and were received by smiling people and their coats taken and immediately given great treatment...all the while we are invisible probably bc we didnt look important enough...the difference in treatment was obvious and uncomfortable to my kids who are well educated but no not rich.We ordered appetizers which were good but I didnt like mine because it had way too much oil.The ravioli was overdone but my sons plate was a-ok.  Birthday time.. the waiter comes with a candle on her dessert but not even a smile as he flatly sets it in front of her and walks away. No singing as promised and it was really really sad.  The 150 dollar bill is typical of midtown but we could have spent about 50 dollars at the Olive Garden and gotten MUCH better food AND service.When I kindly asked a bus boy to clear the plates so my daughter could open her present he got a real attitude lol.  It honestly was a very uncomfortable experiance and my daughter actually cried when we left.If you have money to burn its a decent place but if its a special occasion skip it, they arent very friendly though one girl half heartedly said happy birthday as we walked out.  What a waste!",1,0,0,Lisa M.,"Manhattan, NY",104,30,0

The ambiance was simple, but inviting and there was plenty of room between the tables. Our waiter was attentive and friendly.The drinks were a hit or miss. I ordered a French Martini which they made absolutely horrendous. I asked the waiter to take it back, but he asked how the bartender could fix it. I made my suggestion and when he brought it back, it was a little better. I rather be told that they can't make it instead of playing bartender myself. The cosmos mediocre.Appetizers:(1) I cucuzielli fritti alla pino (fried zucchinis) - I didn't try them, but everyone else seemed to like it.(2) Fritto misto del mare (golden fried calamari, shrimps & sea scallops) - they were a little stingy with the shrimp & scallops. Not worth getting as the taste wasn't anything exceptional.(3) Terra mare del tavoliere (grilled baby octopus & cuttlefish, with broccoli rabe on a bed of fava beans pureé) - surprisingly was my favorite appetizer.Entrees:(1) Scialatielli quattro passi (home made short cut thick fettuccini with eggplant & smoked mozzarella) - I'm actually not a fan of pastas but this was delicious! The pasta was cooked so well and was so full of its own unique flavor.(2) Bocconicini di pollo al vin cotto funghi e salsiccia (chunks of boneless chicken with mushrooms & sausage, in a red wine and shallots sauce) - I enjoyed this dish. Perfect amount of food & the sauce was light & complimented the meat well.(3) Orata del Mediterraneo (grilled whole Mediterranean Sea Bream) - my first time trying sea bream. It was a little meatier & tougher that I had expected but my sister seemed to really like it.Dessert:(1) Espresso was a great way to end the night.(2) Torta di mamma paola (flourless chocolate almond cake with vanilla ice cream) - not a fan. It was too doughy. I've had much better flourless cake.(3) Crostatina di melle con gelato alla vaniglia (warm apple tart with raspberry sauce and vanilla ice cream) - a must order. It was the perfect dessert to go with my espresso. It balanced the bitterness well & it had its own right amount of sweetness.Overall, this place is a restaurant I would recommend to others if you do like Italian food.

4.0,1/17/2011,"I was with family and friends for a great Italian meal at La Masseria on Sunday evening. The only negative of the entire evening occurred early - one of the hostesses was, I guess a little brusque is the best way to put it, in regard to coat check. She made it very clear that we would have to tip her for this service. Hey, at least she's up front about it! All the rest of the service was polite and attentive. The bartender even came over to the table to ask if I had left more cash than I meant to when settling up at the bar. Turns out that two twenties had stuck together and I had indeed stuck in an extra $20 bill. Very nice of her, I thought. The food was very good. We split an appetizer of fresh mozzarella, prosciutto, and tomatoes. Where they got tomatoes that taste that good in January, I have no idea. Carbon footprint? What carbon footprint?! I got one of the entrée specials, a sea bass. They presented the fish whole and asked if I wanted it filleted. That part kind of freaked out my sister but that was part of the fun! Everyone else also enjoyed their entrees. For dessert, we sampled the cheesecake, mango sorbet and chocolate gelato. The cheesecake was made with fresh ricotta cheese and was nice and light. The sorbet and gelato were amazing and so intensely flavored - just like in Italy. The décor is rustic country Italian.

3.0,1/10/2011,Good food and poorly run restaurant. Had several tables of raucous drunks and management refused to ask them to lower their voices and cursing activity. We sat there and wondered when the restaurant management would react to the sounds. Felt like we were sitting with the cast of the jersey shore. Food was decent but overpriced. Really a disappointment only because of the tables of jerks who were as rude as can be!,0,0,0,Brian E.,"Livingston, NJ",0,18,0
4.0,12/27/2010,We went and saw La Cage aux Folles and decided to head out to dinner afterwards. Went to La Masseria (it was across the street). For an appetizer we had the crispy fried zucchini which was very good (like shoestring strips). My husband had the thick fettuccini with eggplant and smoked mozzarella - he loved it! He said it was one of the best pasta dishes he has had in NY (we have lived here for over a year now). I had fettuccine with bolognese which was great. Our waiter recommended a bottle of wine which was fabulous and very inexpensive. Overall we had a great meal at a reasonable price.

We walked around looking for a good italian place and google searching led us to La Masseria because of all the good reviews.  We were not disappointed!!We were seated right away and the drinks we ordered were promptly brought to us.  They were made very well and as we found out later, very reasonable in price.We ordered the special app - fresh buffalo mozzarella with chopped tomatoes and prosciutto.  One word: WOW!!!!  My fiance and I love this type of app and we've had it many places over the years but this was by far the best ever.  They brought out a HUGE ball of fresh mozzarella that looked and tasted as if it was just made in the back of the house.  To accompany it we each were given a plate of the most delicious tomatoes (which is impressive considering its December) and the richest, butteriest prosciutto.  For dinner I ordered the ravioli which was another slam dunk.  Everything about it was so smooth and delicious.  Definitely homemade.  My fiance ordered a chicken dish as said his was just as good.  For dessert we spilt the creme brulee.  Now, I'm a pastry chef and know my classical desserts.  This was incredible!!!!

5.0,12/23/2010,"I have been eating at La Masseria for the last 6 years. The food is always great and the menu offers a wide array of selections that any fan of Italian would love. For a Times Square Italian restaurant, the food is very authentic and the rustic atmosphere always reduces the touristy feeling that sometimes plagues the area. The management of the restaurant has been in the business for a long time and have an amazing track record of providing great food and service that makes sense. The wait staff, bartenders and bus boys all work cohesively and even if you are dining during the busy pre-theater time slot, La Masseria always delivers in terms of getting good food out on time.Overall, La Masseria is a 5-star Italian restaurant with 4-star prices.

4.0,9/1/2010,"I got the rib eye steak and it was delicious. A bit on the salty side but I liked it and it was a very large portion.* The cut of meat was good (not chewy like Bar American) The soup of the day (potato and leek) was boring, but came out very hot. The bread basket was a bit of a disappointment because everything came out cold and the butter was hard to spread. The dipping oil was very unique because it was actually a plate of black (beans, hummas? some small black dots that were about the size of caviar, but I'm sure was some sort of veggie). No one at the table tried it, and the servers didn't introduce it. Oh well. The service was good** but for two quick points. First, the hostess was a bit rude (her podium was RIGHT at the door so there wasn't ANY space upon entering the restaurant for three people to move). After giving her my name for the reservation, she pointedly said ""let them get out first"" referring to a group who was just leaving.... well, there wasn't any ROOM to just ""move aside"" so what were we suppose to do? Leave the restaurant and then come back in? We ended up pressed against the wall uncomfortably while the other people squeezed by.  I just did not appreciate her tone - she could have politely asked if we could shift or squeeze in, but first impressions matter. If she's going to be crabby, the restaurant should just rearrange their placement of the podium.Also, the person who poured the water (which, impressively, never went to empty) did not walk around the table pouring each person's water. Instead, he would reach over the table to get the glass at the other end, which meant his arm would constantly be obtrusively blocking the two people who were talking across the table. Other than that, the food was satisfying and the price was reasonable (for a nice Midtown restaurant).---------------------------------------------* I actually took the steak home and had it for dinner. It was still very good, even after I microwaved it (great cut of meat) and it was MORE than enough food for dinner. ** I really feel like I should clarify when I say the service was good (thanks to Ms. Alexandra S.'s compliment). The service WAS very good but for the two points I noted above.  They offered ready to be ground pepper at every course, the head server/manager? stopped by to say bon appetite with the delivery of our main entrees and they were quite fast about taking our orders, getting the check, etc.",3,1,2,Nicole L.,"Philadelphia, PA",263,513,33

Turned out the show did not get out to 11 and the place was practically empty.

3.0,8/9/2010,"The first time I dined at La Masseria was for RW last year. I remembered it being an OK experience - romantic, rustic ambience; decent food and decent service; nothing outstanding. After my meal, I remembered thinking that I should have ordered off of their regular menu because I noticed my favorite pasta dish on the menu, so I filed La Masseria away in my head to try again another time.I finally made it back to La Masseria last week. My friend and I were hungry after seeing a show on Broadway and while brainstorming places to go, I thought of La Masseria. It was already around 10:30 by the time we got there. The restaurant was half empty so we were seated immediately. However, I recommend making a reservation if you intend to eat at La Masseria during pre-theater hours because they're packed at that time. They have a great selection of wine, listed by region. They also have a killer bread basket: delicious breads and breadsticks, especially with the lentil sauce. For entrees we had...LINGUINE ALLE VONGOLE (Linguini with fresh baby clams, garlic and white wine sauce) - I finally got to try my favorite pasta dish at La Masseria. Unfortunately, I will not be having it again at La Masseria. The linguine was al dente but overall the dish was under-seasoned and many of the vongole clams were sandy. Rookie mistake.

4.0,8/3/2009,"Sitting in our mid-town hotel room, the missus decided that she wanted Italian for dinner. But after a long day of shooting ballerinas, the last thing I wanted to do was trek down to Little Italy for dinner. A quick recommendation later, and we were pleseantly seated outside on the patio of La Masseria enjoying a summer NYC evening, some fine wine, and a great little lentil dipping sauce. Little did we know the treat that we had in store...If Krispy Kreme made pasta, La Masseria was serving it. Their delicate ribbons of linguini dissolved on my tongue, requiring hardly a bite. Gently coiled with a perfectly delicate lobster sauce and chunks of the crustaceon meat, the dish was a testament to perfect balance in Italian cooking. My wife's spaghetti bolognese, similarly, was meaty without being overpowering. The obviouly-fresh-made-that-day noodles were like tasting pasta for the first time. I swear we've never tasted more light and delicious pasta... in the theatre district, no less!For dessert, we couldn't decide between the tiramisu or the ricotta cheesecake. Good thing, too, we had to try both! And both solidifiec La Masseria's place in my book of ""we'll be back"". The ricotta cheesecake was, again, the antithesis to the heavy ""ugh"" we're used to from places like the Cheesecake Factory. Light, slightly tangy, a little sweet, you could even taste the ricotta cheese. While filling, you felt as if you could eat 3 slices and still have room for tiramisu. And oh the tiramisu! Perfection!Our service was -- again -- a NYC surprise. Unhurried and supremely attentive, we were allowed to have an unhurried meal in one of the world's fastest paced cities while watching the street pass by. Our water glasses were never empty, and when our meal ended, the check was only presented once I asked for it. We felt as if we would've been allowed to stay all night and not eat another bite, if we choose. Next time you find yourself suck in the midtown blues wandering between national chain #1001 and national chain #876, walk a block east of Broadway for some respite at La Masseria.",1,3,0,troy w.,"Irvine, CA",30,60,6
5.0,6/21/2009,"Well, it's two years later, and I have to bump it from 4.5 stars to 5 stars. The experience was even more enjoyable than my first. Could have been the company I kept (including Tony Tantillo, local host of ""Dining Deals""), could have been the complimentary umbrellas provided on a rainy day, could have been the ""just right"" cocktail, could have been the personal service, or it just could have been the delicious food. Each aspect deserves a star of its own!When I first came here, two years ago, I didn't know about the bad wrap Theatre District restaurants ""enjoyed."" And, frankly, I'm glad to be ig'nint. Had no prejudices to worry over, and could simply enjoy myself.I recommend you come here, and do the same. As to the price range, you can do it moderate, or you can do it spendy. I prefer not to assign a dollar ranking.",0,0,0,Marja M.,"Alameda, CA",42,189,258
4.0,4/13/2009,"I really try not to eat in midtown ever. I hate it there. This is partly because it's where I spend my weekdays developing carpal tunnel syndrome and partly because midtown lacks any flavor whatsoever. With this being said, my wife works at La Masseria and she has been begging me to come visit. After two months I finally made it in. ""Honey"" she screamed as I walked in the door, which although adorable, made every table stop eating and look up. It's a very quiet place honey... no more yelling please. La Masseria is an upscale, ""white tablecloth"" Italian restaurant . Although it gets a lot of its business from the theater crowd, it also has many regulars. The Manager is Italian and remembers people and their drinks. It's nice to see a place like this being run by someone who has done it for years (instead of a 20-year old kid). The Chef was awesome and made sure I got a hefty sampling of his fare while I chilled at the bar. The highlight was the ""Fettuccine with Duck Ragu."" The pasta was cooked perfectly. Seriously... perfectly... and the ragu was just ""intense"" enough to not overwhelm the pasta.Maybe it was all the free limoncella but I left La Masseria ""getting it""... it wasn't just about the theater district... it was about old-school Italian owners and a veteran Italian chef producing really good food. It's a little on the pricey side but that aside I think you will be pleasantly surprised.",3,5,2,Jeremy G.,"New York, NY",329,105,12
4.0,2/24/2009,We came here between lunch and dinner. Few people in the restaurant and our waiter was fabulous! Very nice ambience. Excellent Food and a satisfactory wine menu. I'll be back!,1,0,0,Terri V.,"Manhattan, NY",171,277,13
2.0,9/7/2008,"I came here with folks from work while we were in NYC for a company event.Even before we got our food, disaster.  The waiter dropped 5 glasses and 2 beer bottles meant for our table right behind me, all of which shattered on the floor and splashed all over my jacket.  An obligatory ""sorry, are you ok?"" was all that was offered.  No free drinks, and no help with cleaning off my sopping-wet jacket.  I was pretty miffed, but didn't want to create a scene in front of my coworkers.Most of them had the dish with fettucini and lobster, and perhaps it was worlds better than what I had.  Didn't hear any complaints (or compliments) from them.  I had the whole wheat ziti pasta with vegetable sauce, and I couldn't finish even half of it.  I hated the texture and taste of the pasta, and I can't even remember the taste of the sauce.  It was that good.I wouldn't go back to try the other dishes.  Life is too short.But what really made the night was.. toward the end of our meal, a woman from a table behind us suddenly stomped over, leaned right over me and the person sitting next to me, glared at us with hatred, and very nastily said, ""I know all of you are deaf, but if you could quit screaming like rabid dogs, we would really appreciate it!"" D*mn woman.  I know you forgot to take your meds today, but if our conversation was despicable and pissed you off, understand that coming over like a b*tch and talking to us the way you did will only guarantee that we deride you ""like rabid dogs"" for the rest of the evening.Never in my life have I another diner at a restaurant be so rude.",0,3,0,Jennie Y.,"San Francisco, CA",35,51,6
3.0,7/10/2008,"This place is OK, but not great.  It's another watered-down Italian restaurant, but I'll cut them a little slack because 1) the food was good, and 2) it's in the theatre district, where I've seen far worse.You're better off going to Serafina (very close on 49th) or Trecolori (on 47th).  I think they're in about the same price range.",3,0,1,Demitasse E.,"New York, NY",15,209,61
5.0,6/2/2008,"One of my favorite Italian in NY (shocking because it's in the theater district)!  Every dish was perfect, great taste and presentation. A little pricey, but worth it. Be sure to order the parmesan cheese, artichoke and pistachio salad special  if it's on the menu.",1,0,1,Veronica O.,"Charlotte, NC",40,142,12
4.0,8/26/2007,"i'll go along with reviewer number one, except to add that i found the bathrooms to be highly entertaining. nothing like a large, well mirrored room for a bit of uni-sex between courses of a great dinner...",0,3,0,Andrew C.,"Denver, CO",58,81,15
