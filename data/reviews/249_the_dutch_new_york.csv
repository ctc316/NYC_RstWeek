5.0,4/25/2019,"Not sure why this place isn't rated higher, but I've been twice and I loved it both times. We had a party of four that turned into five and they were super nice about accommodating us (no wait even!). We got in around 7pm on a weekday. To start, we went a bit crazy with the appetizers and ordered the oysters, crab, steak tartare, and bursts with artichoke. All of it was extremely delicious. I would say that my favorite was the tartare. Afterwards I had the hangar steak and kimchi for my main dish and I would love to come back and have it again. I was too full to finish it all, but it was so delicious. This is a good spot for groups - two thumbs up.",0,0,0,LeAnne B.,"New York, NY",86,174,127

1.0,4/6/2019,"Little shocked by their customer service. Slipped and fell down their wet staircase inside the restaurant, injuring my leg and hand. They wipe up the wet floor after I fall, sit us down and that was the end of that. Not seeing if I was ok, no complimentary wine or anything to express ""I'm sorry you fell down the stairs and hurt yourself."" Was not worth the $300 I spent on dinner that night. The waitress was lovely and the wine was good, but that's about as good as it got. Disappointed in the way they handled everything.",0,0,0,Laura H.,"New York, NY",0,2,3
5.0,4/2/2019,"Great place for dinner with friends! The ambience of the restaurant is discreetly upscale but also casual. Phenomenal service and the dessert was mouthwatering. We had citrus salad and a variety of fresh oysters, for apps. For our main we ordered hot fried chicken, hanger steak with kimchi fried rice, side of asparagus, and my favorite, rack of lamb. All the food was perfectly cooked and the seasoning and sauces complimented the meal nicely. For dessert we tried a little bit of everything. The beignets were divine, my favorite was Meyer Lemon Merengue Pie, and we also tried tres leches cake, warm chocolate tart, and hand pie. Overall would recommend to anyone looking for a filling meal with flavors from all different kitchens and cuisines.",1,0,0,Victoria N.,"New York, NY",354,42,35
5.0,3/31/2019,"We enjoyed our dinner at The Dutch. The service was amazing. The cornbread was exceptional, baked in house. The sour dough bread was also good. We started with the mini fried oyster slider because that was recommended by the article we read. It did not disappoint. Then we shared the hot fried chicken. It was moist and tasty. The honey butter sauce for the biscuits was out of this world. Highly recommend this restaurant.

3.0,3/24/2019,"I've been to holland many times, including spending time in southern Holland by the Belgium border over an extended period of time not as a tourist . There is nothing Dutch about this place , it's very American . Perhaps the reference is to the Dutch Americans? I have no idea The portions are large ( American sized ) . I would share an appetizer . If you get a mains there will be no room for dessert ( well barely) . I thought the food was innovative, well prepared , flavorful and the service was excellent and accommodating . The wine list was highly curated, and impressive. The restaurant has a trained Sommelier that accommodated us. I ordered a lamb dish, which was an interesting take on rack of lamb dish.  My dining partner's dish was excellent too.The place is Soho, busy, tables close together ( a pet peeve of mine in NYC) but I suppose rent is steep so the more tables the better.  Volume is loud. I would not take a first date here, maybe wait till you are engaged?. I went here with a lover, where the expectations were lower. We went back to his hotel for dessert.The main reason we went here was for the Soho location. If you are coming here for a date, choose the later sitting as I noticed it got quiet later in the day.  In NYC there are in my opinion better places for this kind of food, at the same price point. Check came out to $200 ish-plus wine for 2 people, add a tip and that's roughly $250.",0,0,0,Alexander M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,28,0
4.0,3/24/2019,"I will say this place was the best atmosphere I've been in, in quite some time actually.  Really nice bar, and more than just tables.   I found the wine list lacking, and the food just wasn't my taste, but I'd go back for a date night with the wife regardless.   Dessert and coffee were awesome!  You all give it a try and let me know what you think!!!",0,0,0,Chip L.,"Katy, TX",4,70,33
4.0,3/22/2019,"I recently planned a corporate dinner party in the Dutch's private dining room and it was a really awesome event.  Here are some highlights:* Event planning:  The staff was very helpful leading up to the event and made the process very easy.  Very responsive to email and helped me make my menu selections.* The space:  the private dining room is in their downstairs and it has a very cool vibe.  The room has it's own private bar which is perfect to host a cocktail hour prior to sitting down at the long table for a meal.  The venue says they can fit 20 at the table, but we were at 16 adults and it felt just right.  I don't think any more than 18 could fit at the table, and even that could be tight.  16 was the perfect size for the room.  The room has its own closet to hang coats and bags and the bathrooms are located downstairs so easy to get to.* The service:   The sommelier was the bartender and main server for our event.  He was very helpful describing wines and made sure to keep everyone's glasses full throughout the event.   I had no complaints about the service.* The food:   For the private dining room, they have a 3 course supper which is family-style.  They recommended with start with the snacks package during the cocktail hour which is a choice of 3 snacks.  We had the oysters, eggplant dip and smoked salmon bagel chips.  The salmon was very good but everyone enjoyed all 3 dishes.   The supper begins with a choice of 4 appetizers - the lobster rolls were a huge hit, so was the burrata.   For entrees, you get a choice of 3 - we selected the fried chicken, bass, and pappardelle.   The fried chicken with honey biscuits was a standout dish.  I didn't love the flavoring of the bass dish and I unfortunately didn't try any of the pasta.   Finally, for dessert we had the chocolate chip cookies (so delicious) and the apple crumb pie.  The apple crumb pie had a unique spice taste - more spice than sweet.  Not my favorite but tasty.   The dessert was served with homemade sorbet and ice cream.   The buttermilk and chocolate sorbets were delicious.  I was surprised that they didn't come around and ask if  we wanted any coffee or tea during the dessert course though.  Overall, we really enjoyed our private event at the Dutch.  SoHo has a lot of hip restaurants to eat at, and I will definitely swing by the Dutch again to dine on my own.   Thanks to the staff for all of their help!",1,0,0,Kristin A.,"Hoboken, NJ",163,55,44

2.0,2/22/2019,"Rather high price point for a casual American restaurant.  For dinner, the host stated a time limit on the table (already turned off) and the server said the chef would only accept complete orders (i.e. you can't order appetizers and then order main dishes later after you've had your apps) - another turn off.  Get the stick out of your rear end chef.",0,0,0,Jonathan K.,"Brooklyn, NY",57,333,4
5.0,2/20/2019,"Outstanding and sophisticated dishes. Two of us shared a range of appetizers including: 1. ""Chinatown"" calamari (more like a zesty salad of cilantro leaves, shaved fennel, fried calamari, XO sauce, and dollops of trout roe - all goes great together, and with a glass of wine), 2. Eggplant dip with heavily dusted zataar crackers (amazing), 3. Gulf shrimp and grits (with wilted greens ringed by red tomato sauce, chunks of simmered bacon), 4. Roasted brussel sprouts.  I believe the crackers with zataar seasoning are made in-house, as is the complimentary jalapeño cornbread and sourdough for the table. For the main, we shared the handmade gnocchi with duck ragu. While we were almost stuffed by the appetizers, the gnocchi proved to be extremely light and pillowy - not gummy or heavy at all. The servers did a great job of explaining all the dishes, and I appreciated the care behind all of the details and the handmade ingredients/components of each dish.  You can tell a lot of work goes in to fresh preparation each day. Finally, the dessert and pastry program is excellent. We shared classic lemon meringue pie and fresh beignets with toffee sauce and mascarpone. I'd recommend stopping by just for dessert if the restaurant is quiet enough. You can't beat the location on a charming corner in Soho NY.",0,0,1,Dennis G.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,5,0
4.0,2/18/2019,"Summary for the Dutch would be: food was great, atmosphere was good, service was below average. My girlfriend and I ate dinner here last night (Sunday night in February). We arrived at 6:45PM for a 7PM reservation and were quickly seated. A couple in front of us arrived 45 minutes early for their 7:30PM reservation and had to wait, and we saw a lot of people waiting, so keep this in mind! The table was a lot more spacious than similar neighboring restaurants (*COUGH*, Lure Fishbar, *COUGH*), and we had a nice view of the street.SERVICE: by far the only black spot on this meal. I wanted this to be a 5 star review, but our waiter was pretty bad. Explains why the Yelp review average score is so low (I almost gave this review a 3). We saw our waiter 3 times: ALL when it was time to order. Not once did he come over and ask us if we needed anything (ohhh and we did need things - because he forgot). Highly unusual for a restaurant in this price range. He forgot to bring us bread, we had to ask a busser. At the end of the meal we ordered 2 chamomile teas, and they just straight up never came out. FOOD: most of the items we got were delicious. Items from the Raw Bar especially stood out - everything was was exceptionally fresh and well prepared. We ordered:JUMBO SHRIMP COCKTAIL, CRAB LOUIE ($26) - fresh and deliciousMAINE LOBSTER, PLANTAIN CHIP, BELL PEPPER & CITRUS ($25) - this was our favorite item of the night. Must order!2 LITTLE OYSTER SANDWICHES ($16) - delicious bites of heaven! Almost as good as Fried Oyster Po Boys we got in New Orleans.HANGER STEAK, KIMCHI FRIED RICE, FARM EGG ($39) - I got this entree. It was sooo good and the portion of steak was generous (I got it medium rare and it was perfect). Definitely order this.BBQ SCALLOP ENTREE ($40) - my girlfriend got this as an entree and she didn't like it. She said it was too heavily seasoned - maybe they are trying out a new recipe or something (I don't see it on the online menu). She orders scallops frequently at a variety of different restaurants, and I've never seen her not like them. I would suggest having a more plain scallop dish on the menu. Easy win.Dessert was good, bill was standard value for NYC, I just wish the service had been better. I'll be back, but not as soon as if we had a better waiter.",6,1,3,Chris B.,"New York, NY",110,61,237
5.0,2/18/2019,"So this is somewhere I've wanted to try for years... and it was perfect. Look, I have a soft spot for steak tartare and their wagyu one was phenomenal. Even the jalapeño cornbread with whipped butter that comes before the food was amazing. Although bad cornbread is hard to find. The kale Caesar wasn't anything to write home about, but that's okay. The service was stellar and the hostess even said, ""Goodbye Ms. Heather!"" on my way out, which I loved. I love it when a restaurant does Restaurant Week and actually treats those customers the same as regulars. I will definitely be back here.",0,0,0,Elizabeth H.,"ASTORIA, NY",16,126,77
3.0,2/14/2019,The vibe here is very good but the food is inconsistent. None of the dishes were particularly memorable - the black bass was very good and the burrata with Nutella was interesting. Their famous friend chicken was a bit dry and didn't have enough chicken breast. There was no sauce on it (just on the side). The calamari was ok. Their pies are very good.,0,0,0,Lisa S.,"New York, NY",95,66,7
5.0,2/13/2019,"A little over a week ago I finally had the privilege to enjoy lunch at the Dutch for NYC restaurant week.  I ran behind schedule and barely made it to lunch before the kitchen closed for dinner. The staff was very accommodating and ensured I was well taken care of. Service overall was great. I took advantage of the deal $26 for two courses which was a great bargain for the amount of food I got. I had the hot tin roof cocktail which was good, refreshing and somewhat medicinal. For the appetizer I went with the shrimp cocktail, the shrimps were huge and the right amount of the crab louie made this deceptively small dish very filling.  The entree was the highlight for me, the roasted chicken kale caesar salad with lots and lots of cheese was huge that it could feed two people. This salad was so good, the chicken was tender and skin was so crispy while the kale and cheese combination hit the spot. I was only able to eat half of it. I highly recommend this restaurant for lunch for restaurant week, it's worth it.",1,0,0,Chris P.,"ELMHURST, NY",91,53,182

The food is so so, service so so, and the restaurant week deal was barely a deal. My daughter ordered the burger which was not on the specials and was pretty good but not great.

2.0,1/27/2019,"I'll start with the positives: we love the food and they have something delicious for everyone - gluten free options, dairy free, for the vegetarian/carnivore/pescatarian. Negatives: the waiter had tremendous attitude, was impatient and we felt rushed to make decisions. Both my friend and I have severe allergies which require asking questions and his response was ""why don't you narrow down your choices first"". Well, how can we narrow down choices without asking questions. I called ahead to ask if they had non-alcoholic beer as one of us is abstaining from alcohol and they said they did not, would not be able to get any for us but we could bring our own and the same as their wine corkage fee which is  $35 PER BOTTLE - that's just stupid.

3.0,1/22/2019,"Been there, no need to do that ever again! This was our first, and most likely last, time there. My hubby and I wanted to give this place a try bc we pass it by often and it's always packed. The service was great, our waiter was fantastic and hilarious which is always appreciated. Drinks were very tasty specifically the smoking jacket (a smoky Manhattan). The food was the issue. We ordered the 2 dishes they are best known for, the fried chicken with honey biscuits and the hanger steak with kimchi rice. Those honey biscuits were bomb but the fried chicken was just ok compared to bubby's (my fave fried chicken place not counting bonchons). My hubby's hanger steak was ok but he ordered the same exact dish at vandal's and this version didn't leave us wanting more. Also, the wagyu steak tartare was a mess!

2.0,1/7/2019,"It's a quiet night on a Sunday.  My friend and I enter the Dutch with the intention of getting drinks and dessert.  We're told by the maitre d' that they aren't serving food yet.  It is exactly 5:21pm.  We proceed to the bar for drinks until 5:30 when tables open up.  That's 7 minutes away.  At 5:37 the maitre d' approaches and says he has a table but that he needs it back by 6pm!  That's 23 minutes away.    Uhm what?  I go onto Open Table and make a 5:45pm reservation.  I tell said maitre d' I have a 5:45pm reservation.  Indeed there is barely anyone in the place and every single reservation time is wide open. When we leave at 6:30pm, virtually every table is open.  Either the maitre d' is trying to turn away business to harm the restaurant or he's got another motive unbeknownst to me.  Weird experience for a place I frequent often.",5,0,2,Rick M.,"New York, NY",5,95,2

Otherwise, our server was very hasty and a bit snooty he lacked basic customer service. The only time he seemed personable with the group was when he collected his tip smh.

3.0,12/30/2018,"A large upscale brunch spot located on the edge of SoHo's shopping area, the Dutch offers some interesting twists on your typical Sunday brunch. The egg's Benedict, 2 locally sourced organic poached eggs with a chipotle hollandaise sauce and a chive/cheddar biscuit with ham was the highlight of the meal. Everything bagel, with lox, cream cheese and trout roe was fine - but the roe+lox were slightly over-salted. The chia seed, organic granola and citrus was well balanced, sweet/smooth chia seed pudding with a mix of sour grapefruit and sweet cashew granola went well together. While each dish is done plated beautifully the portions are quite small, so recommend ordering sides.The staff is knowledgeable but improvements could be made. The meal felt rushed. WiFi access was denied as employee only (an issue for anyone traveling internationally without a sim) and the bus boys were surprisingly rude, we were stationed near the entrance and we overheard a couple of them complaining in Spanish about guests who wouldn't leave and were slow to order. Waiters were knowledgeable, they could explain the flavor profiles of each dish but were impatient, we were asked if we could order 3 times and were brought the check without asking.

Most recently, I was there on a Thursday evening after 9 pm,and my entire party felt the attitude from some of the service staff to be palpable. We ordered cocktails and a numerous appetizers to share and be on our way to another Party. The Ceviche, Steak Tartare & Burrata were all lackluster,  there were less bread pieces than people at the table.  We were aware we were nearing the end of service however It was obvious they didn't have much regard for our patronage.

The oysters were as they were - nothing good or bad the restaurant did when it comes fresh. Handmade pumpkin agnolotti was wonderful! Delightfully sweet for a pasta but not dessert-like sweet. Tuna ceviche was a big let down - terrible combination with avocado and red grapefruit (an extract I think?) and jalapeno that overpowered taste of tuna. If the tuna was tasted alone, it didn't taste fresh... Turkey sandwich was good, but not great.Servers were rushing even though the place wasn't at capacity.

The skin was crisp, the meat was moist but I have to say, the biscuits stole the show. Might be the best biscuits I've had so far in NYC. They were moist and sweet. The butter and apricot jam were to die for. I'd come back just for the biscuits. 4. Apple pie - presentation alone gives this place a great rating.

Perhaps enables them to give smaller drink. Funny how expensive, fancy spots are often cheap that way. Sets an unattractive tone of trying to chisel the most money out of their patrons.Brussels Sprout side as app very nice, Duck entree also good, a bit perfumy, but interesting & good. Pork rib app also very nice crisp, chewy. Don't recommend the rabbit pot pie,  which sounded cool, but a disappointment.

The hostesses seemed understaffed and stressed. Overall the food was good, not great. The menu had limited options to choose from. I opted for the shrimp salad. Perhaps I would have better luck with a different dish.The service was very hit or miss. While our waiter was attentive throughout the meal, trying to find my lost sunglasses was a whole different ordeal. When I reported my lost item one woman was completely unhelpful. She said no one had turned anything in and didn't take my number down. I went back to the counter again and another woman was much more understanding. She logged the lost item along with my name and phone number. She even went back to the table to check and see if they were on the seat. I really appreciated her making an effort to find the lost item. There are so many brunch options in New York, I would recommend going elsewhere.

1.0,8/24/2018,"On August 22, 2018 around 5 pm a coworker invited me for cocktails to The Dutch where he's been to before to talk about some personal things. The first bartender who served us at the bar was a bald, Latino man with tattoos and was very friendly and personable. After serving us drinks his shift had ended, unfortunately. After having one drink, around 6pm I asked for a glass of water from the second bartender who was African American & took over the shift of the previous bartender. After one sip of water I felt something enter my mouth from the water and then spit it back into the glass. It was black and about 1/2 an inch long and then sank to the bottom of the glass. I showed my friend the glass and then proceeded to notify the bartender. Being a Bar Manager myself I understand the proper procedures for handling these issues. The bartender looked at the floating object and said ""Oh, it's probably a piece of mint."" He never apologized for the inconvenience I had experienced or offered anything from the bar to compensate for the unhygienic & health code violation. I told the bartender I felt disrespected and insulted for him belittling my experience and telling me what it was rather than asking me. I told him I know for a fact it WAS NOT MINT that rolled over my tongue and touched my tastebuds. I would know...it was in my mouth. How dare he make an assumption so cavalier. I then asked to speak with a manager. The tall, lean Caucasian manager came over and I explained my situation and the problem I had with the bartender. The manager just said ""I'm sorry""  and kept walking with total disregard! Being a bar manager the protocol for such a situation was NEVER met and the restaurant staff at all levels had absolutely no concern or care for their customer or how there behavior may affect future patrons from supporting the establishment. I hope the OWNER of The DUTCH, gets to read this and address his staff on the following: 1. proper procedures for dealing with health code violations which can close a restaurant down; 2. customer satisfaction and etiquette, and how to properly handle future situations with them; 3 communicating properly and showing RESPECT to paying customers.

2.0,5/10/2018,"TLDR: High prices for an overly loud restaurant that's all over the place and needs to find their niche. Very hit or miss dishes here. Only half the items ordered were actually good. I expect a higher standard of quality and deliciousness for their steep price tags. I wouldn't bother to return honestly. Doesn't live up to the hype. Overall rating: B-Even though we had a reservation, we had to wait 10-15 minutes to be seated for a party of 4 on a Saturday at 8:45pm. It is VERY dark, extremely loud, and overly crowded inside. As a result, I found the space itself to be very uncomfortable right off the bat. Honestly, I think this restaurant is just trying too hard. The dishes are full of odd pairings that are hit or miss. Heads up: Restrooms are located downstairs for those with mobility issues!Here is the full break down of the dishes:APPETIZERS:-CHINATOWN CALAMARI, CHILI CRISP, SMASHED CUCUMBER ($18): Spicier than expected, but I like spicy. Well executed. A--STICKY PORK RIBS, PEANUTS & LYCHEE ($21): Wow! I was really blown away by the crispy exterior and the moist, fall off the bone interior of these ribs! Lychee is fresh and wasn't overly sweet! Highly recommended! A+-The other 2 appetizers were specials of the day I don't really remember well. One was an odd borscht soup with too many extra ingredients that don't belong in it and didn't add to the dish (C grade). The second was a forgettable fusion cuisine tacos (C grade).ENTREES:-WILD HALIBUT CHA CÁ, TURMERIC, DILL, RICE NOODLE, PEANUTS ($42): I didn't try this personally but the person who ordered this said it was very good. A-RACK OF LAMB, SCOTCH BONNET JERK SAUCE, ROTI PANCAKE, PIKLIZ ($42): I sampled this and wish I got this instead. Excellent! I was worried the scotch bonnet sauce would be too spicy, but it was a comfortable heat. The Pikliz (condiment in Haitian cuisine of pickled cabbage, carrots, bell peppers and Scotch bonnet peppers) didn't add to the dish's flavor. The roti was barely crispy and very oily. The lackluster sides brought the dish's grade down. B+-HOT FRIED CHICKEN, HONEY BUTTER BISCUITS, SLAW ($32): This is the dish The Dutch is KNOWN for. Diners at adjacent tables all opted for 3 pieces of chicken (unfortunately you cannot request just dark or just light pieces since they're already pre-portioned per person) and 2 honey coated biscuits with coleslaw served in a large circular metal dish cafeteria style like I did. The chicken was perfectly fine as regular fried chicken, but no way can anyone ever call it ""hot"". They give you a house made hot sauce but even that's not all that spicy. The biscuits were cold by the time I got them so I didn't really enjoy them. The cole slaw was standard. It was a big portion at least. For $32 this should've been the best darn SPICY fried chicken in NYC! This would normally get a B rating elsewhere, but since it's over $30 I'm bumping it down to B- rating!-The last entree was a special of the day. It was a bacon wrapped fish (possibly cod). I don't recall the side dish. I sampled it. It was decent (not a seafood lover though). BDESSERT:-CHOCOLATE HAZELNUT CAKEMALT, COFFEE ICE CREAM ($14): This was a decent cake. I didn't really pick up the hazelnut flavor other than the hazelnut pieces themselves. The ice cream was delicious. B+BONUS: At the end of the meal, they give each person a complementary homemade muffin to take home. That day we received carrot muffins. B+",1,0,1,D D.,"Manhattan, NY",4,143,27

You have to get the hanger steak with kimchi fried rice and fried chicken and biscuits. They're both amazing.While the service was fine and food was great, it really doesn't warrant the prices.

2.0,4/7/2018,"Perfectly acceptable place for brunch or dinner. Nice selection of oysters, and a bistro menu with the usual suspects plus things like fried chicken. I came here for a client lunch and everyone was pleased with their orders. Our server was pleasant and we made friendly chit chat with her.  The lunch went on a little longer than I had anticipated and I was going to be late getting to my next appointment. I was preoccupied when I got the check and left only half the tip that I meant to. The manager came over to me and instead of asking me if something was wrong privately, demanded angrily in front of all five people from the table that typically you leave 20%, what was wrong, this isn't standard practice, etc. I was horrified first of all for my mistake.  I used to be a server and I know that feeling of being stiffed. But I was also horrified by his behavior.  There is no reason he could not have been discreet.  I was clearly mortified and apologized profusely both to the manager and the server and left more tip than I had to but he was still cold. This was obviously a business lunch so even if they don't know me to know that I'm not cheap, why would anybody do that intentionally on expense account. My clients commented on how rude they were once we got outside which was even more embarrassing. I guess his emotional first reaction just got the best of him, but it left a bad taste in my mouth.",0,0,0,Jennifer B.,"New York, NY",2,90,2

Horrible experience that became a running joke at our table. We all walked out saying ""We're sorry we stayed so long.""  Total time spent? 70 minutes, or about $2.50 a minute for our group.  The prime server was almost angry, and certainly undeniably irritated that we lingered for that last cup of coffee.

We truly appreciated the extra effort The Dutch made to recognize our anniversary and make it special.  There was a sparkler presented with desert to make the evening even more memorable.  And if you're particular about the experience, let me tell you without any hyperbole... the restaurant staff was constantly (but quietly) attentive.  Our water glass was never empty and our table was never soiled while the food and drinks kept flowing.We highly recommend The Dutch.  Stop by if you're local and get there if you're not.",1,0,0,Jay F.,"Greenville, RI",0,14,3

Our table was in the bar area, not the restaurant, which was strange given I'd booked my reservation in advance. It was noisy and nearly impossible to hear one another.

Came here for late lunch, it was pretty dead since it was a weekday and we ordered off the restaurant week menu. We tried the wagyu steak tartare and the beet and citrus salad. My tartare was really good and presented beautifully. The beet salad was very fresh and had a pleasant flavor.For our main dishes, we tried the shrimp bowtie pasta and the trout. Personally, I thought my shrimp pasta was a bit too rich and heavy, but my friend really enjoyed it. If you're into a dish with lots of flavors and enjoy shrimp scampi, I would try it. The trout was heavenly. My favorite part of the meal came at dessert where I tried the chocolate mint icebox cake. I am usually not a huge fan of mint and chocolate together, but this was marvelous.

5.0,1/25/2018,"Note: This review is for a private event.I came to The Dutch during the holidays for a private event. They have a cozy, well-decorated event space downstairs, with a dining table set up and its own little bar. It was the perfect size for our ~20 person party. Mingling at the beginning was a little difficult as the table took up most of the space, but most of the event was seated. The bathroom is also downstairs, which is convenient.The food was a mix of decadent and healthy-ish, your standard contemporary American. Looking at the menu, I don't know if I would be willing to pay their elevated prices for it myself, but all dishes were good and some excellent. I particularly enjoyed the desserts.It was open bar and the house wines were all solid, as well as the house cider. They also were making simple cocktails for people and we had some high end whiskey before we left (had to hit that budget).Staff was great. They were attentive at the beginning for serving drinks, hanging coats, etcetera, but also knew when to leave us alone.I would imagine private events get pricey here, but if it's in your budget I would recommend The Dutch.",3,1,2,Liz S.,"New York, NY",952,772,1843

It seemed like an elaborate version of a hot totty, but made with vodka, and I don't really drink vodka, so we asked if we could have some thing like this - with the extra spices with a whisky.

When we asked for a chair, we were told a chair couldn't fit. I get that you messed up the reservation - at least take responsibility for it. My boyfriend took matters into his own hands and asked a solo diner if we could use his extra chair and ALAS, a chair could fit! The other complaint we have, is we ordered an appetizer and it never came. I'm appalled with the price of dinner that the service would be so poor.

I love that it has a nice ambiance about it, but they're still able to serve a large amount of guests. We sat in their back area that was open and had a mixture of booths and regular tables.THE FOODEGGPLANT DIP WITH SAVORY CRACKERS: The savory crackers were DIVINE and such a perfect pairing for the eggplant. This is a great app, especially for the $13 price point. I would say to request extra crackers ;) WAGYU STEAK TARTARE, CAPERS, BÉARNAISE AIOLI: This was just ok to me. The aioli tasted like mayo was thrown on top of the order. While pretty, not sure this is worth the price tag.AMERICAN BURRATA, ROASTED SQUASH, RADICCHIO, PERSIMMON: Loved the fresh flavors here between the squash and radicchio. The burrata itself was just ok, I felt it wasn't as creamy as other burratas I've had. HOT FRIED CHICKEN, HONEY BUTTER BISCUITS, SLAW: This is a LARGE order! You get four pieces of chicken, two biscuits, and a nice side of slaw. I know a few friends who could take on this challenge, but I definitely say if you load up on apps, you can split this entree. The chicken has a nice crunch to it but I will say I came across two pieces of mine that seemed a bit underdone. LOBSTER ROLL, TOBIKO, YUZU PICKLE, FRIES: Perfect. No complaints, wish it was bigger maybe? But all lobster rolls are too small AMIRITE?!CHOCOLATE MINT ICEBOX CAKE, COOKIE CRUNCH: If you like thin mints or york peppermint patties, this is your go to! I love both, so this was easy to love on my end ;)VIETNAMESE COFFEE PIE, HOUSE MADE CONDENSED MILK: If you've had a Vietnamese coffee before, you know how strong it is. Well just like it's namesake, this pie is STRONG in the coffee flavoring, but so delicious. Definitely a good imitation of the drink!WARM APPLE PIE, BOURBON ICE CREAM, WALNUTS: I love apple pie. I love this apple pie. No complaints, this was definitely very very good.OVERALLThis place was perfect for our work lunch. I can see other business lunches taken here, or maybe a more intimate date.

I've been out of NY for more than 20 years so when I come home, I want to experience HOME! Sleeping in on a Sunday and a great brunch with friends at a great brunch spot--which is exactly what The Dutch is. It's cozy and sexy and casual and whatever you need it to be all at the same time. I love that the entrance looks like you're going into an apartment building (if you missed the awning above the door, that is). You then enter into a dark vestibule and then open the next door and greeted by contrasting warm tones of tan and cream decor. The staff is really nice and accommodating...definitely what I like to experience when I go out. Now usually, if the spot is nice and the service is great, clearly the food is lacking, right? I mean....could all 3 areas be that good?! Yes. They. Can! So I'm told that everything at The Dutch is good...and I intend to find out on my next visit home.

The breakfast sandwich is definitely thumbs up both in portion and taste. I am a fan!The Deets:As everyone knows, the main meal on NYC weekends is brunch...no doubt about it. In the search for that ever elusive brunch bliss, we made it down to The Dutch in the South Village area. The Dutch is a pretty sizable eatery, and that in itself makes it stand out. Inside is a well finished decor that is not too bistro but not too fine dining...just right. The front area is a bit brighter with large windows and an inviting bar area while the back area is somewhat darker but just as welcoming (we were seated here). Our server was attentive and pleasant, and drinks were distributed in good time. Their brunch menu offers a great variety of options for every taste. I chose their breakfast sandwich with a mimosa and coffee for my brunch experience. The breakfast sandwich has maple sausage (appears to be hand pattied) along with a large block of scrambled egg surrounded by an outer layer of cheese on one of their honey butter biscuits. It's pretty large as they give you a steak type of knife to help enjoy it. And enjoy it I did, the flavors of all the components came together wonderfully and no complaints on the portion size. I was delightfully surprised how well the flavors all worked together beyond a basic sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit.

You need to have this in your life at least one! It comes with tortillas (seemed home-made) to make your own tacos!! - Skillet-Roasted Half Chicken, Artichoke, Smoky Tomato ($32): Loved the smoky flavor and how abundant the chicken was. Wine:They have a great cocktail selection, but decided to go with one of the wines from their ""Some interesting reds"" section. Gothic Pinot Noir Maelstrom 2012, Willamette Valley, Oregon. If within your budget ($90), I highly recommend it. Complex flavor, not too strong, not too light. Perfect to pair with their meats.Service:Very attentive. They even asked us if it was ok to close the window glass (we were seated in the bar next to the window).

Although the menu may look small to some, I found there were plenty of delicious, diverse options to choose from. My only compliant is the chicken was not spicy, neither was the hot sauce - although I'm a big spice fan so plenty of ""hot"" things to me are not spicy.  Also, if anything was overpriced it indeed was the drink menu ($16 a cocktail, over $20 for certain wines by the glass).

The Chicken entree was good, but it was not much different than fried chicken at other restaurants.  At a price tag of $32, I was expecting some outstanding chicken.  The accompanying honey biscuits were delicious and more like a dessert than something to accompany a Fried chicken entree.  The bread served prior to dinner, which included a corn bread was tasty.

5.0,2/10/2017,"Went here with my parents on their visit to NYC. Made sure to make a reservation as this place is packed for dinner. Despite being 30 minutes early for our reservation, we were able to be seated right away.To start off, we decided to go with the burrata. I feel like it is hard to mess up burrata, but the addition of black truffle and the sunflower toast, really helped to elevate the flavors of this dish. We also got an order of the beets and enjoyed those as well.For the main course, we decided to split the famous fried chicken and the NY Strip. The NY strip was very good--cooked perfectly and had nice flavor. However, the winner of the night was the fried chicken. Wow, what a memorable dish--the chicken was so moist and packed with flavor and was a generous portion size as well. In addition, the biscuit was to die for--so buttery and rich, yet flaky and delicious. The slaw was good as well, but was more of an afterthought after the chicken and biscuit.To finish the meal, we decided to get an order of the Pecan pie with chocolate bourbon sauce--holy hell was that good, and the perfect ending to our meal. The pie was so rich and satisfying, I could barely stop myself from eating the whole thing. The nutmeg ice cream was interesting, but sort of seemed unnecessary and disconnected from the rest of the flavors of the pie. Nevertheless, we enjoyed it immensely.Overall, this place serves up some tasty food. The prices are a bit steep, but the portion sizes are generous and the service is friendly. Definitely a lively atmosphere and worth checking out if you are in the area.",3,1,1,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",746,1843,225

3.0,2/4/2017,If were to give it a rating on value it would be 2 stars.First off this was for a birthday party for 9 and originally wanted to do dinner as birthday person wanted the fried chicken.  This place is one of those that requires getting an expensive menu for parties greater than 8.  I am not a fan as would have been fine doing a order of 2 items and paying a guaranteed 18 or 20 percent tip.  We ended up doing brunch as chicken is on that menu.Everyone raved about the chicken but the wing I tasted was okay.  I am from the south so maybe harder to please.I ordered the banana waffles with bacon.  Bacon was great and one of reasons give place 3 as nice and thick 6 pieces and well cooked.  My waffles though tasted like cooked  earlier as did not have that right out of grill taste.  I know it comes with bananas and ice cream but should not have to ask for syrup.  Give me Waffle House over these.The doughnuts were to die for as perfectly flaked with coconut and nice chocolate sauce.    Bloody Mary was okay but hard to screw those up and at 16 dollars better be good. Place is very nicely designed and service was good. Though mocha not on menu they made me one.

1.0,1/8/2017,"Wow, what an awful and sad experience we had here.I've been here a few times, with my husband, with co-workers, on business lunches...each time was really great, the restaurant decor is lovely, the food was really delicious and service was attentive. We booked a table for a friends birthday dinner because we noticed they did a fun sparkly candle with the desserts and we had good experiences here.For this particular birthday dinner, we had a culturally diverse group and almost immediately, I felt the service was vastly different from the other times I've been there. Our table location was terrible, they squeezed us into a smaller table meant for a smaller party, we were basically 6 people at a 4 person table, basically sitting on top of each other. We crammed ourselves and our gifts around this cramped table in the middle of the aisle, super uncomfortable. We would've gladly had a drink at the bar and waited for a better table but we weren't given that option.The waiter rushed us from the start, barely looked us in the eye and took our dinner order with our first drink order (we had no time to look at the menu). Again, this was completely different from my other experiences, where we lingered over our wine and savored each bite.Despite the fact that we were all dressed up, ready to celebrate, the waiter never asked if we wanted a second round of drinks or checked in on us once. Birthday sparkly candles were flying around the room for various other diners birthdays and when our birthday girl went to the ladies, we let the waiter know we wanted to order a special dessert with a candle for her....we all waited for the dessert to come, ready to snap a pic of her blowing out the same sparkly candle everyone else got....but when her dessert came, it was a regular .99 store candle. They brought the bill with the dessert.I'm not a loudmouth, I find these circumstances extremely uncomfortable to deal with, I normally just don't go back to these places again but I was really so shocked that I did ask the waiter why she didn't get the sparkly candle (...sounds silly but we were treated poorly and this just added insult to injury)....he was visibly annoyed and said ""that's just the candle I grabbed, I don't get it, whats the problem?"".....and of course, on cue, another sparkly candle comes out of the kitchen for another guest. It was really a sad moment and put a damper on what was already a rushed and lackluster experience.There's nothing you can say to convince me that we weren't treated differently for a specific reason and I'll never come back here again.

1.0,1/4/2017,"I'll let this letter I just sent to the owners speak for itself:My boyfriend and I dined the Dutch on Sunday after it came highly recommended. I ordered the catfish for dinner, and given that I was a vegetarian for sixteen years and have been a pescatarian for the last two, I am in the habit of reading ingredients carefully. I literally haven't eaten a bite of meat intentionally since 1998. When the catfish dish arrived, I ate part of it and half wondered if the chewy pieces I was tasting in the grits and collared greens were perhaps bits of meat--but no, I thought--what restaurant would list the ingredients on a seafood dish but leave out the fact that it contains meat? These must just be hearty mushrooms. When I asked the server if there were mushrooms in the dish, she replied, ""No, but there is bacon and blood sausage."" I cannot begin to imagine why you would bother to list the primary ingredients in a seafood dish but choose to omit the fact that there is meat in it. While I was disgusted and immediately lost my appetite, I was upset not so much that I had accidentally eaten these things, but more so at the thought that others with dietary restrictions might be truly devastated if they ended up in the same position. Can you imagine someone who doesn't eat pork for religious reasons coming to the realization that they had just consumed bacon? And considering that many people who do eat meat won't even touch blood sausage, the whole thing truly blows my mind. Even worse, the server mentioned (upon my prying) that I was not the first person to be surprised by these ingredients, and as I pressed for an explanation, she acknowledged that this issue had been previously been brought to the owners' attention, and nothing had been done in response.Neglecting to highlight the pork-based ingredients in a seafood dish is irresponsible, but your decision to ignore the issue is negligent and reprehensible. I'd appreciate if you would correct the menu to reflect those ingredients.",6,1,0,Elizabeth B.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,41,1

I was instructed to leave the coffee at the front desk because no outside beverages were allowed. This is completely understandable as you are trying to offer customers the fullest experience at The Dutch. However when I walked out of the restaurant with my husband, I asked for my coffee thinking it would still be at the front desk. However the girls unapologetically said there's no reason for them to keep the coffee as they get cold so they always throw it out. It would be great if front desk can be more direct going forward and tell customers that all outside beverages will be tossed. In that case, I would've finished my drink prior to entering.

It was very refreshing and the sauce that came with it almost tasted like a tasty green juice. Oyster sandwich- My friend had it and said it was amazingly delicious. It is suuuuper teeny weeny. Bass entreé- this was yummy. The sauce/purse veg much complimented the bass. Right before this though, they got my order wrong and brought out the catfish entreé. To be honest, this one looked a lot more appetizing than the bass. Might try it next time around. Hangersteak with Kimchi fried rice- my friend had this. I had some and this was BOMB!! We were both wary to try anything Korean in a American cuisine restaurant,but kudos to them to almost perfecting the kimchi taste. It was nicely done. Service- very friendly and attentive. Our waitress made sure we were taken care of and the bussers and runners were always making sure our table was cleaned and our waters were being filled.

4.0,11/3/2016,"So this space was volunteered as a meeting point to catch up with a friend of mine during this Manhattan visit.  I haven't hung out that much in Greenwich Village so walking the area for a bit was a nice and leisurely surprise.First off, almost all of the eateries in NY are very trendy, filled to the brim with youngsters around the age of late 20's to late 30's.  The vibe in NY is different overall but it is definitely palpable.  The dark interior with accents reminded me of an old remodeled barn that is comfortable yet modern.  We were seated in the other dining area away from the corner windows and the entire place was packed at 6:00.Menu here is somewhat limited so since I didn't really have any interest in seafood or pasta, I opted for the Hanger steak with kimchi fried rice and a fried egg.  While I am a huge fan of Korean food, I don't usually eat my steaks with a side of fried rice so we were able to finagle a substitution of french fries with the steak.  We requested the rosemary potatoes but the chef turned that notion down, saying it would detract from the flavor of the steak.  Once out, we understood why.  The Hanger steak was lightly marinated in a soy sauce, which would explain the fried rice.  My personal take on steaks is that other than flank steak or tri tip, steaks of this nature (extremely soft and tender) should be recognized for their delicate nature and while the marinade was good (mild enough so that it didn't saturate the steak), I would have preferred a simple grill with salt and pepper.  Our other dinner guest ordered the lasagna and what a surprise!  It was not the type of lasagna we were expecting and especially since this establishment was not Italian focus at all. The sauce was a veal bolognese, on spinach pasta and enough pecorino cheese to blanket the amazing square cut of deliciousness.Overall, I have to give a ""10"" to our waiter since she did her best to accommodate and make us feel welcome.  Staff here are attentive and if you have time to burn before your supperm, walk up the street toward Houston and Sullivan, Francois Payard has a little cafe ;-)",1,1,1,Miika M.,"San Francisco, CA",2266,1707,2221

Their bartenders take careful note of who shows up in which order and serve you appropriately. They even are careful to never pass drinks between members of a party at the bar.Our waiter was delightful, offering hefty pours of wine and a few quick jokes but never overstaying his welcome. Good advice on wines and appetizers, too.The food was solid but didn't blow me away. We started with a half-dozen oysters and the burrata, which was really delightful with sunflower toast and a side salad. I had the hangar steak with kimchi fried rice -- decently spicy with a cooked egg on top, and the steak was blackened and rare inside. My date had the scallops with lemonade foam and trout roe, and they were cooked perfectly and nicely presented. Would I go across town for any of these dishes? Probably not. It wasn't especially cheap or expensive for SoHo, either.

5.0,10/17/2016,"reading some of these reviews.. makes me wonder if we ate at the same place.  Our experience at The Dutch was top notch. We had a party of 7 and had a reservation on a Sunday evening.. perhaps early by New York standards but as four of us had just completed the 39-mile AvonWalk, it suited us perfectly.  Started with cocktails which were excellent... and salads that were fresh and nicely seasoned but honestly nothing to write home about.  We all loved our entrees... I had the crab risotto, which consisted of a black rice risotto with the crab mixture on the side of the plate, sort of a yin & yang combination.  The elements were delicious separately and together, and a perfect amount.  The black sea bass was perfectly cooked.  The steak tartare was some of the best we've ever had, chopped to beautifully diced consistency, not a pasty mince.. impressive knife skills by the chef.  The hay-smoked duck was crispy and tender and delicious.  Another friend had the hangar steak with kimchi rice which was unusual and spicy, while another had salmon, and the last person had the spicy roast chicken, which tasted like chicken basted in tabasco or cholula sauce... simple, but perfectly executed.  The desserts were really outstanding ... the nutmeg ice cream was amazing.  I only wish we'd ordered two scoops instead of one, because it was the smallest dessert that came to the table.  The pumpkin donut with ginger ice cream came with 3 large pastries plus the ice cream.. could have been enough for the whole table.  The waitress graciously separated the bill for our table.  The wine steward did his best to interpret the tastes and needs of members of our party, and everyone left feeling satisfied by a wonderful meal.  We didn't find the noise level to be uncomfortable.  The restrooms are downstairs, so persons with mobility issues might be challenged.  But overall we had a wonderful experience, felt like we had discovered a great neighborhood gem, and enjoyed a meal prepared by people who truly cared about food.",0,0,1,Sarah E.,"Monrovia, CA",1,15,0

3.0,10/5/2016,"I struggle with this rating... I came in last Saturday for brunch with two friends. I love the interior/ambiance. It is definitely a cool, trendy, popular restaurant in Soho.We started off with the burrata, which was excellent. It comes with toasted bread and a Delicious fig/hazelnut salad-- the burrata itself was delicious, although small. This is where the struggle comes in-- I ordered the ""POACHED EGGS, CHEDDAR BISCUIT, HAM, CHIPOTLE & TOMATO"" as my main. The eggs were not poached. I think they aimed for them to be soft boiled-- however they ended up being somewhere between soft and hard boiled. Half the yolks in both eggs were solidified by the the time the dish was placed on the table. The rest of the dish was just kind of confused at that point-- I ended up nibbling on everything else on the plate individually -- and I'm not sure where the chipotle was really. My friend got the egg sandwich-- The sausage on the sandwich was delicious-- it was sweet and tasty, however an egg sandwich without a fried egg for me personally is a miss. The egg is more of a square shaped scramble-- which just isn't appetizing to me-- again-- personal opinion.If I came back for brunch, I would most likely try different main dishes on the menu.",0,0,0,Kyle S.,"Manhattan, NY",17,86,565

2.0,9/19/2016,"I have to say I was very disappointed in this restaurant. I heard about the hot fried chicken and wanted to try it. I made the incorrect assumption that it was the NashVille style spicy hot fried chicken. Much to my chagrin the waitress informed me that the menu was ""misleading."" The hot fried  chicken wasn't hot at all actually. It had plenty of spices, very heavy on the paprika and was very crispy but for $28 it just wasn't special enough. My sister had the burger, which the waitress recommended saying it was a customer favourite. It came on a bun that was soggy from too much of their ""special sauce"" and sis was underwhelmed. I also ordered a side of fries. They were nine dollars and they may have been the biggest disappointment of the entire meal. There were plenty of them but again they were nothing special: tiny little shoestring fries and a bit under cooked. Again for nine bucks the chef better bring it. Beer and wines by the glass were overpriced as well.

4.0,9/18/2016,"I've always considered The Dutch to be the cooler, slightly rambunctious sibling in the family of Andrew Carmellini's restaurants. Situated on a central street in SoHo, it's an ever-busy restaurant that serves the whole gamut of elevated ""American"" cuisine, complete with a full bar and with all your key meals of the day (even your Mid-Afternoon munchies) covered.On the evening that my friend and I visited, the restaurant was almost full to the brim, despite the fact that it was in the middle of the week. While grateful that I'd made a reservation in advance, it did also mean that we were seated fairly closely to neighboring parties, and that we had to repeat ourselves several times given the volume of conversation in the dining room. Needless to say, don't come to The Dutch expecting a quiet and leisurely evening; it's far from the place for that.To begin, we started off with the Steak Tartare, which featured finely chopped wagyu beef topped by slices of pickled mushrooms and dill. The tartare was well-seasoned and had just the right amount of creaminess to bind the protein together; a little acidity from the mushrooms and a freshness from the dill rounded out each mouthful. And, of course, the side of toasted bread made for an ideal vehicle, giving just the right amount of texture and crunch to the dish.The mains shouldn't be undersold, either. As an avid lover of duck, I couldn't avoid ordering the Duck Smoked in Hay, which featured five expertly cooked portions of duck served with a rutabaga puree and a cranberry mostarda. The duck was perfectly cooked to the requested medium rare, the skin was crisp and had just the right salt and pepper crust while the actual meat retained its juiciness. The puree provided a smooth, lightly sweetened contrast, and the mustarda had just the right level of sweetness to complement the duck. As for the Hot Fried Chicken, it's certainly not the most elegant dish to eat, but the chicken is served piping hot with a crispy, lightly spiced skin - a surprisingly well-done feat for a restaurant that doesn't specialize in the dish. The honey butter biscuits and the vinegar-based slaw served on the side round out the dish, making it one of the larger and more filling plates on the menu.While they're not particularly well known for their desserts, I have to give a nod to the Pecan Pie, which was chock full of glazed pecans and topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. One slice was quite dense, and was ideal to share between two people; and if you're interested, they make pies daily on premises that can be ordered to go.Aside from the slightly claustrophobic dining area and the fact that you may have difficulty hearing your dining companion, I'd return to The Dutch without hesitation. The food is surprisingly well-executed and conceived, and our dinner service flowed smoothly without a hitch. Just make sure to get a reservation in advance, as I'm sure more than just a few other people will have the same idea.",13,5,9,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

My mom ordered the peach pie and there was a piece of twine in it. I called the waitress to show her what we found and she kept saying that it was fruit skin. Last time I checked, fruits don't have thick long and pretty hard fruit skin (especially peach). She took the dish away to ""check"" with the chef and came back to say that it was a fruit skin. She asked us if we wanted to finish the dish and we refused. We were baffled by her audacity to just lie to us and keep claiming that the thing was just a fruit skin. She never apologised.

5.0,4/17/2016,"At the time of writing this review, somehow the Dutch has a mere 3.5 stars. This is like a wormhole in the universe. This is like Moby Dick not being appreciated when it was published, or like Shakespeare not being thought of as much more than an actor and so-so playwright. People, get it together. This place is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. The vibe is lively and mellow, exciting and chill, all at once. Food? Forget it. Top of the line. For dinner I almost always get the fried chicken, honey butter biscuits, and slaw. The American burrata appetizer is also transcendent. If in a mood, I get half a dozen oysters which they really know how to make a show of on that big silver plate filled with ice. Some of the best oysters I've had in the city and definitely the best presentation. For brunch, waffles with strawberries, cocoa nibs, and pistachio cream? So, so, so good. Dessert includes a second-to-none pecan pie, at least in winter. And the cocktails are out of this world terrific. One of the best things about this restaurant is that you can sit at the bar, have a full dinner, and it still feels like a special meal without the long wait. The bartenders are friendly.

The burger is really average at best. That is a lot coming from a town that has so many awesome restaurants serving burgers. Heck, even the Italian place on my corner serves a better burger. For a place that has so much going for it, they can really step their burger game up. The bun was tasteless, the special sauce is useless, the two thin patties make it so most of the juice is lost, and the meat blend...well, I don't think it's Pat Lafreida, so why even make a burger then? Also, the ""homemade fries"" are identical to those you would find at the double arches establishment you see on every corner over America. I guess I'm bitter because this cost me $23.Mehhhhhhh.

We were seated in the backroom, and the decor was amazing, classic decor.The brunch menu was honestly not too big, it incorporates lunch into brunch, so you can have options like oysters too. I have a picture of the menu, so you could see what's for brunch.we ordered an appetizer to share:- Steak Tartare ($18) - It was absolutely amazing, to start with the toast was crunchy and amazing, the steak was phenomenal and it came with mayonnaise that blends really well with the whole dishBrunch food- Omelette with caramelized onions and salad on the side ($18) - the omelette was amazing, very strong on onions, a must-try if you are an onion lover- Smoked salmon with bagel with scrambled egg - the scrambled egg? no joke is the best scrambled egg i've had in the city. the bagel was crunchy but not dry, and the smoked salmon was really good, it also have sour cream and salmon roe on the side where you could put on the bagel, love the little touch.Strongly recommend the smoked salmon with bagel and scrambled egg, probably the best brunch dish you get in the city!Service is absolutely amazing, the servers are super nice, take really good pictures from good angles, and everyone was super attentive.Will definitely come back and would recommend everyone too!

2.0,3/9/2016,"First, the Dutch is overpriced.  Perhaps I'm totally spoiled by all the amazing brunch choices in NYC where I only pay $30 for food + unlimited mimosas... so I was surprised by the price tag here.  Without alcohol, we spent $40 each.Second, the food isn't stellar.  I ordered their famous fried chicken which (if you're a hungry girl like me) is good for just one person.  The fried chicken is tasty, but the problem is... I recently discovered the fried chicken sandwich at Fuku+.  Now I want my fried chicken to have a tiny bit of kick to it.  My girlfriend ordered the Shrimp & Kimchi fried rice.  We warned the server that her being Korean meant she had high standards for Kimchi and he still told her to go for it.  Mistake -- she took a one bite and then said she could make better kimchi herself. Third, I was surrounded by preppy kids in plaid.  Perhaps a lot of kids from NYU decided to go to brunch that day, but I was definitely aged out.So if you haven't ever gone to the Dutch, just go check it out once.  It is a NYC institution, and I'm happy to have gone so I can take it off of my Yelp bookmarks.",3,2,1,Elle W.,"Santa Monica, CA",208,285,372

Whoa. I mean really a couple fancy poached eggs and not enough ham with a mini biscuit?Anyways, it was a meal, nothing spectacular and they were very strict about outside beverages (it was just a cup of coffee from a local location) that they held for me at the front while it obviously got cold.

1.0,3/7/2016,"We had a horrific experience at the Dutch on Saturday night and will never eat there or at any restaurant of Andrew Carmellini again.   It was a bit like being in the Sex and the City episode where Carrie and Miranda have to fight the evil hostesses to get their table.  Unfortunately our firstwait was over 90 minutes.  If we had any self-respect and if the guests we had joining us weren't so hungry,  we would have walked out many times.My husband and I arrived promptly at the restaurant at 7:55 PM for our 8:00 PM reservation.  We asked to be seated as the rest of our party arrived and were told ""soon.""  Unfortunately, we waited and waited as many walk ins arrived and were told to go to the bar.  We repeatedly watched such walk ins be seated....while we waited and waited.  Unfortunately our remaining party had arrived late in NYC via La Guardia and did not arrive at the restaurant until 8:50 PM.  So yes, we were late as a full party - but when I asked the hostess whether it was their policy to not seat a party until everyone had arrived, she indicated it ""was discretionary.""  During this time, we watched her seat 3 women at a table I presume was ours....who sat at this table for over 45 minutes until the two men accompanying them joined them.  So clearly the ""policy was discretionary,"" she just wasn't going to seat our party.My husband and son both complained and they finally showed us a table for 4 in the back room...where a party of 5 could not sit - my son had now joined us as we were to have met him at 10:00 PM, after we had dinner.  The hostess told us they would put another table together and when they finally brought us to the table after now what was a 90 minute wait, we couldn't fit and they told us we would have to sit at this table for 4.  We waited another 35 minutes for a table and were not seated until nearly 10PM. The food was mediocre if not outright bad; service was rushed.We come to New York at least twice a month on business and we are quite well versed on the city.  We eat constantly in great places (Le Bernardin, Babbo, Gramercy Tavern) as well as small neighborhood restaurants.  We have never been treated so badly in New York  - ever.",3,0,0,Cheryl W.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,3,0

We had a wide variety of food from kimchi fried rice to Lobster rolls to scallops to fried chicken! My favorite was the fried chicken. I'm still thinking about it. The outside has the right about of crisp and crunch while the inside was juicy and tender. The honey biscuits that came with it were delicious as well! My second favorite was between the Lobster roll appetizer or the scallops. Both were cooked very well. Not overcooked, fresh, and tender.Also, I ordered a birthday cake from the restaurant. The cake was amazing! The presentation and taste! The outside was a light butter cream and in the inside was a layered vanilla cake with an Apple based mixture. It was light and delicious!

4.0,2/27/2016,"The Dutch is only a few years old, but it already has the swagger of a New York institution. And that might be one of the strongest things to say about any restaurant in Gotham given the city's tendency to be spoiled rotten with new food joints popping up literally every day. Trendiness only lasts so long before some younger, hipper, more attractive digs open up. And from there, it's off to the worrisome, awkward, puberty-esque second stage, which could last long enough to still see the spot sputter off and shut its doors. Somehow, The Dutch has unfairly skipped this zits and braces phrase. Frankly, that's a rarity. But it's certainly not by chance.The dining room is inviting, stately, modern, and casually gorgeous, like a well-tailored suit, worn unbuttoned and without a tie. It's an effective first impression one gets even before taking a bite of their unapologetically American cuisine. It's a safe favorite for business lunches, and I've been lucky enough to frequent The Dutch enough to narrow the menu down to three solid choices: the Hot Fried Chicken, the Pastrami Roll, and the Double Cheddar Burger.The Hot Fried Chicken is The Dutch's most popular dish, so we'll start there. Deserving of its omnipresence on top ten fried chicken lists in the city (if for each piece's juicy center alone), but I personally would stop short of putting them near the top spot. To be honest, they're upstaged by the very side its served with, those devilish Honey Butter Biscuits, drenched in liquid sugar and blessed in a Southern Baptist church.The Pastrami Roll may have been my favorite. And perhaps no one else's, since it's sadly off the menu these days. As I feel like I'm eulogizing the sandwich while I reminisce, it was anchored by deliciously briny meat, slathered with horseradish and Swiss, and armed with crispy onion rings at its hip. I always hold out hope it's a special, and I've tried to bring it up with servers since its disappearance, in the off-chance there's some secret sandwich code among the well-informed, but no such luck there. Yet.The Double Cheddar Burger has probably been my most reliable pick. It's got your typical fast food formula (sesame seed bun, pickles, secret sauce, addictively salty fries on the side), but with of course way better ingredients. So rather than reinvent the wheel, The Dutch attempts to perfect a low-brow American standard, and they more or less deliver with a gooey, cheesy, dry-aged monster not for that faint-hearted. As a general rule, in fact, you shouldn't misinterpret The Dutch for light fare. This is some all-around, gut-busting cuisine.The service can be spotty, but The Dutch really lets its decor and cooking do most of the talking here anyway. It's quickly become a SoHo staple, despite serving a week's worth of calories in a single meal for the models strutting down nearby Prince and Spring Streets. A wolf of Wall Street in Southern sheep's clothing (or is it the other way around?), The Dutch is confident, delicious, and American through and through.",3,2,2,Dan R.,"Brooklyn, NY",633,551,148

3.0,2/18/2016,"My DINNER companions decided to go family style so we could have some variety. Beet and avocado salad - great! But I love beets and get them rarely, so it could just be my excitement over beets. There was some kind of crusty sprinkle over the beets that was really good. I couldn't quite put my finger on it - peppercorn and something? A very unique flavor I've never had elsewhere. Fried chicken - this cannot be their most popular dish- it's so boring. There was no discernible flavor. I give credit to tender and moist meat though. And a nice honeyed-biscuit. Smoked ricotta ravioli - surprisingly addictive! The smokiness of the ricotta was not too strong and didn't overpower the rest of the dish. Something I would get again if I happened to come back. Steak and kimchi rice - well flavored steak and well blended kimchi rice but I'm not a huge fan of kimchi rice in general, so this fish was just fine. The kimchi rice doesn't have any hint of spice but does generally have the requisite pungent sour taste of fermented dishes. We felt so rushed the entire meal. They tried to take our dishes whenever there was a bite or two left - it was very odd. We had plenty of room on the table to hold every dish, so it's not like we had to make room on an overcrowded table. They tried to take the app away with about 1/5 of the dish left. Then tried to take the fried chicken away with one whole piece still remaining in the plate. I will probably promptly forget I ever came here or its dishes since only the appetizer made me say YUM! I even did not bother to pack away leftovers because I was so unenthused by the dishes (and I'm a notorious doggie bagger).",1,0,0,Eva H.,"New York, NY",54,142,19
3.0,2/11/2016,"We came for late dinner on the last day of New York Winter Restaurant Week with reservation made via OpenTable. We were seated right away and the ambiance is great, albeit a little loud in the main dining room.Our server barely gave us attention, but he was pretty spread out over a few other larger parties (although the other tables were clearly favored over our party of 2). I inquired about the Restaurant Week menu and was told flatly that it's not available, no further explanation. Ok, not a big deal. When our server finally returned, we ordered 2 glasses of riesling from the wine list and were offered a taste before pouring. However, I only realized when the bill arrived that it was a more expensive riesling, not the one I requested. Again, it's a minor annoyance. I wish our server had informed us up front when he brought out the wine that it was his recommendation or that the other kind was not available. We had the eggplant dip (love!), cedar plank salmon with cauliflower and citrus (amazing, buttery salmon paired with a sweet and tangy cauliflower salad), and a truffle gemelli pasta (decent). After we finished our food, the server simply put the dessert menu in front of us and then walked away. Yep, we were ready to leave at that point. Props to the bus staff though!

5.0,1/27/2016,"My friend Rochelle and I continued our Restaurant Week Adventure.. We have been eating in Soho because she works in the area and really what is there to complain about eating in Soho!?I always wanted to try The Dutch due to reading a great review a few years back from NY Mag.I can't even begin to describe this perfect gem of a restaurant:You find this cozy restaurant on the corner of Prince and Sullivan. When I walked in I felt as if I was walking into a restaurant in Prague: intimate, cozy and beautiful lighting greet you. I checked in and a very pleasant maitre' d escorted me to my table where Rochelle was already seated: a booth next to a fireplace and near our table old recipe books were placed. We were immediately served water with ice and lime/ lemon and amazing corn bread. Our waiter,Ramon( best waiter!), greeted us and told us to take our time in ordering. The menu contained many tantalizing options. We decided to start with the eggplant dip with savory crackers( toasted flatbread with delectable spices) and I had the little fried oyster sandwich( scrumptious slider).We then ordered from the Restaurant Week menu: 1st course: mushroom soup( I wish they bottled and sold it) served in beautiful Apilco pottery. Ramon checked on us to ensure we savored it properly: next to the bowl is a delicious cheddar cracker with truffles on top. He instructed us to crumble the cracker into the soup. All I can say is OMG!2nd course: a delicious veggie burger( alas Hillstone still has the best) with melted cheddar and fries. Rochelle had the salmon with cauliflower( she loved it). I ate half of my burger to save room for last course, dessert. I asked Ramon to pack my burger for a late nite snack*(* I will explain later about my burger)3rd course: Apple pie with cherries on bottom of pie with Chestnut ice cream. (OMG part 2). Rochelle had the Devils food cake with Vanilla ice cream.Ramon, who was pleasantly chatting with us throughout our dining, returns with my burger packed to go. He pleasantly explains ""Fawn, we gave you a brand new burger and fries"" How nice was that?All I can say is WOW!

Go have a real meal elsewhere for a lot less money. Everything is way overpriced. Drinks are good but wine and liquor menus are absurdly priced and pretentious.

Luckily, if you're not normally part of the SoHo crowd, you can also catch The Dutch for a great weekday lunch and still eat with your eyes.We opted for the lunch tasting menu ($32), which is a relative steal for both prices in the area and considering you get full-sized portions instead of small tastings. I ended up trying:+ sunchoke soup with coffee cream and a chestnut-date granola: the foamy coffee cream on top was quite bitter and off-putting, but the actual soup was very good. The sweet ""granola bar"" on the side was also delicious for dipping. Probably wouldn't order this again, but I wanted something warm on a chilly day.+ crispy duck leg salad with cranberry beans, frisee, and egg: this was absolutely delicious, and it took serious control not to eat the entire thing in one go. The duck leg was deep fried and melt-in your-mouth perfection, while the light salad was perfect to complement the heavy duck. I loved the puree beneath it all (still not sure what that was), while the egg had some serious yolk porn going on. Definitely order this if you want to pretend to be healthy.+ devil's food cake with vanilla ice cream: pure chocolate heaven. The entire cake was wrapped with this meringue-like coating that had a little pepperiness to it, while the cake itself was super decadent. Their vanilla ice cream was also some of the best I've ever had; you could really taste the fresh vanilla beans inside and it was the perfect compliment to the rich cake.The entire staff was very friendly and the pace of the courses was very relaxed.

5.0,8/5/2015,"I love this restaurant but before last night, I have only been for Lunch and Brunch. He fried chicken that they serve here for Lunch and garnered such a following at my company that it has become a regular trip. If you haven't tried the Fried Chicken then you are missing out. As far as dinner is concerned, we were not disappointed. The waiter was fantastic offering up his favorite items. The oyster sliders were so tasty and tender. The texture was phenomenal. We also had the octopus and squid which was so tender and not even a bit chewy. The steak tartare was also delicious. As soon as I saw the Lambs Neck on the menu I never looked back and loved hearing it was the waiters favorite. It was so tender and worked well with the warm potato salad.

2.0,7/21/2015,"Me and my sisters went for restaurant week to the Dutch expecting it to be something which would be decent, if not something that would blow our minds away, but far from being delectable it was below average. For those of you who don't know how it works in restaurant week, generally it's a three-course meal served. The Dutch had 3 options in all 3 sections. I was fortunate to choose the best items( the duck in kale salad was decent) in all the three parts, hence I have given 2 stars while my sisters were less fortunate and barely managed to finish their meal. Even the dessert a new york cheese cake and a brownie that we ordered were just above average. Coming to the service, that too was on the extremely average side, with curt responses to any question asked. All in all a terrible experience! Restaurant week is meant for customers to get a taste of the fabulous cuisine in store at restaurants and then want to pay the normal amount because it was such a great experience.

Monday nights they offer the fried chicken dinner including coleslaw (which was epic), biscuits with this honey glaze (I wanted to steal my boyfriends and put them in my purse), and blueberry pie with vanilla ice cream (which we took home because it was physically impossible to consume that much food) so we will be enjoying that tonight.

3.0,7/18/2015,"Grabbed dinner here with my team after a long day. One thing that definitely caught our eye was the interesting list if whiskey and bourbon and features cocktails. I got the Caprice that was a bit sweet for me, so wouldn't recommend it but two at our party had at least a second and potentially 3 rd round. I like fresh cocktails and another member of the party added gin to a cucumber mock-tail for a great refreshing blend. To start we tried an array of oysters - super fresh and all perfect for popping (no biggies). We got the must have fried oyster sliders and they did not disappoint. You must get one per person, you won't want to share. The oyster is fried to perfection and accompanied with a great remoulade sauce, sandwiched between a sweet sesame bun. For dinner I got the skate which was highlighted with Meyer lemon on capers which I love. My only complaint is that the fish was pan fried and had a light coating that left it a little salty for my taste. The star of the evening was the 32oz steak the only 2 guys in our group shared.

We started with the waiter's recommendation for an awesome white wine - Lichen. My husband said the cornbread 'might be the best I've ever eaten'. He had the fried chicken accompanied by biscuits and coleslaw for dinner and was equally impressed. I had the cornmeal crusted trout with mustard sauce. The sauce was so delicious that they could have put a piece of cardboard on top of it and I would have eaten it happily.

This jalapeño cornbread was brought out to the table and it was amazing! So soft, moist, and flavorful. Would've been content if that's all we ate during our visit. We decided on the Shrimp Hushpuppies. Phenomenal decision. The shrimp tasted so fresh and outer crust of the Hushpuppies were also crisp. They were served with a kind of aoli (don't remember what it was called) but complimented the Hushpuppies perfectly. For my entree, I ordered the Fried Chicken, which also comes with two biscuits and coleslaw. BEST. DECISION. EVER. Words cannot describe how amazing this dish was, although it took a while for us to finally get our food, it was well worth the wait! The biscuits were warm, soft, and smothered in a honey glaze.

Yet, I received and consumed my appetizer, and then received entree, finishing almost half, before Bob even walked back over to see how everything was. So, about 28 minutes before the waiter (Bob) coming back to check up on his customer, does not show a lot of customer focus in my opinion.  at least have someone dedicated to that duty.  It is a genuine connection with your customer, as well as a nice touch.  price point is fair in my opinion for NYC dining.  Just a sleuth of other dining options out there.  Which is why customer focus is imperative.  would I rush back?  no.  It was a fine experience, average food, yet no huge wow factor.",1,0,1,Dave B.,"Mendham, NJ",12,179,34

2.0,4/9/2015,"I was quite disappointed with my dinner at The Dutch, which I had actually been looking forward to.  Although I was fond of the restaurant's atmosphere, the food was overrated and not worth the hefty bill.  I cannot remember the appetizer we chose (which goes to show how unimpressive it was).  Bestie & I chose pasta and a main entrée to share.  The Creste with spicy shrimp ragu, clam, and sea urchin was aesthetically pleasing, but lacked flavor and should have been served warmer.  The tasty kimchi fried rice saved the Hanger Steak entrée from being another disappointment.  Bestie & I obviously had to share their freshly made Warm Apple Pie.  We were expecting a more traditional presentation of the pie, but it was pretty good.  The chestnut ice cream was a plus.I am sad to say that I left The Dutch with a disappointed palette and one upsetting credit card charge!",0,1,0,Danielle M.,"New York, NY",396,512,41

2.0,4/1/2015,"In a word, disappointing. I walk by it often, and love the decor and vibe. (I've also been a big fan of their sister restaurant, The Smith.) Two of us went for dinner. I had skate, my partner had a steak. The skate was greasy and oversalted, and my partner found the steak to be mediocre. Both entrees were over $30, which felt overpriced for what it is. My glass of local beer was $9, and it wasn't even a pint.Service was stilted, and bordering on rude -- perhaps because we just wanted a quick bite on a weeknight and weren't ordering lots of drinks and other add-ons. Not that that should ever be an excuse for crappy service... we felt unwelcome.The worst part was an extremely loud large party sitting near us. This group was very clearly ruining the experience of everyone in the vicinity, but management didn't ask them to quiet down until we were nearly finished eating (and not until another guest at a nearby table shouted loudly, SHUT UP!). The restaurant was half empty, so there was no reason to seat others so close to them.It's too bad, I really wanted to like this place.

Fortunately had a $10 off to try out Pay with OpenTable to lighten the blow, but this place is more a spot to be seen (the beautiful Regina King was enjoying herself during a slow weekday lunch period) than to eat as well as the price would have you believe. Friendly hostesses offered coat check and had me brought to my table, and the very professional Ramon helped me out by taking my order for the hot fried chicken (priced the same at every meal). Cornbread (after their really weak and unremarkable branded hot sauce) to start, with heat hissing behind me and instrumentals overhead. Visible butter remnants in the cornbread and biscuits (not a bad thing, but very unrefined for the price point). The fried chicken was hot in temperature but certainly not spice, and Nashvillers would be extremely upset with their meal had they expected a taste of home. Hot towel to finish.Though I confirmed I could pay with OT, as I paid and walked out without receiving a bill on the table, the waiter looked very concerned, but then realized and wished me well.

We then decided we just wanted to order drinks and the waiter came back and asked us what we wanted to order as far as food. We politely told him we were sticking to drinks. We planned on ordering a bottle of wine but after he rolled his eyes and grabbed the menus out of our hands we thought otherwise and just had glasses. I have been to many many nice restaurants and I have never been treated this way. The waiter stormed off To talk to the hostess who glared in our direction.

The bartender recommended a white rum, which was also very good. For the appetizer, I had a fried oyster sandwich and the snow crab with curried mayo. I love snow crab, so I really loved that app. and even though I don't like oysters, the sandwich was also very good.For dinner/dessert, of course I ordered what this place is most well known for: the fried chicken. It is 4-5 pieces of very generously sized, sort of spicy, very moist, very crispy chicken. It also comes with cole slaw and 2 very delicious, buttery biscuits covered in honey. Also had it with a glass of white wine. I can't remember what it was, but the server recommended it to me. For dessert, I had the blueberry pie and the vanilla ice cream that comes with the chicken. I don't like blueberries, and I don't like pie, but it was so good! Very generous slice of pie too. Also had the Stumpton iced coffee with amaretto (they were out of Bailey's).The fried chicken and dessert is $30.

5.0,2/25/2015,"Dinner at The Dutch is an amazing culinary experience! A cold snowy night last week, some colleagues/friends and I went to the West Village for supper at The Dutch. We walked into the restaurant and instantly felt at home. The space is balanced well, with a front foyer and coat room, two main dining rooms joined together by a large square-shaped bar, and then a downstairs area with an intimate private dining room. Each room feels very separate and somehow cozy, with low, but warm lighting. And the acoustics were amazing...we were able to easily hear each other even when the restaurant was entirely full. Our table was in the front dining room by a wall of windows, giving us a lovely view of the snow as it fell that night. The meal began (and ended) with cocktails, wine and prosecco. And on the suggestion of our highly skilled servers, we opted for a number of appetizers, including The Prince Platter seafood tower filled with oysters, clams, octopus, scallops, shrimp and crab claws. The presentation of this seafood tower was so impressive that we all took photos and posted them to Instagram. We also tried the Ravioli with Sheep's Milk Ricotta, which was my favorite item of the night. Homemade pasta and cheese drenched in a buttery sauce...delicious!For our entrees, we had quite a range of the menu represented at the table, though the Korean-Style Hangar Steak was very popular. Again, the plating and presentation of this dish was so simple but special, as it was served in a cast iron skillet and garnished with KImchi Fried Rice and a Fried Farm Egg. I ordered the Mahi Mahi which was cooked to perfection and complemented by a shared side of the Housemade Fries. How we had room for dessert, I really don't know, but we moved ahead with the delicious Banana Fosters Crepe and the Warm Apple Pie to share. I absolutely loved the Warm Apple Pie, and really appreciated that the top crust was created with individual pieces of dough cut into the shape of leaves...such a nice detail!Overall, this meal was truly awesome, the service was incredibly professional, and the ambiance was just lovely.

This is a pet peeve and something that really turns me off in these places. We all settled for the tep water. However, his demeanor changed slightly as we all ordered the $28 per glass sparkling rosé. Good wine but not $28 good.

This isn't midtown.  This whole NYC 'we're too hip for you' crap is really getting out of hand. We won't be back.,0,0,0,Bruce G.,"Belleair Beach, FL",0,4,0
2.0,1/19/2015,"We walked in on a rainy Sunday for brunch, I called earlier to check if I could make a reservation for 4 people, but it was full so she recommended to just walk-in. At 2PM we walked in to meet a grumpy hostess. I believe she barely looked at us when we said hi. The first room was kind of full but still had some available tables. The host told us that we had to wait until all 4 was there to be seated and that it would probably take 40 minutes until we could get a table. She was still talking while looking at her computer. We where asked to move to the bar and wait there. Which we did, there was one available seat at the bar and I sat down, it took the host 2 minutes to almost push me off the chair and told us that the bar was on the other side and that this was a side for people to eat. My boyfriend and I just looked at each other as people where eating on Both sides of the bar and that it was really no difference from one side to the other. I just tried to smile and said ""sorry we did not know"". The rest of our party arrived after some minutes and suddenly we could get a table right ways as the restaurants in the back was almost empty. The service was ok, and the food was good. But since the whole experience started off so bad I will think twice before coming back!  I give it 2 stars just because the food was ok!",0,1,0,Elena G.,"New York, NY",3,10,0

Also, they charged $15 for a mimosa. I liked the restaurant and was impressed by the service. However, I don't think the prices justify the meal.

Came here after 3pm, brunch was already over but the bar was still open and thriving with patrons. We sat down right away as another party was just leaving. We split the following dishes between 3 girls.- Fried Chicken - just how I imaged it, large portions, fried chicken. Nuff said.- Burger and Fries  - medium rare, juicy, finger lickin' good. Killed the fries - thin, just like way I like them- Sashimi Appetizer - fresh and just how I expected it to taste but next time I would not order this dish. It's seriously just for one person.

5.0,1/11/2015,"I had to wait a few days for my dinner experience here to really fully settle in...the elated feeling I experienced whilst suckling a variety of oysters and  enjoying their succulent prime meats, left me on what most people know as ""Cloud 9"".I went here for my birthday dinner a few days ago, and even though we were a bit late for our reservation, we were greeted by a knowledgeable friendly waiter right away.We started with two of each of the oyster selections. Plump, fresh and creamy, the Barnstable oysters ranked as my #1, I highly recommend. The oyster sandwiches that are $5 a piece must not be overlooked! I didn't know there was such thing as, for lack of a better description, ""freshly fried"". The oil the chef fried the oyster meat in was very crisp and clean to the taste,  complimented with an incredible okra rémoulade. For the main entree, I had the pork loin with the brussel sprouts and the sweet potato mash. This is no ordinary pork chop, it's about the size of a mini meatloaf, big enough to satisfy a grown man or it can be split between two light eaters.Dessert was probably the most unexpected part of the evening. I had the  Toffee bundt cake, an incredible throwback to my childhood. The taste reminded me of my mom's Latin American bread pudding. It was moist and the texture was granular yet decadent. I also had the Coconut Passion Fruit Sundae which tasted like a typical South American dessert with coconut guava and fruit. Both had me feeling nostalgic and close to tears. I am tempted to suggest this place for my other birthday offers!! The only two cons I have about the evening is that it was sweltering in the back portion of the restaurant where I was seated, and the lighting was a tad too low.

We started off with the Beef Tartare, the Atlantic snow crab legs, follows by an order of the Spicy Tripe Lasagnette (exceptionally delicious). For our entrée,  I ordered the the Canadian pork loin with a sweet, velvety and butter whipped sweet potato, and some perfectly roasted Brussels Sprouts. (I still can't get over at how amazing this dish was, I might go back just because of this one dish). My boyfriend's entrée was the Prime Bone-In NY Strip, it was a very flavorful piece of meat but just a little too long on the grill, so it was a little too chewy. Overall the food was solid, I would go back to try the rest of the menu. The missing 2 stars was from the service. The hostess could be a little more friendly and welcoming, and a smile wouldn't hurt.. Also, I had made a reservation in advance but we were seated at the bar section but not at the dining area.

There were people at the bar with full glasses of beer and people in the surrounding bar area all with full drinks. However, as soon as we sat down the bartender immediately checked her watch. Then before asking us if we wanted a drink or saying anything at all, she completely left the bar and I assume went to talk to someone about her disapproval of us being let in for a cocktail.She came back and while she did ask us if we wanted a drink, she was not very friendly about it, at all.

The atmosphere is incredibly cozy- almost like a cabin feel, with a lit fireplace, garlands of lights and moose/plaid decor (granted, it is December). Its located in Soho, which has amazing shopping just steps away. Its a great place to bring out of town parents or a casual date, with the neighborhood being so appealing and having much to do afterwards. The service and waiter we had was amazing. I'm gluten free and also semi- paranoid about eating out due to cross contamination. I get immensely sick if a knife even so touches a slice of bread. He was very accommodating and ensured me that the kitchen staff would take extra precaution in making my food. I ordered from the seconds,""the omelette, oyster mushroom, comte cheese, frisée"" as well as off the fresh pressed juice menu, ""the green clean"" (kale, spinach, cucumber, lime, apple, pineapple, and mint). The juice, hands down, was my favorite thing I ordered. It was incredibly fresh, wonderful combination of fruits/ vegetables and of course the perfect hint of mint.

1.0,11/18/2014,"Not so much a review as a non-review.  We came last night after a show.  It was a Monday night - 10:15pm and we wanted dessert and coffee.  The place was only about half full.  The hostesses acted more like they created ""The Dutch"" than like they worked there and they were a little condescending.  One of them told us that if all we wanted was dessert that she could seat us at the oyster bar, but that they couldn't give us a table, because they had to save their tables for people actually ordering food.  I found that a little insulting.  Now listen, I understand that waitstaff earns their money from tables.  I also know that when I go to a restaurant and all I want is dessert and coffee, I tend to tip extra big to compensate.  We went straight across the street to Piccola Cucina - which, by the way had really amazing dessert. Great find and I know I'll end up back there for dinner soon.  We had one of the best pistachio creme brulees I've ever tried and the most adorable and delicious marzipan-wrapped cassatas.  The waiter got a nice healthy tip and, honestly, from the moment we walked in, we felt welcome.  That's the type of place where I like to spend my money.This was the second bad experience at the Dutch for my friend.  She told me after we left that this was her ""giving the place another chance"".  She lives just a block away and had gone there for brunch a while back with a group of her friends.  She had ordered an omellete on the menu.  When she asked about toast, they brought it, but charged a $5 surcharge.  That coupled with the fact that the service was a little spotty put them toward the bottom of her list.  We are both people who eat out a lot - and I mean a lot.  It's unusual for me not to end up at a restaurant for dinner on any given night.  I hate doing dishes and it's worth it for me to eat well and have someone else do the clean up.  When I find a great place, it gets on my list, it gets a lot of my money, and I'm loyal to it.  This is not a place that I will be being loyal to any time soon.",2,0,0,Simon C.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,7,0

The ham was fine and you should probably eat it with the eggs or the eggs won't be savory. -Chicken and waffles: Chicken was bland according to my friends. The honey biscuit, which I tried, was quite delicious and I'd probably just order a side of that if I could.-Sweet Waffles: The waffles were fine based on my friend's review. It comes with a syrup, strawberries, and a vanilla/white chocolate pudding. The pudding was way too sweet and there was way too much (an entire bowl). I'd say go to The Dutch if you're looking for a reservation for a group and you want to stroll around SoHo after. The prices are probably a little too high considering I don't think you're really getting quality food.",0,0,0,Sally Y.,"New York, NY",117,93,16

Our waiter was by far the rudest person I have ever come across in my entire life. He was french and felt annoyed by us asking questions about the menu. He was completely unfriendly and did not even ask us once if we were ok, if we needed more wine etc. We had to call him over each time. He never once came over asked us if our food was good or that it was on its way. We waited over 45 minutes for our entrees and when I asked him where our food was he goes ""soon"" and walks away from me. I have never experienced service like this in my entire life. When we walked out, he did not even say thank you or even goodbye to any one of us! it was appauling. I am informing every single one of my friends to NEVER EVER dine at this restaurant.

Fried Chicken, had no flavour at all, I am better off at Popeye's where they actually seasoned the chicken. I asked our waiter for hot sauce, okay, I had to look at the bottle, because I couldn't believe this was actually ""hot sauce"". No sort of heat or any sort of kick was happening in my mouth.  It was putting something bland on something bland. The biscuit was hard as hell on the bottom and already coated with the honey butter. We both wished they left the buttering to us, since it wasn't as fluffy as we would have liked. The slaw was actually good, since I don't like slaw and their version was good.The complimentary cornbread - good texture, but leave out the green peas, it didn't enhance the flavouring of the bread at all.

Pork belly should never be dry.We also had the fried chicken. Again, it was also very dry and chewy. I'm sensing a trend. The flavors were pretty good, and the chicken itself was not greasy on the outside, which is nice. But that's ruined when the meat itself doesn't taste good.

2.0,8/31/2014,"It was hard to decide to give this place 2 or 3 stars, I would give it 2.5 if possible. Had brunch with my boyfriend, his father, and his father's girlfriend this weekend. It's nice that it's large with ample seating for brunch, which made it odd that they put us at a way too tiny booth when we showed up with four people (with reservations) and the restaurant was only 1/4 full. We had the eggplant dip appetizer, two orders of the cornmeal pancakes, two orders of the omelet, an order of the honey glazed biscuits (really really tasty! best thing we had), and a big bowl of fruit. However, when we ordered the entrees the waiter tried REALLY hard to upsell us, trying to get us to order toast and bacon too- even though as just mentioned we ordered a bunch of sides and apps and had ample food. He tried to upsell each of us after our orders which is a habit I find so tacky. Especially considering we did order additional food beyond the entrees. It seems like an awfully nice place to be desperate to upsell its customers. Then, when the food came, the omelets were bizarre. I get that they're trying to do something new and different, but these ""omelets"" were actually just rolled up mostly-cooked scrambled eggs next to a pile of omelet fillings. Like a deconstructed omelet. But who really wants a deconstructed omelet at brunch? No one, that's who. At first it appeared there was bechamel sauce inside the rolled up eggs, but no, it was just undercooked egg. Additionally, two separate servers stepped on my toes, which were under the table, so that seemed strange- possibly because we were seated at the worlds smallest four top for no reason",0,0,0,Denise G.,"Chinatown, Manhattan, NY",3,33,0
2.0,8/28/2014,"Let me start by saying I really wanted to love this place. I had read good reviews and was eager to try it. So I went for dinner here around 9 pm and the place looked like it was near closing already, which seemed rather early for this part of town and not to mention the sign on the door which reads as you enter the establishment ""Open Late"" (which I now assume is there solely as a form of art and is not put into actual practice). After reviewing the menu and based off of the waiters recommendation, I went with the heirloom tomato and melon bruschetta as an appetizer, and for my main dish I chose the montauk tilefish, shrimp, mushroom, miso cabbage. The heirloom tomato bruschetta was highly disappointing. It tasted like the dish had been pre-made earlier that day and then stored in the fridge as the tomatoes did not taste like they were room temperature and were a touch bitter to taste but had been masked with excess salt. I would also like to add that the bruschetta itself tasted soggy and I just can't imagine that's how the chef intended to serve it? I barely ate any of it, but as I was with company I did not want to make a comment to the waiter regarding (nor did they ask when they took my obviously full plate away why I hadn't devoured my 17 dollar tomato melon appetizer that they had enthusiastically recommended to me). The main course I ordered was unfortunately just really boring. The fish and the shrimp tasted overcooked and there was no real flavor in the broth and honestly once again it just seemed over salted to make up for an otherwise flavorless dish.To me the food seemed tired and limp. I'm not sure if I was there on an off night or if you need to show up earlier to this restaurant to get a better end result with the food or what the deal was, but suffice it to say I likely won't be rushing back anytime soon or recommending it to anyone in my network.I will say that the wine menu was excellent and the waiters were cordial, but for over a hundred dollars per head I would recommend a Hundred Acres over the Dutch hands down.",0,0,0,Harlow G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,5

1.0,8/12/2014,"WORST dinner E. V. E. R....!!! Let's start with the wanna be model hostess with an attitude that looked us up and down when we walked in, with a reservation and told us she'd find us when our table was ready(she didn't). Then, proceeded to seat us 20 minutes later at the same empty table we saw when we walked in. The bar... Get ready to wait. The bartenders are incredibly flustered. With THREE bartenders, we still waited ten minutes to be noticed and even once we ordered it took another ten minutes for him the make one cocktail and and pour a glass of wine. Then, he screwed up the bill and didn't charge us the right amount.Service... TERRIBLE and practically nonexistent! Although she was nice, she was absolutely clueless about any menu item when asked(when we could actually find her, of course). And it wasn't just her. We again waited for our drinks. Any server, bus boy, food runner we asked for anything either never brought it or brought the wrong thing. We finally had to ask for bread, when we noticed everyone around us had it. After asking two people, it finally came. There were three of us, we had enough bread for one person. Cornbread was dry and butter was over whipped and semi melted because of it. Half our appetizers came out and the other half were never put into the kitchen. When we finally got the attention of someone to re-order the other apps, we were done with ours. When we finally got the check in the end, we told her which amount to put on the two cards, of course, that was down incorrectly and was blamed on the busboy that took the check, saying, ""Oh, he doesn't run the cards."". Ok, so he shouldn't take the check from the table then!! And course, the check was wrong!! Food... Wedge salad was limp and nothing special at all. I made better salads when I was kid, helping my mother out with dinner! Everything from the raw bar was pretty disgusting and at room temperature, which was off putting in itself. The oysters they use in the sliders are enormous west coast oysters that are way too creamy to be fried like this, so the consistency is pretty disgusting once fried(think oyster pudding! breaded and fried). Heirloom tomato salad was nothing worth the price, just topped tomatoes with dressing, I had the Cobia, which was such a small portion, I couldn't find it under the piles of limp, over cooked beans. The same went for my friend's fish entree, very small portion. I literally could've eaten another entree, just not at The Dutch! The chicken dinner was good, but the biscuits were really dry, which was attempted to be disguised by a ton of melted butter and honey poured over them.  Cole slaw was good, but spicy(which wasn't noted). Then when my husband asked to take his blueberry pie to go(it came with the chicken dinner), the waitress was dumb enough to say, she didn't recommend it, because it came with a scoop of ice cream. When my husband said, you can keep the ice cream, she literally thought he was saying that SHE could have it and said she couldn't, because she was on a diet! We love Laconda Verde, but this...

Biscuit was semi dry and the poached eggs were overcooked. My friend had the eggs with salmon and the salmon portion was so small we thought they forgot it altogether.

5.0,5/18/2014,"Trying to find the perfect place to eat, I happened on a whim while a friend was visiting from Turkey and I could not have had a better experience!! We walked in and were immediately greeted by a wonderful hostess (this is a big plus... can't tell you how many restaurants fail at something so simple like this). It was peak lunch hour so no tables were available for two. My friend and I sat at the Oyster bar and placed an order from our bubbly and attentive waitress (Brianna?). She was excellent to say the least.We started with a fresh red beet salad with home-made stracciatella. Good Lord it was to die for! Very fresh, very flavorful. By far the best beet salad I've had (i rarely throw those words around). Then we moved on to the main dish. I had yet to eat that day so I went with breakfast. The mushroom and cheddar omelette was so delectable, cooked to perfection and was topped with a truffle oil reduction. It was extremely tasty and I was in awe how simple dishes like these could possibly taste so good.My friend ordered their fried chicken and biscuits. I am somewhat on a diet so I only snagged a small bite of the chicken, it too was out of this world.To make matters BETTER... We ordered some espresso to cap our meal. (I really wish I was better with names....) A lovely gentleman who runs the coffee program there served us our espesso's then engaged us with interesting conversation about the complexity of coffee. Apparently he is one of the top experts in the country on all things coffee. He even judges at the National Barista Competition (never knew it existed but very glad this was the man behind our roast). Not only did he give us a complete background on the intricate processes behind making the perfect cup, but he went ahead and made us a complimentary latte.Again, this sounds simple, but I'm not exaggerating when I say, yet again, it was the BEST latte I have ever had. Not sure if he used a different type of milk or just prepared it differently but when my friend and I sipped our cups, we said simultaneously ""Wowwwww."" I guess that sums up our experience.

And my memory about this W.V. spot has blurred. But I had a clear idea about what I would be getting - oysters!  And I am happy to report, the Dutch not only fulfills but exceeds my expectation.Right after I slide into my seat at the bar, the waiter came promptly and helped me choose the wine for my oysters - a dry and well balanced Veltliner. Perfect. Onto the food, oysters! Yes, the price per piece is twice you would pay at Mermaid Inn but the quality matches with the higher price. I got half from east coast, the Montauk Pearl , and half from west coast, Blue Pool from WA. Both were super fresh and juicy; sweeter with the Blue Pool and saltier with the Montauk Pear.  However, both of them could not compare with the Island Creek , which excelled in texture and size.  As I was sitting at the bar, I had a great conversation about oysters with the guy who shucked my oysters. Very knowledgeable fellow. Feast continued. I got the sea urchin from Santa Barbara, simply served with lime, seasalt and pepper sitting on top of a bed of,, I believe, sea urchin jello! Heavenly! Saltiness, sweetness, brininess and creaminess! All hit your taste buds at the same time. I want to have more!Of course, I would not skip on veggies. Per recommendation, I got the spring pea, with carrots seasoned with vermont butter and  topped with Parmesan and garlic bread crumb. It was spring time in a plate. All in all, I had a great night. i am thoroughly satisfied about the food the services and the wine. Yeah you might not find cutting edge cooking technique or exotic sourced ingredients here.

Yes this is NY, but I always look at value as an equation: V= F/C (function over cost). So the function (eg, service, food, atmosphere) is directly related to the value, whereas the cost is inversely proportionate. I put this in nerd terms, because I want to emphasize this is a very good restaurant, and otherwise would have been 4 stars. It's situated in a very hip part of soho and you truly feel like a local ducking into this charming neighborhood bistro. But describing it as a bistro doesn't do justice to the interior.

2.0,3/17/2014,"What is all the hype about?? I've been hearing about this place since it opened and finally ate dinner there on Friday.  With plenty of seats visibly empty they still played the Please Wait At The Bar & Buy Our Expensive Drinks game (okay, pretty standard in NYC but still annoying). Bartenders were quick with the drinks and friendly, so that's a plus. Menu: Meh - nothing really struck me as Interesting & Gotta Have It. And the prices for what you get? Unwarranted.  Worst experience while there (and the Dumbest. Owners - listen up if you're concerned about profitability!): we liked the sound of the seafood tower, which was priced at $125. A selection of cold seafood including uni... which none of us would eat. We also know that uni is Very Expensive, so we asked our waiter if they could substitute anything else for it - a couple of extra shrimp, maybe a clam or two. He looked doubtful but went to the Chef to check and the answer came back: absolutely not.  No, you can NOT have a cheapy clam or shrimp instead of the expensive uni.  Mind you, we did not ask to negotiate the price on this - we were actually WILLING to spend $125 on a seafood tower and the answer was still no...So instead we got the broccoli & cheese puffs ($8 for 2 small, dried-out puffs. that's $4 a bite. And they could stand to learn how to make decent gougeres here - i don't mind paying if it's an incredible experience.) and a few decent mini lobster rolls (I forget the price). But it wasn't anywhere NEAR a $125 spend on just the appetizer.  Then we ordered real entrees, sides, drinks, etc.  And nothing was impressive, wow, or ""gotta get back here"". More like ""what the heck was everyone raving about?"" plus 'How stupid was that waiter when he would have made a $25 tip off of the appetizer ALONE!??"".    Anyway, $300 later and here I am to tell you all - save yourself the hype and go spend your money somewhere that it's TRULY worth it.",2,0,0,Renee W.,"Rockville Centre, NY",21,118,10

2.0,3/7/2014,"It finally happened to visit The Dutch after having passed its location on the corner of Sullivan St. & Prince St. on all the many previous visits to SoHo.  The two dining areas (a bar on each side of the two rooms) were nicely designed with a modern industrial dark theme, lightened up by the white colored brick walls and the black and white hanged photography of different parts of Manhattan.  The place showcased a fresh take on SoHo's lofty identification.  It was very well executed, and maintained, I must say.  The stylish host was very attentive and certainly helpful when it came to my questions about the extensive Restaurants Week's menu of The Dutch (prices of each and every item were displayed in case a person would choose to go a la cart, or add up items on the prix-fixe, which was a considerate touch, I thought).  It was the first most generous menu of the Restaurants Week that a restaurant had ever offered.  But with the extensive choices came the dilemma of indecisiveness, of course (now that was the problem? Really?!).  Oh, well.  Choices were narrowed down to an order of each of the followings (items were listed in the menu by their ingredients and not in titles (interesting!): Appetizer: Beets, Homemade Stracciatella (a creamy version of burrata), Candied Pistachios, Main: Dry-Aged Burger, Cheddar, Secret Sauce (.....What?!!), Fries, Dessert: Peanut Semifreddo, Fudge Sauce.The presentation of the beets salad was nice, while the serving was exceptionally small--I guess this was where the European feel, which is derived from the restaurant's name, came along.  Despite the ""tasting"" portion of the salad served in a rather side plate, the homemade stracciatella was phenomenal.  I could have enjoyed it as a spread on slices of sourdough bread (nice idea!), had the bread that was served not been ""oily"" corn bread (with chipotle and chives).  I also found the beetroots to have been more on the acidic side, as the vinegar taste in the dressing was too overwhelming.    When it comes to the main, the dry-aged beef was of an evident high quality.  However, my entrée had a room temperature and felt as though it was sitting in the kitchen counter for awhile before it was served (not good idea to have fries tasted as if it was prepared a couple of hours ago. That is a big NO!).  The brioche buns were moist (lots of butter, of course), but some of their edges got hard half way through my meal (the hardness you get in a microwaved bread after it gets some exposure to air).  And what's up with the ""Secret Sauce""?  Are not customers supposed to know what their digestion system is exposed to, at least by a general sense?  I honestly felt the main was tedious, and could not wait to get over with it.And as far as the dessert, imagine having a very soft ice cream with a bar of Snickers mixed with it.  That is all.The Dutch has a very nice atmosphere for people watching while enjoying drinks (highly recommended to meet up with ""active"" friends as the ambience is very vibrant).  I also overheard the brunch is good, but that is for me to explore!

Complete opposite spectrums in terms of taste, but on the same wavelength in terms of how unsatisfactory they were. The Korean dish was extremely salty and the truffle fusilli was extremely bland. I literally had to put together one mouthful of the Korean dish and one mouthful of the fusilli to somewhat balance out the flavors. I'm usually very wary of ordering Korean fusion dishes in non-Korean restaurants and once again, my reasoning for doing so was confirmed.The best part of our meal were the lobster roll appetizers ($6/each). Needless to say, I wish I had ordered 5 lobster rolls instead of the entree I had- it was THAT bad.Oh, also the portions were tiny. We grabbed a 2nd dinner of shawarma on the way back home.

We started with four different types of oysters (absolutely delicious), a mini lobster roll each (also excellent) and the truffled beef carpaccio appetizer. I wouldn't say I'm usually a fan of raw meat but this was incredible - my favorite dish of the night actually. It came in a lovely dressing with parsley and tiny mushrooms.For main dishes, we shared the truffle fusilli (creamy, truffle-y, and wonderful) and the spiced pork with collared greens and grits. For dessert we shared the rum baba (great presentation - the dessert comes out and then they pour more than a shot of aged rum over it) and the lemon chess pie (highly recommended).The service was perfect, the atmosphere relaxed but upscale and the experience was memorable. My only complaint was I didn't love either of the drinks I ordered (the buttered rum and the emerald city cocktail). Both were far too sweet and did not go well with dinner at all.

Our waiter was breathtakingly rude -- curt, sarcastic and dismissive. He was aggressive in pressing us to order food, aggressive in removing plates while members of our party clearly were still eating (i.e. fork in hand), had to be reminded to bring ordered coffee, and dropped the check at the table before it was requested (i.e. just as the coffee he needed to be reminded to bring was delivered). This waiter's demeanor was beyond the pale, especially since there were open tables throughout the restaurant.The experience was so uniquely bad that I emailed the ""communications director"" for the restaurant group (only contact, aside from the events manager, on the restaurant's website), providing the waiter's name and a polite, albeit disappointed, description of our brunch. His reply left something to be desired. He said he was ""terribly sorry to hear about [my] frustrations"" -- which turns the problem back on me rather than acknowledging that something might have been awry in the service itself -- and said he would forward my email on to the team at the Dutch.It's been over three weeks now and no further word from the restaurant acknowledging the email.

For dinner we shared four entrees and a side (for 5 of us), which was plenty to go around. oh, and more bottles of wine, of course... with the assistance of their somm, who, like the bartender, was great. my last visit to the Dutch was for a summer weekday lunch, and I have to say I was less impressed with the food offerings this time around. Not to say that anything was bad -- it was all very tasty. Just seemed a little less inventive than my previous visit.

The atmosphere is lovely: warm, comfy, the kind of place you could hang around for a while a have a long, slow dinner. The night started great. I was truly excited by the menu and excited to dive into deciding which cocktails and wine I wanted to have. We started with a selection of oysters. All fresh, briny and simply yum yum yum. We tried a few different cocktails. All of them seemed a little off--as if they were trying too hard to create something unique. The last cocktail I ordered was the ""Emerald City"". It was repulsive. Bright green--like some nasty slushy you'd get at a street fair. We put it at the edge of our table as to clearly signal it wasn't to our liking. The servers ignored it and did not ask us if everything was ok. House-made rigatoni is solid. Grilled red chicken is flavorful and some of the most moist chicken I've ever had (although served not quite hot enough, temperature wise). The major screw up with the cocktail in addition to the fact that service was just completely off the entire night leads to my two Yelp star review. We had a few different waiters throughout the evening, and none of them seemed to know what was going on. To be fair, the manager brought our dessert (which we ordered and paid for) out with a candle for my birthday.

Also split 2 different kind of pastas. The lamb rigatoni (our favorite) it tasted slightly gamey which was perfection. Then ordered another raviiolli like pasta that had a very sweet creamy taste. It was not what we expected at all but still very phenomenal. The staff was amazing. We had Ramon as our server! He was great! But on top of that, we had about 5 individuals helping us at all times.

That doesn't give you an excuse to be rude. A week ago we walked in around 9:30 on a Monday night and we were told, very matter-of-factly that there was about a 45 minute wait, and no room in the bar, so go somewhere else in the neighborhood for a drink and if you come back we'll see what we can do.

We didn't have a reservation but was seated right away. I opted for the Fried Chicken, since everyone raves about it. It was very moist on the inside with a crunchy crust on the outside. I'm not THAT big of a fried chicken fan (I usually have 1-2 pieces and then fill up on sides) but I did finish the entire plate. Their honey biscuits are to die for and I don't even LIKE biscuits on a regular basis. The Boyfriend had the hamburger, which was a bit messy to eat since their special sauce was a bit drippy but it was enjoyable. The fries, though, were so good! We split the apple pie for dessert - I was hoping for some of their other more famous pies but this one was enjoyable. The caramel ice cream was since compliment. I hear they have pumpkin doughnuts on their dessert menu for the time being, so I might be back pretty soon to try them out.

Delicious and tender...not overcooked or soggy.Monday night Fried Chicken - We had to order this (pictured below).  The honey buttermilk biscuits were unbelievable.  The chicken was like gourmet Shake and Bake...seasoned perfectly and tasty...not trying too hard!  Just greasy enough.  Korean-style hanger steak - yum.  A little chewy, as hanger steak can tend to be.  Delicious with the Kimchi fried rice!Desserts - They brought us special ginger gelato and pumpkin donuts from pastry chef Kierin Baldwin.  Donuts were warm and perfect fall dessert!  Cooper was our waiter.  Very passionate and attentive.  Great vibe and great atmosphere.  Highly recommend.",2,0,0,Dana S.,"New York, NY",1188,13,3

3.0,11/18/2013,"Although I'm not 100% certain why a restaurant that serves American food is called ""The Dutch"", I did somewhat enjoy my experience here.  The ambiance is quintessential New York, late night dinner: dimly lit ambiance, cozy corner banquets, candles, and attentive service.  I started with a drink.  Emerald City: Banks rum, Plantation syr, Black Strap, Senor Curacao, Pastachio, Ginger,  and Lime. I didn't care for it.  Too tart and a weird mix of flavors.  It was also served like a slush.  Either that, or they just put way too much crushed ice in there.  This drink left a big ""?"" above my head, and I couldn't finish it. My friends split a bottle of red, which they really enjoyed.  I wish red wine didn't give me a headache, but I usually can't do more than one glass.   Under the ""snack"" portion of the menu, we started with: the broccoli and cheese puffs and the foie gras toast with california figs. Each order came with three.  And there were three of us.  Small in portion, but large in flavor.  A nice amuse-busche.  For my entree I had the steamed mediterranean dorade with mushrooms and cauliflower.  It was nice.  A very clean dish. One of my friends had the Skate Schnitzel, served with red cabbage, apple creme fraiche, and dill.  It was not exactly what we expected, but it was tasty.  My other friend had the Korean style hanger steak, served with kimchi fried rice and a farm egg.  Her dish may have been the winner.  The kimchi fried rice was excellent.  It had a kick to it and it was just really nicely flavored.  For dessert we shared the peanut butter ice box pie.  The pie part was decent, but it  was also served with this slushy lime stuff on the side, which reminded me of a margarita.  A very weird dessert.  I'm not sure I would go back here again.  Good, but not at the top of my list.",0,0,0,Laurie V.,"North Canton, OH",617,1182,979

I'm not sure if the fact that it was served (attractively so) in a metal, two-handled bowl mattered, but the dish did get cool pretty quickly though.I made sure to save room for dessert. The salted lime pie is a great balance of salty, sweet and tart. The blueberry pie was rich and flavorful. And then we got nice squares of lemon brown butter shortbread with our check.The service is attentive and friendly but not overbearing. Fortunately, the dining room was not that crowded when we were there but I did feel that the tables were a little too close to each other for true comfort.",0,0,0,Janet W.,"Hoboken, NJ",95,77,42

It's not overdone like Commerce and it doesn't make you feel underdressed like Marea...I would say it feels closer to Gramercy Tavern. The food is more delicate and of higher quality than you expect when you order: steak tartare will be more finely chopped than you're used to, with chives in it and microgreens on top and fried potato chips the size of your fingertips; trout a la plancha says ""almonds"" on the menu but actually it's not just any almonds it's marcona almonds; salted lime pie not only comes with the described coconut sorbet but also has dots of coconut water gelee and passion fruit sauce.

I am a chocolate person all the way but the lime pie sounded really good and it comes with coconut ice cream so that hooked me in and it was AMAZING. graham cracker crust had a little bit of salt in it too which was great.

4.0,7/26/2013,"Restaurant Week has become such a restless event that some diners are shying away from it.  While the initial objectives of RW were to provide an opportunity for diners to try out restaurants that they cannot normally afford at a prix-fixe price and for threstaurants to bring up their revenue during the less populated late summer and winter times, but what was a two week promotion turned into a month (or even a year for a few businesses) and the menu just became tiring, with the usual soup du jour/salad/another item from regular menu as appetizers; grilled fish/chicken/pasta as entree selections; and cake/pie/ice-cream or sorbets for desserts.  None of the choices showcase the strength of the kitchen, but rather an assembly line way to churn out as many plates out the double doors as possible.  Luckily, there are restaurants that do not follow this route.  The Dutch is one example.  Rather than offering mediocre dishes, the chef decided to allow the diners to choose items off the regular menu.  One is not chained to the prix-fixe template and we were excited to try some of their namesake dishes.  The steak tartare, carefully brunoise cut of beef paired with grilled scallion, a swipe of spicy mustard to balance off the fattiness of the protein and mini parprika chips that were more of a tease than a crunch satisfaction.  It was an ample portion for an appetizer, no size skimping at all.  The only 'beef' is the overly grilled toast points that could literally cut the roof of your mouth if you do not chew the 20X plus that our mother taught us to do at the dinner table.  And for the main, the hot fried chicken was a no brainer.  The poultry plate probably is the order of choice 50% of the time.  The metal plate with a pair of handle accessorizes the Americana comfort food of fried chicken with biscuits and coleslaw, but there is nothing simple about it.  The skin is crunchy as you bit into the chicken leg.  What your mouth meet after the crunch factor is its contradiction - moist, smooth, tender meat.  The meat itself isn't seasoned, so the skin is where the flavor profile retains.  However, remember to eat these chicken quick as cold fried skin is not friendly to the roof of your mouth, again.  Four pieces come on a plate, which is estimately half a chicken.  The best piece de resistance is the leg (IMHO), just more tender meat and easier to dig into with both hands.  The biscuits are like two little pucks of honey-sweetened flaky scones. In between the times you are tired of the protein, alternate between with the sweet biscuits or the sour coleslaw.  Overall, the fried chicken is not revolutionary and at its original price of $19, it is definitely one upscale 'KFC' food, but the quality is there and you don't taste that processed seasoning as from fast food grubs.And finally, dessert was chocolate semifreddo. Frozen chocolate (rocky road flavor) with a pool of snow white whipped cream. That was a better choice than the cherry crisp (too tart and 'simple'), but the salted lime pie with coconut sorbet was a close call.  The bitterness from the chocolate complements the saccharine cream. The angel/devil (white/black) contrast was very visual looking, if only the plate wasn't white, but perhaps a fiery red.  That would've been 'fierce'.  As expected, The Dutch is hopping the entire time we dined there. Only one empty table was seen and then it was soon occupied.  The bookended cookbooks by the fake window sill and exposed brick walls (the choice of restaurant decor, I suspected) added a comforting and inviting ambience.  Service was passable, but I could definitely see the bussers being overworked during RW.  The decibel level, which has been the talk of the blog town recently, is quite high.  There were times when we had to say 'huh?' a couple of times.  Crowds are mostly young, fashionables or business people during the lunch hours.  But during RW, you never know.  Seems like everyone on a tight budget are out, hunting for the next best meal deal in town.",6,1,5,GarGuPi L.,"Flushing, NY",87,496,1696

4.0,7/14/2013,"Originally I bookmarked The Dutch to try the brunch/lunch fried chicken. But a friend assured me their dinner menu was good as well. After scanning the menu I wasn't impressed and none of the entrees really stood out to me. So on a whim I ordered the duck breast with polenta and foie gras, plus beef tartar as a starter.The tartar was nice but a little fussy with microgreen salad and dressing. It detracted from the raw beef flavor that I like to get from tartar. I tried a friend's fried soft shell crab app and preferred it over the tartar. The crab tasted fresh and had a great crunch to it.Next came the entrees...I was blown away by my dish! The duck (medium-rare) was super tender and dressed with a bit of salt to cut through the rich foie and duck fat. The polenta had a creamy grits-like consistency and taste. I also loved the tiny radishes and pickled cherries as they provided a punch in flavor and texture to contrast the rest of dish. Aside from the few slices of duck I shared, I scraped my plate clean!Lastly I stole a bite of another's wheat pasta dish. When we were ordering, everyone had their reservations about the wheat pasta because of its healthy and un-tasty reputation. The server convinced my friend that because their pasta is house-made and fresh they wouldn't feel that way after trying it. Good thing I didn't bet money against it because I was proven wrong! If only all other wheat pastas tasted like this, it wouldn't be labeled as the evil villain among pastas.Ultimately the best part of the meal was having my (average) expectations exceeded. With NY having so many great restaurants I'm not coming back for a second try if the meal was mediocre. I'm happy to say that The Dutch has earned another visit.

4.0,7/2/2013,"After making reservations at a fancier restaurant, we ended up canceling last minute because it was hot, and we didn't feel like dressing up. So we strolled in, fingers crossed that the wait would not be too long on a sunny Saturday evening, party of 2, around 6:30 with no reservations. We were seated immediately. Score! After settling in, we looked over the menu, and while it was a little easier to determine what main courses to choose, we had some trouble picking starters, since many options were raw, and we don't generally like raw food. Despite our indecisiveness, our waiter was the perfect amount of patient and attentive, and we settled on the eggplant dip, soft shell crab, Korean-style hanger steak, and the blackened cod. Shortly after ordering, we got our bread, which we didn't eat much of, save for the cornbread, which we devoured instantly. It was moist and flavorful, and I can totally go for some right now.The eggplant dip with crackers is essentially baba ghanoush. It was good, but if we're going to call it baba ghanoush, and we compare it to other places that serve baba ghanoush, this certainly isn't the best that I've had, although I enjoyed the chopped bits of eggplant.The star of the meal was the crispy soft shell crab with pickled ramps. This is my first time actually eating soft shell crab (not counting the countless spider rolls I've had at sushi restaurants), and it was delicious. The batter was crispy, and the crab itself was fresh, meaty, and sweet. The pickled ramps added a welcome acidity to round out the flavors. While I didn't try the hanger steak, the blackened cod was great. It was cooked perfectly - tender, moist, and not dry at all. It came with a crab sauce, a poblano pepper sauce (or puree?) and potatoes. I enjoyed the crab sauce, which was very buttery with generous chunks of crab. For the most part, I thought everything on the plate went well with each other, except for the poblano peppers. It was either eat some fish with the crab sauce, or eat some fish with the peppers. Together, it made me go ""hmm...I don't get it"" rather than ""OMG genius!""Unfortunately, we were full to the point that we declined dessert, which I now regret in hindsight - the pies sounded amazing!

Usually a place like the Dutch doesn't get crowded until later, so we decided to go as early as possible. The service was great. Coffee and water as soon as we sat down and he gave us some great recommendations. We wanted to get a few things to sample but he advised us that we had ordered too much food already, so we reconsidered. We went with the waffle dish (it used to be french toast on the menu but was just changed) and the soft scrambled eggs with salmon and a bagel. We also had a side of honey butter biscuits and bacon. The food was really excellent. Totally different choices with the heavy and light but they were each great. I liked the waffles more. They were served with strawberries and crème fraîche. The biscuits are a must try. As we left, the place was packed and it got sceney but if you want to try a great place for breakfast, make a 10am reservation and check this place out.

Had me question my stance on butter biscuits vs honey biscuits.For real though, I only giving it 4 stars only cause the front staff and bar took way too long to acknowledge me and my friend even though there was no wait time for seating and no one ahead of us.I can respect the empty tables for reservations, but come on son, if there's a waiter chatting with the bartenders and there's still dirty plates on tables that need to be cleaned, you can't just be waiting for the busboys to come and clean especially if its slightly to your left, my right and I gaze into your soul, about 5 steps away. It's not that hard to pick up a plate and pass it along or tidy it up a bit.But I give a virtual fist bump to the busboys cause those dudes were quick with the water and cleaning, whenever I saw a customer in need.Otherwise, the brunch was dope as ****. S word or F word, whichever you wanna insert. That Smoked Salmon with Scrambled Eggs was definitely delicious, but the Fried Chicken with them Honey Biscuits? SON! MAD DELICIOUS. I did not ever once in my life considered eating fried chicken with a biscuit with a knife and fork, but bruh bruh; I HAD to eat it with a knife and fork to pace myself and savor it. It's juicy, crunchy, not as oily as other spots that make me feel like I should take the excess oil home and possibly give myself a hot oil hair treatment.

The hostesses were dismissive and rude. Doesn't really bother me that they enforce the standard ""won't seat you until your whole party is here"" rule, but they do it in such a rude and condescending way. Anyway, onto the meal itself. We asked to be seated in the back which was a good call, since the atmosphere is much nicer for dinner. I ordered the stracciatella toast and the blackened cod.

5.0,5/7/2013,"Been here twice now, so I feel like I can adequately review it.  Both times we sat at one of the bars and ate because the wait for the tables was long, but the service didn't suffer just because we were at the bar.The food both times has been awesome. So far we've had the turkey sandwich, the burger, the fried chicken, oysters and the Hamachi appetizer.  Everything has been excellent, but THE FRIED CHICKEN IS BY FAR THE BEST.  It comes with 2 honey biscuits, which is basically 2 of the softest biscuits you will ever have with honey drizzled over both of them.  Luckily, the biscuits can be ordered as a side too so next time, I might just be ordering that and gorging.  The Hamachi appetizer was beyond amazing too, 3 sashimi pieces over a light yogurt sauce (which on paper sounds gross, but it was good, I promise) and caviar on top.  I was pretty happy for 11:30am on a Sunday to be eating that.  The drinks were good too, I had the Dutch Iced Tea, which was delicious, the husband had the Bloody Mary which he enjoyed.  Word to the wise, they can't start serving alcohol until 12pm, BUT our server was kind enough to put our drink order in the queue so that it was one of the first ones to come out at 12pm and we didn't get stuck behind all the other drink orders just going in at 12pm.  Smart server, I liked her :)  It's not cheap by far, but I certainly don't feel cheated walking out of there, the food, the atmosphere, the service, the drinks warrant the cost in my mind.  One last note (and this does not factor into my rating above, I swear!), but the first time we were there, Ewan McGregor sat right next to us at the bar.  Since Ewan McGregor goes there (and I've decided he has good taste, he sat next to us of course) and because everything above I said is true, you should go there too!",2,2,2,Sara P.,"Jersey City, NJ",326,21,36

The service was friendly and well informed about the food and drinks. Brunch: the bloody mary's were strong and had good flavor, as well as some fun little accompaniments- cornichons and sausage.  We ordered the fried chicken with honey biscuits and it was some of the best fried chicken I've ever had- crispy and flavorful.  We also ordered the fried eggs with grits, chorizo and salsa. We loved the flavors in this as well- would definitely recommend!Dinner: I brought my family here when they were visiting for the weekend, and they absolutely loved it. We tried many of the different cocktails and all were amazing. All of the food was delicious-we had the oysters and eggplant dip as starters. I had the Korean hanger steak with kimchi fried rice and found it to be creative and cooked perfectly.  I was disappointed that they did not offer the fried chicken for dinner as I had raved about it to my parents, but will hopefully be able to bring them back for brunch another time so they can try it!I would definitely recommend this place, especially for a date or for a large group of people.

Who would've thought of  putting scallion in cornbread?!?! I usually shy away from getting full on bread but  I had to make an exception with the cornbread!  Onto the entrees, I had pan seared duck and hubs had lamb.  I couldnt bring my self to try the lamb but he said it was very tender.  The seared duck with fois gras was excellent as well but there was just too much creamy polenta. I was just stuffed at that point.  Overall, the food is very tasty, staff is friendly and the semi open kitchen is a nice touch.  The bill was moderately priced for three appetizers, drinks, and two entrees.  We will definitely go back to try their brunch menu one day.",0,0,0,Olivia L.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",15,12,0

I can recommend the fried chicken- it's pretty good ( and this is coming from a Southerner who is very wary of trying fried chicken up in these parts ). The texture of the chicken is a little different than I expected, but the seasoned batter and juicy meat were delicious; as were the honey biscuits that came along with it. The french toast bananas foster was very good- highly recommended. The cornmeal pancakes fell flat for me- I will not order them again. The decor and ambience is charming and attractive.

It's true we had to settle for a 5:30 reservation on a Friday (senior citizen style), but I'd eat dinner here at 3pm if I had to. For starters, the overall feel of this place is just so up my alley. Classic decor that I would model my own home after. The bar can get a little crowded, but the bartenders are really cool down to earth people, given this establishments ""trendy"" nature. Ok, now for the food. Where do I even begin? I guess the appetizers would be a good place to start: we ordered the oysters, because, I think you have to when you come here. They were so fresh and tasty that I hardly felt compelled to smother them in hot sauce. Next we had the eggplant dip. It was definitely very good, but I think next time around I could skip it.For our meal we shared the steak tartare item under the ""Salads"" and the Spinach Rigatelli with the white veal bolognese pasta.

Coffee was decently strong.I love the restaurant interior. It's beautiful and we got to sit in a lovely little nook. We gabbed for hours. I'd like to go back to The Dutch to give it another try.

The young lady serving us was cheery and wore large, fashionable glasses. Catering to crowd and expectations, the Dutch offers bottled water as a voiced option. Tap, please.Somehow I resisted the urge to try some oysters, but I was able to snag one in my very expensive Bloody Caesar (retail price, $15): Aalborg Aquavit (accept nothing but the best?), clamato tomato and clam juice), coriander salt, and a shucked oyster topping. A bit of decadence with brunch! I was happy with my plate, too (baked eggs, barbecue short rib, and chipotle beans). Very rich and savory on account of the beans, so don't let the moderate size deceive you.Around us, pretty young shoppers, tourists, and well-dressed locals (some conveying babies in bjorns) were enjoying the afternoon.

4.0,2/11/2013,"Restaurants like The Dutch can go one of two ways. 1) It's undeniably trendy in every way imaginable - which can make for frustrating dining experiences due to sheer volume and oftentimes a pretentious atmosphere, or, 2) It's backed by an amazing chef and restauranteur - which builds high expectations that can fail to be met.Fortunately, The Dutch follows neither of those two conventions.Sure, this Soho restaurant is pretty trendy and the menu very promising - but The Dutch delivers on all fronts. The service is pleasantly cordial and attentive, everyone from the accommodating receptionist who was happy to save our table when I was running 15 minutes late for my reservation, to our friendly server who was all smiles.Their brunch menu is great, definitely more interesting and dare I say, sophisticated, than most popular brunch places in the city. The brunch menu truly is diverse, offering everything from creamy egg dishes, to Tex Mex-inspired items, and more southern dishes like the famous fried chicken with honey biscuits. Feeling a little classier? You can also order up a royal platter from their raw bar alongside a few bloody marys.As for me - I really loved the soft scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, trout roe, and toasted bagel. The scrambled eggs were perfectly cooked - creamy, buttery and wet - the way they should be. Paired with the appropriately fishy and oily roe and lox with just a smidge of creme and scallions, it was the most elegant and comforting version of lox & bagel I've ever had. The generous platter of hot fried chicken that the bf ordered was phenomenal, just as good as it's hyped up to be. Even the breast was so moist that the juices literally gushed out as he bit into it. And those honey biscuits! Perfectly flaky, buttery and their little tops glazed with that glorious honey. The surprisingly vinegary slaw served on the side was pretty nice as well, and that's coming from someone who normally doesn't care for cole slaw.I've long been a fan of Locanda Verde downtown, and I am happy to say that The Dutch is just as good as its Italian counterpart. I am certainly going to add this place to my list of Brunch favorites, and really look forward to coming back for dinner sometime soon.

4.0,1/29/2013,"A bit on the pricey side for what it is, but what it is is delicious so...if you've got some extra cash burning a hole in your pocket, definitely pop into The Dutch. I went here with some people from work for a Thursday night dinner a few weeks ago. We started with cocktails, which I have to say, was the highlight of the night. I got an ""old fashioned"" made with a lovely, smokey mezcal, vanilla bitters, and cardamom. I've been dreaming about this drink ever since and it's worth going for this cocktail alone. We carried on with oysters, which were incredibly good, fresh, and well shucked, but at $4.50 a piece, not necessarily worth the price. The pork chop was the surprise of the evening, though. One of my friend suggested we order it, and I went along, but I would never order a pork chop because I tend to think of them as dry and boring. I was proven wrong! It was incredibly tender, served alongside pork belly, and maybe one the best dishes I've ever eaten. The scallops with bacon jam were another winner, as well as the ceviche. Dessert was surprisingly good, too - the lemon doughnuts were the best. This is a great date spot or someplace to take your parents (if they're paying)!",0,0,0,Sydney K.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,348,5

4.0,1/27/2013,"A good, simple brunch place with high quality ingredients.  I think the real creativity starts at dinner but eh, I didn't like it so much to return.  Just like any other Adam Platt acclaimed place, it's expensive and hyped.  You need to make a rez here- even for brunch because it's pretty packed. You're welcome to eat at the bar but somehow that was more packed than the tables.. I came here with Buo Z at 1pm. They sat us prompty and service was overall polite and quick.  My waitress endorsed my choice of the two fried eggs with chorizo, hominy grits.  Loved that the eggs were farm fresh, and they were tasty but I've had better grits.  I prefer mine to be cheesier or honey-ir or SOMETHING. It was just bland..the little bits of salsa were meh.  The chorizo was plentiful but not spicy.. I think I just prefer my chorizo Spanish/tapa style. My friend ordered the almond stuffed french toast, didn't try it but she said it was good.  We shared the honey biscuits which look greasier than they are.  Given how much butter was visible, I'd say that it was actually a bit dry. Brunch items are in the high teens, biscuits $18.  My friend got a solid latt for $5, and I a meh glass of freshly squeezed OJ (I prefer pulp) for $4.  The prices come from the fact that this is a sceney place (in a hipster-y, downtown, Gastropubby way). I think dinner is better but eh too many places for me to try to come back. Didn't regret brunch though- it's jus not that creative for the prices.",3,2,1,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",878,1242,25

4.0,1/24/2013,"Restaurant week used to be when the mole people and working stiffs came up from the gutter to chow down on some delicious food at an affordable price. Sure, we wouldn't always make it past the door, but boy when we did, we chowed down, paid the bill and left a respectable tip if our waiter didn't gawk at our uncouth mannerisms and thread worn thrift shop items, now popularized by Macklemore and friends.Have had this place bookmarked for a while and was glad it lived up to the hype. Our party of three thoroughly enjoyed our meals. The cornbread was a nice start. The celery root soup was very healthy, and my friends' steak tartare came with heavenly toasted bread. We really must start using our toaster oven. For entrees, we ordered the short ribs and the seafood ravioli. The short ribs were divine, perfectly juicy and cooked well. The side of creamy mashed potatoes and broccoli were nice touches. Even though I could taste hints of star anise in the ravioli, *gag* the sauce was pretty good. I'd probably pass on it in the future though.For dessert, we ordered the banana cream pie and the citrus sundae. The pie came with a side of chocolate ice cream and was heavenly. The citrus was tart and refreshing.The service was spot on, but my only gripe would be that the apps and entrees could have been much warmer.

2.0,1/24/2013,"I just came back from lunch at the Dutch and I have a few things to mention.First off, this place is FREEZING.  I know its super cold outside, but almost everyone seated by the window has wearing their coats, including me.  They have a lovely corner spot in SOHO, but they need to turn up the heat a bit so people can be comfortable while enjoying their meal.  My food got cold rather quickly because of this.  ::tear::Second, their Restaurant Week menu is very limiting.  I was hoping to take advantage of this, but I can't really eat dairy so there wasn't a entree I could eat.  Even the roasted chicken is marinated in yogurt - so I had to order from the main menu.  My friend who has a gluten allergy was able to make due with some of the items, but it was disappointing.  I ordered the fried chicken, based on a recommendation from our server.  It took a really long time for my friend's first course to come out.  She got the steak tartare, which looked very pretty but it was rather uninspiring.  She ate it because she was hungry and wasn't overly impressed.When our food finally came out, 40 minutes after we ordered (mind you this is lunch and we had to be back at work at a reasonable time), we were pleased with the plating.  My fried chicken was served in a metal pan on top of a clothe napkin to soak up the grease.  There was a lot of chicken, which is great and it was crisp and tasty.  Perfectly juicy on the inside!  It was served with 2 buttered honey biscuits which were delicious.  The side of coleslaw was okay with a bit of heat from the thinly sliced jalapenos.  Its weird to just have a giant pile of fried chicken with not much else to go with it.  After a while, you don't really want to sit there and eat 4 giant pieces of fried chicken. I would recommend this dish as a way to share with a table.  I feel rather gross now after eating just two pieces with some slaw and 1 biscuit.  How about some veggies or mashed potatoes??  Even some fries would have enhanced this dish and made it a meal.  But that's just my opinion I guess.   My friend's short ribs, from the RW menu, was very fatty but she thought it was tasty.  The mashed potatoes had a ton of cheese, which she seemed to enjoy.  It was a small portion and the ribs looked more like brisket than anything else.  There weren't bones, so I don't know how these were actually short ribs. She also ordered the citrus sundae, but without the portion of it that had gluten.  For some reason this was almost an issue with the kitchen because they don't want to modify the RW menu, but they managed to do it regardless.  How nice of them to save money by not serving something that would cause physical harm to someone if they ate it.  A win, win if you ask me.  Anyhoo, our server didn't check on us and food came out VERY slowly.   It was a cute place that caters to the trendy SOHO area, but it wasn't very impressive.  If you have an hour lunch break to come here, you won't make it.  Plus, with it being so cold you'll want to get the hell out of there quickly regardless.  I'm sad at how disappointing the whole experience was.  I was SO looking forward to coming here, but alas what can one do.  Guess all the zagat hype was just that - hype.",1,0,1,Jaci H.,"Brooklyn, NY",116,301,33

2.0,1/23/2013,"So let me begin by saying I just finished watching the ""fried chicken"" episode of Top Chef. I feel vindicated that Josie was booted after Kristen was wrongfully accused of her transgressions. But I digress. Point: the fried chicken at The Dutch was unremarkable. First, the crust and honey were flavorful addition to this simple dish. However, the chicken was served warm, i.e. colder than piping hot fried chicken should be served, and it lacked salt. Actually, it  was bland. and did I mention it was kind of cold? yea, I should have had the oysters like the neighboring table and called it a day. Actually, I wish I had ordered from the Restaurant Week Month menu because that was actually what made me give this place more than 1 star. The bread was kind of tasty for an overpriced diner.I would say the price was fair for absolutely rock star fried chicken, but at $19 dollars  (pre-tax, tip, and drink) for lunch (!), it is a bit of an insult to the lip-smacking good and affordable platters available in Harlem and the outer boroughs.In the end, as I learned from Top Chef, fried chicken is not cordon bleu but is simple. Chicken, dredged, fried, seasoned, and served. For a place that seems to have developed a reputation for making ""the best"" fried chicken in town apparently this place needs more string for their chicken wings.",0,0,0,Ozzy C.,"New York, NY",141,93,1
3.0,1/21/2013,"This review is only for the Restaurant Week 2013 lunch. Starter- Bread and cornbread were amazing! Wish I had a whole basket of it.Appetizers- Celery root soup with chestnuts and hen of the woods mushrooms: I never get soup for appetizers because I'm too greedy, but I had a taste of my friend's and it was very good. Earthy and creamy.- Steak tartare with frisee salad and sourdough toast points: Great bread made the difference in this tasty but unremarkable steak tartare.Entrees- Seafood ravioli, octopus, tomato sauce: Small serving size (but it's Restaurant Week, so I understand) but both the ravioli and the slightly spicy tomato sauce it came in were cold! Not appealing. The sauce had lovely bits of octopus in it, but I wanted more. The pasta itself was also a little too thick and a little more than al dente.- Short ribs, potato puree, broccoli: Potato puree was perfectly creamy, but again the food was brought out a little cold. Short ribs cut like steak were tasty but not fall-off-the-bone tender or bursting with juiciness -- they were neither here nor there in the preparation.Desserts- Banana cream pie and chocolate ice cream. Conventionally tasty, though the crust was unappealingly thick near the end.- Citrus sundae: vanilla ice cream, citrus sorbet, caramel sauce, crumble, kumquat and orange slices. The caramel, crumble, and ice cream were delicious; the rest I could take or leave.Service was good and ambience was comfortable.

But I guess I wasn't the only one: we came at a weird time (2PM on a weekday) and there was a 45 min wait for a table... Wow. No big though, since it was just two of us, we opted to sit by the bar facing the windows -- perfect for watching those trendy, well-dressed Soho-ites. (Sohoians?) So yeah, you can either sit along the huge square bar in the middle of the Dutch, the tables around it, or the high-stool seating by the windows.Food ranged from $11-26, so not your average day-to-day grub. But at least the menu is pretty diverse, so there is something for everyone. My favorite parts of the meal were the loaf of homemade cornbread (Is that refillable? Omg like classy Olive Garden -jk) and snapper ceviche with aji amarillo and popcorn (wtheck? too cool). That cornbread + butter was SO GOOD, it just melts in your mouth. In the snapper ceviche, the textures of the snapper and the popcorn contrasted each other well. I love how they were completely saturated in the sourness flavor. The sea scallops with sunchoke, bacon jam, and meyer lemon sounded awesome on the menu, but was pretty disappointing in plating and taste. Just plain 'ole scallops yo.I thought the server would forget about us since we sat in such a random area, but he was surprisingly attentive and friendly too.This place reminds me of the Smith (in the East Village) in terms of decor and the downstairs bathroom (gorgeous), but this place is obviously more high-end, price-wise.",1,2,1,Jess C.,"New York, NY",591,305,582

3.0,1/7/2013,"After reading the rave reviews for their Fried Chicken, I decided to give it a shot and have a taste of the deliciousness myself. Sadly, I was not impressed.The good: Decently priced - $19 for half a chicken with two biscuits and small dish of coleslaw. Chicken was fried to perfection so you get a nice crispy batter (thickness was just right too) with a tender and juicy meat. The coleslaw was spiced with jalapenos and had the right kick. Honey biscuits were soft and buttery.The bad: Despite my praises for the chicken above, I could not find any taste in it. The chicken was probably not brined, but that shouldn't be a problem with the right rubs or seasonings. Unfortunately, I can mostly taste only the flour in the batter with a slight tinge of paprika (?). As I have mentioned above, the batter wasn't too thick, in fact it had an ideal amount of coat around the chicken, so I was surprised to have tasted the flour. I ended up adding their hot-sauce for more flavor.I also ordered a cup of Cappuccino which was pretty good. Creamy, mildly intense aromas. It had a slight bitterness on first taste, but ended off with a sweet and creamy note. Bare in mind that I did not add any sugar.I swore I saw at least 6 waiters on the first floor, which meant I had no problems signalling for service. They were all quite attentive and friendly.

5.0,12/1/2012,"For an awesome brunch, this is as good as NYC brunches get.  I will begin with an ode to the bloody mary.  Their bloody mary is the mother of all bloody mary(s).  Its the one that all of the other bloody marys pretend they don't want to be like, that they're not jealous of, but believe you me-they are.  They all secretly wish they too came with pickled okra, spicy salami, olives, and a little cornichon.  They too wish their friend came with a raw oyster.  They too wish they were deep, dark, rich, and very alcoholic without being overwhelming to the delicate palate of the consumer.  They do. They just pretend they don't care.Maha and I had the egg dishes, opting for something slightly lighter than the fried chicken heavenly platter I actually wanted.The food was awesome. Perfect brunch food, in fact.But the bloody mary is what deserves 5 beautiful red stars.",1,0,1,Lama B.,"Brooklyn, NY",229,592,50

4.0,11/20/2012,"Ah, I was wondering why I had already bookmarked this place. It was named one of the ten best new restaurants in New York last year in New York Magazine, and I had good luck going to two others on the list, Boulud Sud and Empellón. So when I was looking for a late dinner this past Saturday (they're open until 1AM on the weekends), I figured I'd give it a shot. Even at 11PM, it was quite a happening place with a lot of people dining toward the midnight hour and the bar quite a scene with hipsters and affluents co-mingling rather fluidly. I was a solitary diner so a bit self-conscious about having a table to myself. I was first seated at a small table between two boisterous parties of revelers, but to the credit of the hostess, I was reseated in a quieter section upon my request.The menu is mostly new jack American courtesy of Locanda Verde chef Andrew Carmellini with creative twists on tried-and-true dishes that border between audacious and absurd. Things started on a high note with an entire loaf of homemade cornbread served on a wooden plank with a ramekin of butter. It was extremely addictive in a crumbly, meltable way as I waited impatiently for my order. I think I devoured 2/3 of it before I recognized I needed to stop. I went relatively conservative with my appetizer, the $14 Local Beets, Smoked Egg and Honeycrisp Apple in Yogurt Dressing (see photo). It consisted of huge chunks of beets decorated with bits of hard-boiled egg and slices of apple in a pool of dressing. The ingredients worked well together but how could they not?My entree was a bit more daring, the $30 Korean-Style Hanger Steak presented in thick slices on what looked to be a saute pan. It was served over a mound of kimchi fried rice with a fried egg on top (see photo). Prepared medium rare, it was savory good meatiness. The waitstaff was genuinely nice and attentive, and there were quite a few of them running around. Funny thing was they thought I had been waiting a long time for the steak, but I was so preoccupied catching up on my Yelp Quick Tips that I didn't even notice the lapse. They even offered me a free dessert, which amazingly I turned down simply because my flexitarian sensibilities started to kick in around midnight. By that time, the place had quieted down considerably, and I could enjoy the low-key tavern ambiance a lot more. It's definitely worth a return visit with a group of friends when I'm back in the village.FOOD - 4 stars...creative executions on abundant comfort food dishesAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...a hipster haven that gets back its clubby tavern vibe close to midnightSERVICE - 4.5 stars...very nice and attentive...thanks for thinking about meTOTAL - 4 stars...do people go Dutch at the Dutch?",9,5,6,Ed U.,"San Francisco, CA",4522,4629,37977

Not to be too dramatic here, but it's the best turkey sandwich I've ever had and I dream of it often.- Fried oyster sandwiches - I could easily eat 4 of 5 of these but usually only order 1 so that I can leave room for the rest of my meal.

4.0,10/24/2012,"The Dutch - Delicious American eatery with a thoughtfully unique brunch menuBottom line:  American eatery with a thoughtfully unique brunch menu.Tips:    Try an order of biscuits on the side    Great for fueling up before shopping in Soho!    The iced coffee comes in a jarAbout:  I think the street that The Dutch is on is one of my favorite streets in the city.  Sullivan street between Prince and Houston is quaint, neighborhoody and quiet.... and just steps from the bustling Greenwich Village and Soho.  My cousin Alison is a regular at The Dutch and said I had to try it out for brunch... obviously.Food/Drinks:  The menu at The Dutch is a mix of sweet and savory dishes that have a traditional base (poached eggs, French toast) with a unique twist to intrigue the palette.  In addition to a full brunch menu, there is also a rather large oyster selection if that's to your taste.-Honey butter biscuits - As we sat down, my cousin ordered a side of biscuits for the table - great way to kick off the meal, let me tell you! An order comes with three warm biscuits topped with a honey butter glaze.  They are delicious alone but even better with a shmear of jam or butter that comes with the order.-Cornmeal flapjacks - Very yummy!  I like how the traditionally sweet dish had a bit of a savory taste from the cornmeal and the salted butter that comes on the side.  Also, the blueberry syrup was such a nice taste in combination with the flapjacks, and I liked that it had whole blueberries mixed in.-Poached eggs on a biscuit - A cheddar biscuit to be precise, along with thinly sliced ham and chipotle sauce drizzled on top.  This dish was a mix of southern comfort and American classic. The eggs had the right amount of gooey yolk in the center that the cheddar biscuits seeped up after breaking the egg (the best part). The saltiness from the prosciutto was a nice complement to the eggy/biscuit combo. A great way to start a Saturday.-Iced coffee - I've never seen this before... the cold brew comes in a jar, pre-made.  It is pretty strong and wasn't bad but didn't have the freshly brewed taste that I prefer.  But I certainly recommend trying it ... come on, it's coffee in a jar!Atmosphere:  Pumpkins everywhere!  I love the fall and everything that comes along with it, so when I saw the display of pumpkins and gourds throughout the restaurant, I was pretty excited (even though it was a freakishly warm fall day when we went).  The simple, understated decor was a perfect fit for this quiet block, but the minimal colors and decorations were clearly thoughtful.  The service was good except we received our main dishes almost immediately after we received our appetizer of biscuits, so we felt a bit rushed.  Overall a very friendly, welcoming atmosphere at The Dutch.",1,1,1,Stacy S.,"Manhattan, NY",3,13,1

3.0,10/15/2012,"Went for dinner last night with mixed expectations. We ordered the beet salad with smoked egg, lobster cocktail, sea scallops, pappardelle with oxtail and ravioli. The service was kind of slow throughout the whole dinner. It took a long, long time for the main entrees to arrive. The server apologized, but it was just as long, after the server apologized. The beet salad was good, but the egg wasn't noticeable smoked. The lobster cocktail was interesting and arrived in the half lobster carcass, making it a neat presentation. The sea scallops were okay, but cold. They were cooked, but the dish had cooled off so much by the time it arrived to the table that no matter how heavy the plate, it couldn't possibly hold onto the heat. I'm sad to say, I've had better elsewhere. It was rather disappointing. The pappardelle with oxtail had also cooled off. It was eating cold pasta and non slippery. No wonder the noodles were al dente - they were cold! Overall the play was okay. I wish the experience and food was better. The highlight of the meal was the dessert. The apple concord pie was end of summer captured in a slice. The poached pear was also really good. Poached pears can start tasting the same, but this had a brightness and some additional crunch from almond.Loud. Slow service.

4.0,10/12/2012,"For me, The Dutch deserves any buzz that it gets. I've gone for both lunch and dinner, and while the clientele is obnoxious, the good food, creative menu, competent service, and comfortable but dressed-up decor overshadows any negatives. My latest experience was lunch, and I tried the pine-nut hummus sandwich with heirloom tomatoes and thinly sliced cucumbers. This was served open-faced, and was exceptional. The heirloom tomatoes couldn't be more juicy, and it was as if they were singing their last big major chord of the symphony, as summer glides away. Every table receives a loaf of chipotle corn bread, which comes out warm and buttery, and becomes even more creamy and decadent when you spread butter on it. I also like that they usually have a twist on Japanese food on their menu. From deconstructed okonomiyaki to a sashimi-grade tuna burger, it's good that they didn't just settle for easy western food. I guess that is their menu goal though: to take something comfortable and expected and twist it to become more interesting.",2,1,1,Meghan A.,"New York, NY",235,593,533

But if you're a fan of cornbread, this is right up your alley. And the honey biscuits taste just like those from the south (maybe better). I have also had their fried chicken. The chicken is very crispy (and fatty), which I'm not a huge fan of, but is very tender on the inside. Most people I've brought here usually enjoy the french toast as well. It's a very different take on french toast. I believe they soak it in the sauce overnight. I am not a huge fan but I think it's only because I prefer traditional french toast.

2.0,8/21/2012,"My wife and I made reservations for the Dutch several months in advance, as last time we visited this establishment on a whim we were told that was the notice needed.  The service was very good, although we had a fairly significant wait between second course and entree.  Unfortunately if you are going to pay top tier prices for food, you should get top tier food, I can honestly say I was quite disappointed.  We shared spicy lamb tacos, which although spicy lacked flavor and substance.  When the main course finally arrived the chicken and pork dishes were both dry, the potatoes under done, and the chili cheese grits (although great) lacked chili.  Both my wife and I had our dishes packed up without finishing and left early.  My dog on the other hand, he rates the pork chop 5 stars, but I one time saw him eat poop.",1,0,1,Patrick S.,"PECK SLIP, NY",0,8,0
5.0,8/20/2012,"Of all the places we went to during my weekcation in New York, The Dutch is one of the places I will miss the most.We came here during the afternoon and saw that The Dutch was participating in the NYC Restaurant Week. For about $25, you can get three hearty courses. Considering we were in New York, this was a steal.I decided to get a mango gazpacho-like soup garnished with lobster meat and greens as my appetizer, a texas toast brisket sandwich as my entree and a lovely peach melba sundae for dessert.What I got was much (thank goodness) better than what I expected, especially for a prix fixe menu.The soup was outrageously unique, yet so refreshing and good. It's this blended mixture that's cold and a little sweet, but it works as a fragrant dressing for the lobster and greens that come with it. Really quite good.Then there's the texas toast sandwich. The brisket was... wow. Tender and melty and so, so good. I stuffed some of the coleslaw into the sandwich and boy, was that a sandwich I could eat over and over again.Finally, the sundae. WOW. I thought it would be nauseatingly sweet. It wasn't. It was a peach sorbet on top of vanilla ice cream with some salty-sweet cookie crumbles and probably one of the best desserts I've ever had. Even though I was busting at the seams, I ate that whole darn sundae and even licked the glass bowl it came in clean.And might I say it again... $25?!?! Crazy! I was full and extremely happy. But here's the million dollar question: Would I go back again? To be honest, I really don't know. Judging from some of the Yelp reviews, it seems like we were really lucky. We did not have to wait for a table. The service was excellent. The food was divine. The prices were very reasonable. If I go back here again, I'll be expecting a meal equal to or perhaps better than the one I had here (which I find almost impossible).But regardless, I love this place. I can't get over it.",2,2,2,Sara C.,"Seattle, WA",789,614,858
2.0,8/19/2012,"The Dutch is a very annoying concept for someone who enjoys a good meal.  The food isn't bad - its actually pretty good.  The problem is the random system they have in place for making people wait for no reason before seating them.  Its sort of like when you're made to wait outside of a nightclub when its empty inside because the owners want the line outside to be long - giving the illusion of exclusivity.  On that note: here's my saga from last night: I arrived at 8:00 with my wife and we notified the three annoying hostess girls that the other two members of our party would be arriving shortly.  They told us they couldn't actually begin our wait until they arrived, which, unfortunately, wasn't till 8:45.  Once they did arrive, they told us we could have a table in an hour and a half, taking us out to 10:15.  A quick glance around the restaurant showed it was crowded but not that crowded and many people were on dessert.  So it was sort of a stupid thing to say to a group of people with brains and eyes.  They did tell us it might be sooner and big surprise we were seated at 9:30.The table they gave us was right near the kitchen and in the way of the busy servers, so we asked for one of the several tables which wasn't right in front of the kitchen and one of the annoying little hosts came back out to half-smile and tell us they were reserved, which was clearly a lie as they were still empty when we left.  Its this sort of nonsense that made me dislike The Dutch before we even ordered. Our order: oysters (delicious) lamb tacos (pretty good) chicken entree (delicious) raviolis (OK) and trout (pretty good).  The peanut butter pie and sorbet were both pretty good as well.  Drinks are solid with a good whiskey menu and decent wines. More general comments about the experience: the service was a little slow, its loud for no reason inside, they forgot to bring out the fries and corn, and the prices are high for what it is.Overall the only thing I will take away from this experience were the annoying hostess girls and silly waiting process.  The Dutch has lost the business of a true foodie with plenty of cash to burn.  I certainly doubt the chef intended this kind of experience for his customers.",7,0,0,russell b.,"New York, NY",37,116,0

3.0,8/12/2012,"Best fried chicken in the city? 19 USD worthy? Questionable. Debatable. I did enjoy the nice thick, crunchy crust which was at least twice dipped in a lovely batter. Similar to KFC extra crispy fried chicken but better. The fried chicken came out piping hot and as juicy as it could be! The meat was not tough and kept hot until completely devoured. It was hard to let go, some scorched fingertips resulted. I would have liked some seasoning and a dash of salt for taste, but the intention may have been to enjoy the fried chicken in its natural and least unadulterated state. 3 1/2 Star territory.Super secret fried chicken spot: For a thinner crusted fried chicken check out Tanuki Tavern albeit with smaller portions and similar pricing it's just so darn good! Don't neglect that lemon!Accompanied Sides:The honey biscuits were soft and light without sticking to your teeth, just fine as far as biscuits go.The coleslaw was swimming in its watery sauce and otherwise unremarkable.Dessert: 10 USD. Agreeable portions.Peach-Verbena sorbet was refreshing but may remind others of body lotion.Salted lime pie had a lovely thick crust but the key lime pie itself was just alright - the soft texture may have threw me off. The accompanying sorbet was very refreshing and the flavor unexpectedly pleasing. Peanut butter icebox pie comes with an interestingly flavored ice on the same plate - like it or hate it. The flavor just didn't make any sense to me.Other remarks:RW halibut was done just fine with abundant flavors which was a nice surprise. The accompanying salad was large and had a nice presentation. Pass on the watery iced tea, also it's mostly ice. For 4 USD - they could at least make it taste good. Also, their cocktail was not made on it's best day.Service was very good. The waiter was knowledgeable.  Noise level was low for lunch. Good looking crowd. Lighting was moderately bright from the large windows which I liked. Tables were spacious and some were somewhat close to each other, but not cramped.Extras: Restrooms are downstairs, left of the entrance.

3.0,8/11/2012,"This is a review of Restaurant Week lunch: Honestly I was expecting their selection to be better than it was. Be that as it may, the food itself was good, nothing to rave about, but good. The standout for me was the Orecchiette, which of course comes with bacon, as all dishes should.  This was a huge bowl of yummy pasta, with tons of flavor, and even a little spice to it, which was perfect. I wasn't really a huge fan of the salad, to start, but the Orecchiette totally made up for it. Man was that stuff good. My gf got the brisket, which seems like a 2 person job just to handle, let alone eat! Needless to say, she took most of it home.For dessert We all got the peach melba sundae, which was good, but again, seemed a bit too dessert-like for me to really appreciate. With that said, 3.5 stars for this spot.

The cucumber soup was my favorite because it was chilled, something that was perfect for a hot Summer day. Overall, it seemed that everyone enjoyed with the choices they got from the RW special.

2.0,7/15/2012,"It's simple. Classical chefs never do ""downtown"" restaurants well. Daniel? Great restaurant. DBGB? Lame. Same for the Dutch. Its quest for comfort food in a hip room just doesn't hit the mark.Andrew Carmellini was a highly respected chef at uptown spots like Cafe Boulud and Lespinasse. After A Voce, Locanda Verde was a home run, and despite rustic food, it was executed like a higher end operation, with a slightly casual feel.The Dutch's problem is the food. Steak tartare is bland and has chopped caesar salad on top (?!), the Burrata was ruined by cherries and mint, and a turkey sandwich at $16 was nothing special.The fried chicken however, was very good. Although its plating in a large oval All-Clad pan is a rookie move that Scott Conant--another uptown guy who failed at doing comfort food--did at the long gone Faustina. ATTENTION CHEFS: If you serve a dish in a stainless or cast iron pan, THE FOOD SHOULD BE COOKED IN IT!In conclusion, it's just OK, and if you're in the 'hood, go to the bar at Raoul's or Blue Ribbon.

We also shared a sweet pea (or something) salad, the steak tartare and the american buffalo salad.....not so great. The tartare was so bad we sent it back. It was warm and tasted like mayonnaise after it had been sitting on the counter for 20 minutes. The American buffalo thing was an interesting twist to the traditional, but honestly delicious cheese smothered in what was basically BBQ sauce? Some may consider this innovative or unique. I think it is just wrong! The other salad, not sure what to say about it except it was just boring. There is a similar dish at The Nomad  that is a little more my speed.

3.0,7/11/2012,"The DutchUpdated for Restaurant Week: 3 StarsCame here for Winter 2013 restaurant week lunch. I was really looking forward to coming back after we visited last summer for brunch and enjoyed the food. We were late for our reservation and while they gave us a hard time about not seating us if we were later than 15 past rezzie time when we called to let them know we would be running late, they thankfully did not hassle us at the door. we were seated in the bar room and service was prompt and efficient. i got the RW set menu and selected steak tartare, short ribs, and banana cream pie. my bf got the fried chicken that i had our previous trip. see my original review for my raves about the fried chick, biscuits, and coleslaw. all still goes! unfortunately the RW items were not nearly as good. my tartare was a generous portion size but lacked flavor. the mustard on the side helped but otherwise it was very bland. also i would have prefered a harder / more toasted bread option than the lightly grilled sourdough that accompanied the tartare. the short ribs were actually a bit tough. i had to use a steak knife to cut through which i cant recall ever being the case with short ribs before. they also had a very smokey flavor which was okay but almost overpowering and made me feel more like i was eating a bbq sandwich at a tailgate than quality short ribs at a good restaurant in NYC. at least i love bbq sandwiches at tailgates so it wasnt a complete fail. one other note, even though it is freezing outside, they had an air conditioner / fan that would cycle on and off every 10-15 minutes that would blow freezing air right on me. not very pleasant and even after my bf switched seats with me i was still shivering every time it came on. still recommend the dutch, just dont bother with the RW menu-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original Review: 4 StarsWhat we ate: Fried chicken with honey biscuits and coleslawSoft scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, roe, and sesame bagelPastry board with blue cheese scone, berry muffin, and curry sugar doughnutOn a recent random Sunday, we decided we wanted to try a new place out for brunch. I'll be the first to admit we generally focus on the boozy options around the city to take advantage of unlimited mimosas, bloody mary, and sangrias. But on this particular Sunday, we were out to try somewhere new that had less of a boozy persuasion, and we settled on the Dutch.We called (they only take reservation by phone) the morning of and got a reservation towards the end of brunch. Upon arrival, we were seated immediately and got very attentive service from the wait staff. We started with some coffee and a pastry board. I wasn't as interested in the pastry board as I had a feeling the main courses would be more than enough food, but we went ahead with it anyway (we were skipping the booze for the day after all). The pastry board included a blue cheese scone, berry muffin, and a curry sugar doughnut. I was surprised to find that the blue cheese scone was my favorite. It had a very subtle hint of blue cheese and was the savory portion of the board. The berry muffin and doughnut were both also delicious and very well made. The board also came with whipped butter and strawberry jam which went best with the muffin. Next we moved on to our main courses. I got the fried chicken which came with 4 pieces (ill let you guess what the 4 were), 2 honey biscuits, and some coleslaw. It came out piping hot in a steel pan. A simple presentation to go with a simple preparation - it was delicious. The chicken was so hot I could barely get into it without burning my fingers, though that didn't stop me. The chicken was dusted with a seasoning that had a bit of a kick to it, but that paired really nicely with the sweet honey biscuits. I had to enlist some help to polish off the whole dish (which is rare for me and fried chicken), and I would order it again without hesitation. We also got a dish that seemed to be very popular with tables around us (not to say the fried chicken wasn't). The soft scrambled eggs were so good! We only wish we could figure out how to replicate them at home! I didn't try the smoked salmon and bagel part of the dish as I am definitely more of a fried chick and biscuits gal, but the whole egg dish disappeared really quickly so I can only assume it was all very good like the eggs. Overall: really good spot to grab a casual, booze light brunch on a weekend.

3.0,7/8/2012,"Having heard so much about this place I was a bit disappointed in real time. I think it may be a bit more trendy than actually great. The decor was beautiful, the bar looked very nice, the lighting terrific. Noise level pretty high. We sat across from the bar, I was on the banquette and my husband on a chair across from me. I was in the direct path of the AC blower. For me that is a GREAT place to be as I love it to be chilly, however the vent blew so hard our table and the one next to us couldn't have lit candles on our tables.The service was very attentive, maybe too much so. I do like down time with my dinner partner for conversation without interruptions by multiple busboys, multiple food servers, food runners, bar staff, etc. Overall we had 8 different people serving us!  It is a bit much. If I had so much as a tiny crumb on the table from eating the corn bread someone swooped in and wiped down the table, rearranging everything as they did. As we each lifted the oyster sandwiches off the plate and while still in mid air the plate they came on was whisked away. The oyster selection was much smaller than I expected. Also surprising was that the combo plates listed clams, however they were not on the menu separately. Our waitress (the first one) did get them for us though. The steak tartare was good, but the chips on the plate were soggy. The little oyster sandwiches were good and the asparagus app good as well. We had the halibut as our main course and the fish itself was very good and tasty (a bit dry in the middle) , but the rice, broth and mushrooms didn't add very much in the way of flavor to the plate.",0,0,0,Margaret F.,"Long Island, NY",27,81,69

3.0,7/5/2012,"Andrew Carmellini has made quite a name for himself in this town. He has trained in the kitchens of San Domenico and Lespinasse, as well as spending time cooking in Italy, France, and England. He was Le Cirque's opening sous chef and then the chef de cuisine of Café Boulud. That was followed by the launch of A Voce Madison and his first Michelin star. Finally he opened Locanda Verde in 2009 and has since been a household name. Unfortunately his latest venture The Dutch suffers from being overly hyped and yet failing to deliver quality and memorable food consistently. Indeed, the best thing about The Dutch is the beautifully built space. Designed by Roman + Williams, the team that designed the Ace Hotel and the Standard Hotel, the space is elegant and reflective of its SoHo environs in the harmonious use of contemporary and traditional elements of design. The front dining room's center piece is the double bar, one side of which is allocated to serving the current hot item in New York, oysters. The bar is gorgeous to look at and the decorative pieces enhance the atmosphere. With claims of cooking with American roots in mind it's a bar with an impressive selection of whiskey. The cocktails, however, shy away from said liquor so feel free to order something off the menu. Tables are placed along the wall and the large windows are open during good weather. The dark wood and warm color palette complements the custom-made brass and hand-blown glass light fixtures well and the room is airy and lends itself to a rather boisterous crowd. If the noise level here is too much, fret not, there's another dining room at back. Here, the ceiling is lower, the lights dimmer, and the leather banquettes cozier. Reserve a table here if you want the chance to engage in intimate exchanges.Unfortunately, the menu itself is one that sounds better on paper than upon execution. The oyster selection is small and unimpressive. Really, when there are only 4 kinds of oysters to choose from a restaurant's claim as an oyster bar hardly succeeds. They claim to cook what makes them happy, that is casual, American comfort food. Yet half the dishes reflect an obvious attempt by Chef Carmellini to exhibit his skills at fine cuisine. The kampachi appetizer for example is plated beautifully and the subtle flavors are delicious but the portion is miniscule and disproportionate to its price tag. Among the entrees, the sea scallops sounded promising but was forgettable. And the much-raved about 'white boy' pork ribs and rabbit pot pie are no longer on the menu. The pasta fares better as the black fettuccine was delicious and the ricotta ravioli is a big crowd pleaser. Over all, it's not quite what you would expect from a chef who has trained far and wide and even garnered well-deserved accolades for his work. The dishes lack that magical quality that makes you erupt in foodgasmic expressions. Nor do they trigger that heart-warming feeling true comfort food is supposed to evoke.",4,0,1,Ryna D.,"New York, NY",227,1549,2438

4.0,6/19/2012,"I had been wanting to try The Dutch for a couple months now, but could never get a reservation. Before a concert at City Winery, we strolled in on Monday at 6:30PM, and instantly got a table for four. The decor is intimate and really unique. It's a great date spot (or double date in our case). We had a couple questions about the Spanish wine, and the sommelier came over to chat with us. He was so knowledgeable, and recommended a great (and relatively inexpensive) bottle of wine.We ordered the Black Fettuccine, the Ravioli, the Korean Hanger steak, and a side of potatoes. I personally had the Ravioli. It was melt in your good. The flavors were simple, but perfect. I didn't get to try anyone else's dish, because, they were gone instantly. The potatoes however, were weird. They had a very strong dill taste, and I can't think what they would compliment.

4.0,6/15/2012,"This is one of the few place in NYC I will continue to visit ..... as long as the food stays amazing! In the past, I'd find restaurants with wonderful food the first time around, but less then expected quality the second time around. It could be that the chefs aren't consistent or the cooking staff doesn't write down recipes ... Regardless finding a place that has wonderful plates of food time and time again are special and of course i  going to give them the praise they deserve!The Dutch ALWAYS has the same wonderful dining atmosphere, quality in food, adventurous cocktails and great WAITING service. The menu does change from time to time but that is the beauty of this great restaurant. Adventure through food is a great treat if you're willing! The foodies, locals and tourist eating at this establishment are all beautiful, classy and fun .... Which is perfect since the waiting staff is exactly the same! My tip for those seeking a great dinner, try the MUST HAVE for dinner: Rabbit Pot Pie!!!!!!!!  I know what some of you might be thinking... Bugs bunny in a pie, I could never!!! But the presentation alone should win you over right away! The pastry on top of the bowl/plate is big and dramatic. When you finally break thought the golden crust, the aroma of rabbit, gravy and vegetables is intoxicating! Please try this! Rabbit is tastier then you think!Currently they have a summertime lunch menu that offers 3 courses for $28!!!!! It's an AMAZING STEAL!!!! I got a large sweet watermelon salad, pasta and a chocolate desert all for $28!!!! And I didn't mention that the meal also comes with a loaf of yummy warm loaf of cornbread. The waitress also informed me that the menu changes weekly- depending on ingredients in season... That to me says a lot. The restaurant is expanding culinary and it well worth it! The bar specializes is ""mixed drinks"" ... Which means a good ass quality buzz!!!! The drinks alone are a great reason to come to the Dutch (plus the bartenders are cute in little vest!)Those are the pros... Here are the cons .....that only let me give this great establishment 4 stars and not 5......  The female hostess are snotty, inattentive and aloof. The service at the front hostess desk never matches the friendly bartenders and waiting staff. I think they are hiring cute girls rather then people with experience in customer service bc they THINK it will improve their income BUT they are bitchy and whatcha gonna do! Deal with the cute snotty hostess to get a great meal and restaurant experience.... It's up to you... But I will tell you this.... As a NYC foodie, I'll deal with a snotty bitch for the Dutch's truly delicious meals!!!!!!!!!!(especially since at the end of the day ...

2.0,6/7/2012,"NY Times/ Mag recommendation = Fail. Do not trust what those guys say, they do not know food. Use Yelp instead. Went to the Dutch for late night dinner after reading rave reviews of it by the food critic illuminati so was expecting some exceptional fare. Never was I so disappointed. This is the typical place where the chef wants to get too eclectic/ experimental and comes crashing down to the ground. If you're the type to fall for exotic-sounding menu items and (a) don't care about the actual taste plus (b) don't mind dropping a pretty penny then try this place out, otherwise I can give you a ton of recommendations for way better New American food. We started out with the kampachi in salsa verde and champagne mango (see? that's a mouthful of words before you even get to the actual eating): for some reason the chef decided to put tortilla chips on the kampachi slices, so my appetizer reminded me of doritos; unfortunately, the various ingredients didn't blend very well either, so my first bite tasted like a tortilla chip, my second only of coriander, and my third was just lemon. Not that nice. Went on to get the black sea bass on crispy rice in a mushroom-yuzu broth (waiter recommendation): sounded delightful, tasted like, well... nothing. Bass, as all white fish, needs subtle flavoring to get the taste buds working - the seasoning on this fish was pretty tasteless though, and the broth had only slightly more flavor than hot water. the ""crispy"" rice was soaked in the broth so it really was all mushy, and the whole thing just turned out to be a sloppy, watery mess. My dinner companion's ravioli also were very unexciting. We had wine by the glass - a chardonnay and a chenin blanc, at $15 ranking in the middle of the tiny wine list - and they were both barely drinkable, cheap wines that you could buy a bottle of in a liquor store at less than the price of a glass here. At least the waiter was nice and offered us a complimentary key lime pie which was excellent and the only redeeming feature of the whole dining experience (it was offered free to us because he could see my expressions of displeasure throughout the meal).

While it is on the smaller side, it didn't feel too cramped for a party of about 15. It is gorgeous, dark and cozy and feels like you are a guest in someone's home. We had a cocktail hour to start, which I always love. The best thing about this PDR is the bar. Your private dining experience comes with it's own full bar and bartender. Not a makeshift set up in the corner, but an actual built in bar, fully stocked. Favorite cocktail was the Miss Ellie. After we sat, the pre-fixe menu came out family style. Oysters were incredibly fresh! The oyster sandwiches were also awesome, juicy and delicious. Most of what we had is no longer on the menu, as it changes seasonally. However, my favorite entree, the Pecan Duck with Dirty Rice still is!! The fries are also very good. Service was impeccable. The waiter was cute and the chef came out to say hello. We also had a late joiner who missed the first courses of oysters and the little oyster sandwiches. Within minutes of him sitting down, a half dozen more oysters and a little sandwich came out for him. Little things like this make all the difference.

5.0,4/24/2012,"See the blog for my review.  I hate to rave hype spots, but I ended up here twice in one day.  High point dishes below.  Service was spot on, to boot.For ""Hot Fried Chicken, Honey Butter Biscuits"" I have to admit I did not anticipate a half of a chicken, two biscuits, and slaw - overall I was glad to share not because I didn't have room, but because all I really wanted to do was see if it lived up to the hype, something two pieces would easily accomplish.Opting first to taste the slaw as it is generally not something I fancy while friend stated she loved it my one bite was sufficient - crisp, creamy, a touch of sweet and a bit of acid...just as expected, but essentially just filler.  Moving next to the chicken - okay, I'll admit, it was pretty excellent; golden brown, crunchy coating giving way to juicy meat, and just a touch of salt and spice to make it memorable.  It was as good as any Amish fried chicken I've ever tasted, though perhaps not quite as lovely as the version at Central Michel Richard...a side by side taste test would be necessary to decide.  Rounding out the plate, and thankfully deemed ""too much bread"" by my friend, the honey butter biscuits needed no side-by-side at all.  Dense, buttery, flaky, and sweet I can't think of any that I've tasted that can compare.  They were the best non-pastry bread I had on this trip to New York, Per Se and EMP included.With regard to dessert, only pies are offered at lunch, and while I certainly do not claim to be a pie maven and fully admit that 99 times out of 100 I will order cake, pudding, ice cream, or otherwise instead this Dutch Apple Pie was pretty damned good.  Beginning first with the apples - cooked but still snappy, sweet but balanced by the sour cream, warm and loaded with cinnamon - they were quite good, but where this dish really shined was the crust; a crisp, buttery, and flaky shell beyond reproach topped off with cinnamon crumble and paired with creamy buttered walnut ice cream and candied walnuts...it was a dish that made me think that just maybe I should consider pie more often...maybe.Returning later in the day with a different friend, ostensibly for drinks, two more desserts were ordered.  The first, ""Forbidden Rice Pudding"" climbed to a spot just behind the rice pudding at Chez L'Ami Jean for best all time.  Featuring black rice and its expected savory notes cooked to texture just short of creamy at its base and topped in rum-tinged syrup before being finished with shredded coconut and chopped pineapple, mango, and passion fruit plus crushed macadamia nuts there really wasn't a single bite of this dish that tasted the same as the last and adding in the coconut sorbet to smooth the substantially sweet fruits was a beautiful touch.  Even as someone who generally does not order fruit based desserts I found myself raving and not-so-secretly sort of glad when my friend deferred an offered taste.Moving on to the second dessert, and perhaps the restaurant's most well known, the ""Devil's Food Cake"" would sit waiting while I finished the warm rice pudding and with my friend quite willing to give this one a taste or three we were both impressed, though for myself certainly less so than with the rice pudding.  Featuring a dark, dense chocolate cake topped with black pepper icing, fudge sauce, and layers of chocolate mousse and ganache between the three cake layers the cake itself would prove a perfect match for the coffee while the light peppery hint was just detectable on the lips.  Served alongside and atop a pile of chocolate crumbles - white Russian ice cream...delicious, boozy, and creamy as the namesake drink...the dude would definitely abide and having said what I did earlier about  considering pie more often, sure, provided there is no cake or rice pudding.",4,1,2,Michael U.,"Las Vegas, NV",3078,4441,99554

The other bar being the one with alcohol. I swear within 30 minutes, the whole restaurant filled up with other dining patrons so for future reference I would advise making a reservation.One of many reasons I enjoy eating at the bar area, especially in sushi restaurants, is the social aspect. I met a friendly older couple from Australia who ended up giving me a taste of their entree and we shared dessert. The oysters were good- I guess. And the food was decent, but in no way exceptional. I overheard that the pie is supposedly very good there.The restaurant sits on corner of a busy street and has large glass windows that seemed like they might open come summer. I imagine it would be a great place to come for a late afternoon bite or glass of wine, enjoy a summer breeze and watch the crowds mosy on by.",2,0,4,HL M.,"Los Angeles, CA",94,76,20
1.0,4/1/2012,This place is expensive overrated rude and snotty staff and a really poor brunch for $16 you dont even get a piece of toast with you eggs.Coffee is weak and waiters are really unfriendly like if you are bothering them for beeing there.,1,0,0,Mia B.,"PRINCE, NY",4,7,0
3.0,4/1/2012,I had heard a lot of praise of the Dutch so expectations where fairly high. We knew it was popular so made reservations and it was probably a wise choice. A lot of people waiting for tables when we arrived but we were promptly showed to our table. The service was friendly but still very professional.For starter I went for the wagyu beef tataki - decent but not more. It was way over-priced for what I got. The five-grain salad was a much better starter (both from price and taste perspective). We went on to have the pecan duck and the wood grilled chicken. The pecan duck was excellent but it could have been even better if they would have gone easier on the 'pecan'. The Chicken was a lot of food but not anything special so would not really recommend it (nothing wrong with it but could have been served at any restaurant).The wine list is pretty good but we actually went for some local beer instead. The beer selection was pretty good and we got good recommendations to go with our food. We did have room for dessert and had the banana cream pie and the Dutch Apple Pie. The banana cream pie was very good and can be highly recommended. The Dutch Apple Pie was way too sweet and the sugary flavor was over-powering everything else - the chefs should really learn how to make a proper apple pie so avoid at all costs.As can be seen from what we thought of the food it was a bit up and down. Some things were very good and some were just good (and others like the apple pie actually bad). The thing not mentioned is the atmosphere - it really has a nice feel to it and comes not only from the layout and design but also from the staff and the guests. Really felt like a nice place to hang out so would probably visit again but perhaps then not with the expectation to eat great food. An extra plus for serving some very good coffee (Stumptown).,0,0,0,Mathias H.,"Stockholm, Sweden",236,931,2803

From the Oyster apps, to the freakin best cornbread I've ever had, to a chopped salad I had no clue of all the ingredients - it was a huge hit!

I was sad to see the kale carbonara gone on the menu's latest iteration (and brussels sprouts!) but yadda yadda seasonal whatever. Almond french toast is great, though I usually regret sweet brunch, and you can't really go wrong with egg dishes. Also, personal preference, but I love how the room looks during daytime. The scallops are a personal favorite--great mix of salty, sweet, and spicy, with the scallops themselves cooked perfectly. I would also recommend the duck and ravioli. And the fries--oh, the fries. While I love reacting against things that seem to be overhyped, these are well worth it--they're crispy and soft at the same time, salty and yet not at all greasy. Not one bit.

3.0,3/28/2012,"I want to start off by saying that the food and wait staff are amazing.  The reason for my a-ok rating is because of the bartenders.  My husband and I had reservations and were waiting for another guest so we decided to have a drinks.  It is a very small bar, not crowded at the time, had 3 bartenders, how bad could it be? Well my soda was flat and I tried to get the bartenders attention, he ignored us so we asked another bartender, well that bartender was clearly annoyed and just gave a glass no ice and half filled it!!  My husband wanted another drink and had to struggle to get anyone's attention.  Small bar, 3 bartenders, not crowded...what is wrong with this picture? Is that a hint that they don't want our business? When we sat down @ our table I was prepared for the worst but am happy to report that the experience was wonderful.  We had the peel and eat shrimp, lobster cocktail, cracked jonah crabs, american burrata,  and oyster sandwiches to start; they were exceptional.  Our entrees were just as good; sea scallops and striped bass.  Our waitress recommended the fries to add to our heirloom cauliflower; great choice.  Loved our dining experience but I would not go back based on our experience at the bar.  So please go for the food, you won't be disappointed, stay away from the bar!",0,0,0,May Ling L.,"Huntington, NY",0,5,0

5.0,3/26/2012,"Rarely will I ever be found having brunch on weekends, as it is easier to find excuses to stay in bed until midday.  But for an out-of-town guest and an unusual brunch proposition, I reluctantly agreed.  Said brunch proposition fell through and with a sudden gap in the itinerary and a brunch place needed (and no excuses for not going), I suggested The Dutch.  I am already enamored with Locanda Verde, an outsized love that is surely more than the sum of its parts, and was long overdue to try Andrew Carmellini's newer restaurant.  So on a sunny Sunday morning, we found ourselves in pleasant west Soho.  Stepping into the wood-paneled antechamber that overlooks one of the dining rooms and bars, I liked the place immediately.  Flooded with natural light bouncing off white washed brick, it has a retro, classic look with rustic woods, dark leather banquettes, brass and globe lighting fixtures, with blue tiling at their bars.  With reservations on hand, we checked in and were seated.  Wait staff were efficient, friendly, and energetic.Deciding what to order was probably the most difficult task at hand.  And since three people can't sample most of the menu, I will have to go back (no, probably not for brunch, which fortunately plunders many items from their lunch, dinner, and late night menus).A Bloody Mary and a Bloody Caesar arrived first.  Similar in hue, with sediment, and a tall celery stalk, but comprised of entirely different spirits, spices, and the shucked oyster on the Caesar.  And oh yes, these were fantastic.  It seems the cocktail making prowess I've heard about is true.A freshly made pastry board of donut, scone, and muffin arrived on a cutting board; a medley that remains the same but the flavors change daily.  Sweets are not my thing early in the day, and I've yet to like a scone, but after this pastry board and sampling the cocktails, I couldn't stop smiling.  Great pastries, incredible donut.Next came the Sullivan Platter, a two-tier seafood platter with about 8 oysters, 6 little necks, 6 bay scallops with blood orange, small bowls of uni in their juice, kampachi chunks with herbs, and 5 big shell-on shrimp with red remoulade.  Quantities may be misquoted, we were too busy delighting in the very fresh seafood to do a proper inventory.  Would note scallops were somewhat overwhelmed by the blood orange flavor, and personal bias in favor of uni served ""dry"" rather than in its juices, but otherwise, the speed at which we finished the platter about matched how much we liked it.And for the grand finale, out came six dishes, a combination of appetizers, brunch items, and sides.  The gloriously beefy wagyu tataki, beautifully arranged on a textured, glass plate (almost incongruous with the retro, comfort food style), touched with wasabi, showered with scallions and daikon, refreshing and earthy.  Hot fried chicken, which isn't the Nashville specialty I thought of first, is a well-made version with very crispy, light batter and juicy meat, but suffers from the common not-enough-flavor chicken issue.  Their sublime house bottled hot sauce (not for sale!) fixed that.  I never got to the lacquered honey butter biscuits but the cole slaw was an excellent version, neither very sour nor creamy.  An interesting Mexican-inspired rich and tender tripe stewed with beans came topped with pico de gallo, avocado, two sunny-side up eggs, and a handful of Fritos.  Finally, the wonderful sides included crisp and flavorful applewood smoked bacon, tender, porky breakfast sausage that bears no resemblance to the supermarket varieties, and fried potatoes, thin crispy outside and soft, fluffy inside, topped with melted cheese, scallions, and sea salt.I suppose we are gluttons.  And yes, I suppose we ordered so much somewhat on faith in the chef.  It was rewarding to find the food every bit as I hoped, if not even more so.  There are great takes on comfort foods being offered here, and with a sure hand at cocktails, excellent service, and a pleasing ambience, I will surely be back soon.  Reservations for prime time anything is absolutely a must, although you can probably snag seats at a table or the bar at off hours.",1,0,2,Valery C.,"Forest Hills, NY",56,837,9616
4.0,3/26/2012,"The food here was delicious, however they lose a star for the service. I came here for brunch and got a table at 1:30 with no problem. Here are the reasons why they lose a star.1. No cornbread during brunch.2. Would not let me order a side of fries with my fried chicken. I asked for a side and they said they do not serve sides of fries for brunch. Only if you get a burger. Why? What's the difference? If you have it why not serve it? I don't understand that at all but whatever.3. Would not let me have the banana cream pie with walnut ice cream. Again, the response was ""We don't substitute the ice creams with our pies"". This made no sense. Just slap the walnut ice cream on the plate instead of the orange sherbet. It isn't rock science. What if I had been alergic to orange. What is someone is alergic to nuts? Then I guess they would have to swap it.Overall, the waitress had a little bit of an attitude when I asked for the above. I didn't think they were outrageous requests but she didn't even ask the kitchen she just quickly dismissed them.Onto the food. I got the hot fried chicken and settled for a side of the hometown potatoes. I have to say the fried chicken was very good. Crispy batter, slight spice, and the meat was very juicy. It is a huge portion too. One big complaint is it seems that I got 3 pieces of white meat and 1 piece of dark meat. I am a dark meat lover and wished they would give you more. Not sure if you had to specify it or if they just give the same to everyone. The honey biscuits were really delicious and I liked that the cole slaw was not mayo-based and provided a nice cool break from the spice of the fried chicken.The hometown potatoes were tasty, fried nuggets topped with a cheesy sauce and some sea salt. The waitress said it was topped with creme fraiche as well but there was none to be found.For dessert I had their banana cream pie. It was more like a banana cream pudding to me. No real chunks of bananas, mostly whipped cream, and the crust was ROCK hard. When I tried to cut through it a huge chunk flew off my plate and landed at the table next to me. Needless to say I was very embarassed LOL! Still, I have not found a pie that compares to Emeril's in New Orleans.Overall, the Dutch is a really good restaurant but they need to loosen up a bit and be a little more accomodating to customer needs.",1,1,1,G C.,"New York, NY",21,264,798
5.0,3/26/2012,"I didn't have any expectations for brunch at The Dutch.  My mom's friend picked the place, and I didn't have a lot of time to read up.  It ended up being one of the best meals of my 10 day trip to New York.I came on a Sunday at 11AM with three friends, with my mother and her friends at a nearby table.  (My mom picked up the check, which was very generous - we were only eating at the same restaurant for transportation purposes, as our next stop was the airport.)  The reservation system was a little silly, in that I tried to make my reservation when my mom made hers, and the hostess told me to hang up and call again even though I was sitting right next to my mom, I mean how inefficient and bone stupid is that?  Anyway, a few of us arrived a little early and waited for our friend at the bar.  It was a beautiful, well-stocked bar with a friendly bartender.  I tried to order a Bloody Mary, but apparently New York is still a little Puritan - no boozing before noon on a Sunday.  When the last of our party arrived, we were lead to a roomy table in a clean cozy dining room with a lot of dark wood.  I loved the space.  Service throughout the meal was somewhat inattentive and standoffish, but it wasn't problematic.Since there was no Bloody Mary, we went straight into the food, starting with Kierin's Pastry Board.  This was a wonderful pastry board, with a curry sugar donut, an apple cheddar scone, and a blueberry buckwheat muffin, all big enough to split comfortably into four.  The donut was delightful, with a dense crumb that still managed to be fluffy.  It was rolled in sugar tinged with curry, so it was sweet overall with a tantalizing savory edge.  The apple cheddar scone packed plenty of butter and crumble, and while there was a little less apple than I wanted, there was a nice amount of cheese to each bite.  The most straightforward of the pastries was the blueberry buckwheat muffin, and it was excellent.  Not too sweet and very moist, with a lot of blueberry and a crunchy streusel top.  The pastry board came with kumquat jam and a salted butter with an almost sour cream flavor.  Scrumptious stuff.Maka E. and I shared some soft scrambled eggs and hot fried chicken for the main portion of our meal.  Both were delicious.  The soft scrambled eggs were some of the best I've ever had - loose and creamy, but never quite wet, with a rich, vibrant effect.  If I could make eggs this luxurious at home, I might go out to eat less often.  The eggs came topped with smoked sable, trout roe, and a dollop of creme fraiche, with a toasted sesame bagel on the side.  Bagel and lox?  No, not at all.  A different dish, with subtler flavors.  I loved the salty burst of roe with the creamy eggs.  More roe would have been better, but isn't that always true?  The hot fried chicken with honey butter biscuits was also a winner.  The fried chicken was well seasoned with a good crust and moist meat to both legs and breast.  I wouldn't say it was the best fried chicken I've come across, but it was very satisfying.  The dense glazed honey biscuits were a great side, and I loved the lightening effect of the crisp bright slaw.  I rarely go with sweet stuff for my brunch, but if I did, I would be happy with the almond French toast with Bananas Foster, which I mooched from Jorge C.  It was excellent French toast, eggy and puffed, with a pleasant almond crust.  The Bananas Foster topping was nicely caramelized but not too sugary.Once the clock hit noon, I got my paws on a Bloody Mary, or rather, a Bloody Caesar.  This was a twist on a Bloody Mary, with Krogstad Aquavit, Clamato juice, and coriander salt, with a celery stalk and a Spring Creek oyster on top.  The cocktail was thick and delicious, with a calming brine from the clam juice.  The shucked oyster was an awesome garnish, slurpy and mild, just right with the tomato and spice underneath.  The straight Bloody Mary was at least as good, with 42 Below vodka, chipotle, smoked paprika salt, and pickled olive.  I swapped some of my Caesar with my mom's Mary, and I might have preferred the dense spice of the Mary.  With an extra oyster in the mix, though, I don't think I could choose.For dessert, I forked in on some Dutch apple pie.  It was fantastic, not too sweet, with well textured hunks of apple and an addictive cinnamon crumble.  A scoop of walnut ice cream made it a splendid a la mode.  A great way to end a great meal.It's been a while since a brunch spot knocked my socks off.  I like the ceremony of brunch, and the category of food, but I've found that it's pretty hard to reinvent the meal.  Sweet or savory?  Poached or scrambled?  Blood Mary or does the restaurant not serve alcohol?  The brunch menu at The Dutch looked familiar enough, but small extras and perfect execution made an extraordinary meal using the usual building blocks.  This came at a price, with most dishes clustering in the high teens, but I'd pay to come back.  The Dutch is #1 on my list for brunch in New York.",3,6,5,Steph C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3889,3532,94

But the added flavors of the shaved broccoli, pine nuts and large golden raisins really took away from the pure gold of the burrata.  It was much too busy.  The service at the bar was fast and friendly but I would hope so.  Maybe I'll to go for the full dinner, but I really don't see why this place is as buzzy as it is.",0,0,0,sara M.,"New York, NY",0,7,0

2.0,2/22/2012,"For my 28th birthday, my mother and our two friends went up to NYC for a long weekend. I had been researching what restaurant I wanted to visit for my big birthday dinner. I decided on The Dutch after reading New York Magazine, reading reviews on Yelp, and hearing that it was the best new restaurant in town. I made the reservation three weeks in advance. When I called about Saturday night they were already booked. I decided we could do my birthday dinner the following night, Sunday, which also happened to be Super Bowl Sunday. The earliest reservation I could obtain was 9:30, which, again was fine, because I wanted to shop and sightsee all day. When we arrived they quickly sat us, and the hostesses were friendly and charming. Our server, a female also seemed very cordial, and helped us choose a bottle of wine. I began to notice that The Dutch was completely dead. There were maybe five tables that were occupied, while all the others were empty. I questioned why it was such a hard time to get a reservation when it was a literal ghost town. The Giants were playing in the Super Bowl, but when I had requested the reservation weeks in advance they seemed like their reservation list was almost completely booked. We all decided that we wanted steak, and since I am a server, I decided to ask the waitress if the ribeye for two would actually be enough for four women if we also got salads or appetizers. She said that it would be best to get two of the ribeyes for two, even though I stated that we were staying in a hotel and wouldn't be taking leftovers. When the steak came out forty minutes later (and they did say it would be forty minutes), it was on two platters surrounded by potatoes and a small salad. The steak was cut up into at least ten full slabs on each plate, and it became quickly apparent that there was no way in hell we were going to finish one plate, let alone two. The steak itself had a nice flavor balance, but it was tougher for a ribeye than I normally like. It was not worth the 120 dollars each, and there was never a way that we were going to be able to eat all of that food. I did enjoy our waitress in the beginning. She was very attentive and sweet, but when it became very obvious that she just wanted to make her check larger instead of being honest about the portion size, it turned me off. I had no time to actually complain, because soon a man was waiting on us. She did not even tell us she was leaving. I don't mind a server leaving a dead restaurant, but when you trade off you must always tell the table. The man we were left with seemed bitter we were still there. When I looked around at 10:30, I noticed we were the only ones in the place. I jokingly said to him, ""What are you guys closing soon?"" And he said, ""Yes, we've decided to close early since no one is coming in."" The Dutch is known for its late night fare, and I believe is normally open till 2 am or later. They only had two slices of pie to pick from for dessert and the entire kitchen staff had already gone home. Again, we were not told. I wanted the food to be good. I really, really did. I have been stalking yelp for years, and have never posted a review or joined, because I don't believe in sending in a written complaint to a restaurant. This occasion was an embarrassment. We were out the door before eleven. The steak was over done and the cut was tough. The waitress gave a bad, obvious choice that any server who has worked in the industry for over a year would know better than to do. She also did not think to say she was leaving, and the new waiter began ushering us out without mentioning that they were closing early. Nothing is more disappointing than going to NYC for your birthday, wanting a great experience and great food, and getting the exact opposite. All and all we closed down The Dutch at eleven when it normally closes past two. The hostesses and the men who filled up the waters and bussed the tables were by far the most attentive to our table and any other table in there. Good luck.",4,3,3,Kate O.,"Vienna, VA",85,1,0

I'd been meaning to try the okonomiyaki with pork belly but it's no longer on the menu so I ordered the French toast with bananas foster. The table ordered the Aperol Fizz, which is a blend of breuckelen gin, aperol, lillet, passionfruit, tangerine, cremant -- tasty, tropical drink with blueberries that you can fork out once you're done with the drink, as well as honey biscuits. My french toast consisted of two large slabs of toast with a few slices of banana and the banana foster sauce underneath. It wasn't overly rich or sweet, but for some reason I simply couldn't eat anymore after forcing the first toast down. Probably not a good sign. There just wasn't anything special about it. Tasted a bit of my boyfriend's soft scrambled eggs with roe. Again, nothing special.Aside from that, slow service but lovely atmosphere. I love the books over the shelf and fireplaces -- I can imagine this place is probably quite different for dinner so I might be convinced to check it out again.",1,0,0,Elizabeth L.,"New York, NY",240,816,249

2.0,2/15/2012,"It's easy to see how this place became so overconfident when you consider the press it's received over the last year. I didn't have inflated expectations, I was just completely confident that I would not be disappointed. Maybe this is why it took my so long to even admit to myself that my meal there was not very good. I dined with three companions, we each ordered two courses, and we ordered the fried chicken chicken wings for the table. Every single thing that I tasted was bland except for my sister's burrata appetizer, and the chicken wings, which was the only unique/interesting dish that came to our table. I loved them.  The trout crudo was in serious need of more acid, the crab claws and the oysters were delicious, but they didn't make those. For mains we tried the wood grilled chicken, the kale carbonara, the duck, and I ordered the special short rib raviolis on top of a robiola sauce. The grilled chicken was nicely grilled, but seriously under seasoned. The pasta in my sister's carbonara was spectacular, but once we broke the egg, and mixed it all together, we were disappointed to learn that there was not enough cheese, not enough egg, barely any pancetta, and almost no salt. My short rib raviolis were beautifully made, but almost tasteless, and the robiola sauce was one of the more bazaar things I've experienced in a restaurant. It was chiefly melted robiola underneath raviolis. I love robiola. It may be my favorite soft cheese, and this was good robiola that was being ruined by this bland fatty meat, and at the same time, the raviolis didn't stand a chance against that robiola. It was the only entirely unsuccessful dish of the evening; it was ill conceived. I forgot to try the duck. As far as getting a reservation... something fishy is going on here. This place is huge, and I've been trying to get a reservation at a normal hour here for some time, but I have been unsuccessful. We were able to secure a 6pm reservation for Valentine's Day, and we were there for over two hours. When we left at 8:15, the place was much more full, but it was not completely full. I'm thinking that if you're not completely full at 8:15 on Valentine's Day, it's easier to get a reservation there than you're making it seem. I find this to be especially likely after tasting the food.",2,1,1,Emily M.,"New York, NY",136,286,45

3.0,2/9/2012,"I was a bit disappointed with my lunch at The Dutch.  I certainly want to come back for dinner, as the dinner menu varies greatly from the lunch, but for a restaurant with so much hype, I'd have expected more from its lunch service.First, no oyster sliders on the lunch menu, which I desperately wanted to try.  I take full responsibility for glazing over this important fact when I scoured the menu beforehand, but I just assumed they would have them..  I mean really, (a) they are the most talked about item offered; (b) they serve oysters for lunch; and (c) they serve other fried delicacies so they've got their oil hot.. so, frying up and oyster and sticking it on a slider bun shouldn't be so tough, right? The bartender who waited on us was so surly it was uncomfortable.  We tried engaging him to discuss the different cocktails on the menu, but he was completely indifferent, and seemed totally put out by our request that he make us something off menu (and by a request for a second cherry in an old fashioned - come on! there should be 3!).  We ordered a few cocktails, which were well made, but when served with a grimace (at $14 a pop) they don't go down quite as well.  Sure the jalapeno cornbread was moist and spicy, and sure the oysters were fresh and delicious, but I expected more on all accounts.",3,1,2,Julia G.,"New York, NY",25,87,0

I had called about 3 weeks in advance to make a reservation thinking that I would never be able to get in after the NY Times Review.  Well, what an incredibly disappointing experience.  It definitely does not live up to the hype that it is receiving.  We ordered the burrata appetizer; the scallop entree and the spaghetti carbonara entree.  My friend's scallops were luke warm, if not downright cold, but he said he likes his food a bit on the cooler than hotter side, so we didn't say anything.  My carbonara was probably the worst carbonara I have ever had.  It was practically flavorless and the pasta was very strange. There was nothing special about any of it.   Ugh, I was so bummed.  The one saving grace to the entire meal, well 2, I should say, are; dessert was very good and our waiter was very nice and pretty on top of it.  He didn't charge us for the 2 glasses of wine we ordered as he said he forgot, but I wonder if he decided not to charge us when I told him my meal was very mediocre.  Either way, it was nice.  So, all in all, The Dutch is NOT worth the money and unless they get their act together on the food, I can't imagine it surviving the very competitive restaurant scene in NY.",1,0,0,Tania P.,"Boulder, CO",0,11,0

2.0,1/25/2012,"The Dutch was recommended by a trusted food-o-phile, so we were ready for a treat. The mood was dampened somwhat when it took 15 minutes to get our coats checked as they re-arranged the coatroom. Friendly staff placed us in the far room, which is nicely appointed, and we had a table for two set into the wall. It was quite cozy - however, it was across from the wait station, so when the station was occupied, I was hit in the back each time a staffer went by. No fun. So, once we were seated, it became painfully clear that the extreme noise level was something to be dealt with. I mean SERIOUS NOISE LEVEL - engine room of a 1930's tramp steamer noise level. The occupants of the table behind us were yelling to be heard above the din, adding to the torture. Our server was quite amiable, and the food arrived within a reasonable amount of time. Our oyster sliders were magnificent. My rabbit pot-pie was far too overdone - I jokingly asked for a chisel to break the crust. Inside, the dish was succulent, but for sure the dish had sat for a long time somewhere. We never received our vegetable side dish- although he had written it down, it wasn't on the bill.

2.0,1/25/2012,"I too read that the New York Times named The Dutch the No. 1 restaurant of 2011 and was extremely excited to check it out.  Everything started out great.  We arrived a little early for our reservation and sat at the bar enjoying a few drinks (good selection of booze and beers), checking out the decor (very nice, although the hipster/reclaimed/wood everywhere decor is starting to feel a little homogeneous), and eagerly anticipating the upcoming meal.  Upon being seated and given menus, we were then left for over 10 minutes before anyone came by to take our drink orders or even give us water.  That is where the disappointment began.  We each ordered beers, an oyster slider as a starter, salads, and entrees.  Fast forward another 10 min or so and we finally received our beer, but at least I had something to placate me while we waited another 10-15 min for food to come out.  A server (not our waiter) then comes out with our salads, deposited them on the table and scurried away.  We then basically chased him down to ask where our sliders were, he looked confused and said he'd get the waiter.  5 or so minutes go by while we're eating our salads and our waiter finally graces us with his presence.  What a surprise, he had forgotten our sliders and promised they'd be right out.  Well, salads are finished and taken away and shortly after our entrees come.  What's missing?  Oh, our sliders!  The food all looks and smells delicious though, so we dig in.  First cut into my pork chop and i see that it is rare.  Not slightly undercooked mind you, but seriously raw inside.  No way i'm getting thrichinosis so I flag down our waiter (who for the first time seemed to be nearby) and ask them to cook it a bit further.  Now i have to sit there and watch everyone else eating and enjoying their meals.  Thankfully at this point the sliders finally come and I have something to nosh on.  I should have nibbled on that tiny slider much slower as it took over 15 min for my pork chop to come back out.  By that time most of my party had finished their meals and I had to eat alone, of course I had to also eat fast since we had plans after and I did not want to make us late.  Mind you it took over 15 min for me to get back my same pork chop.  It wasn't as if they had cooked a new chop to the proper temp.  They simply had to finish cooking the one they previously attempted serving me.  I will admit it was a tasty dish, but at this point I was soured on the experience.

4.0,1/23/2012,"ANDY: So, there we were, sitting anxiously, waiting for our food to arrive as I see one of the waiters heading towards our table with a little wooden plank in hand. ""Is that for us?"" I'm wondering as he catches my hopeful eyes and walks right up to our table, setting a mini loaf of Jalapeño Cornbread at the center. Instant tongue swell. You know what I mean? My dad used to call it ""comiendo con los ojos"" or ""eating with your eyes."" I hadn't even tasted it yet, and I was salivating. I quickly grabbed the knife and cut into the loaf releasing a gust of warm steam as it parted. The moment had arrived...the first taste of Andrew Carmellini goodness. Wow...Delicious! Spicy, moist, and smokey, fresh baked cornbread dancing over my senses with a little dab of creamy butter to cool the tongue.  And...it was complimentary. I looked around at the other boys and I can tell the decision was unanimous: love at first bite. What a great start to this new relationship!ADAM: All of Matt's slurping and moaning over those oysters peaked my interest. I've always heard that oysters are an aphrodisiac. But Matt seemed to be experiencing a minor orgasm across the table. Confession: I've never eaten an oyster. I know...get it out now. How dare I call myself a food lover if I've never oystered before? I haven't lived until I've oystered! My reasoning: it hasn't really appealed to me until this moment. It sort of looks like a giant loogie sitting in a shell. I imagined the texture gummy. The flavor muddy. It wasn't until Matt's eyes rolling to the back of his head and the slight smell of the ocean wafting over to my end of the table that I could summon the courage to face a new culinary adventure. I ordered one, Matt's favorite of the bunch. When it arrived, I was thrilled by how luxurious and manageable it all seemed. Two sauce options, a lemon for freshness, sitting there on a bed of crushed ice. I dressed it up with homemade cocktail sauce and the oyster vinaigrette. Matt gave me slurp instructions. 'Tilt the shell enough and it will just fall in.' 'Do I chew?' 'A bit, yeah.' And so down the hatch it went. I remember thinking in the moment: wow, this is thrilling, I'm doing something I've never done before. It was like walking around in a neighborhood of New York City I've never seen before. A really old street I've yet to discover. The experience was magical. It was like I captured all of the ocean in my mouth for just a few moments. And then down it went. And I became a shell carrying the distant sound of the ocean inside me.JAY: When I was asked to be a guest set of tastebuds with BwayBites, my mouth started watering. When I found out I was the first guest in BwayBites history, I felt honored. I walk by The Dutch on a weekly basis traveling to and from evening therapy sessions. The vibe inside always felt a little too swanky for me with its mood lighting and its patrons dressed in business attire. However, BwayBites and I were there for lunch. The mid-day light spilling into the wall of windows facing Prince street gave the place a chill beach-like vibe. I am from Texas, and when it comes to comfort food this good ol' country boy can get real hungry. I had been craving fried chicken for quite some time, and when I heard it was a highlight on The Dutch's menu, I knew it had to be my choice. Now, I have had A LOT of fried chicken in my life, and I must say The Dutch's is the most unique I have ever tasted. Not overly salted and not too greasy, this fried bird was felt like the healthier distant cousin to which Texas is accustomed. I can picture myself as though I were a judge on Bobby Flay's Throwdown: Fried Chicken. While it is not yo grandmama's home style recipe, it was a foodie experience to open my mind to the possibilities of what fried chicken could be. Who-da-thunk putting hot sauce on it would be so tasty? I'm accustomed to dipping mine into creamed gravy. Dairy Queen, anyone?MATT: Appropriate that ""The Spoon"" picks dessert, and by dessert I mean desserts, because truth be told, they sounded so good that we couldn't pick just one.  The sorbet sampler was superb; we all went bananas for the banana cream pie (Did I just taste rum? Yum!); but of course the signature dessert, Dutch Apple Pie, took the cake...pun very much intended.   What could be better in the colder months than a warm apple pie with notes of sour cream, topped with a cinnamon crumble, and served with homemade walnut ice cream?  It fulfills every expectation of the dish with varietal textures, tastes, and temperatures.  Simply put...sweet and buttery goodness that only Mom's homemade could even begin to compete with.  Oh, and the cocktails and coffee washed it all down very nicely.bwaybites.com/2012/01/lo…@bwaybites",0,1,0,Broadway B.,"Manhattan, NY",127,21,39

Waitress: (annoyed) ""Well we sell by the glass, so you don't have to buy a bottle."" It went on and on from there with her pushing us to get coffee, tea, iced tea, soda, etc. She wasn't happy that we weren't big spenders.* Food took awhile to come out to us, although not a painfully long time, longer than it should have taken* When I called to make a reservation they told me that any later than 6pm without a reservation and there would be a 1-2 hour wait. When we arrived and even when we were leaving, they were seating people right away. So in retrospect we didn't need to get there at grandma time.THE FOOD* Since I'm pregnant I was pretty limited on what I could eat and sadly had to skip the steak tartare, scallops and oysters that I really really really wanted to get. So I went with 2 vegetable sides (the cauliflower and the brussel sprouts). The cauliflower was delicious. The brussel sprouts... well, unless you LOVE mayo and horseradish you probably won't like them. They were cooked perfectly, I will give them that, but I literally couldn't eat them, and having them under my nose was a challenge. The menu said horseradish - which is a vegetable - so I was assuming it was shredded over or something. Nowhere did it say sauce or marinade or anything like that. Oh well. My friend liked them and took them home. We also shared the fries. They were very mediocre and on par with, if not worse than,any NYC diner. It also sort of sucked that they don't have ketchup. Yes, I said it, ketchup. Call me a peasant, but the ketchup makes the fries. They were just bland and boring and needed salt or something. I'm also not really a fan of mushy, greasy fries.* My friend got the duck and thought it was really great. She said it was cooked perfectly and the crust on top was really delicious.* Portions were big for nice restaurant, so while the prices were a little high, I didn't feel totally ripped off.* I got the ice cream ... need I remind you that pregnant women love ice cream. I got mint and cinnamon. So when the cinnamon was so bad that I couldn't eat it I think that really makes a statement. How can you mess up ice cream? It tasted like I was sticking my tongue in a container of McCormicks ground cinnamon - chalky, strong, makes you want to cough, desperately needs sugar, etc. The mint was palatable, but I swear the main flavoring came from a Crest original tube.It wasn't the worse place I have ever eaten, but it definitely wasn't great. Maybe I would have been happier if I could have eaten the food I really wanted to, so I will admit that. Overall, for the price, I think there are better places in NY. I'm not sure I understand the hype. Also, I understand that a chef takes pride in his food and doesn't want to ""mess with"" the integrity of the dish by adding and subtracting ingredients, but I think that there are times to suck up your pride and please your customers. It's totally unreasonable, in my opinion, that they wouldn't leave cheese off of a dish because I, as a pregnant woman, can't eat soft cheese. But anyway ...",1,0,0,S H.,"New York, NY",12,299,1

The hostess was very pleasant and said she would try to get us in as soon as possible. We went to the VERY crowded bar and tried to weasel our way up to order a drink. I have to commend them on their wine-list. Excellent choices by the glass! I'm a Cali girl and when ever I see Santa Barbara wine country represented on a list it's an automatic thumbs up! We each had a glass of the Syrah which was FAB! We ended up getting our table shortly there after and were seated in the front room. We were a little disappointed as we were totally groovin on each other and lost the vibe when we were seated at a table where we couldn't grope on : ) There were two seats at the bar so we asked to move and they graciously said sure. Once we were seated our waiter was great. Complete professional, laid back with great timing. Now to the food. The cornbread to start was ok...would have preferred regualr bread...then we had the chicken wing appetizer...eeh...a little on the sweet side, nothing special. Then we had the Halibut, which was very good, the beef ravioli with porcini and black truffle, good and the brussels sprouts on the side. Like I said, everything was just ""good"" I certainly wouldn't rush back or wait to eat at 10:15 again for it though.

The nice lady at the door quoted us a wait time of 1 hour, so we put our name down and began the usual hover around folks at the bar who look like they might be getting their check in a relatively short time. 15 or so minutes pass and still with our first drinks in hand, the hostess comes to tell us our table is ready but we only have 2 hours to eat.

We had the wonderful good fortune of not sitting near any whining DABA girls, curly-mustached skinny jean-wearing dudes, or crying babies. Our waiter came over with a sense of humor, knowledge about the full menu (down to descriptions of the difference in the oysters they were serving), and pointed recommendations on mains. We skipped on the oyster sliders and went for them raw on the half shell. I got the pecan duck with dirty rice. M got the new york strip. Both came out perfectly medium rare. The side of fries had a light crisp to the bite and melted in your mouth. While the duck was good sweet, rich, and savory all at once, his steak was pretty damn great.

If it wasn't for the huge portion, I would have finished every last bite. The oyster sammies for late night and the pastries/desserts are all very delicious too, but the fried chicken is a must.

I think I didn't hear the server say that it was prepared with beets, which I don't really like, since when being eaten, remind me of blood. The patty was prepared in a way that the beets made the patty look like a blood burger. I think I had like 4 bites and could not take any more of the grossness of it.

4.0,12/23/2011,"Lunchtime at the Dutch wasn't nearly as crazy of a scene as the reviews portray for dinner.  We got there at 12:15 thinking there'd be a madhouse, and instead were pleasantly greeted with a few empty tables.  Our party of 3 got seated right away, and within 5 minutes, we had a loaf of the delicious complimentary jalapeno cornbread to split.  Our friendly, stoner-sounding servers really pushed for us to split a few dishes.  Seeing that all 3 of us were eyeing the hot fried chicken and honey butter biscuits, we strategized and agreed to order the chicken as an ""appetizer."" crazy, i know. Given this genius strategy, I ordered what seemed to be the healthiest sandwich of the 4 options on the menu, the house-smoked turkey on a roll with avocado.  They also had several entrees including a kale carbonara, which despite the strange-sounding combination, looked very appetizing. The piece de resistance, the hot fried chicken consisted of 4 pieces (drumstick, thigh, breast, and one of the biggest wings I've ever seen) of crispy, juicy chicken with a bit of seasoning that reminded me of the old bay-seasoned chicken at Momofuku. Was it $19 good? I don't know, but it was magically delicious and easily could be split for 2 people. Let me not forget the 2 honey butter biscuits accompanying the chicken--they were some of the shiniest carb diamonds I'd ever seen and they tasted as advertised, of honey and butter. The house-smoked turkey sandwich was no slouch either. While it looked to be a wee bit on the small side (considering it was $15), it was a step up even from boar's head turkey which is my go-to staple. It came on a warm cloud of a roll and slathered with savory avocado and green sauce aioli, although the kale salad accompaniment was meh.  My friend's roast beef sandwich however was the better choice--one bite of the delicious, tender beef on a warm bun with horseradish sauce was awesome, and I don't really even like roast beef sandwiches. One thing I do wish they did was offer the ability to substitute sides for the sandwiches--I asked to sub my kale salad for fries, which accompany their cheeseburger, but our server wouldn't budge, and we ordered a side of fries (which were salty, crispy and perfect)While the lunch may have started off on the quiet side, by the middle of the meal, the rather small dining room had filled up completely and there was a sizable number of people hovering at the bar area.

The pear was grainy - just like a pear - refreshing and delicious. The grape is tart and tasty, the mint sorbet was full of the actual herb itself.

4.0,12/21/2011,"Unless you're the type of Carrie Bradshaw diner who urges their friends to hit the hottest and most gossipy, you might just hate The Dutch.  I certainly wanted to hate it.  Even before walking into the doors and getting an icy stare-down by the meticulously coiffed hostess, I'd heard glum news about interminable wait times and a feel-good corn pone menu that overcharges and underwhelms.  I wanted to hate the crowd, village people, generally well dressed, beautiful.  And in contrast, there was a speckling of hipsters, food celebrities and the food nerds that love them.  (Is that Anne Burrell over there?  Why yes, yes it is).  Glam or bland, the throng made it tough to get a drink from the bartenders (ironically dressed in period outfits, although they made one hell of a Manhattan).But once you've fought your way to a seat at the bar or done your time waiting for a table, the food answers for at least some of the prior grievances.  Unless you're dining at Le Bernardin, you'll not find fresher raw shellfish than at The Dutch, and you can't go wrong with platter of magnificently fresh Blue Point oysters on the half shell.  Nor could you go wrong with a starter of snapper ceviche ($18), bracing, cold, and oh so good.  The famous but diminutive fried oyster sliders are $5 dollar flavor bombs for the 1%.I suppose part of the charm of the New York restaurant scene is how inaccessible some restaurants make themselves, and The Dutch is no different.  But at the end of the day, all of these restaurants are more than happy to take your money and your time.  At least you'll get a good meal in return at The Dutch.",13,8,9,Chris H.,Hong Kong,170,603,2140

I know I'm not supposed to comment on something I didn't taste, so I won't say anything about how much she liked the coffee.

Before the sandwiches came, we were given a small loaf of warm cornbread. It was pretty tasty as far as cornbread goes, but it is not bread. The burgers come with the Dutch's special sauce. If you like taco sauce, then by all means, go with the special sauce. If you don't want taco sauce on your burger, I would suggest asking for it on the side. Also, beware that it's a cheeseburger so if you don't want cheese on your burger, you must ask for the cheese to be left off.

4.0,11/29/2011,"In honor of my 50th review... a Holiday Tale for you all:Once upon a time Lissa had been wanting to go to The Dutch for dinner. From the day it opened across from FFF (Lissa's favorite foodie friend... and the other leading character in this story)'s apartment, Lissa dreamed of the day she would order off the Dutch's menu. Everytime Lissa got off the 1 train at Houston she'd walk by and peer in the windows, oggeling the plates of food passing by and delicious looking cocktails being sipped.   Finally, one Friday night it was time for Lissa to join the jolly people inside and not just walk among them in the shadows of Sullivan Street. After a long night of gallivanting around Tribeca through various cocktail establishments and even attending a holiday wine gathering, Lissa and FFF made their way north back towards FFF's apartment. All of the sudden FFF exclaimed with excitement that they should stop in at the Dutch. ""Oh what a marvelous idea FFF"" thought Lissa.The inside was buzzing with patrons and had a warm feel to it as they walked towards the bar. They were quickly seated and Lissa and FFF could hardly contain their excitement as they ordered drinks and looked over the menu. Lissa and FFF quickly learned that even though the menu does not list fried chicken it can be ordered if you know to ask for it. ""what a fun little secret"" Lissa thought as she awaited the arrival of her food. The lovely waitress quickly brought over oyster sandwiches to the girls, who gobbled them down. There was other tasty food too, ribs and a squash salad and the girls grew quiet as they stuffed their faces full of food. The best part of the meal had to be the secret fried chicken. Oh the girls would dream of that chicken in days and weeks to come. Lissa and FFF licked their fingers clean and savored every bite. They waved goodbye to The Dutch and walked down Sullivan street feeling full, sleepy and happy. Both girls were pleased with the wonderful night they'd had at the Dutch and promised to visit again soon. The end.",5,9,5,Lissa V.,"New York, NY",565,242,4
3.0,11/15/2011,"""Great,"" he said. ""How's The Dutch, 10PM?""I thought: on a Tuesday?! Who am I, Vogue design associate and Stylecaster trendster Veronica Gledhill? Do I look like the type of girl that has DINNER in SOHO at TEN PEE EM?Not on your life - but I'd sure like to, so I gave a nonchalant yes, sucked down an espresso at 8, dressed down five-inch spikes with ripped-up jeans, and teetered in like the complete ass-pirational clown that I am at a conservatively fashionably-late distance from 10PM. The Dutch, visually, is an unintimidating institution. It looks like An American Restaurant - big, friendly, pub tables, and a conspicuous, noisy bar - not like the sexy, dim-lit footsie-under-the-table sort of thing I'd been priming myself for. I felt more at ease. The food, accordingly, was of the friendly gastopub ilk - familiar and unpretentious. Bacon-specked scallops, peanuts atop a curried bass, a robust raw bar, house-made fries. Nothing extraordinary - in fact, I'd say that the buzz and the location overwhelmed the actual menu. Nothing you haven't had before - and probably somewhere cheaper! Entrees ran north of $30.The best part (and certainly the aspect most responsible for defusing my self-imposed awkwardness) was easily the cocktail spread, which I'd return to explore.

2.0,11/14/2011,"I have been trying to get a reservation for dinner here since they opened with no success, but on a long shot I called on Friday and was able to get a reservation for brunch on Saturday.  I will start by saying the staff from the hostess to waiter, were all very friendly. Unfortunately, for me, the food fell flat. The Bloody Mary was solid and the pickles were interesting, not just another gherkin. I had the fried eggs with grits, chorizo and salsa verde. I did not see any salsa verde on the dish, and while the presentation was nice in a skillet at the table, the entire dish was room temp. The chorizo was completely lacking flavor, it tasted and looked like ground beef crumbles. We did have dessert though which was very tasty! The pie was a grape apple pie. The lattice was perfect and the filling was not too sweet. It also had a peanut sauce and brittle peanuts on the side with a scoop of Rum raisin Ice Cream. The ice cream tasted more like vanilla, good vanilla, but not rum raisin. For all of the hype, I just expected better food.

5.0,11/8/2011,"I haven't actually eaten at the Dutch, but I can certainly speak to the pies.  My lady and I decided to forego the traditional cake at our wedding in favor of a dessert that we, and, let's face it, most people can really get excited about.  We had read some rave reviews of The Dutch's pies and we ordered 12--blueberry, peach, and salted lime.They were indeed mind-blowingly good, so much so that two of my uncles liberated a pie each from the kitchen and snuck out with them, and the less sticky-fingered (figuratively, though not in this case literally) guests went on and on about them.  And to top things off, our wedding was the weekend of Hurricane Irene and, even though the restaurant was closing down for the weekend, they went in on Saturday to finish off the pies and, when our friends showed up to pick them up but couldn't get a cab to Brooklyn due to an early storm shortage, even drove the pies and our friends out to the wedding.  Awesome, thanks guys!",1,0,3,Will F.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,15,0
4.0,11/6/2011,"Step into The Dutch and you know instantly that you're in a trendy New York hotspot.  With its hardwood floors, white walls, Edward Ruscha prints, and sleek, intimate lighting, the The Dutch is downright sexy, almost as attractive as the crowd and staff.  As I stepped in for a Friday night dinner with the BF, I knew it was going to be nothing short of a modern New York experience.  Considering the good and bad, I happened to be right.I had made a reservation four days in advance for dinner at 10:15, but when we showed up we had to wait a little bit more for our table (and we were running late).  We started with drinks at the bar where I went for Dutch Courage (their take on an Old Fashioned, with kumquat marmalade , grapefruit, and Genever).  It was bittersweet and stiff, but softened up as the giant ice cube worked its way into the concoction.  At the table, he opted for the Bellwether (a tequila-based drink with, chili, orange, and agave) that had a spicy kick but tasted just like biting into a fresh bell pepper.  When we had originally sat down, we sat at an awkward table anchored by a lone single booth, placed on top of the waiter station.  Luckily, the waitstaff was more than happy to move us to a more intimate booth in the middle of the back dining room.  Being able to sit next to my dining companion instead of across from him made the food and the experience much more enjoyable.We started with a half-dozen oysters (blue point and kumamoto), which were sensational (the former more so than the latter).  The raw oysters were just a warmup for the real star of the first course, the appropriately named ""Little Oyster Sandwiches"".  A deep fried oyster served on a potato roll with lettuce, tomato, and a spicy mayo makes this seafood slider more than delectable.  It's slightly salty and buttery, but exquisite.  As for the mains, his Spice-Glazed Pork Chop with Swiss Chard and Roasted Apple was juicy and perfectly cooked, while my Scallops with Saffron Rice in Gumbo Sauce were spicy and pleasant, although I wish I could have had one or two more scallops (five was not enough).  Thankfully, we saved room for dessert, and with good reason: homemade pies.  We split a Buttermilk Pie in a Ginger Crust with Coffee Ice Cream that was sweet and well balanced, without being too sugary.I learned after that had we dined at The Dutch an hour or so later into the night, we would have gained access to their legendary ""late night"" menu consisting of high-end comfort food (fried chicken with biscuits, a burger, etc...) which would have been just as satisfying as the seafood options.  Still, for those who want to be seen in a scene, The Dutch delivers.  And the food isn't too bad either.",0,0,0,Barrett L.,"Washington, DC",822,287,0
4.0,11/2/2011,"The great thing about anyone who has worked for Daniel Boulud is that you are instilled with a grace and generosity that you carry on through your career. I don't often see this quality in other restaurant groups but I see it in every restaurant I visit that employs former Dinex group alumni.  This subtle attentiveness is, to me, priceless.  So when I walked into The Dutch one night and chatted with the reservationists and maitre d' while I waited for my date, they were thoughtful enough to call AC (a.k.a. Andrew Carmellini) and let him know I was there.  I eventually wandered over to the bar - which was chock full of handsome men that I instantly starting chatting with - when I noticed a server walking tall through the crowd, headed straight towards me with a glass of champagne.  I felt like a princess; acknowledged, appreciated.  Then my handsome date walked in - grinning from ear to ear - and I was on top of the world.  None of this would have felt as special if the staff was aloof or didn't care to chat with me.  After being seated - at a great table, quickly, without a reservation - we were sent a flight of oysters from AC.  If you're anything like me, this generosity speaks volumes and creates instant brand loyalty on my part.  We followed oysters with a fantastic dish of Octopus a la Barca.  No idea what ""a la barca"" means but it was perfectly cooked, lying on a bed of what I faintly remember as roasted red peppers and tobasco-based sauce.   I sometime cringe when I see tuna tartar on a menu because it seems like such a common addition to the menu to drive up check averages, but I rarely regret ordering it in finer restaurants, and The Dutch's version was above par.  Our main courses were less impressive than the starters.  With sweet memories of AC's lamb tagine at Café Boulud back in the good old days, I ordered the lamb shank tagine with exotic spices and citrus couscous.  But the lamb was tough and stringy, telling me it could have been cooked hours longer.  I had to coerce it off the bone, whereas it should have been so tender that it slipped right off the bone with the gentlest touch of my fork.  My mate's duck was just okay.  While the duck was perfectly cooked, the dish was under-seasoned, similar to my dish.Would I go back?  Absolutely.  But probably for a few smaller dishes than main courses and definitely in the hopes of seeing AC to thank him for taking such good care of me on my last visit.  But The Dutch has gotten mixed reviews.  I've read comments all across the spectrum, from terrible, loud and rude to fantastic and unforgettable.  My guess is that The Dutch will find it's equilibrium somewhere in the middle, probably just between good and really good.  I don't know AC, Josh, and Luke's goals with this restaurant...maybe that's right where they want to be.  If I know AC, I doubt he's aiming for three stars and prefers to keep himself in the two star arena with this place.",0,0,0,T.

4.0,10/26/2011,"3.5 stars rounded up to 4. I came in on Sunday night with a good friend of mine who works at Chef Andrew Carmellini's Locanda Verde. We showed up around 10 PM without a reservation and were pleasantly surprised to see the restaurant relatively full, with a good vibe and good energy. We opted to hang out at the oyster bar. I'm surprised about what others have said about bad service here because if there is one thing that really stood out to me, it's the service. Maybe it's cause my friend works at Locanda, maybe it's cause I work at Eleven Madison Park, maybe it's because it wasn't crazy busy, but it was pleasure meeting the majority of the team. We basically told Justin, the manager, ""Omakase"", noted food allergies, and let him take care of the rest. I'll hit up service points and small details later in the review. We started with a dozen oysters comprised of a mix of Blue Points, Kumamoto, Moon Shoals, and something Walrus...They were amazingly refreshing! The east coast oysters in particular were briny, plump, and meaty. Looking in retrospect, I wish we passed on the Kumamoto and got more of the Moon Shoals and Walrus oysters. They were the best I had in recent memory. Next up, they hit us with ALL of the snacks on the menus. They were all very good. I wish I had quickly devoured the Asian White Boy ribs the second they hit the table because they were definitely beginning to get a little cold. The meat was succulent with deep, rich, braised flavors. The Fried Oyster Sandwiches felt to me like Baby Big Macs except with fried oysters. I think I've already said my piece on how delicious the oysters are here. The last snack was the eggplant dip. At first, I was a bit shocked because I thought it would come out warm, and instead was served cold. After a few bites though, it grew on me more and more. By the end, my friend and I agreed that it was definitely best to be served cold. Oh and by the way, the savory crackers are not crackers at all. They are lavash! And they're delicious!My only minor complaint about the snacks was the pacing that they were served at. I know we were a relatively late table, but they literally dropped all 3 of them within minutes of each other. I'm not 100% sure, but I think we might have still had oysters when the dip was dropped. A minute later the others arrived. In fact, the BBQ Shrimp appetizer came with the Oyster Sandwiches and Ribs too...I think that if I had to time to enjoy them, one at a time while they were hot, I would've enjoyed them even more. This is especially true for the ribs, which I enjoyed immensely. I could probably eat 3-4 orders of them.The BBQ shrimp is the dish that I cared for the least. I think it's because it was basically cold by the time I got to it. I've already said my piece on the pacing, but this dish really suffered from it. especially the fried egg part. Would I be inclined to try it again hot? Maybe, but probably not. The last savory course consisted of the scallops and the lamb shank. I liked the scallops, and again, I think they could've been served hotter. To be quite honest, I love scallops, and while they were good, they were a bit of a let down. I personally felt like everything on that plate was slightly over cooked, and the foam that it was served with lacked the punch that I was expecting on my palette. I really enjoyed the lamb shank a lot. The couscous provided a nice textural contrast and the spices added flavor to the shank without overpowering it. I would have no problem at all ordering that shank again. I know this is going out of order, but I want to stress that the FRIES here are the BEST I have ever eaten. Anywhere. They are probably the reason the rest of the starters went cold. I was too busy shoveling them down my throat to concentrate on the 6 other plates in front of me! Thank you Joanna for recommending them to us. They are cut in the style of McDonalds fries, without the creepy clown costume. They were perfectly fried, perfectly seasoned, and just...PERFECT! Honestly, the fries are what stand out to me more than anything during this meal. For dessert we had the Grapple Pie and the Devils Food Cake. I got a good laugh out of it when we asked what a ""Grapple"" is. The response was, ""It's basically what happens when a grape and an apple have sex..."" Fascinating. It was good. My friend really loved it. Me on the other hand? I was too busy hammering away at the Devil's Food Cake. Very sinful and delicious indeed. I LOVED what tasted like dark chocolate and espresso crumble. I should've been ""that"" guy and requested a glass of milk. I also agree with one of the reviewers that the Grapple Pie should've been served hot. I think I would've enjoyed it more that way, but again, I was busy with ""sinning"" with the Devil's Cake.

I called on a Tuesday asking about a table for Friday despite their month-long waiting list for prime time, and was told they can accommodate parties of 2 without a reservation with not much of a wait and that turned out to be true, we were seated right away. We spent a long evening there, several courses and a couple of bottles, and never felt rushed despite the fact that they obviously needed the table as the night went on. The service was excellent, as is the wine list. And they even sent over the sommelier when I had very minor questions about the list, which was quite nice. They have several nice bottles, including a few 2006 labels from Nuits Saint George which is rare, given that year is tough to find. Granted you can pay $290 for a bottle, and we settled on a 2006 Gevrey Chambertin with some excellent advice.The oysters are fresh and reasonably priced, the white boy ribs very good, the sweet shrimp with green chili over grits topped by a fried egg was recommended and although tasty it was perhaps the disappointment of the evening.

4.0,10/19/2011,"So I was a smidge hesitant to check out The Dutch after all the reviews of bad service. Evenso, we figured all the good food reviews coupled with Andrew Carmellini's reputation made us take the risk. ;-) Turned out we had a great experience with terrific service.. from waiting at the bar to our dinner service. The Manager even came by our table several times to help w/service and see how we were doing. The food also lived up to it's reputation. We started out with the cornbread, the beets and oyster sliders.  They were all really good and oyster slider lived up to the hype -- crispy and exploding w/flavor at first bite. As entrees we ordered the halibut and the sea scallops w/a side of spaghetti squash. My scallops were divine...cooked perfectly with a wonderful bacon, corn and chipotle sauce. The spaghetti squash was AMAZING-- one of my favorite things we tried here-- and truth be told, I wasn't a huge fan prior to having it here. It comes w/a buttery sauce w/walnuts and asiago. It was so good I've made it my mission to try to recreate it at home.. and I will. ;-)  The only thing that was a bit of a disappointment was my friend's halibut...and this is only because it came out with tobikko (roe) on it which she hadn't anticipated even though it was on the menu so can't really fault them for that. They promptly replaced it for her w/o an issue which impressed me.

Lamb Shank, not bad, but could have been a bit more tender, scallops (there were 4 small scallops and a boat load of foam-I left hungry), the duck what ok and the chicken stroganoff with no cream or noodle was ok too.  So needless to say we were not that jazzed with our dinner, so let's try the dessert!!!First and foremost, most people would agree hot pie and ice cream is an awesome combination. Well the Dutch refuses to heat up their pies. WTH?  When you spend hundreds of dollars on dinner and you ask 2 people to just give you what you want and they refuse you I think it's ridiculous.  They said it would compromise the integrity of the pie.  Ummm it's just pie!!!!  And what is wrong with your pie if it can't be in the oven for a minute or two????  So stooopid.

4.0,10/16/2011,"I am not really a brunch person but I would find something fun to try when I get a chance. My husband and I are big fans of Locanda Verde so we have been wanting to check out The Dutch.I personally loved the gastropub'ish style of this place. It's full of characters. We got a table facing the bar and saw people come here by themselves enjoying a bloody marry and a newspaper for a Sunday morning. How lovely.The menu looks good but that kindda created a problem - we didn't know what not to order. You know, we are one of those people whose eyes are just bigger than the stomachs.With my husband's good food IQ, we settled with a burger, a tripe and eggs, and an order or cornmeal flapjcaks to share.The tripe and eggs was a good dish that has interesting flavor profile. It's Spanish sort of and Mexican sort of. The cumming was a bit strong for the first bite and with the eggs and the salsa, it was well balanced. However, If I had to compare, I would favor the tripe and eggs at Locanda Verde more.The burger came with skinny fries (not shoestring though). And since our first bite would always go to the fries not the burger, this dish won us over immediately with the savory fries. The burger patty was yummy and juicy (Pat LaFrieda maybe?) and the buns were toasty the way I like it. I would think the lettuce was very out of place in that pile but the caramelized onions added on to the right amount of sweetness/saltiness.And the cornmeal flapjacks...oh my! I love this dish so much! It's just cornmeal pancakes with fresh blueberries sauce. The pancakes had a fun nutty texture because of the cornmeal mixture and it's still fluffy without being too dense and heavy. The blueberries sauce was so good because it was the fresh blueberries, tart and sweet at the same time. The sauce itself was not sweet by any mean; the sweetness came from the fruit.We were so tempted to order the cocktails but decided not to. It was iced tea and coffee to go with the meal. The iced tea was very light, almost no tea flavor - a slight disappointment. The coffee tasted interesting with chocolatey flavor and it was light. The service was friendly even though our waitress couldn't explain why the iced tea didn't have much flavor.I called at 11am to get noon reservation and I got it.

For main course we had the halibut and the lamb tagine.  The halibut was cooked well but overall I've had better before.  The lamb tagine was flavorful but slightly overpowered by the combination of all the different spices.  Another blemish on the dish was the stale, funny tasting diced carrots.  They tasted like they had been sitting in a plastic container for quite some time.  When I mentioned it to the waitress, she was surprised and slightly angered.And since I am talking about the waitress, throughout our dining experience not once did she crack a smile.  While the bus staff was efficient, the waitress hardly ever came by to check and when she did, it felt like she was doing us a favor.  Everybody has a bad day.  I didn't take it personally.  However, when even the hostesses pay more attention to themselves and not even smile while sitting us down or when leaving the restaurant, then I get the sense that this is the culture of the restaurant.And to be honest, I am willing to put up with attitude if I end up having an exceptional meal.  But when I don't and the people I see around me wear sneakers and In & Out burger t-shirts, then I think the attitude is neither warranted nor justified.So if you love fried oysters, do yourself a favor and try them.

It was 9 pm, we were tipsy and hungry while perusing the menu... A dangerous combination. Ended up sharing a number of amazing items including oysters on the half shell which were deliciously fresh, all the small starters (fried oyster sliders! Dip! White-boy Ribs! Yay!), a tomato and burrata salad (oh my!) sea scallops, and black cod.

2.0,9/25/2011,"Just went there yesterday with two dear friends - and sadly, I have to agree with the reviews that say service could be better.  The food was great!  We enjoyed all of the dishes (which took forever to get to the table - would've been nice to have at least a bread basket if we had to wait 45 minutes).One great example of the rudeness - we get there and there's a wait (no problem) the hostess tells us to sit at the bar.  Which we do.  Oh no, not THAT bar!  The OTHER bar at the other side of the restaurant.  I guess we were supposed to read her mind?  Rude girl even though I have to say I admired her glasses.Our waiter, while cute and very tall all of which I appreciated, was not very friendly and was pretty durned curt with my friend when she asked for tomato salad on the side with her dish.  Guess what?  You canNOT have tomato salad on the side of any dish except the one it comes with - the pork sandwich.  Unless you order that for your meal, you're not ALLOWED  to order tomato salad, for any price.  The tomato salad is delicious by the way.  Anyway apparently the chef believe very strongly in the integrity of every dish/ meal (we were told this by our cute mean waiter a few times at least).  Hence, no tomato sald.  Interesting.",2,3,1,Ananya S.,"Houston, TX",71,129,107

Yay! The service was good, a little on the aggressive side, actually a lot on the agressive side. Our server asked us for our drink order twice and we still needed a minute, he asked us probably 3-4 times about our dinner order and every time we were like ""we just started looking we need a few minutes."" Good lord! The hostess told us they had a reservation at 9 for the table, and it was 7:00 we get it, we'll be out. Chill. Appetizers- buratta and heirloom tomatoes, yum, perfect seasoning, end of summer delicious. Shrimp (wrapped in bacon, need I say more?) and grits, came with heads on, pretty to look at and even better to eat. The cornbread they serve was spot on, super flavorful and not dry. My scallop entree with corn and more bacon was rich and perfect. Oh and we had to get a side of their fries (per the server) for the table. I am a french fries connoisseur and these were ba-nanas to quote Ms. Zoe. Crispy, salty, yumminess. Our wine and cocktails were good and interesting too. It helped that I didn't see the check, probably wouldn't be back on a regular Thurs night since it is a little pricey. But solid, well done food in a super cute space with good people watching.

4.0,9/8/2011,"went with my best girlfriend about 3 months ago, so i'm a little late to review... but if it's any indication, i still remember my experience as clearly as (for a happily tipsy person) if it had been just the other week. we were wandering around the neighborhood after a cocktail event -- hungry and in search of a nice little nook to enjoy the evening. a very kind couple pointed us in the direction of the dutch, which happened to be just at the next corner. given that this was an impromptu discovery, we had no idea what to expect... and much to our enthusiastic pleasure, IT DID NOT DISAPPOINT. instead of full entrees we opted for an assortment of finger food and appetizers to accompany our expertly made cocktails. the vibe was lively, boisterous, even loud, and yet somehow still cozy and inviting. the set-up is perfect for people-watching, with the bar serving as the main attraction and tables situated around the periphery. one thing i especially loved was that they opened up all the windows around the outside to let in the evening breeze. felt a bit like a vacation in havana or that high-end watering hole before taking off on a safari. (or maybe i just had a few too many drinks...)absolutely recommend the asian white boy ribs, which sound questionable (it's actually called that) but hits the right balance of hearty, tangy and slightly sweet. the little oyster sandwiches were ridiculously tasty too (a must-order), although i'm a raw girl at heart and prefer to slurp them right out of their cold little shells -- lucky for me, they had kusshis and malpeques, which came near to sending this all the way to 5 stars. asparagus okonomiyaki was more of a novelty selection and didn't deliver as highly as the other choices. housemade fries were honestly some of the best i've had in a long time, and i'm not typically a fan.at the end of the evening, we were under the dutch's spell.definitely going to bring my husband the next time, and a huge appetite. what this restaurant does well is delivering a really fun and enjoyable dinner experience. would be great for a date, cocktails with the girls, or just a late night stopover before heading home.oh and did i mention how well they make their cocktails...??(note: if i could, i'd make this 4 1/2 stars but no can do...)",0,0,0,M.

The first time I came here we arrived around midnight in search of a burger (read: we had a few beers at a concert)--The Dutch has a late night menu and the burger spoke to us. It's massive. The fries are a bit salty but they're perfect at that point in the night. The SECOND time we came here a little more on our game and ordered cocktails from the bar before being seated. The Miss Elliot is fantastic. Like a light vodka martini with lavender. Prior to 11pm, we were still in crave mode for the burger.NO.GO.Warning: Burgers are on the late night menu. Only after 11.

Meanwhile, the stool was already at the bar when I sat on it, I didnt move it.  There were a few men who also were sitting on that size stool but I was the one picked up and demanded,  not asked to give up my stool.  I was very upset and offended after spending so much money there that I was treated that way.  I confronted the waiter and he went to get a manager as he had no rebutle for acting that way.  The first manager that came over, apologized but it was not heartfelt, she could have cared less. After our heated discussion, she said our last round was on her.  A few minutes later a male manager came over to discuss the situation and said again that round of drinks was on them.

We both had fish and things got better. The black bass was tasty and with good spice and an okay mixture of flavors. The smoked cod was very good in it's juice and justified it's hype.

2.0,8/13/2011,"Being the ""It"" restaurant a la moment, and after having garnered a glowing review from Sam Sifton in the New York Times, I absolutely had to try The Dutch for dinner. A previous brunch at Locande Verde was a delicious experience so I had high hopes for Andrew Carmellini's newest venture. Regrettably, it was one of the more unfortunate new restaurant experiences I've had in recent memory. My date and I were walk-ins on a Friday night. I had called earlier in the day for a reservation at that time and was told (twice!) that they were totally booked for the evening. They suggested I walk-in but included the ominous warning that the wait, ""could stretch to an hour or an hour and half."" Undaunted, I appeared at the restaurant at 10:30 and was promptly seated, no wait. I knew what the reservationist did not: that on an August weekend in New York, late at night, NO restaurant is THAT popular. But, better for them to make me fear the worst than show up disappointed. Unfortunately, when I did sit down it was perhaps at the most unpleasant table in the restaurant: in the room dominated by the bar and next to the loud swinging door to the kitchen. If you're sat at this table, do what you can to move, it's maddening. The bar scene in the center of the room was a cluster of 20 and 30-something women, none weighing more than 110lbs and each wearing a dress that costs more than my rent. This is, of course, exactly the clientele I expected at the Dutch, so perhaps I'm wrong to complain, but the din created by this gaggle was absolutely deafening. I am used to loud restaurants. I love loud restaurants. But this! THIS was a NASA launch. I could detect no audible ambient music in the restaurant, something that might have cut through the shrieks and chatter.Of course, all would be forgiven if the meal had lived up to the buzz. In this department The Dutch failed most noticeably. We started with two specialty cocktails, the Bellweather and Dutch Courage, neither of which particularly impressed. We ordered two oyster sandwiches to start. Then, per the New York Times suggestion, the dressed crab appetizer and the asparagus with pork belly appetizer. For a main course we settled on the cod, the duck and a side of Broccoli Rabe. Every meal starts with a loaf of jalapeno-cornbread brought out to the table, complimentary. The cornbread is good, though a little less spicy than I was hoping for. This starter is a bit of a tease. It makes you anticipate a down-home comfort food meal ahead. That is not what we were served. The first items brought out were the appetizers. The crab was simple, showing off the natural flavor of the dish. Still, I didn't quite understand all the praise. The Asparagus was a mess. I usually love poached egg over Asparagus but this dish threw what tasted like Cheap Chinese Sweet N' Sour Pork all over the place, all but neutralizing the subtle flavor of the vegetable and the creamy goodness of the egg yolk. I really disliked it. Next the bus boy brought out our main courses: cod and duck. Both fared better than our appetizers. Of course, we noticed right away that our oyster sandwiches had been forgotten but, with our main courses piping hot and sitting in front of us, we decided to just forge ahead. The duck was actually delicious, amply portioned with a salty crust; it was a good preparation of the bird. The pilaf it was served on was less memorable but, given the tastiness of the duck, that's not necessarily a criticism. The cod was tender and subtle; the mushrooms it came with stood out. Here, unlike the asparagus appetizer, subtle flavors were allowed to come to the fore. Finally when the waiter came back to ask about dessert I mentioned the missing oyster sandwiches. He apologized and, graciously, offered dessert on the house. This turned out to be my favorite course. I sampled the Mint Chocolate Chip Ice Cream served with cherry sorbet. A deep lover of anything mint chocolate, the ice cream was delicious, though the addition of the sorbet was gilding the lily just a bit. My date got the Chocolate Cake with White Russian Ice Cream and Meringue Crust. It was a nice change from the usual flowerless chocolate cake served at every other restaurant in New York.After exiting out onto Prince St, my date mentioned to me that we had never received our side order of Broccoli Rabe. I was flabbergasted. That sealed the deal for me: The Dutch just wasn't all that it was cracked up to be. With its busy, noisy bar and soft, diffuse lighting the restaurant aspires to a warm conviviality  that doesn't quite match its often over-thought food preparation. After 11:30 The Dutch serves a late-night menu that includes a delicious looking burger and a traditional Fried Chicken entree. This is probably better than the over-priced, almost fussy food I ordered at dinner. Bottom-Line - Skip The Dutch.",5,2,1,Matt S.,"New York, NY",245,4,0

I highly suggest the Dutch Iced Tea on warm summer day.To start, they give you a loaf of their freshly baked jalapeño cornbread which starts to set the stage for things to come.

4.0,8/6/2011,"Because the Dutch messed up our reservation before, I decided to boycott this trendy and boisterious gastropub but I finally gave in and decided to give it a try out of curiousity because every time I pass by this restaurant, it's always packed no matter what day it is! Therefore I was convinced to assume that there must be something really amazing about this place.I came here on Tuesday night at 6:15pm and the place was already packed as usual. Unless all the party has arrived, you won't get seated even if you have a reservation. The interior is beautifully covered with white brick walls and dark woods, the decor feels a bit old school and European, and yet hip and casual at the same time. The noise level is high and the tables were so cramped that it's hard not to disturb others if you need to get up. There were many Wall St. type as well as beautiful young hipsters/model type,some older folks, and some young geeky foodies taking food pictures(I bet they are Yelpers!!).I've had the following:1) Complimentary corn bread: 4.5 stars. YUM!!! This is not your regular corn bread, it has a slightly more complex layer of flavors enhanced with spices.2) Asian White Boy Ribs : 4.5 stars. Love the name!! Not bad for a white boy, well done! LOL! The meat was tender and perfectly marinated3) Housemade Fries:5 stars! I LOVE THESE FRIES! So crispy, so good!4) Orecchiette : 5 stars!!! Wow, this inventive orecchiette was surprisingly delicious! I liked it more than the conventional orecchiette I've had in Puglia! 5) Dutch Courage: this drink was waaay too strong for me so I made my friend finish it. The drinks are expensive, like $14.6) Lime pie with coconut ice cream: 4.5 stars. I love the hint of saltiness! And the graham cracker crust was a nice touch.Overall, the food here is very solid and exceeded my expectations. The Dutch elavates simple casual food to tasty gourmet dish.  However, this place is not cheap, and I do feel the food is overpriced even though they are delicious. Prepare to spend around $50 and up. I was a bit annoyed by the waiter, he was trying to rush us out and brought the bill before I even started eating my dessert. Minus 1 star!

When we asked to be seated at the other available table for two, she said we should follow her back to the hostess stand. Mid way she barked ""Stay here."" We stood in a busy hallway for about 5 minutes when another women (whom we learned later was the manager) came and told us it would be a minute. Five minutes later she came back and told us that unfortunately she could not accommodate our request since the other table had been ""reserved."" She didn't know what to say when my husband pointed out that if they knew they wouldn't give us the other table (because it had been ""reserved""), they had no reason to make us stand for 10 minutes in a crowded place. She then asked if we would like to wait for a table at the bar. If they made us stand there for 10 minutes for no discernible reason, image how long we would have to wait for a table.

5.0,8/2/2011,"Sunday near midnight, and SoHo slips into silence. The roads are empty. Footsteps sound into the blackness. Boutique shop windows become dark mirrors. Voids.Here and there, the oil still burns. An Italian taps out his cigarette at a cafe table. A model's heels click-click away from an airy loft. But chiefly it is a vacant movie set, Gotham City writ large without the extras, or the principals. Except me. For several blocks, *I* am the principal, floating joyfully down the sidewalk like a freed shadow.Then, as Sullivan Street approaches, the air starts to hum. Barely audible white noise begins to resolve into low-level chatter. Soon, the sources appear: nattily-dressed New Yorkers collected in pools of amber light. My sojourn has brought me here. This is the Dutch.Stepping over its threshold, I become corporeal again. I feel the weight of the 14 hours I have just spent on call in the hospital. I am tired. I am frazzled. I am dressed in formless scrubs carelessly arranged around me like yesterday's bedsheets. The Dutch's black-clad hostess looks like my antimatter: lissome and graceful, each blond lock of hair trailing enticingly down the Bezier curve of her sleek neck. Yet she brooks no hesitation as she glides over the floor, leading me to a stool at the raw counter. Centrally located. Elevated.This is no Monkey Bar: for the pittance of the price of a meal, you too can be placed in the midst of an urban fantasia, a NYC that hardly exists outside the confines of film. I settle in. On one side, the ethanol-kissed repartee between patrons at the bar. On the other, the patter of seated diners. Vibrant exchanges between old friends. Business deals racing against the Nikkei's closing bell. Dates angling obliquely towards some far-off bedroom... I almost begin to believe that the celluloid city exists after all.But before it is a lightning-in-a-bottle repository of cinematic tropes, the Dutch is a restaurant. At first blush, $5 for a single fried oyster in a tiny bun seems steep, the result of some hype-induced tariff. But the fun-sized po' boy nearly knocks me off my stool. A red-hot blast of the sea, bursting forth from its crackled breading, balanced by a pickled okra remoulade. Three bites, but of bliss -- $5 is not too much to ask for that.As I wait for my main course, memories of Carmellinis past wash over me. A trio of elegant tartares (Cafe Boulud). A cherry-glazed duck meatball stuffed with foie gras (A Voce). A poached egg bleeding its golden yolk over cotechino hash (Locanda Verde). Uniformly fantastic, but old Andrews all, chained to continental Europe. An oyster slider? A mere introduction to New Andrew's new American-eclectic. Barrio tripe. Rabbit pot pie. Peel n'eat sweet shrimp.Ever the nostalgic, I opt for a page out of the appendix of AC's old playbook instead. Years ago, those in the know whispered reverently about his fried chicken. At the time, that it was coming out of a French kitchen (Cafe Boulud) made it all the more louche. No less than David Chang had taken it as inspiration. Years later, in 2011, AC had to take it off the Dutch's dinner menu: too MANY people had been ordering it.But I am here at the witching hour, when the bird rises again like a phoenix. Is its appearance on the late-night menu just canny exploitation of supply-and-demand? I look around at what AC et al. have wrought: a modern space that also feels timeless. A clientele both attractive and simply New York. A charisma seemingly electrostatically embedded into the room air. I cannot believe that *all* of these things can be impassively calculated, ruthlessly planned, coldly executed. There must also be some luck there. Some magic.Magic seems the right word when the chicken arrives. Buttermilk brined. Old Bay laced. Faintly sweet, definitely spicy. Gorgeous skin. Succulent flesh. Each element could be a soloist, yet none dominates. This is what the haute-comfort-food revolution promised, and what it so often fails to deliver. Only a consummate chef like Carmellini can do this: take a breather from veal pizzaiola and asparagus okonomiyaki to toss off one of the finest fried chickens in the city. Accompanying biscuits soaked in honey-butter seem almost unsportsmanlike, a basketball team running up the score. But they too are wonderful.I pay my check. I tip my hat to the hostess who had placed me front and center. She flashes me a smile. As I step out of the charmed space, I find myself licking my fingers. I know intellectually that I have already washed my hands, that any effort to taste even the faintest echo of Old Bay or honey glaze is futile. But I know too that this meal, in this restaurant, in this city, will take a proud place amongst my eating memories. I shift back into the spectral plane, and I, the prince of Prince Street for a few moments more, take flight into the deepening night.Probability of return within 1 year: 100%",6,4,11,Lawrence C.,"New York, NY",82,215,0
4.0,8/2/2011,"Really, really enjoyed my first (of many to come) visits to this spot.Went with a friend for dinner...couldn't get a reservation beforehand, but I found their host staff to be super accommodating both on the phone and in-person.

2.0,7/31/2011,"Upon hearing about Andrew Carmellini's new food project, I made eating at The Dutch a priority once I moved into the city.  I had had a terrific experience at Locanda Verde before and had heard great things about AC's two previous restaurants, Cafe Boulud and A Voce, and was expecting great things from The Dutch.  The Dutch is clearly a place of the moment.  The scene is fashionable and the food modern - what AC may call American, is a crazy and delicious reflection of what American society is - a melting pot of cultures.  The food: I ordered the soft scrambled eggs whiles my dining companions got the flapjacks, eggs okomiyaki (because as one person said, ""they sounded so cool!""), and the fried chicken.  The soft scrambled eggs arrived and my dining companions quickly commented on how they looked like egg soup with a bagel.  Unenthralled I dug in and upon receipt of the first bite, I emerged, re-enthralled by The Dutch.  Because of the simplicity of scrambled eggs, I had expected diner quality scrambled eggs accompanied by trout roe, sable, and a bagel.  What I got instead was satisfying and delicious.  While the non-scrambled eggs components were too salty or too ""eh"" when tasted individually, the synergy of the components when tasted together was marvelous.  I also tried the flapjacks that one of my companions got.  They were sweet and fluffy (although not too sweet) and not even mildly dry like those of AC's other restaurant, Locanda Verde.  After we were done with our brunch entrees, we ordered pies off the recommendations of seemingly every food critic that has reviewed The Dutch and well they are correct.  The pies at The Dutch are very tasty and inspired frequent shouts of ""This is good pie!"" or ""Whoa, I never really liked pie till now!"".  So treat yourself to some pie and be happy my friends.Service:  Quality service.  My water cup was never left unfilled and I never felt neglected by the wait staff.  One of my dining companions realized that he had an allergy to one of the components of the Eggs Okonomiyaki and the wait staff immediately and attentively addressed the issue as well as comping us the dish.   There was a slightly awkward period between when we ordered and when we got our food because the food took some time (not a lot) but there was nothing to munch on while we waited for our food to arrive.Ambiance:  Loud.  We were shouting across the table the entire time while speaking to get over the din of the dining room and even then we struggled to hear one another.  Because of the loudness of the room, the tables next to us were turned twice while we were eating.The scene:  Leans towards the trendier side as is customary, although if you're not that cool you won't feel too out of place because you will see the occasional tourist and not-cool diner (like me!)I may or may not return again for brunch, but am definitely interested in coming for dinner.half star for the eggs, half star for the pies.  one star for the service.  minus half star for the noise.  half star for the dining atmosphere.Two stars.",1,0,0,Stephen T.,"Manhattan, NY",33,21,0
3.0,7/30/2011,"Seeing all these reviews, I thought to myself, how can this place only be 3.5 stars?  Everyone must be crazy if they think the followup to Locanda Verde is in comparison, a disappointment.  Well, they're not.  I came here on a Monday night around 9 and found a 30 minute wait, which actually wasn't too bad given the popularity.  A drink at the bar later, we were seated and chowing down not too long after.  I started off with the little oyster sandwich.  Basically deep fried oyster sliders which was good.  I think it had the right amount of sauce since you could still taste that oyster flavor.  Next was the pecan duck.  Also a good dish, lots of flavor, good texture, but something was missing that I can't put my finger on.And therein lies the problem.  I think the bar and expectations were so high after Locanda Verde, that relatively, The Dutch just doesn't give you the same wow factor leaving it at only 3.5 stars.  It's not a bad spot by any means, but if you're going to spend $60 at dinner, I think there are some better choices in the area.",1,0,1,David W.,"New York, NY",168,834,0
1.0,7/29/2011,"We came in on a Thursday night at 8pm and were told it was a one-hour wait, but that the bar keeps their own list for bar seating. We were happy to find that we were the only ones on the list to be seated at the bar.  So we ordered a couple of drinks, and watched as most of the bar got crowed with people ordering drinks and occupying the chairs while drinking (not eating). When two people got up, those two seats were quickly occupied by other drinkers. The bartenders did not care to tell them that those seats were going to be used for dining, and that we were a the list. So..being next on the list for food didn't mean much. People pulled away the bar stools  to sit next to their friends, and the bartenders didn't care to tell them that those seats would be needed for diners. An hour later and after questioning the bartenders a couple of times, I approached the hostesses, who tried to be helpful, but said they really couldn't control if someone else sat down in our seat (?!..what's the purpose of a list then?). We asked if we could put our names onto the regular restaurant wait list (and perhaps higher up, since we had essentially waited one hour thinking we could be seated at the bar and the initial restaurant wait had been an hour), and they said they couldn't do that. Rather than waiting another hour at the bar for the bartenders to give us a seat (and fend off others who try to sit in it), we left.

There.is.just.no.way.We had: raw oysters, crab claws, asian ribs, oyster sliders, fried green tomatoes with shrimp, tomato burrata salad, lettuce w/ buttermilk dressing salad, black cod, quail & NY strip, and sides of french fries and mexican corn.  Which is to say, we tried a lot. If it wasn't average, it was far below average. That being said, I'm going to go ahead and pretend like A.C. has never even stepped in the kitchen here. We did, however, have a great time. Go for the vibe, for the drinks, and for the wine (which oddly the sommelier pours himself a glass of your wine away from the table, and never metions doing so, before bringing back the opened bottle to your table). Perhaps if you have enough to drink (assuming the wine guy doesn't drink all your wine) before your food arrives, it tastes better.",2,0,0,Annie E.,"New York, NY",4,41,1

We got there on time and proceeded to sit in the back room which was totally empty until 7:30. This was so lame. Their perceived exculsivity is contrived and odd. The other diners that trickled in after 7pm were out of towner/tourist types....maybe the crowd improves after 9? The food was small, overpriced and not great. Our waitress was rude and pushy. We ordered several appetizers to share and said we would order our entrees after we had appetizers. She said the ""kitchen"" prefers people order all at once. I actually think ""she"" would have preffered that we order all at once, but that wasnt happening. She didnt serve our table their famous cornbread becuase she ""thought we were going to order entrees""- or something lame like that. She screwed up our bill and overcharged us by 330$.

The asparagus okonomiyaki was also quite good; the perfectly cooked egg pulled the dish together, with the bonito flakes adding a nice contrast.     Entrees: The scallops with corn and bacon were very good.  The pecan duck with dirty rice was OK; the duck was slightly overcooked, and the dish was overpowered by the rice.Service: Our server was great, striking the perfect balance of being attentive without being doting or intrusive.  However, the spacing of the courses was quite rushed, particularly given the richness of the food.  I could have used more time between courses to recover.  Atmosphere: Loved the overall decor, which also benefitted from the famous and attractive patrons filling the tables and banquettes.  However, as noted by so many others, it is quite loud throughout the restaurant.  The front room, which includes the bar, was a cacophony.  We were fortunately seated in the back room, though it, too, was still rather loud.  And while the place does have air conditioning, on this hot summer night it barely kept pace with the heat from the kitchen, so that it was rather warm inside.",0,0,0,D J.,"Boston, MA",0,11,0

4.0,7/18/2011,"The Dutch suits the neighborhood. Beautiful dining area with attention to detail that compliments the beautiful clientele that dine here. Unlike some gorgeous model that lacks substance, The Dutch proves that it's more than a pretty facade and not just an of the moment hot spot. To start, our assortment celebrated summer with fresh, bright dishes such as the dressed crab, lightly paired with a bloody mary and green goddess sauce that subtlety highlights the freshness of the crab. The arugula with honey kissed melon and prosciutto, a new rendition of an old favorite goes down easy as well. Little oyster sandwiches evenly coated with a light batter was fried just enough to make it crispy while leaving the inside moist and bursting with briny juices. Although the Asian white boy ribs sounded like another cliche, the meat that barely clung onto the bones was done well and without a heavy hand on the five spice. For entrees, simplicity at its best is displayed with the ricotta ravioli - tender pillows of pasta floating atop a light, tangy tomato sauce that highlights the smokey ricotta inside. Scallops perfectly seared medium, get to showcase their sweetness with spring peas, bacon and pickled ramps. Although the rabbit pot pie was touted as a specialty, I wasn't too thrilled about the cracker like crust, and unexciting filling. Whether it was because it was 90 degrees out or that I'm too attached to a traditional flaky crust, I could have used that stomach room for extra dessert.If a restaurant isn't known for its desserts, the offerings are usually boring after thoughts, a menu filler as part of some checklist of requirements. However I was wonderfully surprised with the pies and yes, we ordered two of them! The sour cherry pie with cream cheese ice cream and lime pie with coconut ice cream, and graham cracker crust are not to be missed! Throw in a strawberry shortcake if you must, as the honey biscuit and granita welcome a new twist to this classic. Never mind that our waitress was like cardboard and we would have rather enjoyed the company of the friendly back waiter serving us. Never mind that the guy sitting next to me at the adjacent table spilled his water splashing some on my seat and purse without an acknowledgment or the slightest feeling of remorse. Never mind that a name like Asian white boy ribs would cause one to raise an eyebrow because the food is just plain good.

5.0,7/1/2011,"This may be my new favorite restaurant. The vibe is about the same as the breslin. Loud, stylish people with a douchebaggery level around 7. 930 on Thursday night was packed. the bar took 15 min to get a drink and 15 min to get our table. Once we sat 15 after our stated reservation time I was quickly happy that we got a table in the main dining room. There are seats in the bar are, but you would need to yell through dinner.  I would gladly wait 15 min for the corner table we got.Service was a bit unattentive, but the food was fucking GREAT.We order some beausoleil oysters which were expertly shucked. No mangled bodies. Standard mignonette of red wine vinegar and shallot, with the addition of tons of course cracked pepper. House made hot sauce was a rendition of Tapatio a bit stronger on the vinegar. I didn't the the cocktail sauce. The oyster were ice cold, fresh and delicious.Asparagus Okonomiyaki with Poached egg: This was my favorite thing of the night. It had the flavors of okonomiyaki, but completely different textures. i am a sucker for a beautifully poached egg, and this egg was perfect. The subtle sauces added that okonimiyaki flavor and the bonito flakes add a smoky seafood saltiness. Lightly battered and glazed rock shrimp and pork belly accompany this dish perfectly. This has got to be one of the most creative dishes I've ever had. I had a wow moment after the first bite and it wouldn't be the last of the meal.Dressed crab with bloody mary and green goddess: tender lump crab dressed with celery seed and stuff. Bloody mary broth that was lightly spicey and salty. There were shiny dots of green oil floating in the bloody mary that i will assume was green goddess. This was wonderful and light and refreshing. I kept thinking, this would be so much better if there were a few freshly shucked oysters floating in the bloody mary. I will be stealing this recipe and making it next time i do a brunch.Lamb loin chop: Keens has some competition now. They use the same cut. If you can't recognize it think lamb porterhouse steaks connected at the top of the T. (yes i'm confused too.) This was topped with olive marmalade. Lamb was medium rare and perfectly cooked. Each bite melted in my mouth. Nicely seasoned and the marmalade was actually awesome. i was thinking it would be a sweet tapenade, but it was thankfully not. i cant really describe it, but it totally worked and worked well. the belly bacon was cut and place on the side of the plate. Dont throw them out. just cut off the fat and eat the small bit of belly.the water cress salad with radishes was nicely dressed and perfect.i kept thinking to myself who's chop is better: keens or dutch. i'll say they are of equal quality. keens is simple and all about the natural taste of the lamb while dutch's has the marmelade that totally adds to the chop.French Fries: Can french fries be light? well these are. They were like the fries the McDonalds aspires to be. delicious.we didnt order a fish dish, but saw may people eating them. Each piece of fish looked perfectly cooked. i'll try one next time.Lime pie with coconut sorbet: very good tart pie with yummy not over coconutty sorbet. i'm not huge on dessert, but it was good.This place has pretty much everything i like, raw bar, runny egg yolks, chops, pork belly, but nothing was too heavy (or course the chop was.) as soon as i walk out i was planning my next visit.",1,1,0,Michael S.,"Castro Valley, CA",15,227,22

My dining companion ordered a full dinner, starting with oysters, and everything was fine - but I just ordered a glass of wine and it never came.

3.0,6/28/2011,"This is a hard review to write.  On one side of the coin, the food was good.  I think my friend would even say it was amazing.  The service was questionable, but in the end was o.k.  Let me explain....First my friend ordered oysters, and let the waiter pick.  She loved them!  For dinner I ordered the peel and eat shrimp, she the scallops.  When my shrimp came, they had the full bodies....head, tentacle things (or whatever they're called), and were staring at me!  I don't consider myself to be unclassy, but 99.9% of the peel and eat shrimp I've had don't look like they directly jumped out of the ocean onto my plate.  When I told the manager and waiter I didn't expect them to have the heads on, I got some attitude.  ""Well you ordered peel and eat shrimp???""(which they said 3 times to me), as I should have known they should have heads.  I asked them to just cut off the heads, but instead the waiter came back and said, ""is there something else you would like to order?""  ""O.k.??  I'll have the swordfish"", I said.  They promptly came back with my new dish (scary shrimp were never to be seen again) and it was excellent (my friend loved her scallops too).  After our meals were delivered however, our waiter just seemed to forget us (or was totally over me, but I swear I was nice).  We were both done with our glasses of wine, and never got asked if we would like another.  In the end, they kindly did not include the peel and eat full bodied shrimp on the bill, which was very nice.  I don't know if I would go back though, due to attitude of the staff, as well as lack of choices for us non-oyster, non-meat eaters.  One other note:  cool atmosphere, but it is very loud.  Had a problem hearing my friend across the table from me!",0,1,0,Christine L.,"Columbus, OH",63,227,5

The waitstaff was friendly and seamless.My friend and I split the pancakes with fresh blueberry sauce and the more seasonal softshell crab sandwich with a spicy mayo. I don't even know how to decide which I liked better, the sweet or savory. I wanted to devour the pancakes, but almost felt like I should eat them as the dessert to the mammoth sandwich, which I was upset I had eaten so quickly... the pancakes were not out of the ordinary but the blueberry sauce was the perfect topping.Can't wait to go back and try their dinner menu.",0,0,0,Jess K.,"Manhattan, NY",297,269,2
3.0,6/26/2011,"I had never heard of The Dutch before and randomly found myself there on a Monday night with co-workers. Wasn't really sure what kind of experience I was in for.I found the decor and ambiance energetic and lively. The restaurant filled up very quickly and it was almost elbow to elbow at the bar in no time. We ordered a round of drinks and placed our bets on the appetizers and entrees. Appetizers: The eggplant dip with savory chips were a bit too soggy for me and lacked the punch that I had expected with such an interesting dish. Next up came the Asian White Boy Ribs. They had a mild kick and the meat fell off the bone like butta and were very delicious, but nothing over the top special. What truly made this meal pop were the oysters! Superb and fresh, these lil shells of joy were exactly what I needed to make my night. We ordered the Misty Points and the Kusshi. The Kusshi were tiny and were less grainy, while the Misty Points were much larger and grainier. Delicious is an understatement, these bad boys felt like they came directly from the ocean. Kudos on the freshness!Entree: For my entree I ordered the scallop with bacon and peas. A delicate dish with two main flavor components that dance with each other like tango. The sweetness of the peas vs. the saltiness of the scallop/bacon was phenomenal. A great dish that lingers on your tongue for hours after.Dessert: Our team dove into the devil's food cake like deep sea divers looking for ancient treasure. The sounds coming from our table were reminiscent of 70s pornos, the ecstatic look of satisfaction on the face of my fellow foodie was enough to make me want to come back for more. As the night continued, we found the crowds getting larger and larger and our waiter seeming more and more impatient.

5.0,6/21/2011,"All too often, these heavily-hyped, impossible to get into places are letdowns.  In my estimation, the Dutch is exactly the opposite - outstanding.I had some time to kill at the bar, so I ordered a drink and some oysters.  The cocktail program could use a little work - the menu cocktails mostly sounded bad, so I ordered a Sazerac, which was made expertly.  That was followed by a few wines by the glass, none of which I particularly took to, but each was an interesting selection.The dining room is much quieter than the front bar/oyster room area, and wasn't even full despite the throngs of people waiting for tables (sadly, this was one totem of highly-hyped restaurants that the Dutch did display).  Our main waiter was knowledgeable and friendly, as was the sommelier, who has assembled an excellent list of unusual and well-priced wines that go far beyond the basics.Our food was universally outstanding. Items ordered were the shrimp and fried green tomatoes, dressed crab, lamb neck mole, and scallops with bacon.  All excellent - all worth a return visit. I should return briefly to the service, as I saw some complaints in other posts.  It sounds like the restaurant, like most, had some trouble finding its footing at first on the service front, but I see no such problems now.  In fact, although I expected SoHo-style, ""I don't want to be here/I'm better than this/I don't care"" attitude from the waitstaff, I found them to be the exact opposite - knowledgeable about food, interested in what the chef was doing, extremely friendly and helpful.  In fact, I would say the service had an overall Danny Meyerish quality - it was that good.  Believe the hype - The Dutch is worth your time.",1,0,0,Jonas B.,"Brooklyn, NY",257,92,3
3.0,6/16/2011,"The first trip the the Dutch was love at first sight. We got there late after a show, and the place was bumping. Music, people, drinking, it had the feeling of a really fun place and the fact that the food was tasty made it all even better. I was dying to try the fried chicken, but we had come late and they were out. They'd only been open for three days when we first came through, so they were still ironing out some kinks. We opted for raw oysters (fresh and delicious), scallops which were perfectly cooked, but the best part of the meal was the mini oyster sandwiches. They were fried to the heavens and placed on top of fluffy, light buns. The seafood ceviche didn't do all that much, but it was good enough. The drinks are eh, but that night, we didn't care with all the good eats and the devil's food cake was ah-mazing! We also were given a free glass of rosé after some dishes fell and made a mini ruckus.Fast-forward to May 26th, it was my birthday. We couldn't get a reservation around 8, so we decided to do an early meal at 6 since we had plans for later anyway. We get there, and the vibe was entirely different. Lots of tight-assed businessmen and their lady friends, and other self-important jerks. Let's just say, we're much edgier than that and apparently didn't fit. They placed us all the way in the back, like BAAACK, next to the dishes, towels, and forks. On our first trip, we were seated in the front and it was awesome. The chef came out to say hi, the servers were cool, it was like a whole other restaurant, and we fit in just fine. Everything was so different on the second go. We wanted some Lambrusco, this time, but they didn't have it. Cool, we got champagne. There was no fried chicken...again. They apparently only serve it late night...okay. It was my birthday and I had my heart set on it, but fine. We ordered more of those luscious oyster sandwiches (they're still wonderful), more raw oysters (still fresh), and hanger steak (perfectly cooked medium and succulent). We were okay all in all, until the table next to us received a free plate of fried oysters, because the restaurant didn't have a wine that the table wanted (they weren't even going to buy a bottle, this was by the glass). Mind you, this was after we just ordered like 3 different appetizers, 4 glasses of champagne, 2 main courses, and desserts (the strawberry rhubarb, very good). They didn't have the wine we wanted either, but we weren't special enough. Lastly, the tables in THE BACK were placed so close together, that when I stepped out to go to the bathroom, the table moved and our champagne landed on the floor. There was no offer to refill or anything. After spending well over $250, they just made us feel like our business was not as important as some of the others there, when we were spending more money in comparison.

I guess I was under the impression that it was a restaurant first with a bar area. The bar, though, is right in the center of the restaurant and it's LOUD. The hostess said that if we wanted to sit in the quiet section we should make a reservation, but honestly it was not all that much more quiet. I don't have a problem with noise when I'm expecting it, but I just had no idea that I was going to be shouting to give the waiter my order. The service was average, I think hampered by the fact that they couldn't communicate very well with us due to the noise.

2.0,6/15/2011,"This place is so in-vogue it intimidated me to even walk by it, let alone sit inside for a meal. Even on a rainy tuesday night the place was packed with hipster hat, retro eyewear, scruffy-on-purpose beard, short skirt clad, model crowd. After a 45 minute wait a friend and I dared to sit among these über-cool patrons. Unfortunately, the hipness was so all-encompassing that even when shouting at each other across the table we couldn't understand a word of what the other person was trying to say so we gave up and literally ate our entire meal from start to finish in silence (well, in über-cool boisterous din sort of silence).Our waitress took an unusually long time to take our order, but was helpful when she did, answering all of our intricate questions with ease.We started with the eggplant dip with chips and the spring salad with buttermilk dressing, green beans and radishes. The dip was pretty standard nothing too exciting to report, the salad was creamy and came in a pleasant huge portion. The radishes added a wonderful crunchy texture to the mix, and the lettuces were well selected, having a nice fresh green vibrance to them. However none of that compared to the fantastic scallion-chile cornbread that came on the side. Having spent several years baking bread professionally, its very rare that I find myself considering any sort of bread 'fantastic' but this one truly was impressive, probably the best cornbread I've ever had. I found myself ignoring most of the other food and eating slice after slice of the tasty loaf, golden and crisp on the outside, fluffy and moist on the inside, wonderfully aromatic bites of scallion and chile appearing on the palate every so often. My dining companion and I finished the whole loaf before our plate of ravioli made it out to the table. The smoked ricotta in said ravioli was interesting but I found the tomato sauce it came in to be over-salted. Also, the ravioli might have benefited from a minute or two less cooking time and a heavier hand with the herbs.Already feeling the effects of such a large quantity of cornbread, but wanting to have the full Dutch experience, we gave in and order a single dessert to share: the Spring Sundae. What a mistake! Where to begin with how to describe it, well, it was bad. Very, very Bad. The kind of bad where you take a bite and then decide how you are going to manage to swallow said bite. The sorbet was sticky sweet and horribly icy. The blondie was a grainy, over-baked, sugary mess. The rhubarb was sticky, overly sweet as well, and was off in both texture and temperature. The candied lemon rind tasted of antiseptic. This was one of the rare times in my restaurant experiences when I actually sent a dish back, not wanting to offend the kitchen, but also not wanting to force myself to eat another bite. I have to hand it to the wait-staff though, as they took the dish back without much protest. The black pepper chocolate cake that ended up replacing our sundae, was, unfortunately, not much better. The cake was dry, the filling bland, the black pepper undetectable. The meringue on the outside was more of the overly sweet, under flavored letdown we'd already experienced. On a positive note I did semi-enjoy the white russian ice cream sitting on top of some crunchy cocoa nibs, but then, how wrong can you go with cocoa nibs and ice cream? Am I missing something; are bad desserts suddenly in-vogue these days? If so, I'm happy not being cool.I was rather relieved to walk out the door into the nice quiet street. All that hip noise had given me a headache. Or maybe I was just crashing after all that bad sugar? It was an interesting experience but I'll definitely be sticking with the slightly less hip setting, but substantially more solid food at Locanda Verde in the future.",3,0,2,Melanie M.,"New York, NY",6,42,144

We then ordered smoked ricotta ravioli. It was smoky and perfectly al dante, but its tomato sauce was unbelievable. It was fresh and tangy and obviously made in house not from the can. We then each ordered the fried chicken and some french fries. We should have ordered just one order of the chicken instead of two as we took one order home. It was huge. It has four large pieces of juicy and crispy fried chicken with two honey glazed biscuits and some cole slaw. I mean, wow.. The biscuits were delicious. The best ever. The chicken was good too....It was juicy, crispy and even had some spiciness. It was lacking some seasonings though. Some salt would have went a long way. Now, the fries were pretty great as well.

Well, the bar was busy and and the dining room was half full at 830. We did get seated. We already started the night off with the reservation confusion. I mean, my bf asked for a table in an hour, it's not as if he only said the specific time that confused the other person on the other end of the phone. Then they forgot to give us a loaf of corn bread. Ladies beside us that were seated after us, got a loaf of corn bread right away! It looked dry, so we didn't bother asking about it. My bf ordered the Sullivan platter that had probably 4 different oysters, clams, ceviche, crayfish, cooked Hawiian shrimp. I love the shrimps. I might have to order just an order of that next time. The others were not the best,. The condiments were no the best pairing. Their vinegar is a bit too strong for some of the oysters. I wish they had horseradish too. My bf would say the value is there. It's just too much work to shell the crayfish for me.Like other yelpers commented, the oyster sandwich and the ribs were delicious. The beets and smoked eggs were great too. Big plate of fries for $7. Not bad!I wish I had the room for dessert. Another time!Overall, the bar seemed busier early in the evening, and the dining room was packed by 11pm. It was difficult to flag down our server at the end to get our bill. The entire wait staff was pretty good with the entire service though.",0,0,0,Doris L.,"Toronto, Canada",30,172,179

3.0,6/2/2011,The restaurant is beautiful especially after siiting vacant for so long after the aweful cub room closed.  The food was decent but nothing absolutely fantastic.  The pork chop was tastt but an incredibly fatty piece of meat.  Two people ordered the pork chop and both were very fatty.  The bass dish was very strange.  The topping was light and summery but on a bed of BBQ sauce and a Spanish type of rice.  Weird combo that didn't work.  Very reasonably priced for the quality of food tho.  Service was pleasant and consistent.,0,0,0,Ji Won S.,"New York, NY",8,20,0

Service: we were there probably in week 3 and the staff were literally running around like maniacs in a PACKED place. The one thing I noticed consistently was that they were all smiling and extremely polite in a situation that would certainly be unnerving for anyone. We didn't get served early on, when were approached what seemed to be the sommelier he offered gracefully to serve us. He proved to be not only a great server but recommended a great bottle that wasn't rip of your face expensive.

2.0,5/29/2011,"I have never written a review before but I absolutely had to in this instance...I just had dinner at The Dutch this evening. The ambience My boyfriend and I had each a starter and an entree. Starter was okay nothing amazing but still good: beet salad and tartare.For our entrees we both ordered the dry aged NY strip. I ordered medium rare and my boyfriend ordered rare/bloody. When our entrees arrived at the table we both notice that the steaks looked like they were cooked the same, medium rare. We pointed this out to our waitress who assured him that is was rare. Considering the dim lighting we assumed she was correct. But we cut into the center of the steak and still found it to be in fact medium and nothing close to rare. We asked a table service man to take it back and replaced it with a rare steak. 10 minutes pass and the Manager (tall man with dark hair and black eye glasses) comes to our table with the same steak butchered into thin slices. He then starts giving us a tutorial on how steak is cooked and what is the definition of rare. I then cut into my steak (medium rare) and place the meat next to the ""rare"" steak which looks EXACTLY the same. We point this out the Manager. Instead of realizing that we are not children and this is not the first time we've eaten in a restaurant nor ordered a steak before, he then offers to recook MY STEAK (which was actually cooked very well). Totally ignoring the fact that we had proven our point and that we are highly dissatisfied with the dish. Never did I say that my steak was not cooked properly but in this scenario in order to make the Manager ""correct"" he wanted to ""fix"" my dish... So stoops! In the end we ended up eating the damn thing because it was getting late in the evening and it was just really humiliating the way we were being treated.The music was little loud but not obnoxiously so;Drinks: I don't drink so much but I do have wine for dinner and the selection by the glass was not bad. Typically in most restaurants you would get such. But this not not enough for me to ever come back to this restaurant.

2.0,5/29/2011,"Holy hype! Got to give credit to The Dutch's PR team which has got them written up everywhere. My date and I read all the articles and immediatly wanted to give this place a spin.Easiest way to explain this place is if Balthazar + Schiller's had a W. Villagey-feel baby. Less french, more 'fake it 'till you make it'.Long story short, no need to rush here, you can wait 'till the reservations lighten up, if at all.Food was fine, nothing out of the ordinary.  Ribs were good, but a bit fatty. Boyfriend gobbled down the fried oyster, so assume that was a success. My beet salad was tasty, but nothing that you couldn't get at 15 other restaurants. Boyfriend's pork was good, cooked well, but glaze heavy. My lamb sausage was more kielbasa than merguez (which is what I had thought) -- again, good but not memorable.So why only two stars and not three?(1) Service was a bit bizarre. We didn't see the same server/runner twice. It seemed like they just had staff loitering around until a table looked around for help. I would have liked to know who I could ask for more water...(2) I ordered two ""glasses"" of wine, both were really chintzy pours. Look, I'm happy to pay for my booze, but please then pour me a real glass...(3)  The crowd. Look, I know it's not the restaurant's fault, but let me explain. We were seated next to two guys, who must be very close with the establishment. They received some oysters ""from the kitchen"" and every runner in the restaurant came over to say hi. The problem with these two was their disgusting, too loud for the distance between the tables, filthy language. I had no interest hearing about ""his boss' tits,"" or how they were going to go to Oak later because the guy ""knows the owner and we'll definitely get f*ck#d"" The amount of swearing and the pissing contest these two were having was gross. And to think that these were guests of the restaurant. Again, I know that it's hard to judge a restaurant by all its clientele, but this was honestly one of the worst experiences I've had dining next to anyone.

1.0,5/29/2011,"First off let me just start by saying everyone I went to dinner with got severe food poisoning. Sadly, it wasn't even worth it because the food was not really that spectacular. The black sea bass was really ordinary, sort of Mexican chain restaurant, and the vegetable entrees were overly salted. I don't mind getting severe stomachaches after a fantastic dinner but this was just not fair. Add that to the fact that the bar in the center of the restaurant is surrounded by yappy women constantly tugging their skirts down to cover their crotches. It was not a good situation. The bar people were just milling about everywhere so that they were bumping into my chair and table, and the waiters had to keep navigating through them. The noise level was awful, really raucous and the tables are long and narrow so you can't lean in close enough to hear your friends talk. I just couldn't wait to be out of there.

There's playfulness in the seating arrangements, so depending on your mood, you can sit at an open picture window facing the street, at the interior bar where all the Happy Hour action occurs, or scoop up a highly coveted table in one of their two rooms. This place serves well into the bewitching hour with a late night menu of comfort-chic bar snacks that are better than most of the food you can find around town at 2am. The Dutch is essentially billing itself as an Oyster Room, so there's a rotating list of different oysters on tap...but the thing to write home about, for me, was the pasta! Carmellini's pastas are heaven. I had the smoked ricotta ravioli with tomato and soft herbs, undeniably the perfect pasta-dish for the season. Now that spring has finally sprung and summer feels fast on its heels, all the yummy, fresh vegetation like English peas, asparagus, light cheeses and the fiddlehead ferns can contribute to the perfect ravioli dish. I think spring is the season for ravioli, no? If I were you, I would try to hit up The Dutch early or late to avoid crowds and enjoy its sexy, sceney atmosphere and delicious delectables. Eat it up!

4.0,5/19/2011,"I have been to The Dutch three times now and I really like this place a lot. Unfortunately, it will inevitably be compared to Locanda Verde, and it is not in the same league, but I think those that make that comparison are missing the point. The Dutch has more humble aspirations. The Dutch aspires to be nothing more than a really casual, and very cool, neighborhood joint serving tasty and comforing food late into the night. It overdelivers on this mission and has the potential to quickly become a Manhattan classic.Carmellini's is offering up a very modern and interesting definition of American food with dishes like his barrio tripe which pays homage to the growing Latin American influence in our culture, or his Asian white boy ribs which does the same for that culture's confluence with classic American dishes . So many places that describe themselves as serving American cuisine fall victim to all of the cliche interpretations of what that means, but Carms offers up a new and fresh menu that celebrates American cuisine for what it really is, a melting pot of different ethnic and cultural influence.Standouts for me, The Rabbit Pot Pie, sensational and unbelievably dramatic presentation, and The Lamb Neck Mole, huge portion, meltingly tender and a mole so aromatic it lingers on your palette for days. The Pork Chop was a little disappointing, dry and not as juicy as you would expect from AC. The Oyster Sandwiches are destined to be a NYC bar food classic right up there with Momo Pork Buns or Locanda Lamb Sliders. The Asian White Boy Ribs are as good as any ribs I have had in awhile and The Barrio Tripe is deeply satisfying comfort food.Shamefully, I have not tried the pie yet, but that will change soon.

Fast-forward two hours and The Dutch had turned into a sceny, crowded restaurant/bar- maybe we noticed because we were seated very close to the bar.The food was really good. Oysters were typical- oysters. Oyster sliders were tasty and small enough to not fill me with the normal guilt I experience every time I eat ANYTHING fried. The hubby had the grilled escolar, which he very much enjoyed, but was surprised when he bit into a small piece of bacon (in the beans...yuck!!). My dressed crab (bloody mary) was delicious...and reminded me why I constantly justify consuming shellfish to myself, though the rest of my diet is borderline vegan-- because shellfish so DAMN good!Dessert rolled around and we couldn't decide on one item, so we ordered two.

4.0,5/16/2011,"Came for late dinner on Saturday, pretty satisfied.My friend and I arrive at 9:45, 15 min late for our 9:30 reservation. They offered us a seat a the bar, but since we wanted to have an actual table--neither of us were in an alcohol mood--we opted to wait a bit longer. We were seated by ten.FOOD:We didn't order too much since it was late and weren't too hungry/have small ish appetites (actually this statement is false for me; my appetite varies depending on who I am eating with. I should probably eat with this friend more since she has a small appetite, and mine unfortunately--or forunately?--can expand to that of a college athlete when necessary). Anywhoo, here's what we got:Asian White Boy Ribs:I place an inordinate amount of faith in Yelp! reviews, so when Yelp!--and one of my secret Yelp! idols, Britton B (yes that was a shoutout) recommended these, I had to get them. Only $7 for two delicious bbq, falling-off-the-bone tender ribs...mmm. The bbq sauce was pretty spot on, and though the meat itself wasn't saturated with flavor it wasn't entirely bland either. Paired with the sauce, I think it was just the right amount of savory/sweetness/general awesome. AND THE MEAT WAS SO TENDER. Seriously contemplated getting another order, and probably would have if my friend wasn't one of those people with so much discipline it makes me feel bad sometimes.Little Oyster Sandwich:I had to get this too, because of Yelp. It was small for a slider but large for an oyster. And delicious. I tasted mayo, some sort of relish, and a battered, delicious oyster, and a just barely-oily and perfectly lightly toasted bun, and it was just famazing (which is shorthand for fucking amazing, in case somebody is too old to know that). I could probably eat like 8 of these, which would run me a $40 bill, but good things come from the sea in bite sizes and are tempting/prone to being potentially wallet-wreaking like that. Just ask my checking account after Yasuda the other night.ANYWHO.Ricotta Stuffed Ravioli with Soft Herbs:This was our entree. It was pretty good, too--the ravioli was al dente, which is basically 50% of my pasta judging criteria. The sauce tasted decently fresh, nice tomato-y flavor, and the pleasant surprise was that the ""soft herbs"" actually included MINT. I was expecting basil, but mint! It was an interesting and welcome twist. I'm putting fresh mint in my pasta next time I cook pasta (if I ever get around to cooking pasta).Oh, and they gave us cornbread as the obligatory bread basket-esque thing. It was decent, I liked the whipped butter they served with it, but it was a savory cornbread, and I like my cornbreads sweet, so I wasn't a huge fan. Some people like it though. I'm sure some people like it.ATMOSPHERE:Well, this is what, the third week? Andrew Carmellini's new brainchild has been open, so it is, as expected a bit sceney (don't know if it'll stay this way or become a bit more down to earth). It wasn't to the point of pretension or even enough to really bother me, but worth noting. The people around us were generally those who belong to the more trendy/likers of sceney-ness kind of New Yorkers, from 20s up to maybe even 50s? But mostly not too old. However, there was this one woman two tables away from us who had this banshee-cackle that I rung in my ears, even above the loud echo of music and talking that permeated the air. Speaking of which, this place is really fucking loud. I came here to catch up with/say bye to my friend, who I will not be seeing until next February, only to find ourselves literally leaning across the table and yelling everything in each other's ears. It probably would have been more effective to just text each other, in all honesty. Just kidding. But not really. It was loud.SERVICE:This is actually funny. Well no but ironic/unusual. The people up front, the maitre'd and hostesses were actually pretty nice--especially the maitre'd. And the bussers were REALLY courteous, albeit quiet (as bussers tend to be...). But our waiter. Okay, this guy was a douche. Not that he you know, yelled at us or spat in our food anything (okay I hope not), but he was pretty MIA and impatient and curt and generally unpleasant. I was going to be like um excuse me, you're not exactly doing me a favor by allowing me to spend money here and I mean this is a new place, at least pretend to be excited about it? I'm usually quite friendly with waiters at restos, but this guy was just not having it/extremely uninterested. He was probably mad that we didn't order drinks. Well, I was actually debating getting a drink but guess what douchebag, you just made my decision a hell of a lot easier. I understand if you're less interested in us because we ordered less but do you have to be so obvious about it? SHEESH, whatever.VERDICT:Good spot, worth a visit, like that it's open till 2am.

1.0,5/15/2011,"Let me start by saying that I rarely give bad reviews and almost always give the benefit of the doubt. However, in this case, the way the situation was handled was so unclassy and unprofessional, that I think it's worth mentioning. On a busy saturday night, 2 friends and I stopped in and were told that it would be a 1 hour and 45 min wait for a table. Their bar was full, so we ask the hostess if we can go next door to have a drink. She said it was fine, but mentioned that we should come back in plenty of time because they'd give away our table if we werent there. So, following this advice, we come back about 1 hour later (with 45 min to spare). A new, less friendly hostess says that they'd already given away our table. We mention that we'd been told the wait was 1:45 so we thought we were giving it plenty of time. To which the hostess says (in a tone of voice that suggests we've never eaten at a restaurant before) ""that's an estimate."" Um, duh....but the point is that it was a very wrong estimate. So, after a little complaining on our part, she tells us that we can wait for another table, but she won't have one for an hour. At this point, we are losing interest in eating here... So, my two friends and I stand in the entryway regrouping on what to do for dinner. While we're doing this, a third friend calls and says she's going to be joining us. As this is happening, the hostess yells over to us, ""I have a table for three now.""  Since only about 3 minutes had passed, I'd say this was another bad estimation of waiting time. But whatever. So we say (assuming that a 3 person table could also accommodate 4,  ""great, there are actually four of us now."" To which she says ""Well I guess we're even."" And turns her back on us. Table gone.Wow. Most unprofessional hostesss I've ever encountered.",9,0,2,caroline e.,"New York, NY",17,118,0
2.0,5/13/2011,"This is one of those overhyped places that really are just not that exciting.  How do people love the decor? The interior is that of any other generic gastropub... Drinks: Mixology style menu, reminds me of the cocktails at The Bourgeois Pig, most of them look tasty such as Aviation Royale- sounds delicious with Creme Yvette, champagne, gin, and maraschino liquor.  In reality it tastes like strong cough syrup.  Cocktails are also very small although one could argue they make up for it in strength.  Food: After reading all the tips for Oyster Sandwiches I tried them; not bad but nothing to write home about...  Eggplant dip served with salty chips was also fine; not very memorable.  As for the fried chicken; it's two pieces of very generic fried chicken- no different than you'd get at a grocery buffet. The honey biscuits that accompanied it were significantly more sophisticated although a tad too sweet even for me with a sweet tooth- like English tea scones with glazed honey.  I would have liked the collared greens if they weren't so spicy as I would have liked the cornbread if it didn't have jalapeno in it.  The mashed potatoes were the best part; nicely whipped with a homemade taste and a dash of chicken gravy.  Also noteable is they slapped ramps onto every other menu item which makes me think they're trying to be locavore-trendy.  Also heard it was 'pie-centric' although I didn't see a single pie on the menu except rabbit pot pie... If I go back I might focus on oysters and desserts- too much chili and mustard on the menu for my tastes. On the plus side I am a rhubarb addict so I was a fan of the spring sundae and the rhubarb sorbet.  It's a decent place with decent food just not up to all the hype and there's so many other good places to eat downtown...",5,0,2,Elena V.,"New York, NY",104,191,232
5.0,5/12/2011,"DELICIOUS. I don't think I've ever stared at a menu for so long before making a decision. I mean if you were me, would you go with the pecan duck (Carmellini allegedly makes a mean duck at Locanda Verde)? Rabbit pot pie? Hanger steak? Steamed bass? Lamb neck mole? My dinnermate was facing a similar crisis. Luckily, we resolve this issue the way we often do - by ordering enough to feed a family of four. This is how things went down: We started with the eggplant dip with savory chips (4.5 stars). A glass of cab for K and a glass of pinot noir for me. The Dutch surprises us with free cornbread. I shriek with delight. We get two orders of the Asian white boy ribs (5 stars). I think it was around this time that I became full. We order the local beets with smoked egg and dill (4 stars). I tell K that I can eat no more!I eat my lamb neck mole with chayote and red rice (5 stars). The topic of marriage comes up. K orders another glass of wine.K eats her hanger steak with smoked potatoes. I eat K's hanger steak with smoked potatoes (4.5 stars). Stuffed, we joke about ordering dessert. We order dessert. Spring sundae with rhubarb, froyo, candied lemon and brown sugar blondies (4 stars). I briefly go into a depressed state of guilt and self-loathing and we leave the restaurant.",12,31,12,Nancy Y.,"San Francisco, CA",234,130,7
4.0,5/9/2011,"A few years ago, I went to A Voce, where this guy, Andrew Carmellini, made my heart swoon with his ricotta. Fast forward a year or two and he made me swoon again with his ricotta, his roasted chicken and potatoes, his pastas, and his cookbook. So when I found out that he was opening up another restaurant, I watched the coverage like a hawk. And when the reservation line opened, I demanded my favorite cousin bring me to celebrate my birthday.The dining room is large and spacious in the back, which means you will be comfortable while you eat. My server was adorable, friendly, and helpful with his suggestions, and our table was always cleared and glasses refilled promptly.We got:Little Oyster sandwiches (2) : These are a must get. Usually Im not a fan of cooked oysters, but these were crispy, tender, and flavorful. Asian White Boy Ribs (2): Dont make the same mistake I did, each order of ribs is two big ribs. No matter, I had more of the smokey, sweet, Asiany bbq-ness to myself.Local beets with smoked egg and dill: This dish also has celery, so think about it as a teeny bit of awesome egg salad ever over beautiful, earthy, smoky beetsBarrio tripe, with beer and avocado: Tripe was tender and spiced very well. The radish and avocado complemented it well. The portion of this is huge, and this came after all the food i listed above and I still had two courses coming, so I packed up half, took it home to my boyfriend, who also really loved it. Smoked ricotta ravioli: Carmellini , once again, makes me swoon with his ricotta. The ravioli are delicate little parcels full of slightly smokey, rich ricotta. The tomato sauce is lovely and sweet and light. Fried chicken: The fried chicken comes with collard greens, cole slaw and mashed potatoes with gravy. The fried chicken itself, while fried nicely and super crisp, could have used a tad more spiciness, but it was by no means bad. The mashed potatoes were so smooth they could have been made from rehydrated potato flakes. Collard greens were nice and vinegary. The coleslaw, while nice, was neither here nor there. I packed up most of this dish, but told them to leave the coleslaw out of the package.Pie of the day was coconut cream, which I had to have- it was nice and fluffy, but the coconut flavor could have been slightly more pronounced. Great graham crust though. We also got the Spring Sundae with  rhubarb, frozen yogurt, candied lemon, brown sugar blondie, which was pink and huge and over the top. It was actually quite refreshing, but since it was so big and we were so full we barely scraped the surface.",2,4,6,Jenn C.,"Flushing, NY",160,261,11
4.0,5/9/2011,"Within just a couple weeks of opening, The Dutch has already become a thriving neighborhood hot spot with lengthy wait times on par with Carmellini's Locanda Verde in TriBeCa. I came with two friends on a Friday evening and we waited 1.5 hours for a table, and I have heard of similar wait times even during the week.  Very cozy country inn / bistro / tavern ambiance serving up homey comfort food. The space is well lit and inviting, although it can get very very loud.  Service was a bit frazzled but probably just because they've only just begun.I loved the Little Oyster Sandwiches- fried oyster slider with this aioli-relish sauce yum!  Big fan of the eggplant dip with fingerling potato chips (think baba ghanoush + cream cheese), along with the rabbit pot pie... total ambrosia.  My favorite parts of the meal were all bread-related, such as the entire loaf of cornbread they start you off with.  This just ruined every other restaurant's boring bread basket with olive oil routine.  And the honey-drenched butter biscuits served as a side to the fried chicken... oh my sweet sticky goodness, those were gone in seconds.  We basically ordered the fried chicken solely for the biscuits, and I wonder if they would just serve those à la carte?  I mean the chicken was good, but these biscuits obliterated any other capacity for tasting. foodcomas.wordpress.com/…I can't wait to return as there are tons of menu items I have yet to try, but I think I need to space out my visits as The Dutch doesn't exactly constitute a ""light"" meal.  May need to hit up a few more yoga sessions before returning, but I shall definitely be returning soon.",1,0,0,Jen J.,"Tiburon, CA",114,250,54
4.0,5/6/2011,"I was able to go to The Dutch during ""Friends and Family"" so my review must be taken with a grain of salt as the purpose of F & F is to get all the kinks out before the paying patrons come in. Decor: 4.5 Stars Trendy and casual feel. I like the fact they have two different rooms with totally different feels. The Dining room feels more upscale with an open kitchen (much like Locanda Verde). The Oyster bar feels much more casual and cozy. Its the kind of decor that can work for just about any occasion which is kind of rare. I will say that for a place that offers many small plates, the tables in the oyster bar a bit tight when you have your glasses, plates, candle and bottle of decorative parsley on it at the same time. Please Note: (You will not find words like ""moist"", ""nom nom"", ""cheesy"", ""to die for"" in any of my reviews) Food: 4 Stars Being that it was F & F, I was fortunate enough to be able to try a large portion of the menu. I did find myself wanting to order about 90% of the menu. Below are somethings I ordered that I highly recommend:  *Smoked Lamb Sausage Links with Yogurt and Quinoa *Eggplant Dip *Dressed Crab, Bloody Mary, Green Goddess *The Honey Butter Biscuit that accompanies the Fried Chicken *Coconut Cream Pie Must Get:    Little Oyster SandwichTry: The Fried Chicken (It was greasy and to hot to eat with your hands. Certainly not the best in NY but again working out the kinks so would try again. All the Sides it comes with are delicious. Price wise seemed to be very reasonable per person as nothing is over $30. Service was a little off but that is to be expected at Friends and Family. I would go back as there was certainly other items I would like to try.",1,1,0,Cody G.,"New York, NY",465,6,4

5.0,5/4/2011,"Thanks again, AC: only a week in, and the Dutch delivers. At 7PM on a Wednesday the place was packed. Bright-eyed, pre-review attentiveness behind the bar will get you a cocktail quickly while you wait for a seat and take in the scene (list by Naren Young, who also designed Locanda Verde's drinks; the barrel-aged Brooklyn cocktail and the Dutch Courage are winners).There are printed reminders on the menu and at the oyster bar to ""eat your bivalves."" You should heed them. Half a dozen Kusshi oysters from B.C. started us off right. The cocktail sauce and the mignonette are quite tasty, although I prefer my oysters naked. The crab with Green Goddess, wading in a beautiful pool of Bloody Mary, is divine; the tripe with beer and avocado is delish, with that perfect tripe-tastic texture. Entrees are portioned generously: five plump scallops, flirting with spring peas, cooked to perfection, and perhaps the highlight of the meal was the fried chicken, well seasoned and crispy and accompanied by coleslaw, collards and smooth, buttery mashed potatoes.Wine and beer list is solid. Colin Alevras, former chef of the shuttered Tasting Rooms, is as comfortable and savvy on the floor as he is in the kitchen, and his beer and cider pairings rounded out the meal, all the way through to that killer coconut cream pie. It's a great space, with oyster and booze bars back to back in the center of a big front room that feels like two rooms, with a ledge to perch on and look out the big windows facing Prince Street, and another room in the back from which you can see into the bright, bustling kitchen. The runners glide smoothly and patiently through the crowds. Listen to the hype and go there, before the reviews make it even harder to get a table. I'll be back to try more of Naren's concoctions and check out the late night vibe. Yes, they serve food until 2AM (at least for now).",3,0,2,Maya F.,"New York, NY",70,147,21
4.0,5/3/2011,"We had dinner at The Dutch during its first week of dinner service - they did a respectable job considering it's so new.  The space is cool and unpretentious, especially the windows that open onto the street (it's now warm enough to open them!) and the amazing, warm light fixtures in the front dining area.  Both hosts and waiters were friendly and approachable (and numerous).  The staff are still learning to navigate the space and there are a few odd kinks-- like the menus are far too big for the tables, the people around us kept losing theirs and diving to the ground for them.We ordered the oyster sliders and the barrio tripe to start.  The sliders were the highlight of the meal: *someone* back there really knows how to work a deep fryer, because these were perfectly crisp on the outside and creamy on the inside, and not at all greasy.  The barrio tripe was interesting.  The tripe really was tender and not at all rubbery - and the nod to Frito pie was cute, but no matter how I try I can't get into tripe and this was a big helping of it.  My husband liked it though.  I ordered the smoked ricotta ravioli and my husband had the fried chicken.  The perfectly smoky and tangy collards that came with the chicken were my second favorite thing we ate, next to the oyster sliders.   The chicken itself was good because, hey, fried chicken, but it's not my favorite in the city.  The simple but solid smoked ricotta ravioli were filled with the creamiest ricotta you might ever try.  Yum.  Great if you're in the mood for a vegetarian option.  Finally, who can refuse a slice of rhubarb pie?  The pie was a perfect finish with an appropriately tart rhubarb filling and what I would call a flaky but restrained (i.e., not super rich) crust.    To be honest, the whole place - space, menu, vibe - seems to be going for kind of a Brooklyn thing (not to pigeonhole it but to me, The Dutch is a bit Bar Americain and a bit Buttermilk Channel).  And as a Brooklyn gal I can say that numerous Brooklyn spots are already doing what The Dutch wants to do.  That said, The Dutch is not in Brooklyn and makes a great addition to this neighborhood, which can be lacking in the low-key warmth that the Buttermilk Channels and Farm on Adderleys of the world do so well, without making the good people of Soho schlep across the bridge for it.",1,0,0,Jessica K.,"Brooklyn, NY",62,24,1

4.0,4/30/2011,"About a dozen or so of us were hanging around outside fifteen minutes prior to opening tonight because we just had to be part of the big new thing in New York restaurants. Sure enough, right at 5:30p the front door of The Dutch was unlocked and the place quickly flooded as staff girded for the first of what I anticipate will be many more busy nights. The bar filled up fast, everyone seemingly texting and tweeting their way through their first drink. I had the added benefit of sitting next to a guy who was sneezing and sniffling but also had the need to be there too. I had a couple of Ayingers which were served in smallish beer glasses. Hey, for $9 I'd like a pint. I had two and they were good; but let me repeat: I'd like a pint for $9, not 10ozs or so. Soon after I ordered dinner, a small carving board with cornbread and a side of butter was placed down. Good, warm, delicious and a pleasant surprise. I started with the dinner salad which comes in a big bowl - good, fresh, crisp - better than I thought it would be and it could even be a meal. I went with the steak coupled with grits and potatoes. It too was delicious - medallions, actually served with chard over grits. Wow. My neighbor had the pork chop which was sizable and at first glance I felt I had missed an opportunity but the steak was delicious and I'd get it again. I finished up with the coconut cream pie - the special dessert and coffee... again, very good and I could hear the others standing at the bar commenting on how good it looked: white, creamy and close to perfection. The Dutch is a treat - and will be for some time to come. Ever hear of licenses to print money? The Dutch has one; it's theirs to lose. This is a fun, loud, sexy and soon to be very popular spot.

The cocktail menu was ok, I tried the aviator which I choked down, then switched to wine.The appetizers (fried oyster sliders, ceviche, beer avocado tripe) were good. We ordered the fried chicken, rabbit pot pie and pork chops as mains and beware, the mains are gigantic and can feed 3 people each. Given that, our bill was $66 per person after ordering 2 bottles of wine, apps, mains and dessert, which was surprising.  I will be back to try the rest of the menu, but this place is not at the level of Locanda Verde.",1,0,0,Kimberly G.,"Williamsburg, NY",0,69,0
4.0,4/29/2011,"This place has been under the microscope since it was an idea in Andrew Carmellini's mind. The anticipation has been next to rabid and people are going in droves. It's only the 3rd night.Initial reaction is that this feels like a ridiculously busy pub. It's full of pretty Manhattanites and It's louder than a rock concert with patrons yelling to be heard above the din.  Bartenders have a wait list for bar stools.  This place is a madhouse.So how about the food?  Scallion cornbread with chipotle butter given to everyone is a nice start and sets the tone for what kind of food you can expect here; comfy, simple food with sexy accouterments.  For my initial meal I had the Tripe app and Black Sea Bass main. You've never had tripe like this. Braised for hours in beer it still has that tripe taste but with all the toppings' frito corn chips, radishes, avocado and onions, it feels like an interesting take chili. The Black Bass was cooked perfectly served on top of the green rice with a fantastic achiote sauce,  citrus wedges adding a nice zing and matchsticks of either pear or cactus pear adding texture.Great food so far; I was told to try the fried chicken next time.  I will.Service was great considering it was only the 3rd night and it was a non-stop slam-fest for the kitchen.  They also feature a great selection of imported and craft beers and the people around me who ordered the mixed drinks said they were all amazing.  Can't wait to go back, the only thing stopping me is the crowd at the door.",1,0,0,Keoni B.,"New York, NY",24,47,5
