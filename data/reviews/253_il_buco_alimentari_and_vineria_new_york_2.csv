1.0,4/9/2019,"I got this sandwich delivered via Caviar. The price of the sandwich is $16. The prosciutto was dry and the few slices that were in there were thick. Here's a photo of what $16 gets you at this restaurant - a piece of bread. Never going back or ordering again.  They should be ashamed of themselves for putting this quality food out to consumer. -----April 9, 2019 UPDATE. After receiving a message from the restaurant promising that this will never happen again and apologizing profusely, I finally decided to order the same sandwich again today. What I got was shocking. The same as the first one. These people don't care about anyone, they just don't want a bad Yelp review and will tell you anything to get you to delete it. These people are lying losers and their food is awful.",2,2,0,Elizabeth M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,16,2

My lobster special was so salty, when the person next to me asked me what it was and if I would recommend it, I responded with a resounding NO. I forget the other pasta I tried, but it was a bit better, though nothing memorable (as you can see from my complete lack of memory of it). There are so many pasta joints in the city.

Prix fixe menu offered a crispy artichoke heart to start; apps of oysters, crudo, grilled quail, and mushrooms in a miso broth; a lemon tagliatelle w/ crab and a golden, melt-in-mouth tortellini in broth; two hearty mains (duck breast and striped bass), then a heavenly chocolate mousse and apple crisp (a touch dry) to wrap it up. Wines were interesting, too, and staff were extremely attentive and responsive to questions.

2.0,1/28/2019,"This review is not about the food. I wouldn't know about their food because my order got messed up and the kitchen staff simply didn't recitify the situation until my dining partners had already finished their meals and we were waiting for the check!A meal that gets sent back because of someone's error should kinda be given priority IMHO.The staff tried their best to help by comping my meal and offering a free loaf of bread and some goodies but sadly, the poor performance by our server and the kitchen staff blew any chance of saving this overall crappy experience. I mean really, is substituting one type of pasta for another in a dish too much to comprehend?From the start, we were a party of 3 and they first tried to seat us a what appeared to be a communal table for 12. Sorry, we didn't need extra ears listening into our private conversation! We asked to be moved and were taken to a high-top table with the most uncomfortable stools imaginable. We should have left right then.Speaking of conversation, forget it! The place is too cramped and so loud you can't hear yourself think!My apologies for this negative review but there just weren't enough positives about this experience other than the bread which was outstanding.

2.0,1/22/2019,Came here for restaurant week and got three courses for $42.  Wasn't very impressed with the food itself but the service and atmosphere were nice.  Had the scallop crudo as an appetizer - the olive oil was delicious but the scallop itself could have been fresher.  The lamb papardelle was mediocre - pasta wasn't aldente and the sauce didn't stand out either.  The dessert was chocolate mousse - neither me nor my friend thought it was too enjoyable. Would give 2.5 stars if I could.,0,0,0,Lauren H.,"New York, NY",3,127,296
5.0,1/19/2019,"On a blustery and chilly January evening, there are few things better than a cozy Italian restaurant, a glass of vino rosso, and fresh pasta. Il Buco Alimentari satisfies exactly that type of craving in a homey and inviting setting. We enjoyed the delicious food and wine, but what really stood out was the convivial ambience, as well as the exceptionally attentive and hospitable service. We felt truly welcomed, as the staff seemed passionate about inviting us into their ""home"".We shared the charred eggplant and the homemade ricotta. The eggplant had a nice smokey and garlicky flavor, and literally melts in your mouth. The ricotta was creamy and paired well with the homemade bread; The hazelnuts added a nice crunch, however, the flavor of the ricotta was a bit overpowered by notes of cumin, and I felt that the kohlrabi did not add much to the dish.The real winners of the night were the entrées. I ordered the tagliolini neri, which was exceptional. The squid-ink pasta was perfectly al denté, and the peekytoe crab sauce was rich and buttery, the caramelized leeks added nice sweetness, and the preserved lemon rounded out the whole dish. My sister was very impressed by the whole branzino, which I also sampled and enjoyed.We finished the night with the ""torta al cioccolato"", essentially a velvety chocolate mousse in a pastry shell with caramel sauce. It was a simple but good (and innocent) dessert to top of an excellent evening!",1,0,1,Cameron M.,"Northwest Washington, Washington, DC",1,9,37
3.0,12/29/2018,"This is a lower version of the official Il buco... It has a pleasant and small interior. The hosts are friendly and welcoming.Straight to the point we ordered our wines and cocktails paired with antipasti. 1) crispy  artichoke was a delight for the vegetarians.. burnt crispy on the outside and juicy inside 2) Scallops crudo  had a gorgeously soft texture.. totally recommend it 3) calamari dish was served topped with burnt cabbage leaves.. never thought this pairing could work but we totally loved the taste4) home made ricotta was honestly pretty ok.. must be made In-house but didn't really work for meMoving on to the mains.. Tagliolini Nero was the pasta to die for.. made with crab meat and black tagliolini pasta, topped with lemon n Chives. The dish was magic on a plate. My absolute favorite.Not far behind was short ribs for 2 priced at $70. Honestly it should have been short ribs for 5 looking at the quantity.  I think the mains were a big hit for us.. would rate it 9 out of 10.I still rate it 3 stars coz first of all the place was pretty small, casual atmosphere and uncomfortable cramped up seating... Somehow the Causalness didn't warrant the extremely high price of some of the dishes served. If you want to charge a premium you got to make customer feel like a king/ queen..  is my thought.Nonetheless the place was great and warrants a second visit for sure.. or well maybe next time to the real Il Buco.",0,1,0,Meghna S.,"Manhattan, NY",36,85,126
2.0,12/17/2018,"I went here incorrectly thinking this was ""il Buco"", not realizing that ""il Buco Alimentari & Vineria"" is not the same place. Unfortunately this is one of a few descendants of the famed original. Although it seems like the menus are similar, the atmosphere here is completely different, very cold and uncomfortable. Whatever you do, DO NOT allow them to seat you at the counter on the 2nd floor. Like me, you'll find yourself forced to have your back to your waiter, facing a stairwell and a wall, while sitting on an uncomfortable counter stool. The homemade bread that I'd read praises about online was below average and basic. The pasta dishes were between average and decent and would have been fine for a basic weeknight dinner.

3.0,12/17/2018,"This has an Italian village eatery feel. And the food doesn't stray from that motif. Everything was very good, but at times it felt unfinished. The bread came out cold, the short rib had a lot of unnecessary fat still on it, and the seating is really meant for big groups, so there aren't a lot of comfortable spaces available for 2 people. The service is great though, and if you'll be in the area definitely have dinner there. Probably not worth a trip out of the way though.",0,0,0,Brandon L.,"Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, CA",2,21,0
1.0,12/11/2018,"I sponsored a holiday dinner for my technology team of 5.  I made the reservation several weeks ago and confirmed last week.  Since there is a sister restaurant nearby with a very similar name, I told them I want to be sure my reservation is for the restaurant and not the casual bistro/retail shop.   We arrived at the Great Jones address and were seated in a table in the front of the place, near the door *in front of* the receptionist.  I mentioned I had made reservations for a formal dinner not drinks or snacks.  We were told we should have asked for ""the main room"".  Well, no one told me that on the phone.   That's Mistake 1.   We sit down spread out on a large table.  But then we're told its a communal table so we have to squeeze together!  Are you kidding??  And we were going to discuss some confidential company business.  Mistake 2.  And its an extremely uncomfortable hard wood seating like a park bench.  Three of my team are vegans; when I called I mentioned this and was told that they could accommodate vegan requests.  But the menu had minimal vegan options and we were told by the waitress there were no other options.  Mistake 3.   I order three vegetable appetizers right away; the ricotta, fried artichoke and eggplant.  The ricotta was very good.  The artichokes were extremely tough to eat and the eggplant dish was a joke... 2 really tiny pieces of eggplant with hardly any semblance of flavor.  Mistake 4.  While we are eating the appetizers, my first course arrives... no other first course arrives.  When the appetizers are finished, they bring the other first courses. By then, my primi pasta dish is cold.  Mistake 5.   And then they totally forget all about my entree after discussing the trout entree at length with the waitress!  I never got my entree!    It was a pathetic showing by a NY restaurant.  Extremely disappointed.",1,0,0,Frank G.,"New York, NY",0,3,0

It was a busy restaurant night and they couldn't have been nicer as we had a large party and added 50% more last minute. The pasta and main course menu items are delicious. We had a range of everything from the whole chicken to the halibut and trout, to pastas. While it was easy for them to accommodate vegan, note they do not have GF pasta options.

Very simple, all wooden floors and furniture. Because it was thanksgiving, the place was packed. However, service was impecable: fast, friendly and on topof every detail. The entree I chose was pasta with mushrooms and cheese. Then the turkey with sides (family style serving) for the main course and caramelized pears for dessert. You could chose pumpkin or Nutella pie too. They had a long menu with wines and 'aperitivo' too. Also, the place has a market.

I said I had wanted a regular Coke and she looked at me as if I were a total philistine and said 'we ABSOLUTELY do not keep THAT.' Then flounced away to bitch about us to another staff member.

Overall, portions are small but well balanced and outstanding. The fried artichokes are delicious (something like a fried kale chip if you're wondering). The homemade ricotta and breads were also stellar, but the olive oil was the best so fruity and flavorful. The riso neri had a nice kick from the sausage and creaminess from the yolk.

Hmm, it was good but nothing special really. We then had the squash Pizza and summer melon. Perfect appetizers both fresh and delicious. The highlight of the meal was without a doubt the bucatini carbonara. So cheesy and good. The pancetta in the carbonara was fantastic.  An excellent brunch portion. The service was excellent and always attentive throughout the brunch. I was just a bit disappointed because I reviewed several restaurant weeks menus and decided to go here since I really liked the 3-course brunch menu that they offered.

Then we finally got the second course, but only for 2 people in our party of 4- took several minutes more to get the other two dishes, and again our waiter didn't come by to say anything or apologize.The cod main dish was great. Kid's pasta dish was so-so. Bucatini carbonara  was a total disappointment- some pieces of pasta were hard, a few even crunchy, and there were only about four small pieces of bacon. Sauce was also very thin, not like carbonara sauce in Italy. I had the eggs with lobster- the lobster was a bit tough (overcooked?) and the eggs were nothing great- I like soft fluffy eggs and expected them to be that way in a restaurant with this reputation.Our daughter was convinced about the dessert choices so we ordered the panna cotta for her. The waiter brought her a serving of salted caramel ice cream instead (?!) When we commented, he said ""oh we are out of the panna cotta"" Why didn't he come tell us before and let her choose which flavor ice cream she would like to try??? The salted caramel was just bad- none of the adults at the table liked it either. Rhubarb crostata was okay- I have had better and can make better myself.

3.0,2/22/2018,"TLDR: Service is unimpressive but food was great.So my sister and I went for restaurant week on a weeknight around 7pm. Despite having made a reservation a week in advance they tried to seat us at the downstairs bar. I looked around at the plethora of empty tables and asked if we could be seated at an actual table. They said no but that they had a more spacious bar seating area upstairs. We went upstairs to a similarly empty room with a couple of the tables filled and STILL they demanded that we sit on the high chairs at the bar. When I asked whether the tables all had reservations the host simply said they were not available and seated us at the bar. Throughout our entire 2 hour meal several tables went unfilled. So just to be straight, this three star review is for the host service and not for the food. I'm sure anyone with a little more moxie would've been able to bargain for an actual table but honestly as customers at a nice restaurant that shouldn't really be what it comes down to. Honestly pretty disappointing.Okay so we came here for restaurant week but actually ended up ordering off the regular menu because everything there sounded so much more enticing.We started off with the crispy artichokes and the mushroom flatbread. The artichokes were so crisp, I don't think I'll be able to have them any other way from now on.The crab pasta was incredible: perfectly al dente pasta, well-seasoned, and not fishy at all. The crab was fresh.The olive oil cake was like any other olive oil cake, which is to say decadent as fuck. Would highly recommend the whiskey, balsamic, and tarragon (I think) cocktail. Should be the first one on the cocktail menu. It was slightly sweet and very refreshing.All-in-all the pleasant experience except for the two unpleasant and unengaging host(esse)s we had to go through to get a mediocre seat.",0,0,0,Chris P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",383,111,45

3.0,2/4/2018,"Hit or miss on dishes and execution.Food ordered:Bucatini Cacio e Pepe - would give this a 4 stars. Was very good, little light on the cheese and heavy on the pepper for me, but would get again.    It is hard to find this dish at many restaurants the pasta with pecorino and pepper.     Chicken (Hemlock Farms Chicken) - came out cold - (cold chicken, cold potatoes), I sent it back.   2nd time it came out the potatoes were black (burned) but still not hot ?? very strange, and then the Chicken was slightly warmer.    I'm not sure what they did, but total miss.  I sent it back the 2nd time and told them to keep it...please switch for Scallop Appetizer, I did that as my enteee instead.Scallop Appetizer - Three large scallops - exellent 5 stars.Bread - they charge for bread and it was average - at least that is authentic, they charge for breat in Rome tourist areas, hah.   But seriosly at the price point of this restaurant, if you're going to charge extra for bread...it best be awesome.Execution:Chicken dish could have been great, seemed like good flavors and portion, but I am guessing (can't be sure) that they cooked it earlier and it was a re-heat approach.      Rotisserie chicken can be hard to time I guess.   It was a complete fail....Restaurant was very crowded, and there is no room for folks to wait who have reservations, bar is not really more than a few chairs.  When leaving it was so croweded Saturday night getting out was a challenge, it just felt like it is more popular than it deserves to be.Drinks were expensive, $15 for mixed drink....between that, breat charge, dessert, and each of us having 2 dishest (first/second) the dinner was over $200 with tip.     I won't retun perhaps unless to grab takeout of the Pasta Dish I iked...although at $21 for a small 'primi' course portion, maybe not even that.",0,1,0,David M.,"Bethesda, MD",8,158,0

The ambience is nice, and it's good to have conversations because it doesn't get too loud. The service was good too. But the biggest disappointment was with the food. We tried the 3 course meal and I can honestly I was not impressed by any of it. I also cannot stress how over salted the food was, I probably drank about 40 ounces of water while there to help eliminate the salt.

2.0,1/31/2018,"Just an OK experience.  I expected so much better from a top-ranked restaurant.  I sincerely feel bad that this will end up being mostly a rant about restaurant week, but hey, no one is forcing your restaurant to sign up.  I made a reservation for myself for lunch, and when I got there, it was pretty empty.  I still offered to take up a seat at the bar, because it seemed the polite thing to do.  I work in the industry, and actively try to be the best patron I can.  The man working behind the bar was...weird? I go into most restaurants with a very positive and upbeat attitude, and start each experience with a smile. And he just didn't respond to that. He seemed distant and not at all intent on providing me with a wonderful experience (which is what I expect when I intend to drop money on a top restaurant).  I thought about skipping the restaurant week menu because they removed the panna cotta, but I also was dying to try the soup and the market fish.  So I made up for it with purchasing wine.  I had hoped that would tip off the server that I wasn't the usual WW customer, but that didn't matter.  Still felt unwelcome.Here's the thing.  I understand that restaurants hate restaurant week.  It's a lot of poor tipping.  But also, if you're electing to BE in restaurant week, then don't have a bad attitude about it.  I don't mind an abbreviated menu and smaller portions, especially for lunch.  But I expect the same great service, especially when I am one of three people sitting at the bar!  My first course was the soup, which was cold.  And not gazpacho cold, just like gross luke-warm cold.  Also, I just looked up their menu again, to see why it didn't come with bread.  It's at the top of the menu for an additional $2.  For bread and olive oil.  Did angels shit it out?  Dude.  Provide bread for customers who order soup.  And that soup needed some bread.The hake was delicious.  As expected, it's a small portion, but I don't mind that!  Well cooked.I was SO excited to try the panna cotta, which was advertised on their menu on the restaurant week site, (It's week 2, so I'm not faulting them for changing the menu) but since they did not serve it, I had the gelato, which was good, but unexciting. The wine was nothing to write home about.  I expected a better selection from a ""vineria.""  Italian meals are so tricky.  Because of the cuisine, if they fall short of spectacular, they're mediocre.  There's no in between.  I had a mediocre meal.Depending on my experience I was planning to come back after restaurant week to try their full menu and eat one of their pasta dishes. Now, on principal, I won't.  There are so many better hidden gem Italian places.  Sticking to them, and advertising them to anyone who asks.And the bottom line?  If you don't want to participate in Restaurant Week...don't do it.  It just wards off future business when you don't provide a satisfactory experience.",0,0,0,Rachel M.,"Randolph, NJ",1,10,0
5.0,1/30/2018,"Came here on a Saturday night - the food was amazing but the service was the highlight of my dinner. My boyfriend's wine came out a bit later than expected (with the entree) and it was comped without us asking. Our glasses of water were also refilled immediately. Our waitress also gave us great recommendations on the menu. We ordered the selection cured meat and the bread basket to start. I had the Bucatini Cacio e Pepe and my boyfriend ordered the Agnolotti. Both were amazing and well-proportioned. They were on the smaller side, but I prefer that so I don't feel overstuffed at the end of the meal. For dessert, I ordered the Warm Seasonal Fruit Crostata. This was some sort of an apple tart with vinegar drizzled on top and balanced out by the goat milk gelato. Sounds strange but tasted heavenly. The portion isn't huge but was perfect to share to end the meal on a sweet note. The downstairs seems hectic when you first walk in with communal tables and a small market selling bread and pastries but there is a much quieter upstairs.

5.0,11/26/2017,"2016 review: We purchased the cooked turkey with brussel sprouts, potatoes and stuffing for our Thanksgiving dinner. I was apprehensive in advance because I was afraid the turkey would be dry and overcooked. However, in fact, it was quite succulent, with a wonderful smoked taste and aroma. The brussel sprouts were very well made, as was the stuffing. The potatoes were too greasy, however and could have used some spice -- rosemary would have been nice. But sitting in my apartment with guests and not being overpowered by the smell (and heat) of a cooking turkey, and not having to deal with the cleanup of the oven afterwards made it all especially nice. And again, the turnkey was very good. I would do this again!2017 review: Came back again in 2017 for another Thanksgiving dinner to go. Hard to believe, it was better than 2016. We were initially disappointed that they ran out of whole turkeys by the time we came by to pick up ours -- which we had order weeks in advance. However, they gave us three 1/2 turkeys instead; I think we ended up with far more meat, and frankly, the turkeys were delicious. They upped their game on the potatoes and Brussels sprouts, and we bought some bread this year too to accompany our meal. Overall quite an enjoyable feast!",0,0,0,Gary D.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,19,6

This place was an absolute waste of my time, money and calories. Made a reservation for 8pm for TWO people but wasn't seated until 8.45pm...okay people get busy I understand, sure whatever. We ordered a pasta dish and was served about 20 minutes later AND the pasta was undercooked. Okay, people make mistakes, I get it, it's fine it's all good so we asked for a replacement nicely. Another 20 mins later the replacement dish came and guess what, YUP, STILL undercooked - really, how hard is it for an Italian place in the middle of Soho to cook its pasta proper? Like, even I know how to do that - second dish in a row of the SAME pasta that was undercooked - for such a fancy/expensive restaurant, this is a shame for the city of New York. Our waitor did try to offer us desserts as an apology but at this point in time we were so hungry we just wanted our main dish to be served (to give the restaurant some credit the main dish was decently flavored). So the waiter just casually mentioned dessert as a replacement/apology but NEVER followed up on it. So in the end we had to pay for every single dish we ordered even though the restaurant screwed up TWICE for the same pasta dish. Sure people make mistakes, but restaurants try to make up for it by taking a percentage off their customers' bills/offering desserts whatnot and actually MEAN what they say. This restaurant? Nope, slow and bad services, mediocore food. Please, never coming back, and I'm telling all my friends to not go there - I'm a huge foodie and always get a lot of asks on where to eat in New York.

(not a complaint I ever really have, so I can't believe I'm saying this).  I guess I would've liked the inside to be a little more meaty in terms of the artichoke...but, regardless, still good.  I think if you think of it as a bar snack, not a veggie, it's very good.The cacio e pepe...I was hesitant to order, because I have very high standards for the dish (my gold standard is Maialino's, which is just perfection).  But I looked through reviews while we were debating what pasta to order, and everyone seemed to rave about the cacio e pepe (I also asked the waiter whether it was really that good, and he said yes...but of course, he's not gonna say no, so I don't know what I was expecting), so we took a chance on it.  It was...meh.  Not bad...but I think I could've made a better version myself.  I appreciate a perfectly al dente pasta, but I felt that theirs was too hard - especially for a dish that should be as creamy as cacio e pepe.At this point, I thought the food was a solid 3.5...but then, the short ribs came out.  That was another dish that I knew we had to get, because of the hype, but a) I'm often underwhelmed by dishes that are talked up this much, and b) doubly so when it's a large format entree because I'm gonna be really disappointed if I pay $65 for a dish and don't like it.  But omg, this dish was so f*in good!  I'm hard to please sometimes because I'm annoyingly obsessed with food and have high expectations - and on the opposite side of the spectrum, my husband is hard to impress, because he'd be just as happy eating a home cooked burger - but we both just looked at each other when we took that first bite - like holy shit, this is the best thing I've ever eaten.  I find that short rib is often a cop out dish for restaurants, because as long as you braise the shit out of it, it'll be super tender and you can't really go wrong.  But their version was like nothing I've had before - first of all, there's an amaaazing pepper crust (side note, I love black pepper so I loved that this was aggressively peppery) that adds a wonderful crunch and contrasting texture to the otherwise melt-in-your-mouth tender meat.  On top of the fact that the meat was cooked and seasoned perfectly, it was accompanied by the most delicious salad.  When they brought the dish to the table, I thought to myself, this looks super decadent, we're gonna have to order a lighter side to go with this hunk of meat.  But they already think this through for you and top the dish with a lemony fresh, crispy celery salad with olives and walnuts that complements the short rib so so perfectly.  We both agreed that it was the best dish we've had at a restaurant in a while (and we eat out often) - and it was enough to excuse and forget the fact that the other two dishes we had were just ok.Ok, I've rambled enough already so I need to wrap up. tl;dr, all you need to know is that you have to order the short rib.  I think I could eat this every week and not get sick of it.One last note - service was very attentive - which, on a Sunday at 6 when the restaurant is empty, is not surprising.  But, one thing that impressed me was that right after we had finished our appetizer, we received an unexpected call and had to rush way uptown shortly after.  We're super fast eaters so we weren't too concerned and wouldn't have said anything to the restaurant, but the waiter overheard my husband on the phone, and the manager (?) came over and said, it seemed like we needed to be somewhere, he'll make sure we get our food asap.  It was a small gesture, but showed the level of professionalism of their service (especially when you go to so many other restaurants that just dgaf).  So lots of bonus points for that.  And, the best part about the fact that we didn't have time to finish our dinner was that we had two perfect pieces of short rib to take home with us to enjoy all over again the next day!",0,0,0,Yoko M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,150,12

5.0,7/30/2017,"I am thoroughly ashamed that it took me this long to finally make it to Il Buco Almentaria. I've easily had this place saved for two years, and the only negative aspect of my meal was the realization that I've deprived myself of their delicious food for so long. So if you're like me, hopefully this review will spur you to finally go ... you won't regret it. Also, if it's your first time, don't do what I did, and just get an idea for where the place is. Il Buco, Il Buco Vita, and Il Buco Almentaria, are all located within one square block of each other, which, in my case, cause some slight confusion.Onto the menu. As I write this we're currently squarely in the midst of restaurant week, and yes, Il Buco is participating. However, you would do yourself a severe disservice by ordering the restaurant week menu. There are two gleaming gems on this menu, and they're both paninis, or paninos. I had the porchetta panino, and the short rib panino. Both were outstanding, so much so that I don't think I said more than 10 words throughout the meal, and taking a glance at my reviews, god knows how much I like to run my mouth. The porchetta was my favorite, but the short rib was a very close second.

Right away we asked our (very nice and polite) server to take back and cook it more. He was very understanding and sent back to kitchen. Few minutes later, a fully new piece of trout was served with an apology for the previous uncooked fish. Sadly, once again when the fish was cut open it wasn't cooked and even more raw than the first time! Sent it back, third time was a charm but by that time the mood was ruined. We weren't offered a credit nor any comps which would have at least made the experience better. It was frustrating and strongly recommend that you ask specifically to make sure ur dishes are cooked to your preference. Usually don't mind my tuna nor salmon on the rare side, but not trout- and especially not after sending back to make sure it gets cooked.

The place is great for a date, small group dinner or bringing your parents.Everything looks genuinely Italian, refined, yet casual. I will have to check out the other Il Buco which is more formal.We had (for two):- House-Baked Bread ($2 per person): Trapanese fiore di sale (aka effing god salt), il Buco extra virgin olive oil. Yes, pay extra for the bread, totally worth it- Salumi della casa, Selezione for 2 ($18): came with prosciutto, mortadella, coppa, pancetta and finocchiona (basically a really good salami). Everything was from Il Buco's farm, except the prosciutto which would be impossible to make as they have such a high demand for it. It is 18 months aged- Spaghetti Neri ($23): squid ink, seppia ragu, marcona almonds, pepperoncino. Loved it! I stole quite a bit from my bf's plate. He always gets the best entrée- Ocean Trout ($34): Amazing. Really big trout, cooked in cedar plank (comes with the dish), comes with baby leeks and lemon- Warm Seasonal Fruit Crostata ($12): seasonal fruit, goat milk gelato.

2.0,6/18/2017,"The oddest placement for the three of us: we were brought to the second floor and were seated at the end of a long table. Everywhere else is empty. This is fine. What's not fine is when the next party that came up was a group of 7 burly men and were proceeded to sit in our table, thus creating a horrible atmosphere for us 3. We could not hear ourselves and these guys were extremely obnoxious. When asked to be moved to the table behind us, which is set for four guests, the hostess said they'll have to bring us outside instead, which is another table for four. UM, OK. The setup for our seating arrangements threw us off our track to what was supposed to be a great meal.Food is thoughtfully crafted yet there seemed to be something wrong in each of them. Pesto pasta, special dish of the day, lacked salt. It also involved asparagus, which I can tolerate but if I knew it existed in there I wouldn't have ordered the dish. Mushroom gnocchi was delicate but the pieces were overly soft for my liking. The squid ink spaghetti packed all the right flavors, however, it was not thoroughly cooked. You might think, ""Girl, it's supposed to be al dente!"" To that, I retort with, ""You know who you talkin' to?! A pasta head. This isn't al dente; the center is still hard!"" The most ridiculous part of the meal is when we ordered the three flavors of sorbet and gelato, where we asked for strawberry, black currant basil, and coconut. The waiter brought out the dessert, and he said, ""We ran out of coconut, so here's goat's milk."" UM, EXCUSE ME??!! How can you NOT tell the patrons that the flavor they chose is unavailable so they can choose something else?? Instead, you pick a replacement for the customers?? Wow.

When me and my girlfriend arrived they said its only a prefix menu, they did send us an email originally saying they have a prefix menu, but nothing about ONLY PREFIX.  Right away out a damper on my night and all the food on the prefix wasn't what I had my heart set on. So now will go to problem #2 the pre fix was $110.00 per person plus 30 extra dollars to upgrade to the entrée that we wanted shared for two, it was the bone in ribeye plus 3 beers and 2 glasses of wine came out to $344.05 plus then over $60 for tip which is over $400 for a meal, that a lot of money for what we ate. I have been to some the fanciest places and never spent that much on dinner. The place was nice and the seating was intimate which was good but bottom line if your not happy with the menu that was unexpected then the overall experience isn't gonna be good, especially if your paying so much. I don't think ill ever return to this place and the last thing I want tot say was I saw people eating things that was not on the prefix meanwhile we asked prior if they can substitute and we were told NO and I persisted an same answer, so I'm really confused on how some people were accommodated and some of us were not treated the same.",0,0,0,Rob B.,"New York, NY",92,54,9

5.0,8/7/2016,"Came for lunch and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food. Started with a watermelon salad and aperol spritz which were both light and refreshing. Next came fried rabbit. I didn't try it but my friends were raving about it. We ordered a pasta called ""bucatini"" or something similar in a tomato based sauce. It was cooked perfectly al dente and the sauce was delicious.The star of the show was the asparagus and tumeric gnocchi. A very unique dish with slivers of asparagus and crushed pistachio, the gnocchi dough is made with tumeric. The gnocchi are lightly pan fried prior to being boiled. This gave them a chewy crust that really added texture to the pasta. The asparagus slivers complimented the dish well because they were crunchy and juicy. Not the typical heavy gnocchi dishes most restaurants serve. Lastly, our pizza was served (it arrived last because the server forgot to enter the order). I don't remember what it was called. It was a simple white pizza (mozzarella) with a mix of greens on top which included arugula, baby spinach, and...mint. I've never seen mint on pizza but these people know what they're doing! The hint of mint added a new dimension to this delicately flavored, Italian pizza.I would have loved to try a dessert if I had room left.

5.0,6/18/2016,"Of course I've known about il buco pretty much since I first moved to the city. But one, I'm not a huge fan of Italian restaurants in NY. Two, the reviews seem to be mixed. And then with the prices I'd rather spend the same amount for another type of cuisine other than Italian..With all that said, I ended up here for dinner with my parents because they are my total opposite and they love Italian food like no other. In fact, they are regulars here. Thankfully I'm happy to report that my dining experience here exceeded my expectations.First, let me say something about the decor and ambience. The restaurant interior is carefully curated to reflect this rustic, countryside atmosphere. There is a small market, if you will, at the front of the house. This set up lends to a rather confusing and cramped front and bar area during prime hours so do make a reservation for a table at the back. The service is a little harried but satisfactory.Now the food.. Oh wow! Everything was so good it not only made up for the slight annoyance from having to wait in the aforementioned crowded bar/market area it also made me feel like the final bill was worth it. And that's saying quite a bit. We ordered the grilled octopus and beets salad to start with, followed by some gnocchi and of course my dad's favorite, the short ribs for two. Everything was excellent. The octopus was cooked just right and the beets salad perfectly complemented the heavier dishes that followed. The gnocchi was also delicious! My mom was happy to be able to try it as whenever they dine here the short ribs dominate their meal. That the menu says 'for two' is misleading. Really it's for at least 3 or even 4 people. With everything that we ordered we still left with leftovers. Granted, you'd savor the leftovers the next day as it is an incredible dish. Not merely for the gargantuan proportion but it's also a well prepared dish. The slow roasted meat is so tender and flavorful you almost can't stop eating more. And the combination with the Castelvetrano olives and shaved celery is quite interesting. It works and I completely understood why it was my dad's favorite. After this huge meal you'd think we'd barely be able to walk but we did have some room for dessert. But here is where their offerings were less than memorable. So my recommendations? Book ahead. Try and bring a group of 4 so you can order the short ribs and have room for other plates. And skip the dessert.",4,1,2,Ryna D.,"New York, NY",227,1549,2438

We got seated upstairs around  this bar-like set up overlooking an artsy chandelier; that was cool and all, but the stools were pretty uncomfortable by the end of the dinner. Anyway, they were already out of the calamari appetizer and branzino! Instead, our waiter recommended an octopus appetizer and cod fish entree. The appetizer was very good, but definitely on the smaller side. The cod was alright. We ordered the artichoke gnocchi and the black spaghetti which were excellent. We didn't stay for dessert because the stools were so uncomfortable haha. The service was not too fabulous; I felt we waited for a decent amount of time between each dish.

It's nothing but regular radish sliced thin enough to make them transparent. decorated with grapefruit which is so small you need a microscope to find it.

5.0,4/25/2016,"While on a quick trip to NYC, this was a last minute reservation for us.  We found it on the trusty YELP app and were quick to book on Open Table and had no trouble.  This place is really easy to get to and was close to the venue we were going to next, so it was a perfect spot.  The interior of this restaurant is adorable.  It is so cozy and makes you really feel like you are in someones home.  It is dimly lit with touches of Italy all around.  When we were seated our server immediately came to greet us and got us started with some amazing wine.  We ordered the artichoke appetizer and it arrived hot and amazing.  We ordered a few dishes off of the menu including the short ribs (which is made for two) and the tortellini.  I have never had homemade pasta before and I doubt I will ever be able to eat regular pasta again!  The pasta was amazing and the broth it comes in is just phenomenal.  The short rib literally falls off the bone.  We loved it so much that we carried it on the plan with us the next day home so none was wasted!  For desert we had the salted carmel gelato and it was the perfect cap off of the evening.  One really amazing thing about this restaurant is you can use your apple pay to pay through the Open Table app.  I thought that was really progressive and something more restaurants should take advantage of!  We were able to pay as soon as we were done, and not have to wait for anyone to take the card and return with it.  It just makes it easier for everyone involved!

4.0,4/4/2016,"This review is only for their brunch. I loved the ambiance here and the service was great, but the portions are too small for dishes that were $18 each. I got the famed porchetta sandwich and my boyfriend got the sausage sandwich, but he was still hungry at the end. The coffee was also $4! Thankfully it came in big mugs and refills were free. That being said, the porchetta was delicious and actually pretty filling. The small ""salad"" on the side was good, but I would have liked some potatoes or something else on the side. I loved the light from the skylight and airy feel to the dining area. The high ceilings and open kitchen were wonderful. There are two long communal tables and one row of seats, where we were, against the wall. When we arrived, the two communal tables were basically empty, yet we were seated next to a party of four, at a four person table, and another couple was then seated at our same table. I know restaurants have specific ways of seating people, but I hate it when they squish everyone together when the rest of the restaurant is completely empty. They also have a few tables in the cafe/market area in the front, and I wouldn't have minded sitting there. Oh well. I enjoyed our brunch but I'd rather go somewhere else and get more food for the same amount or less money. It's a nice little gem with a great atmosphere though.

Seated upsatirs at a communal table, the vibe was energetic and loud. For starters, we began with a salumi board, which included a delicious salame toscano, mortadella, prosciutto, culatello and Lonza.  All were excellent, with the salame the group favorite. Other starters were the calamari wrapped with a bay leaf(dont eat the leaf!) and the highlight of the apps-a flash fried artichoke. Excellent. Must get. For mains, 2 split the famous short rib plate and it lived up to every expectation. Cooked perfectly, oozing taste, the plate was devoured. The other main was an expertly presented branzino.    Desserts included a choclate tort with delicious sorbet and another bottle of the gattinara. Service was good, albeit a bit rushed at first until they realized our pace was casual-slow. The bill with 2 bottles sans tip was 390.00$ for 3, and with Shadys ALWAYS generous tip it settled in for 160$ per person with 2 nice bottles.

4.0,3/29/2016,"Brunch en famille.The bloody marys were on point, tangy, no strange flavors.I am somewhat perturbed that we had to pay ($11?) for a basket of bread, as we had ordered the charcuterie platter ($28). For some reason the basket was mostly  filled with the chocolate and nut breads while we were eating the meats, and the waitstaff refilled the basket with more of the plainer stuff later in the meal. This made no sense. You don't put charcuterie on chocolate bread. The ricotta was nice, but the butter, one large pat for four people, was a bit parsimonious. The salumi were sublime, nice moist prosciutto, salame, and two other meats I am forgetting. A good portion.Three of our four main courses were a hit. I think my porchetta sandwich topped with two eggs took the prize. The plating is a little odd for a dish that  runneth over. The porchetta was really delicious, although the skin was a bit too chewy. The feinschmecker enjoyed her rabbit ravioli, and the missus scarfed a good carbonara. My son found his Eggs al Forno too greasy, so that one's off the list.Desserts hit the mark.

5.0,3/7/2016,"Our best friends, as extreme foodies as we are ourselves, gave me a gift certificatefor my birthday to try the place. So we were in the city today and after 6 months waiting time it was the perfect day to redeem it. So we arrived at the place (so just that I got confused because they have two locations within 2 blocks). We finally found the right one. You come in and my first impression was a kind of Murray's cheese store feeling with tables in the back. I loved it! The shelves full of goodies , the kind of store you just want to buy any single item. Not even mentioning the meat and cheese display, wow I want ALL of that!So we got sited and a look at the menu and I knew we have not been sent there by coincidence.Changing Menus, simple dishes but selection just like you want it ALL!Back to the crucial ordering moment we decided to focus on the basics, the salumeria options were looking fabulous, we tried the Crudo just to see what the kitchen was able to produce, followed by a cheese assortment, indeed small bites but the best way to see the quality of the products they were offering. Don't get me wrong but in my opinion the better the products, the less the kitchen is supposed to touch it. At that stage our first dish was the Crudo, no question perfectly executed the Trout roe and the marinade, a dream within a dream.The kitchen knows what they are doing.The charcuterie selection. I can only say one I would never have thought for one second that it was not all imported instead of that our waitress explained us that they were growing their own pigs and the complete processing was taking place in the basement. To me at this stage, the best meat I ever tasted in NYC. Only that it is 100% made in the US, to me huge respect. BTW we were told that they were the only restaurant in the city doing all that by themselves, and based on the quality I totally believe it.The cheese were great too, even if for that one I do doubt that they also have their own cows, sheeps and goats in the basement. Does not matter it was simply perfect (have a feeling we had already this type of perfect cheese experience not far away from them).As usual my review will not be complete without the wine point. The list is short but powerful. All essentials are there and we enjoyed our cocktails as much as our bottle of Piemonte wine.So even if the gift certificate did not cover half of our meal, every dollar was worth it, and next time I will go crazy in the front instead.Was this review ...?",0,0,0,Benjamin L.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",4,68,36

The Cacio e Pepe was al dented, cheesy and toothsome. Incredible. The boar Raghu was overpowering. The anchovy pasta too mild.

2.0,2/15/2016,"Used to really really love this place. The food has always been solid. Service is here or there, depending on the individual and time of day -not bad, but not amazing. It's a casual place, so that's fine. But the food...In particular, their short rib panini was once-upon-a-time, my favorite sandwich ever. Great bread, amazingly tender, juicy and flavorful short rib with a beautiful black pepper and I don't know what crust on the outside. Topped with onions and oozing gorgonzola cheese, not to mention the great pickled veggies they serve along side, to cut the richness -this thing was rich, decadent and really satisfying. No longer. Over time, I have noticed it became more difficult to get the sandwich. Either mysteriously unavailable, or it was only available on certain days. Then it became only available for weekday lunch. OK, fine. At least I finally know the pattern for availability.Then I come in today for lunch, after not having had a short rib sandwich in a while. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be coming in again. The sandwich that arrived at our table was sad. Google the Il Buco Alimentari short rib panini and you'll be served an impressive abundance of pictures and raves about a sandwich with a thick slab of short rib. Order one now and you'll be served a mere shell of a once great NYC menu item. My panini contained a few thin-ish slices of short rib, that tasted as though they had been cooked on a different day, sliced and refrigerated to be used later for sandwiches. It tasted as though enough time had passed that flavor actually drained out of the meat. The total volume of meat is also less than what used to be. There was no gorgonzola to be seen or tasted, and the sandwich had a mush of overcooked onions on top. What a disappointment. At least the pickled veggies were still good -they were the only source of real flavor to the whole experience.If you order an $18 short rib sandwich and the only thing worth mentioning is the pickled vegetables... there is a problem. And that stings a little.I hope this honest review brings light to the fact that Il Buco Alimentari is capable of great food and that I'd love to see my favorite sandwich return one day. But at $18 per panini, I'll have to see or hear about it from someone else first. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.",1,0,0,Mike R.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",0,5,0

4.0,2/9/2016,"We popped in here on a Thursday evening and found this place very lively, both in the front in the more narrow dining area as well as in the back main dining room/bar area.  I always enjoy eating at places that have exposed bricks and wooden tables, and this is exactly what you get here.  If you are to come for dinner, I would recommend 1 - making reservations and 2 - requesting to sit in the back dining room so you don't feel like your space is being encroached upon.For starters, we went with the beet salad (creamy yogurt but flavorful with nicely fried quinoa) and the persimmon salad (a bit more acidic but different), both of which were good.  For our intermezzi, we did the cacio e pepe (a bit too al dente and dry for my liking) and the spaghetti neri (cooked perfectly but be sure you are ready for the bottarga which is a bit salty in flavor).  For our entree, we did the branzino with roasted carrots (which was cooked simply and was nice and light).  To wrap things up, we did the chocolate tart (a little too rich but well balanced with ice cream), a panna cotta (with balsamic reduction that was nicely done) and a goat cheese ice cream (concord grape jam, grape shaved ice, pistacchio and honey comb) that is a must order!Overall, the service was friendly and attentive as our bartender/waitress Lindsey was great.  The dining room did get a bit loud so be ready for that but overall, I enjoyed the atmosphere.  With the amount of food and drinks we got, after tax and tip, the prices were very fair and I would most definitely return.Buon appetito.",1,1,1,Marco M.,"Manhattan, NY",447,503,263

5.0,2/3/2016,"What a great restaurant. We walked for our 8:45pm reservation and woah, Tuesday night they were packed. Standing room only, shoulder to shoulder in their tiny entrance as ppl waited. I felt bad for the tables in the front as ppl had to graze past them, almost touching them in the tight space to get through. We waited an additional 20mins but grabbed a proseco at the cramped miniature bar. Tip: request to sit upstairs or in the back area as the ambiance and lack of waiting patrons standing next to you while you eat is much better. Food: read many reviews about the short ribs for 2. Did not disappoint and i wasn't craving meat - almost didn't order. So glad we did. Super crispy crust and ultra tender meat. A couple of pieces were grizzle/thick fat but most pieces were incredible. Would definitely come back and order this dish. Our table started with the crispy artichokes, a selection of salami/prosciutto that came on a large wooden board and the waiter asked if we wanted cheese (not on the menu but they have) and i am glad we said yes - he asked soft or hard- we chose hard cheeses (asiago, romano etc). We had them make a selection for the table without us choosing specifics. Aside from prosciutto, lardo, pancetta and mortadella, i had never heard of the others. There were no descriptions next to the names of the specialty salamis/meats which i found unusual given the number of choices but it was ok.  The waiter was helpful. Everything was delicious. The pastas were good but noticeably small portions for some (not all) to consider an entree - probably 1/3 smaller than it should have been. The pastas were kept simple: one is a bucatini pasta with shaved romano and black pepper. No ""sauce"" but the cheese is good and it sort of melts into the pasta a bit. It reminded me something you might throw together impromptu at home.  Maybe it is ""too simple"" for a restaurant...and were that to have been my meal alone i may have been let down. They have a pasta dish with ricotta (little balls of ricotta scattered throughout) that was phenomenal. Dishes like this are better for sharing so that everyone has a little taste but pasta purists will appreciate the quality of the simple ingredients.  So, i would recommend ordering several dishes and share tastes with the table. Since the short ribs were such a stand out, for a table of 5-6, i would recommend you order 2 of them, plus 4 pasta dishes. They serve the pasta very, very al dente. I also had to google a couple of things on the menu as i had no idea what they were (bottarga?) But that's ok.  Everything was very authentic Italian and i loved that. The menu is simple and compact in offerings but had the right amount of choices and you could tell they wanted to simplify. You'll definitely want appetizers, entree AND dessert. None of the portion sizes are large but, that allows you to sample each course and enjoy a well rounded meal. There is a very communal aspect to food like this.  We started out ordering our own meals and wound up pushing everything to the center so that everyone could share.  It just happened organically because it was all so good. This place is a new favorite.  I loved it all. You should go.",0,0,0,B D.,"Saddle River, NJ",0,35,14

1.0,1/11/2016,"Have you ever paid $17 dollars for a handful of pasta with a lit bit of olive oil? Well that's exactly what passes for a cacio e pepe at Ill buco. Not only are the prices completely out of control (OJ $7 dollars, 5 pieces of crispy artichoke $17), the portions are laughable in relation. The experience might have been saved if the wait staff was competent at taking orders and delivering on them. Our table asked for a few things throughout the meal (more cheese for the bare and bland pasta, another coffee, an orange juice). These things either never showed up or showed up toward the end of our meal. The coup de grâce is that they don't take more than 3 credit cards regardless of the size of the table. I understand that there are fees involved in charging cards, and it's a little bit more work, but I would also imagine being gracious hosts might help customers deal better with the fact that they just dropped a wad of cash and left hungry.

1.0,12/29/2015,"A portion of my letter to Mngmt:""What transpired Christmas Eve was nothing less than a joke and sincerely insulting to anyone who dined there that night and experienced what we experienced.  I had called your restaurant and emailed no less than 3 times in the month of November to see about obtaining information for your anticipated services for the Christmas holiday.  On the day you announced the menu for the Feast of the Seven Fishes on social media, I immediately confirmed a reservation and then booked our flights.  We arrived for our reservation early and excited.  Having been seated at 7:05pm for a 7:00 pm reservation, all started appropriately.  Wine was ordered, and dinner service began with the shared first set of courses some 35 minutes after seating.  Ironically enough, we felt that the food quality on those items was not as strong as other starters we had dined on prior at Il Buco.  Nevertheless, we rationalized that it was a fixed meal situation for the holidays and looked forward to the remainder of the courses.From that point, however, all simply went to hell.  2 hours into service, the next course (the crudo) had not arrived.  We followed up with our server, who said it was on the way on at least 3 occasions.  Nevertheless, the 2 parties on either side of us were well paced on their courses and wine pairings.  At some point, we realized that one party was on their last savory course (the monkfish, which notably had been sent back to the kitchen by them due to temperature complaints) and the other 3 top had already completed service with their dessert (it should be pointed out that both parties had been on their 1st and 2nd courses upon our seating).  On the last inquiry made to the server regarding the crudo, he advised us that ""there was nothing [he] could do..."" to facilitate the service!  Seriously??!  So, Joe located a young woman who appeared to be a floor manager and upon inquiry to her, she ran around from the terminal to the first floor, but never came back to advise us.  We located her again some 10 minutes later and she seemed shocked that we had not received the crudo course.  Finally, at approximately 9:30pm, not having received the second course, Joe spoke with an Italian gentleman who appeared to either be a Manager or Principal.  He indicated that he would see what the hold up was.  Yet again, another conversation was had with our server and the terminal was consulted.  However, no feedback, explanation or substantial movement was provided to us or in regard to our party.  When your confused bussers attempted to bring us a duplicate 1st course (the shared plates) and thereafter try to serve us the scampi (having skipped the crudo altogether), we had had enough and elected to depart.  Interestingly enough, when we left at approximately 9:45 pm, some 30 people were still outside milling around and waiting for tables!  While we thank you for your offer to provide us sandwiches/panettone upon our departure and complimenting our 2 ordered wine bottles that evening, the fact remains - you screwed up terribly and on an evening where service and food quality should have been at a prime.  It was Christmas Eve... why would we want to eat sandwiches after having booked ourselves for a $95.00 meal and ordered 2 bottles of wine?!  Let's face it - it was Christmas Eve... it was a special evening and sandwiches or bread was NOT an adequate consolation for missing a feast of a meal.  We made arrangements to come to NY, simply for your Feast of the Seven Fishes and made all further reservations for the remainder of the trip around getting in that evening to dine with you.  We were certainly lucky that another restaurant (Casa Mono) took us in and provided impeccable service on that holiday at roughly 10pm!  This situation was altogether insulting.  I regret having invited our friend, Gary, to dine with us that evening.My complaints: (a) our server should never have been on the floor (he was unable to communicate and address client issues effectively and altogether began to ignore us and avoid eye contact when he realized we weren't happy; THAT is simply not good business or good service); (b) your managers should have been better able to address the problems at hand (clearly you had issues that evening and while they may have commenced in the kitchen, your floor personnel was not adequately trained to handle the problems and customer inquiries); (c) your abilities to converse with, explain and provide meaningful feedback to your guests is far from adequate and acceptable (why was staff constantly running back and forth, conversing with each other and looking at terminals, without any return visits to our table to provide information and explanation?); and (d) food quality was without a doubt lackluster as compared to previous visits.  Based on this visit, I personally would never return to any of your establishments and I would no longer advise colleagues, friends and family to dine there.""",15,5,0,Charlotte Y.,"Chicago, IL",44,74,4

It turned out this was my 2nd time here. Last time I dined here was with a group of 10 people. A different experience compared with this time.The restaurant was packed when we walked in. It feels like an Italian deli, but the rustic modern deco opens up to a cozy experience. We were greeted politely even though we gave a wrong reservation name and they couldn't find us on the system. Only took them a few minutes, we got it sorted out and were directed to the 2nd floor. We sat in the end of the communal table at the corner, sharing the table with 2 other groups in total of 10 people including us two.We started with Salumi and Lattuga salad. The Salumi was house-cured. With my adventurous expectation, it came out not bad. I wish the Mortadella was better though. The Lattuga salad was incredibly tasty. Probably the best salad I've had - seasoned and dressed perfectly. The touch of anchovy taste in the dressing was perfectly balanced with the rest of the ingredients. The big leafy lettuces were unbelievably fresh. And the pickled little onions were delightful.My main entree was Agnolotti - Maine peekytoe crab, Jimmy Nardello pepper and chervil. There were 8 small ravioli, about bit size, came with the vinegar broth. The perfectly cooked ravioli went very well with the broth along with the diced pepper. It looked like piece of art with the red color pepper and Italian parsley garnish. It tasted like heaven.Liam had Salt-baked Whole Branzino. The waiter offered to de-bone it for us, which he did a really good job. There were few bones here and there, but that's what you expect when eating fish. Overall it tasted good. The charred lemon was a nice garnishing piece. I wish it was taken out earlier from the oven. It tasted a bit overcooked.Since most of our dishes were seafood, I paired with white wine - Val di Toro Vermentino ""Auramaris""2012 (Toscana). It has intense aromas of citrus and well-balanced acidity. It was well-balanced with my dishes. Liam seemed to enjoy his red wine as well.The desserts were delicious! The Seasonal Fruit Crostata was amazing - sweet and sour mixed together served a sharp sour-rushed taste followed by melting gelato. Liam liked it a lot. The Panna Cotta was standard. The balsamic vinegar went well with it.I am 5'7"" tall. I felt like the seat height of the chairs was a bit low for me.

I kept changing the time..and the party size..but the restaurant was very accommodatingShort Ribs (their most popular dish) - we all shared the one short rib dish as an appetizer. It is topped with some..celery tasted vegetable (My friend kept repeating what it actually was..but I will never remember the name) along with chopped up olives. I smiled everytime I hit a fatty piece. The dish is $59, but it is sufficient for an appetizer for 6 people because it is some heavy duty stuff.Cacio e Pepe - a lot of people wrote reviews about this.....So......I hopped on the bandwagon and picked this dish. It was just...a-ok. The first thing I noticed was that the pasta was too al dente. The noodles barely even bent. I could taste the authenticity in this dish, but I'd rather pick something else with a lot more flavor. As people say..it was too....basic.Roasted gnocchi - this pasta came with roasted cauliflower - I love cauliflower, so I was happy to see that. It also came with some unique..looking broccoli. If I had to pick between the two dishes, I would get this.Service - A+! The waiter misunderstood me when I asked him to pack my pasta, so the restaurant made me a new dish right away.

1.0,9/1/2015,I am haunted by the experience I had here in 2012 and feel compelled to say that I'm shocked that the restaurant never contacted me with an apology. I'm still appalled that our waiter was clearly a busboy runner on one of his first nights as a waiter - everyone has to learn but on a busy Friday in Manhattan you don't speak very good English at all - and you don't explain to the table that all the plates are family style for sharing - really???? I am still humiliated when I think of my out of town guests looking on in horror as each one received a giant plate of meat meant for sharing. Seriously one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had.,1,0,0,Dolly D.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,134,6

4.0,8/17/2015,"KenScale: 8.5/10It's been a while since I last visited Il Buco Alimentari. I really enjoyed the straightforward yet well-executed cooking at this restaurant, then helmed by chef Justin Smillie. Since then, chef Smillie has taken his talent to red-hot Upland and chef Joel Hough has stepped in, but the words I've been hearing is that Il Buco Alimentari is still executing beautiful cooking with simple yet elegant dishes. I decided to check it out how the restaurant is doing on a recent weekend brunch, and still found a lot of things to like about.I tend to avoid brunch because the range of dishes that I can sample becomes significantly limited. For Italian brunch where I get to try a number of paninis and pastas, however, I still wouldn't mind going at 1 p.m. in the afternoon and Il Buco Alimentari did deliver with a lot of great dishes. Fried rabbit, which was missing on my previous dinner visit, is as tender as chicken. While torta pasqualina consisting of Tuscan kale, organic farm egg and parmigiano was somewhat underwhelming despite its promise, I really liked Tuscan kale Panini that came with Calabrian chili and anchovy. Kale is one of those overused ingredients in the locavore-crazy New York dining scene, but the Panini was still very satisfying, as was the Panini with housemade sausage, fried egg and aged cheddar. Among the paninis, though, the winner hands down was the absolutely delicious porchetta Panini that came with organic eggs and salsa verde. I could probably eat this for lunch any given day, with gently cooked pork working wonderfully with the eggs. It looks simple, but the complexity of flavor was remarkable. On my last trip to Il Buco Alimentari, the pasta dishes were all great, and my visit this time was just as successful. Cacio e pepe with pocorino and black pepper or paccheri that came with housemade sausage and tomato may look like just one of those pasta dishes at a pedestrian Italian establishment, but I can tell that a lot of thoughts have gone into preparing exquisite balance of flavor and texture. I'm not the first one to order gnocchi when it comes to pastas, but the roasted gnocchi with chanterelle mushrooms, English peas and parmigiano was awesome and had the hearty feel that represents the strength of this restaurant. All of the desserts we sampled were also great, from the panna cotta that had very interesting twist thanks to 10-year aged balsamico to delicious tasting of gelatos and sorbets (we tried salted caramel, lemon and mixed berry). The winner among the desserts, however, was poached apricot that came with buckwheat crumbs and yogurt sorbet. It was very refreshing and I couldn't stop digging the dish with everyone in my dining party until it was gone in 3 minutes.The restaurant still keeps that charming Italian market feel (and it does still have one on the front). There are only a handful of places in the city I would recommend for an awesome brunch time, and Il Buco Alimentari is definitely one of them, with fresh ingredients and thoughtful cooking that would start an awesome weekend day.",2,0,1,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738
4.0,8/12/2015,"Amazing porchetta. It was so juicy and tasty, and the fat turns into a crispy outside, which takes the meat to another level. Really attentive service. They were constantly filling up our glasses of water using the bottle of water they put on the table before I would even notice they needed filling up, and the glasses are pretty small, so this was borderline a little intrusive because of how often they would have to reach over for the bottle. Crispy artichokes were too oily for my taste.

2.0,7/31/2015,I was looking forward to our dinner reservation here last Friday night since I love Italian food and wine! Despite having made a reservation we still had to wait 20 minutes for our table. We were seated in the front section of the restaurant right near the hostess station at a high top table which was extremely uncomfortable and the table wiggled the entire dinner. Our waitress was nice and knowledgeable but clearly overwhelmed as she was only interested in taking our order and getting to her next table as fast as possible. We felt her urgency with each question she asked. The food was just alright.. the flavor wasn't exciting.. in fact it reminded me of my own cooking and for the prices they charge on a cheap commodity like pasta I was expecting much much more. We started with the artichoke hearts which were served burnt to a crisp on purpose. So it reminded me of eating chips in a way and it didn't come with any dipping sauce. I think a nice aioli would have been a great pairing! We also ordered the fennel salami which was thick butcher cut slices... it was nice but again nothing we haven't experienced on a charcuterie board before.

Branzino is simply roasted on the the bone and  absolutely delicious, (they fillet the fish on request) roasted short ribs is the signature dish and amazing, the shaved radish and  subtle anchovy taste complement the tender meat perfectly.

It was strange, it felt like our dinner was over and it hadn't begun yet. The dishes were spaced out with very long intervals of time between each. Once we were done with our food there was no one to offer us dessert, so we just asked our busboy for our check. A server we hadn't seen before came over and dropped the check without a word.

3.0,6/21/2015,"The food at Il Buco Alimentari & Vineria is solid, but there are other aspects that detract from the experience.  Portion size relative to price is the prime suspect here, as well as a supplement for bread. The pasta was great, though, and I really enjoyed the deconstructed lasagnette.  I also want to note that, unlike quite a few reviewers, we actually enjoyed good service from a very pleasant, attentive waiter.I ordered the lasagnette, which has all of the components of a classic lasagna, but is not composed as one which makes it a much lighter, but still very flavorful version.  I particularly enjoyed the heat from the peperoncini and red pepper flakes.  I also tasted the Carbonara - which was executed well - and the salumi dela casa plate, which was tasty.  The salumi selection was more diverse than at many other restaurants, which I appreciated.  If I remember correctly, it included prosciutto di parma, finocchiona, coppa di testa, lardo, toscano and sopressata.Two complaints:1) The pasta portions are a bit small for the $18-$22 price tag.2) They charged for bread service without letting us know there would be a supplement.  Before ordering I asked the waiter for the salumi dela casa and he asked if I would like bread with it, to which I of course replied that I would.  It wasn't until the end of the meal that we realized we had been charged.  In fairness, we would have ordered the bread anyway, but I felt a bit misled. It also would have been nice if the purchased bread came with further accompaniments.All in all, if you put a plate of food in front of me from Il Buco Alimentari & Vineria I would eat it with a big smile, but there were some issues with the overall experience.",5,0,0,Alex S.,"New York, NY",20,91,54

I will give you a little idea of all of my experiences.Breakfast: This is the ultimate birthday breakfast/brunch destination. In fact, I came here for both my boyfriend and my birthday mornings. It sounds so simple but they even do coffee amazing. They bring you a little shot glass of steamed milk to put into your hot coffee that puts it over the top. I suggest going for the olive oil tasting to start the meal off. Next, my favorite items are the breakfast sandwich (with either sausage or prosciutto) or the baked eggs with sage and toast (drooling thinking about it). Dinner: Came here for dinner and it was, of course, packed. The crispy artichokes are a great way to start any meal and I got the salt-baked whole branzino. Everything is just mouth wateringly delicious. The ambiance is incredible - old italian with a modern, downtown, trendy twist. The staff is friendly and quick and very accomodating.Snacks: Il Buco Alimentari has amazing cookies and treats. I came here with my brother just for fun and we sat at a high top table. We ordered coffees and an assortment of beautiful, and equally scrumptious, confections. We got great sugar cookies with jam in the middle and little hazelnut nuggets. Additionally, we tried some of their breakfast cakes, which, again, were delish. We did think the cookies were a bit expensive (some were over $5 for a single little cookie).

Don't sit there. We ended up choosing the bar seats and they were a lot better.As for the food, all I can say is either eat beforehand or suffer the cost of ordering more food. The serving sizes of some of the dishes, especially the pastas were underwhelming/inconsistent. The bf had the ragu and as soon as I saw it, I knew he would be hungry and I had to go through my kitchen inventory of possible snacks later. The ragu was apparently very tasty nonetheless. I had the bottarga and my dish was significantly more substantial...but it really seemed to be missing something. It was literally just spaghetti and bottarga. No veg, no textural elements. Our neighbors didn't seem to enjoy their gnocchi and got comped a ragu to replace it, but the size of the serving was bigger than ours. Really frustrating.

Still, for $110 per person I expected a lot more.The tagliatelle with brussels sprouts was overcooked; the pasta was soggy. Our main courses, the raw steak and the fish, were teeny tiny. I was surprised by how hungry I felt after spending $110.

5.0,2/5/2015,"IN SHORT: A simple, darling space that feels like a comfortable little trattoria in Italia. Despite its casual leanings, however, the food is anything but ordinary.THE STORY: One of the most special moments during a meal at Il Buco is the inevitable realization halfway through a plate of pasta that this perfectly firm bite of densely comforting spaghetti is served in a brightly lit space full of happy people eagerly cleaning their plates and talking excitedly without any pretension. With a staff happy to provide sharing plates for the entire table to indulge family style, Il Buco has seamlessly delivered on its promise to provide 3-star food in a space that feels like a modest neighborhood kitchen.A perfect meal at Il Buco should always be framed with a plate of Salumi (prepared in house) in the beginning and a plate of cheeses at the end, both some of the best offered in the city, bringing you as close to a cozy trattoria in Italy as possible. While 5 cheeses for $28 will offer a phenomenal selection (that is best left for the kitchen to decide), you would be forgiven for asking for 5 servings of the Truffle Tremor goat cheese. After one bite with Il Buco's airy bread, I wondered why all cheese wasn't just like this.In between these soft bites of meat and cheese, the pastas and main courses stand gracefully on their own. Diners should not be afraid of what they assume are heavy morsels of potato when ordering the housemade Roasted Gnocchi, which are surprisingly light and just barely toasted for a little crispy exterior, served with black trumpet and hedgehog mushrooms and caprino stagionato, a thinly shaved Italian goat cheese. It's possibly my favorite dish on the menu.The Porchetta alla Romana, a savory, fatty, moist and boneless pork roast served with a pile of charred avocado, ambrosia, apples, and wild watercress is another favorite, while the Cacio e Pepe with pecorino Romano and black pepper is another reminder of how Il Buco excels with simple dishes made from the highest quality ingredients. Innovation here is the result of a dedication to the truest and most thoughtful tastes of Italy, presented in exquisite, and still accessible, form.Although the joy in dining at Il Buco comes partially from the casual dynamism of the space, sometimes service can be a bit too casual, taking away our menus before we ordered our main courses, and squeezing our pasta dishes against our appetizers on our tiny table. But perhaps this is just a nuance that comes with a restaurant that succeeds because of its dedicated search for a relaxed Italian dining standard. When in Rome, right?",5,2,3,Ali M.,"New York, NY",31,234,245

3.0,1/11/2015,"Warm service and decent (but not excellent) food. None of it is cheap. With all the other Italian places in NYC I would make this my backup plan rather than the first choice. Nonetheless worth going back.Went with a large group of 7, seated upstairs and ordered half the menu. Primo charcuterie, bread and veggie-based dishes. Disappointed that the least successful dishes were the pasta and fish.Good: Generous charcuterie platter with meltingly tender mortadella, coppa and finocchina served with perfect bread. Butternut squash gnocchi, polenta side with lots of black pepper, and bacalao app stood out as really good.Meh: Most of the apps selection and the short ribs for two. They were a bit overdone and stringy.Disappointing: Very expensive gnocchi special with white truffles was surprisingly unimpressive despite the generous white truffle shavings. It should have been unctuous but it was dry and unflavorful. Branzino had plenty of scales and lots of bones despite it being ""deboned"" which shows either lack of training for the preparer or lack of detail for whoever lets these plates  out of the kitchen.

Was willing to roll with it since most were at big communal tables. Our server was not in the holiday spirit, to say the least. Very surly, curt service.

3.0,12/23/2014,"I have to say right off the bat that if you want to try this place, head over to its predecessor Il Buco first/instead. By all means, this place has some good food and wine, but it lacks the humble, warm-hearted nature of Il Buco that trumps the trendy, loud hub-ub of this place.If you DO eat here, it goes without saying that the fried crispy artichokes are a must. They're well-fried, and with a pinch of lemon, a great start to dinner! I wouldn't particularly recommend the ricotta appetizer, as I found it to lack texture and embody boredom. The cacio e pepe was good, though heavy (when isn't it?). The pepper took over quite a bit, which seemed like a basic mistake, but I trekked on. The whole branzino was a pretty solid fish dish. For the faint of heart, ask them to filet it for you after presentation. Though slightly overcooked, branzino is a very good fish, and they really nail the simplicity with this plate. Overall, intimate is definitely not what I would say about this place. With good food and cafeteria-like decibel levels, it's probably a good place to go with a few friends to have a good night eating/drinking.",1,0,0,Marcus Z.,"Manhattan, NY",65,123,0

Since I don't do pork I had help for part of the review. As per my spouse if you want "" breakfast"" this might not fit the bill. However he did appreciate the crunchy crust on the meat. He claims it is conceptually well thought out and executed. His dish came with 2 over easy eggs, lucky me got to eat those! Dressed in a wonderful oil and fresh herbsBoth of our dishes were accompanied by lightly dressed, but slightly salty  arugula. My dish, the Torta with kale and hard cooked egg was spot on. Perfectly cooked kale with just enough chew. Crust was perfectly bake and golden brown with a hint of parmigiana.  Service is always good here, friendly and informed but was slow during our brunch. Maybe our service memories are due to mostly sitting at the cute little bar.  One thing you can do to pass the time is shop the assorted local and imported sundries.

And if enough money hadn't been extracted, there were always the  food stuff they were selling at the counter and on the walls.Try their other restaurant nearby if you want great food in a relaxed a beautiful environment, or go to Eataly if you really appreciate the shopping market and restaurant combination concept.

3.0,6/6/2014,"This place has subpar food for the price. We ordered a salumi tasting platter for 2, salad, fried artichokes, roasted gnocchi and bread (which is not free... they charge $1 which is weird) for lunch. The ambiance was cool, I loved the furniture. The best dish was a toss up between the fried artichokes and the salad. The fried artichokes were just perfect, still green and fresh on the inside, and crunchy and fried-goodness on the outside. The salad had a very bright acidic dressing, with anchovy shavings/powder on it. I'd never had that fishy powder before, and to be honest, I prefer whole anchovy instead.The worst dish, ack yuck was the roasted gnocchi, which literally tasted like burnt balls of mashed potatoes. Doughy, heavy, mushy, not good. The bread took ""crusty"" to a whole 'nother level. It just tasted burnt. The olive oil they serve with it is really great though.",0,0,0,Kelly C.,"San Francisco, CA",3,74,12

The pappardelle with rabbit was under seasoned and the rabbit was like rabbit sausage and not tasty.

4.0,5/21/2014,"Went in for a friend's birthday dinner last night. Had 9 PM reservation for 4. But then I cancelled on going so my friend changed the reservation for 3. Then as the night rolled on, I changed my mind again. So I went in with them. The hostess was actually nice. She was like, sure. 3 or 4, doesn't matter. So in we went. We were seated at the high table with stools. We ordered a bunch of stuff, from appetizers to entree to desserts - Chinese style. We shared everything and got to taste a lot more. We also ordered 2 bottles of wine. My two friends did the ordering and pairing as they're more foodie snobs than me (I say this with love - seriously) and they did a great job. So the food and wine came. I don't know all the names but some dishes really stood out. I also tried quail for the first time and rabbit. Well, I have actually eaten rabbit meat before when I was a kid but didn't know it until after I ate it. I thought it tasted like chicken.The winner of the night was actually the Roasted Gnocchi. It was so delicious and succulent. The quail and rabbit were also good. The quail was a bit oily but still good. The kale was just average. The Crispy Artichoke was also a favorite. We ordered 3 kinds of desserts, I thought they all kind of tasted weird, but I may just not be familiar with them. One has balsamic vinegar in it (dunno the name). It was delicious without the vinegar. The coffee ice cream was good. The total bill came just a bit shy of $400. That place is expensive, but we also had 2 bottles of wine, quite a lot of food and a few shots of Amari. Mine I think was Montenegro and it was delicious. Smelled like the hills, tasted like flowers.So, will I go back? If I have spare cash, absolutely!! In the mean time, I'll wait around and make my own gnocchi.",2,1,1,Fenny N.,"New York, NY",56,16,3

2.0,5/19/2014,"If you like salty food, i mean really really salty food Italian food, you gotta come here.  I came to Il Buco for brunch with a friend. We came here mostly for the short rib sandwich (not on the brunch menu). The short ribs indeed did not disappoint. but the sandwich itself is heavily seasoned with salt and salty cheese paired with really salty picked veggies ( cauliflower carrots etc). Man that's really salty. But this is not the most salty dish.. When the Pizza Bianca came, both of us are extremely overwhelmed by the saltiness of the overall taste. So salty that we cannot taste anything else and certainly could not finish.  It could have been such a great pizza. really nice dough with creamy white cheese spread and smoked salmon, toppled with arugula dressed in fried caper dressing. Oh man, that was such a salty pizza. We tasted all the individual component trying to figure out what made it so salty. And the conclusion was that everything is very salty. the dressing was very salty, the caper was very salty. the pizza dough was  salty the cheese spread is very salty and smoked salmon is understandably salty but why put all those salty stuff together in such quantity? I really wonder if the chef has tasted the pizza on that day. How can any respectful chef serve a pizza like that? The most funny thing came when we raised the issue to the waiter in a casual manner. But basically his response was like ""Yeah, every ingredient in this pizza is salty so it is salty. but was it inedible? ""  We politely avoid escalating but yes, it was inedible. It was such a disappointing experience. Maybe the departure of the chef would be a good thing. In any case, i would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Although they have a lot of great things going for this place, if they would serve a pizza this salty and confidently defend it, they lose all credibility as a respectful restaurant..",1,1,1,Qiwen C.,"Manhattan, NY",3,10,1

We were there with a pregnant friend and she grew impatient when we asked her questions regarding dietary restrictions. 2) We ordered several appetizers, bread (yes the only way to get bread is order the salami plate), several pastas, and one entree. The appetizers came at an awkward pace, the lamb shanks were not edible (although I think they didn't charge us).3) when our pasta came, when asked where our entree was the waitress said ""I told you that this would happen.""

4.0,4/14/2014,"This place always kind of confused me, which is why it's taken me awhile to come here.It's the more casual version of the original restaurant, Il Buco, which is around the corner. When I looked up the website for this one, I found different menus for the bakery area, the cafe, and the sandwich shop, all up front, and then separate breakfast, lunch, brunch, dinner and dessert menus for the sit-down restaurant in the back. More confusingly, none of them had the Short Rib Sandwich that I read so much about and which was the main reason I wanted to eat here.I finally decided to try it out for brunch, so I made reservations since I also heard it gets quite crowded, but it was mostly empty on a Saturday at 1 PM.Much to my dismay, the waitress perplexingly told me that they had the Short Rib Sandwich on the menu yesterday, but not today, and they kept requesting them to bring it back. Who is them? Any why do they randomly not have it day to day? Disappointment aside, it did allow us to try another sandwich and a bunch of other stuff that happened to be excellent anyway:- Pastry Basket ($11)Before I talk about how excellent this bread is, let me first point out how shady and blatant it is that they charge more for the bread basket than it costs if you order each item individually - that's right, not the same amount, but actually more money. It consists of the Chocolate Bombolone ($2.50), the Sugar Brioche ($4) and the Chocolate Cherry Brioche ($3.25). Last time I checked, that only added up to $9.75, not $11, so do yourself a favor and order these delicious breads separately. In fact, get one of the fresh filled bombolone instead, which is even more incredible, and only 50 cents more (and still adds up to less than the $11 for the basket).- Bread ($1 per person)This looked annoying to get charged for bread, but it turned out to be excellent, so I didn't really mind. It's the kind that's not hot, served with salt and olive oil, but it tasted really fresh, and is a nice option to start (even if you order a pastry basket).- Kale ($10)I've seen many mentions of how good this side dish is, so I figured I should try it. It had strong flavors, mostly from the very salty anchovies, but I wasn't feeling the texture of the dish. The kale itself was too soggy, apparently from the very liberal amount of oil in the dish, as evidenced by the deep pool of it at the bottom of the plate. It made me yearn for the much better crispy kale at places like Chuko, so while it was tasty, it left me wishing I tried the also frequently talked about Crispy Artichokes instead.- Bucatini Cacio e Pepe ($19)This was some incredible pasta. Some may say it was a bit too al dente, as it was so firm you could hardly even twirl it on your fork, but it tasted so good. I enjoyed the extreme chewiness and the richness of the sauce and the peppery taste.- Salsiccia e Uova Panini ($15)This was an incredible sandwich. It was a fancy version of a sausage, egg and cheese, with really delicious housemade sausage, cheddar, and a runny egg on top. It looked glorious too, and while my initial reaction was annoyance that the sausage didn't cover nearly all the bread, I didn't mind at all as the bread was so good. They really do bread well here.That was plenty of food for a very satisfying meal, but I couldn't resist trying a few things from the casual cafe-like area up front.- Margherita Pizza ($5)I heard how they just started selling this pizza to go, so I was intrigued to try it. Unfortunately, it was pretty bad. Though they heated it up, it was barely lukewarm. The sauce was bland and the crust was inferior to all the other bread we tried previously. Don't bother with this and get some of the great bread at the cafe right opposite this area instead.- Chocolate Cake ($4)This was quite good. They have this at that cafe area, among several other incredible things. It was fairly dense and chocolatey, but not too rich. For something great and really rich, go with the much better Dulce de Leche Filled Bombolone ($3), which I tried on a previous visit. They fill it right there in front of you, and can taste how fresh the bread is.The food here at all different parts of the building is excellent, and well worth a visit to try the various things on offer. There were plenty of other good choices on the menu to entice me to come back, perhaps for dinner to try some of the other stuff.

We ordered the artichokes, beef tartar, and the assorted meats for appetizers. Each plate was great. For the main course, we all ordered pastas, I got the sausage pasta, which was tremendous. Two people ordered the gnocchi, and both loved it. I can't remember the fourth entree, but it was also well received. The desert was also well received, but the appetizers/entrees were the highlight if the meal.I would rate this place five stars, but my only issue was the size of the servings. I never felt fulfilled, I was always wanting more. Maybe that's the point.

5.0,1/2/2014,"This would be 4.5 stars if that were possible.  I have eaten here 8-10 times since September, mostly lunch but also dinner, and love both the food and the atmosphere.  The staff has very high morale, and that adds to the pleasant vibe of the place and the sense of fun.  The whole experience has been enjoyable every time.  The crispy artichoke and lettuga appetizers are great, as are all the pastas I have had and the branzino.  Also the octopus, the cold cuts and the porchetta (except it is fatty).  Really, everything I have had here has been good and interesting--with a bit of a flare.  The grocery part is limited but excellent. The negatives are: a short menu that doesn't change that much over time, which can be a problem if you come often, and it can be noisy at dinner.  The quietest tables are the ones closest to the door.  There is also an upstairs dining room that is very pleasant.",1,0,0,Ned B.,"New York, NY",3,56,13
5.0,1/2/2014,"I can't believe this place only gets 3.5 stars.  I went with my husband and in-laws 5 days ago and am still thinking about the pasta dish we had here.  We started with the artichokes and the lemon-ricotta-cucumber thing - both light and small - and so tasty.  Then the four of us, shared four pasta dishes.  We had the gnocchi, orecchiette, agnolotti, and bucatini.  They were all good, but the gnocchi and the bucatini were my favorites.  I am a self-professed pasta-lover, so I may be slightly biased, but the flavors and the texture were all perfect.  Particularly on the bucatini, it was cooked just perfectly.  Not overcooked and mushy or undercooked and hard, but exactly at the right spot.  The sauce was just a simple olive oil and salt and pepper and how they made something that simple so delicious is beyond my comprehension.  I also am somewhat addicted to gnocchi so order it almost anytime I see it on the menu.  This gnocchi was so airy and fluffy and perfectly pan-fried on the outside.  The mushrooms that were served with it were so creamy that sometimes you didn't know if you were eating a mushroom or a gnocchi.  The portions were also great - if you prefer on the smaller side.  I often leave Italian restaurants stuffed to the brim.  Here I left completely satisfied but not feeling like I was going to explode.  It was definitely on the pricier side.  The only downside I'd mention was the noise.  It was pretty hard to hear the people we were with so if you are with someone is sensitive to noise, you may want to request that you aren't sat at the center communal table, or even that you get a table in the upstairs area which seemed quieter.  Would be a great date spot, as you can sit at the bar and watch the kitchen.  The decor was adorable.",3,1,1,Jennie F.,"San Francisco, CA",18,11,0

The roasted gnocci were ""incredible, unlike any I've ever had before!"" The orechiette was ""nice,"" but unmemorable. The bucatini cacio e pepe was bursting with amazingly assertive flavors, yet just a tiny little bit under-cooked. Easily my favorite dish was the kale with mustard and anchovy: simply phenomenal. The bread basket was fine, the olive oil was okay. The cocktails & wine went down well. My one real issue with was the waitstaff -- sheesh! Our waitress was sniffling, and seemed to be slightly disoriented and/or distracted, probably due to medication, which is fine, but ultimately she failed to be very helpful, informative, or accommodating. And the bus boys were a little overwhelming in terms of their arrogant forcefulness: one (sporting a waxy-wavy pompadour & a pony-tail mullet) would not stop rearranging our plates while we were eating, and trying to remove everything before we were finished; and another (intensely grinding his jaw & mumbling incessantly to himself) kept spilling water all over the table, each time he came around to over-flow our water glasses...

Oh and the $1 charge for a bread basket - include that in your prices, or absorb the bread cost...I was embarrassed for them.The bad- I have no problem with small food, but the clam ceviche was a tasting portion for $22...nicely plated in 4 small razor clam shells...but I could have combined all four onto one teaspoon. The flavor was bright but nothing special. The Busiate pasta was perfectly al dente, but dreadfully under seasoned. You hear anchovy, tomato, cheese, chiles (sounds good right?)....you expect flavor! I NEVER add salt to restaurant dishes, even if I must withstand a little under-seasoning...but never is no more as I added sea salt, than requested chili flakes and lemon and added those, and it made the dish at least come to life a tiny bit.

4.0,8/1/2013,"A solid 4 1/2 stars bordering on 5. The reasons that I couldn't bump it up to 5 are pretty inconsequential but irksome none the less. I had an early 6:00 reservation on a Wednesday and my date was late. The hostess was very accommodating, as was everyone else there, and didn't give away our seats. The first thing that bothered me is that there really is nowhere to wait. The have a small bar in front with only about 3 stools so when they're taken you kind of just have to awkwardly stand in every ones way. I chose to wait outside. When we were seated we took 2 seats on the end of the bar in the back. I really like the atmosphere, a true trattoria. We decided on some cocktails before we looked at the menu. I went with the Miele which was Blanton's, nonino amaro and honey, light on the honey and my date tried the lemonade which was made with vodka, fresh lemonade and mint, they both were fantastic. The sommelier approached us soon after we were seated and I told him to revisit in about 10. The bread they serve you to start is perfect with some extra fine EVOO and sea salt. Skip the bread sticks on the bar as they tasted a bit stale to me. When the sommelier did revisit he was very helpful. We wanted to do a red even though I was having fish as my date is not a white drinker. We definitely had to steer to the lighter side. He made some suggestions and I always try to be adventurous when I'm out so I chose a red from Lebanon. It was interesting and I'm glad I went in that direction.  For appetizers we decided to split the Pulpo A La Plancha: seared octopus, favas, hearts of palm, green almonds, black garlic. I love octopus and this was definitely one of the better dishes I've had. Everything was so fresh and beautifully presented. My date is not a fan of octopus and he still thought it was delish. For an entree I had to go with the salt baked sea bass with thyme, sea salt and charred lemon. I would normally go with a pasta dish at a place like this but my very favorite ""friend"" had been here the week before and told me the sea bass was ta die for. They serve you a whole fish that has been baked with a sea salt crust, they fillet it for you of you'd like and then you just drizzle the charred lemon with burnt sugar over the top and it's pretty orgasmic. My date had the Slow-Roasted Short Ribs: castelvetrano olives, celery, walnuts, horseradish and hello, insane. First of all the portion was huge and uniquely presented and the walnuts were seriously like crack, they were slightly sweet and super spicy but in a cracked black pepper kind of way. We had a great time, left completely satisfied and would definitely go back again.",0,0,0,Leslie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",82,444,2
2.0,7/27/2013,"After several successful lunches at the original Il Buco, plus an outstanding review in the NY Times, I was expecting their casual offshoot to be at least on the same level.  However, my dinner at Il Buco Alimentari e Vineria was much more expensive and bland than I had envisioned.I will say that I loved the atmosphere of having a market in the forefront of the space, as well as a dining room in the back.  We were actually lucky enough to be seated in the market itself, where we could watch our meats being sliced, people sipping wine at the wine bar, etc.  I wonder if the service was of a higher quality in the main dining section, though, as our waiter was inexperienced and inefficient.  First off, we were not read the daily specials, which we only learned about by overhearing the waitress informing the neighboring table as we were settling our bill.  In addition, we had ordered a crudo, but it was delivered to us as ""tartare"".  We told the runner that it was not what we had ordered.  He checked in with our server, who returned the scandalous plate back to us.  He confirmed that it was, in fact, the crudo.When it came to the beverages, we started off with some great cocktails.  The Tomr 13 was a refreshing version of a gin and tonic with some crushed cucumber.  Their margarita possessed the perfect balance of tartness.  Our subsequent bottle of German Riesling was also sweet and enjoyable.Now transitioning to the food, we were appalled to discover that we were required to pay $1 for a basket of their housemade bread.  Because of this kitchen-friendly concept, they were able to convince us to order a Meat Platter for two to compliment it.  The assortment of Italian meats possessed a smoky, salty goodness.  Our actual prepared appetizers were less delightful, though.  The Razor Clam Crudo was bland; the Seared Octopus was over-cooked andbheavily charred; and the Beef Carpaccio was mediocre at best.  In addition, each portion size was completely non-proportional to its expensive cost.  For our mid-courses, we chose a Pasta with Anchovies, which needed salt, and the housemade Roasted Gnocchi.  The gnocchi was tossed with foraged and chantrelle mushrooms, but oddly finished in a sauce of the cheaper, button variety.  For an Italian restaurant charging over $20 for their pastas, we had expected much more.  The Porchetta Alla Romana entree was actually delicious, though.  The pork was tender and perfectly seasoned.  The meat only came with some English and sugarsnap peas, so we added a side of Crispy Polenta for substance.  The crunchy fries were sprinkled with a rich parmigiano and some herbs.  These plates were definitely the highlight of the meal.This roller-coaster of a dinner was such a shocking disappointment.  I had never had something that I did not like at the original Il Buco, so I had expected more.  Next time I want a flavorful Italian meal, I suppose I will have to dress up and visit their more formal parent restaurant.",2,1,1,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640
3.0,7/24/2013,"Dinner was good but not great.  We had a carpaccio and a carne appetizer along with salumi for the table.  Then the fish, orecchiette, and the busiate pasta, party of four.  Plus drinks/wine.Service was fine though it disappeared toward the latter half of the meal.  But the biggest problem with Il Buco is that the restaurant charges far too much for dishes that aren't particularly filling or sophisticated.  Babbo, for instance, is comparable in price but their pasta is cooked more consistently and is more generous.  And the appetizers, at $19-$23 for portions that should have cost about $12 were a bit of a scandal.  The same goes for drinks that hit the $15 mark for 3 ounces or so of alcohol.The carne was a joke of a dish for $19--we had a forkful each between the four of us and it was gone, and it wasn't that good.  The orecchiette was the size of an appetizer, and my friends finished it within a few minutes.  It was good but didn't blow them away.  Ditto my busiate, which had a great sauce but undercooked pasta.One other problem: the place is very, very loud.  At 9 p.m. on a Wednesday night, one had to yell to talk to people across the table.  The rustic feel was fine but dull, like a poor man's ABC Kitchen that still charged ABC Kitchen prices and higher.  All in all, a good meal that didn't justify its price tag.  If you go, stick with the salumi and a bit of pasta, but honestly there are just better Italian options everywhere around NY that cook at a higher level and for the same price or cheaper.",4,1,1,Amir N.,"Manhattan, NY",1,23,0
3.0,7/23/2013,"Food was out of this world. The waiter saved the day. But the host staff and the floor manager were horrible.  We had to wait about an hour after our reservation to be seated. We watched as people's coats were misplaced and customers were asked to leave their table before they were done. When they did seat us, they placed a 65 year-old woman who has problems moving around at a bar table where it was impossible for her to get any footing. We had dinner reservations.  There were 3 of us at the bar table, which was so small that we choose to forgo ordering wine and cut back our choices because there was not enough room at the table to serve what we wanted.  In the end, that cut the check and thus the waiter's tip. I got the feeling that  we didn't look as hip and trendy as others and so got relegated to the worst table available that made no sense for a party of three who came for dinner. I kept my comments off -line and politely explained to whomever vets their emails what had happened. Months later, I still never heard back. They much have soo much demand that customer service be damned.  The food was amazing and I might go back to give it another try. And the waiter, as I said in my email, saved the day.

3.0,7/15/2013,"I really wanted to love this place. And as much as the food was good, in that rustic, simple Roman-style, I'm just not sure I'd visit again for dinner anytime soon.First off, Il Buco Alimentari is ridiculously bustling at night, absolutely packed within the dining room and front bar area even on a rainy Friday evening. While I get that the noise level would get very high in a casual environment like this, I really would appreciate a little more order and mood for the prices they charge at dinner.The renowned roasted short ribs, for instance, costs a whopping $42. While ginormous short rib was large enough for 2 to share, I actually found certain chunks of the meat a little tough. The flavors were good tough, especially the shaved celery and walnuts on top that were unexpected. Other dishes I enjoyed include the ricotta appetizer, a light starter featuring creamy housemade ricotta layered with cool cucumbers, zesty pesto and plenty of olive oil. The pulpo a la plancha, while a hefty portion of octopus legs, was quite tough. I prefer my octopus to be braised before it's grilled, which I don't think they did in their preparation, which made for a much chewier product. Pastas here are very Roman and simple, such as the bucatini cacio e pepe we ordered, cooked very al dente with just pecorino romano and black pepper. While the bucatini dish was well made, the portion was truly too small to warrant its $20 price tag. Il Buco Alimentari is also known for their salumi, and the order of mixed salumi we got was fine as well. I was a fan of the prosciutto, but the speck was actually a little too mild for me. Less successful dishes of the night included two of their contorni, the crispy polenta and roasted carrots. I personally have had much better preparations of both dishes at various other Italian restaurants in the city, so I was sadly very disappointed with the ones here since they came at the adamant recommendation of our server.The wine list is also surprisingly limited for a restaurant like this. While I didn't particularly care for either the white or red they served on tap (from Channing Daughters), the price of the caraffina was easy enough to swallow that the glasses went down pretty easy anyway.",2,0,1,Cecilia Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",762,644,43
3.0,7/13/2013,"The short ribs may be great - but you can't get them for 1 person. If you're a vegetarian, there are zero decent options. The cacio e pepe tasted more like buttered noodles. The sides were delicious - the carrots and artichoke - but the plates are small and expensive. Also, the porchetta romana was good, but didn't work perfectly. Great quality of pork was obvious. But altogether, the atmosphere was not appropriate for the price, and the meager options for vegetarians made this a place I will not return to.",0,0,0,Scott L.,"New York, NY",202,444,17

The accompaniments were also delicious making each bite incredibly decadent.  The short rib goes perfectly with the fried polenta.

2.0,6/14/2013,"Il Buco Alimenteri & Vineria is a current Noho darling. I've been there four times recently, and have even replicated their bucatini cacio e pepe at home.  But this review isn't about the food, it's a diner beware about the restaurant's coat check. Do not use it.  Order the short ribs, the pastas, even indulge in dessert, just keep your eye on your stuff. I learned this the hard way. The last time a friend and I went to Il Buco Alimenteri & Vineria, we ate at the bar; space was tight, so my friend checked his jacket, with my new, huge, fabulous silk and cashmere scarf carefully stuffed into a sleeve. After dinner, he got his jacket, but my scarf wasn't with it. The hostess looked around a little bit, didn't see it, and took my e-mail address. Over the next two weeks, in response to my e-mails and phone calls, I was told that they were working on it: looking at the coat check security tape, talking to staff. I was thanked for being patient, and told that the manager was ""in the know on this,"" whatever that means. I went on vacation, and when I returned, I sent a ""checking in"" e-mail, which went unanswered. The way this whole thing fizzled out is disappointing. A great restaurant is more than the sum of its appetizers and entrées; graciousness and customer care still count. This place can do better.",1,1,1,Merle R.,"New York, NY",0,2,0
4.0,6/14/2013,"The original Il Buco on Bond street has an old country Italian vibe. You think you are eating in some small town in Italy and someone's very sophisticated nonna is in the back stirring up the pots. This new joint is more modern in feel and concept, with hints of ""old country"" in the ceramics that are on the wall. Actually the decor suffers from being too muddled. The part that feel right is the more modern, clean touches that are warm and inviting. The huge light in the center of the place--a jumble of all sorts of wires, bulbs, fixtures, etc, is really unappealing. Anyway...about the food...We had an early reservation and were disappointed to be seated at the wine bar, which I later heard is considered a prime spot. But the seats were so high and uncomfortable and the space was so cramped. We had great cocktails and ordered the ricotta with peas and mint--very fresh and delicious, thought the mint could have been more present. Fried artichokes were very very good, though I wished they were a tad crispier. We cleaned the plate though. And the house-made oricchette with sausage and ramps was divine.

4.0,6/1/2013,"Il Buco Alimentari & Vineria is the casual Italian spin-off of more formal sister restaurant Il Buco. ""Alimentari"" refers to the restaurant's gourmet food market concept, which is located near the front entrance. Here, you can stock up on all of your high-end Italian essentials-it's hard to resist the beautiful displays of amazing cured meats, local and imported artisanal cheese, loaves of fresh bread and scoops of sweet gelato.""Vineria"" refers to the restaurant and wine bar portion of the restaurant, which is located behind the retail storefront. About a third of the space is devoted to the wine bar, and the remaining area is filled with large, communal tables. I found the communal tables annoying--when you charge premium prices for your food, comfort and privacy should be included in the markup. Luckily, I got over my discomfort and annoyance when the hearty and flavorful cooking won me over.A plate of the house salumi and a basket of the freshly baked bread are must dos. The hogs that Il Buco Alimentari uses must be the happiest, most well-fed pigs on the planet, because the pork meat here is the richest and sweetest that I've ever tried. The orecchiette was one of the best pasta dishes I've had in a long while. The quality of the freshly made, house-extruded ear-shaped pasta was quite impressive. The salty fennel seasonings from the homemade sausage provided more depth to the flavor, and the parmigiano coated everything in a creamy, velvety sauce. The roasted gnocchi was also well executed although less memorable than the orecchiette. I personally think gnocchi tastes best when left in its soft, billowy form, which better absorbs the flavors of the underlying mashed potatoes and the surrounding sauce. With the roasted version, the char created from roasting the gnocchi dominates the flavor profile, and the more delicate flavors of the seasonings get lost.The enormous plate of slow-roasted ribs arrived at the table in dramatic fashion. Huge slabs of tender meat fell off a piece of bone the size of a grown man's forearm. The moist, fatty rib meat was so delicious that not even our ""flexitarian"" friends Tim and Caroline could resist a taste. As much as I enjoyed the meal at Il Buco Alimentari, I couldn't shake the feeling that I had just eaten dinner in the area reserved for a cooking demonstration at Williams-Sonoma. I understand that low-key is the theme that the owners were going for, but that seems a little disingenuous when entrees are priced over $30 a plate. I think it works better as a lunch place, where the lower price points and the quicker pace of the midday meal are more fitting for the cafeteria-like atmosphere. If you want something romantic or intimate, the sister restaurant is a better bet. If mood is secondary to good food, then by all means make multiple visits to Il Buco Alimentari.",2,0,2,Sherry J.,"Manhattan, NY",82,35,23

After the woman accrued some serious points, it was time for her to redeem her gift for a meal at II Buco Alimentari.  I booked a reservation for 7PM and the table was ready when we walked in, I was initially disappointed that we got seated at the bar instead of a table.  From my experience, sitting at the bar is usually for walk-ins or folks that want the food without the atmosphere.  We each had a glass of wine and dined on the appetizer that came with the different cured meats.  It was quite salty and fatty overall, the most disappointing part of the meal and deserving of a 3 star rating.  She got the rabbit and I got the short rib for our entrees.  This rabbit evaded Elmer Fudd but thankfully coudn't evade the skilled hands of II Buco who deliciously prepared it.  The real star of the show was the short rib, it comes out on a cutting board of sorts with tons of meat and flavor.  I've only had short rib a handful of times, but it is one of the few dishes I have ever had where I welcomed the meat sweats after, it reminded me of the sweet victory I had eaten.",0,3,1,Larry G.,"Raleigh, NC",135,166,29

1.0,4/26/2013,"Yikes! I can't believe what a day to night difference there is here. I ate here in a group of 7 on a Saturday night. None of us will ever go back. We were seated and not given menus, water, or any type of acknowledgement...15 minutes had gone by. After a ridiculous amount of waving trying to get someone's attention, our Italian waiter came over. Gave us menus, then (literally) took another 20 minutes before we flagged him down again to place drink and food orders and ask for water again. What was upsetting about the lack of attention was that we watched him refilling a party of 20's water all the while, or just standing in the corner near the register. BUT that was not the infuriating part - when we ordered and asked that the dishes that have nuts have the nuts on the side because of an allergy, he told us ""Sorry that isn't possible, the nuts are an important part of the dish, they accent this and that"" My allergic friend told him it is her 4th time eating there and they've always put them aside for her, would he mind asking the chef?  ""I'm not even going to go down to ask because I know what he will say, No."" Then after we just threw in the towel and said fine put the nuts on, we'll order more of things she can eat, he continued to argue with us! We kept saying ""ok its fine"" but he kept going on about it. He made a scene and was the most unprofessional restaurant experience I've had. The original tone of the evening where we had to flag someone down to get anything continued through the meal. About 3/4 through the meal, our waiter disappeared. We flagged down another who told us his shift was over and they would get our replacement (who was actually a nice girl). When the bill came, we were surprised to see the 18% gratuity added on. Usually it is for a party of 8 or more. We felt this explained the HORRIBLE and RUDE SERVICE and his attitude.

We had a wonderful experience and got to try a variety of different pastas and food selection, however, it was one of those meals where you walked out thinking that you would've rather gone to Eleven Madison (I know.. different cuisine!) or somewhere you know you are paying for food + experience.. vs. just food. Overall experience is 3 stars, but would give this place 4 stars for the quality of the food! We were seating in the upstairs dining area (which was lovely and i did love the decor).

I also think it's kind of hard to go wrong w/any type of fresh pasta!Spaghetti - very simple but tasty. I love the cheese and pepper combo. It's a simple dish to make at home though (if you cook!). Probably would not recommend getting this dish given that it is so simple and isn't something that makes your taste buds excited! I was really happy that they cooked the spaghetti al dente!Assortment of cured meats - Very good, but again... you can easily get at a local italian cured meats butcher/store in NYC. Seared Octopus - This was really good, not overcooked which was great. Would recommend getting this!Grilled Sausage - Okay. I remember trying this but don't recall my thoughts!

I suppose all sausages are rather salty, but I think this may have been on the saltier side...Branzino (5 stars) - Recommend getting this! The fish was cooked to perfection!

Anyway, I had the lasagnette, which really was nothing special.Shredded lasagna with Bolognese sauce.  White asparagus = one stalk of thick white asparagus with uni and watermelon radish for $19. It was probably my favorite dish, but I don't enjoy paying $19 for asparagus. My fiance had the famous slow roasted pork.

2.0,3/23/2013,"Went here for a date night.  It's definitely a scene.  There are no individual tables here so everyone is sitting on top of each other on uncomfortable chairs.  My wife had to walk all the way around the counter we were sitting at to get to her seats.  We got the octopus salad, the fried artichokes (recommended by many people) to start and then the bucatini (again recommended by many) and the lasagnette.  Everything was good but the portions were really small for the price.  The pastas were tiny appetizer portions but weren't really priced as such.  For example, the pastas at osteria morini are twice the size (and much better) but the exact same price as they are here.  The cacio e pepe wasn't all that cheesy but it was plenty peppery.  All the food we ate was good but I was still hungry after those dishes.  Gave two stars instead of three because will not be going back.  Just not worth it.",2,1,1,craig c.,"New York, NY",2,60,0
5.0,3/22/2013,"We waited a while (even with reservation) on a Friday night to sit, but once we were seated it was a divine experience. We were sat in the 1 table/bar area (2 seats) literally IN the kitchen, which was an exciting treat. Get a Salumi platter, all types were were all to die for. The bread and olive oil might spoil your dinner  they are so good!Bucatini Cacio e Pepe- omg this was insane! You wouldn't think such a simple pasta could be so delicious, but this is a recipe I am dying for. The amount of black pepper is perfect and the dish is so fresh tasting while being a heavier pasta. The short ribs are a must, even if you don't like horse radish don't order it without. The brussels sprouts salad was worth trying, but I was not a fan of the salted fish roe (bottarga). - Insalata di BottargaAnd the homemade gelatos were so rich, what a perfect ending to a great meal.

4.0,3/22/2013,"Late one spring Saturday evening, in temperatures and conditions that did their damnedest to defy the nomenclature, Angela and I arrived for our reservation, and were, to use the cliché, immediately transported elsewhere. Within moments of being welcomed, we had shaken off what was just before a bone chilling coldness, warmed by both the sights and sounds of jovial people and the enticingly heady aroma of herbs, meat, and cheese.Il Buco Alimentari & Vineria is, in a word, bustling. This is exacerbated by the location of the 'market' portion, just beyond the maitre d's podium and just before the bulk of the seating, meaning you must navigate the poor souls trying to buy salumi, cheeses, or heaven forbid, gelato, in entering and in leaving. Thankfully, it is a small section, so there is little movement involved in browsing, meaning all parties are less battered when the discordant dance concludes. In including both a 'market' and a 'wine bar', Il Buco Alimentari & Vineria seeks to replicate the act of travel to Italy as closely as possible, where it is a simple affair to bemusedly wander from one to the other, happening upon excellent experiences in each. And despite the improbability of the proposition of transplanting this, it largely succeeds. The only instance in which this vision fails to please is in the restaurant's seating. While it is admirable that the lumber came from the original Great Jones Street Lumber Supply, it is also obvious, given how uncomfortable they are. However, what take on a rustic neighborhood Italian restaurant would be complete without the vexatious chairs? Limning the feel of Italy, however, is one thing. Though no small feat, it would matter little if the food lacked the frill free flair wonderful rustic Italian food is known for. This fear was largely assuaged when we were brought the supplementary bread basket. Though some will scoff at the idea of paying for bread, you should bite your tongue, and pay the meager one dollar surcharge, and more if they ask it of you. The bread is a paradisaical spread of the fruits of fermentation. There is nuance and boldness in equal measure, and the olive oil and vinegar on offer will make you rue your decision not to abscond to Umbria. This transcends what is typically a perfunctory start to a meal, and reminds you of what bread baked with genuine care can be. We were almost disappointed to see our appetizers. Almost.We began with both the Ricotta and the Pulpo a la Plancha. The ricotta itself was exemplary. Stunningly sweet, creamy, milky and delicate, it was the beautiful counterpoint to burrata, that cheese of the moment. The pistachio was a clever stand-in for the nuttiness frequently sought after in cheese, and the blood orange another adept inclusion, the tart and sweet notes accentuating the other flavors. The only quibble came from the beets, which I felt in their shaving, lost some of their desired textural effect. I would have preferred whole baby beets, rather than slices of their larger kin, if only to provide a brighter, fresher crunch. The centerpiece of the Pulpo a la Plancha, the octopus, was a bit tough for either my or Angela's liking. A shame, as the black garlic and ink sauce was delectable, and the crudite surrounding the rim of the plate was well thought out and vibrant, as vivid as the sauce was atramentous.Wanting to shift in a heartier direction, we followed with the Roasted Gnocchi. The gnocchi lived up to its namesake, pillowy as could be, rising above the richness of its cream sauce and harmonizing with the earthy medley of mushrooms. It was finished quickly, our remaining scraps of bread sopped in its remnants.Embracing our inner carnivore, our entree was the Slow-Roasted Short Ribs, which few descriptions can prepare you for. It is gargantuan. Upon seeing it ominously bearing down on your table, you will feel shame, fear, ravenous hunger, and finally, elation, before it dawns on you that the duty to eat it has befallen you. Do not be terribly surprised when you finish it; it is magnificent. Succulent meat, a crust seemingly constructed entirely of peppercorns, finished with smears of anchovy paste, horseradish, strands of celery and shaved Asiago, combined with a fall-off-the-bone tenderness result in one of the greatest slabs of beef outside of the Biblebelt. The panna cotta we shared for dessert was taken out of the realm of ordinary with the inclusion of aged balsamico, all ten years of which were evident with each taste. It was certainly not for the faint of heart: the waiters exercise gentle pours for a reason. Waiters, it must be added, who are quick with an astute suggestion, but generally, are a bit hard to come by. But with a place this popular and food this high in demand, one can't fault them for that. The sommelier is a bit less sought after, though his suggestions are equally insightful. I had a fairly specific request, and he handled it adroitly. Truly, Italy in Manhattan.",2,1,2,Jordan S.,"Manhattan, NY",865,273,672
2.0,3/18/2013,"2.5 Stars: chiefly for food and wine, NOT service.The hubby and I went here for dinner this saturday. We were in a splurgey mood, in order to drown our sorrows about leaving the city permanently in a fortnight :( And therefore, we went all out, ordering 2 appetizers, 2 pastas, a meat entree, dessert, and a $100 bottle of wine. The service left much to be desired, unless our waitress just took a specific dislike to us. She didn't tell us any specials, although I don't know if there were any, but I overheard her explain all the desserts of the day (what the seasonal fruit, gelato flavors etc were) to the ladies sitting next to us, without any prompting on their part. But with us, she just asked what we wanted, and spent as little time with us as possible, even though we're always extremely pleasant customers. Also, the wine we ordered was excellent, but $100 a bottle meant each glass was worth at least $20, right? Well, right after they poured mine and I took a few sips, something (maybe an insect or debris from the ceiling) fell into my glass, and I brought it to their attention.The good: they took it away and brought me a clean glass. The bad: 1) the waiter first tried to suggest it was sediment from the wine, which I knew it not to be since I'd been sipping for a few minutes. Also, don't presume I'm an idiot who doesn't know wine sometimes has sediment. And that sediment doesn't look like a fuzzy grey blob bobbing on top of my wine. 2) they made absolutely no apology or attempts to replace the expensive glass of wine I'd just lost through no fault of my own. I understand it may have been too expensive to replace the wine, since they'd have to pop a fresh bottle, but at minimum they could have comped dessert, which was all of $10, as a goodwill gesture. I'd previously had an experience at the Nomad Hotel where I was afraid I got a hair in my chicken (turns out it was some kind of fibrous herb the chef uses), and just for the ""little scare"" as they called it, they comped two $14 glasses of wine for me and my friend. That's the kind of service I would've expected at prices like this.The food:Hamachi crudo- excellent, Salumi for 2- fantastic, some of the best prosciutto I've ever hadBucatini cacio e pepe- this was ok, a little too al dente for my taste, and kind of boringGnocchi- ohhh myyy goddd, soooo good! heavenly, buttery, melt-in-your-mouthy. It's so hard to find good gnocchi, and I was so thrilled about this one! Must-have!Spit-roasted short ribs- one of TONY's top 10 of the year. just meh for me.Zuppa inglese for dessert- pretty yummyAll in all, while the food and wine were pretty great, service at a restaurant usually trumps that, since eating out is for the experience. Il Buco failed at providing us the experience. We tipped less than 20% for the first time in years, and will probably never return or recommend this place to friends.Oh, and PS, they bring bread, oil and salt out before the meal (all good), and charge $1pp- not unusual in Europe I know, but kind of funny and unexpected in NYC!",3,1,1,Annette N.,"Somerville, MA",0,39,0

It's so hard to save room for this final dish (do your best, it's worth it). The peppered pasta is just perfect and al dente. The ricotta dish is always a pleaser, this time with shaved beats and blood oranges. Definitely try the fried artichoke hearts with a squeeze of lime. I was not as impressed by the octopus this time. The hamachi was really fresh with a icy cucumber muddled on top. I am not a fan of the polenta side but the kale side was delish.

4.0,3/11/2013,"This establishment had some ups and downs but the short rib made this dining experience a full 4 stars. If the appetizers were better it might have even been 5. We visited on Saturday night with a reservation and got seated upstairs at a communal table. Normally i'm not a big fan of communal tables but it wasn't so bad this time as it was mostly empty around us until the end of our meal which was still fine. For appetizers we started with the grilled octopus which i thought was very good but by far not the best I've ever had, it seemed to be lacking flavor. The next appetizer we all split was the ricotta with blood orange, beets and pistachios, this was my least favorite of all, just didn't really care for it although it came recommended by the server. We also shared the salumi for 2 which was INCREDIBLE, i would recommend this to anyone visiting. We also, in addition, ordered a chef choice cheese which was incredible. Very complex flavors but tasted so good, unfortunately I forgot the name but it is pictured in my photos.For my main course I couldn't pass up the short rib as it came recommended from my brother. It was hands down the best short rib I have ever tasted. The meat was so tender, it fell apart so easily. it was flavored oh so well and with the added lemon juice, i'm salivating and craving it right now thinking about it. If you come here, the short rib is a must!For dessert we each got an affogato which is a scoop or two of vanilla gelato with a shot of espresso poured on top, absolutely amazing. We also split the bicerin which is a must try if you are a chocolate fan.Overall it was a fantastic experience and if we had not ordered the ricotta and octopus and got a bigger salumi platter would have been a 5 star experience.

4.0,3/8/2013,"+ Ricotta appetizer, housemade ricotta topped with shaved porcini mushrooms, hazelnuts and mint.  The cracked black pepper and healthy drizzle of olive oil made the ricotta dish particularly addictive.+ Spit-roasted duck, plated with charred onions, dates and shaved tokyo turnip.  The duck was very lean, with a thin, soft skin, and the flesh was tender and moist throughout.  The flavors were subtle, letting the simple succulence of the duck shine.- Bucatini cacio e pepe, pasta simply dressed with shavings of pecorino Romano and black pepper.  The noodles were perfectly al dente.  Well executed dish but not particularly memorable.+ Short rib served off a giant Flintstone-shaped bone, ridiculously tender, with a gorgeously thick layer of black peppercorn.  Melty meat in mouth.

4.0,3/6/2013,"My review is a little biased, because I didn't get to see the bill and have no idea how much dinner cost. But I ate here on March 5th for the first time and really enjoyed the food. I was at a biggish event on the second floor with about 35 people. There were lots of appetizers to choose from, including sliced meats (I assume prosciutto, salami), nice salty olives, heavenly cheeses, and various crusty breads. And those were just the pre-dinner snacks. The appetizers were mostly delicious and were served family-style, including an octopus salad (a little too well done for my taste), roasted carrots, ricotta cheese, a salad of brussels sprout petals, and a phenomenally great mushroom risotto. The mains included a sea bass, which was very nice. But the real star of the evening was an amazing beef short rib, which was succulent, meaty, tender, and rich. Too bad I was super full by the time it arrived. There were loads of nice-looking desserts, but I could barely bring myself to taste any of them. The one I did try was the grapefruit sorbet, which was incredibly good: not too sweet, very refreshing, and highly reminiscent of eating a fresh chilled grapefruit.I drank tons of wine too, which made the evening even better.

I've been to restaurants where the vegan option turned out to be the best thing around that night. The nasty people in the kitchen at this flat and miserable shack presented me with a small plate of boiled spaghetti. No sauce. No garlic. No oil. Just a plate of pale, naked spaghetti. That was it.

I was tempted to talk to him but he was with a friend so I didn't want to bother him.Anyway, for my appetizer I got the fried rabbit. This was my first rabbit experience and it was a good one.

Absolutely delicious with a squeeze of lemon and a little drizzle of honey added a nice sweetness. After this came the main event, the piece de resistance, the PORCHETTA!

Huge, thick, fatty, juicy, perfect, sumptous, mounds of porchetta on a perfectly toasted but still soft filone bun with arugula, crispy pork skins, and some really incredible salsa verde.

However, for the NYE menu, the entire experience just left my husband and I feeling HUGELY DISAPPOINTED and totally ripped off. With the $300+ prix fix price tag for the 5-course dinner which drinks are excluded, our meal started off each with a citrus taste of fresh oyster with trout caviar, then all gone south afterward.  I got fed with less then mediocre dishes include 3 pieces of medium rare grilled duck breast with foie gras which deemed too tough for chewing (mind you both my husband and I are only in our 30s with perfect set of teeth). The olive oil poached black cod my husband ordered was way too salty which was left half untouched. All other remain dishes is equally mediocre and failed to deliver the favor and the authenticity which we first fell in love about this place. Overall experience on last night's meal summed up as ""nice presentation, failed on execution"". This was a lesson learn for us NEVER again spending NYE at our most beloved restaurant.

My companions decided to split a pizza, after one of them ordered a plate of pasta. She then cancelled it. When another waiter later brought the pasta to our table, we told him we'd told the other waiter we didn't want it. They took it away. Then a few minutes later our waiter came running up with the plate of pasta and, in an accusatory way, said ""you never told me you didn't want the pasta!"" We said we had.

With that out of the way, on to the food. We started with the ricotta app, very good fresh ricotta and a well composed dish. For entrees we had cacio y pepe and the sea bream with a side of broccoli rabe. The cacio pasta was perfectly cooked and the parm had that fruity/nutty character that good parm has. It wasn't as peppery as it is at the restaurant named for it on 2nd ave (and doesn't come to the table in a wheel of cheese). I actually liked that aspect of it, others may find it under-peppered. The whole fish was well prepared but oddly didn't come with anything. Its price tag a little high for a fish on a plate. The rabe was the expected level of bitter and served in a generous portion.

The rundown:Basil Lemonade - A mix of basil leaves, lemon juice, a bit of club soda, and maybe orange bitters? Smooth, tart and heavy on the basil. A good way to start the meal.Clams - (Manila?) clams in a super salty broth with a bit of peppers and scallions. Delicious and definitely a re-order.Salumi Plate for 4 - A nice selection of various salumi, although in my opinion, the portion for four should really be for two...Pricey, but I'd re-order.Shortrib - The shortrib was maybe the top dish of the night. It was ridiculously tender and had an incredibly salty/peppery crust. Definitely another re-order.Cacio & Pepe - The pasta was pretty much everything cacio & pepe should be: Perfectly al dente pasta with a cheesy/peppery sauce...almost perfect, just a bit too much pepper. Still a re-order.Porchetta - The fatty parts of the porchetta were delicious and seasoned well. However, the loin part was a bit dry and tasteless...a slight miss. The fried pork skin on top was a nice touch though.Affogato - Eh...The gelato was a bit icy and chunky. The espresso was ok. Still, a decent way to end the meal.Overall, a must-visit...If I could get a reservation during normal eating hours (7 or 8), I might be here at least once a week.

1.0,9/24/2012,"I think when someone has a sub-par experience at an establishment, it is fair to bring it to the attention of management before complaining about it online.  There was no management presence in the restaurant that I could spot, although since I was sitting at the bar, I didn't want to spend a lot of time twisted back trying to find a manager when my experience was not all that great to start with.  That's why I wrote an email to Il Buco after my experience.  From the moment one walks in to Alimentari, they encounter a ""we are cooler than thou"" attitude which places the customer second in many instances - I was hoping a simple reply to my email would erase from my mind the notion that this restaurant couldn't be bothered by their customers, unfortuantely I got no reply (after more than 2 weeks) and was only more convinced this to be the case.Below is the unanswered email I wrote to Il Buco outlining the details of my unsatisfactory experience at Alimentari.  Unfortunately, the food wasn't memorable enough to overcome my sentiments so I will not be visiting or recommending Alimentari.----------Il Buco has a special place in my life, as this is where I had my first date with my now wife, and it is also where I proposed to her (in the cellar).  We have since celebrated several special occasions at Il Buco as well. I was looking forward to trying Alimentari and recently did so.  In short, the experience was completely sub-standard from start to finish.1 - 830pm reservation for 2.  We were seated at 915pm, at the bar counter.  We were not the only ones experiencing a similar situation.2 - While waiting we were being told the delay was caused by the people at our table taking longer than expected.  It appears everyone was told the same thing.  One of the 2 hostesses was apologetic, the other one clearly exhibiting a ""there's nothing I can do so don't bug me"" attitude.3 - While we were waiting for our table, 2 ladies who were friends of one of the kitchen staff came in. They hugged, kissed, chatted for 2 minutes and were then promptly seated, in front of all waiting guests.4 - Upon finally being seated at the bar counter, we ordered a salad and selection of 2 cold cuts and 3 cheeses as appetizer, and 2 pastas as our main dishes (one for each person).  Salad came out 15 minutes after order was taken.  Pastas came out 15 minutes after salad plate was cleared.  Cold cuts plate arrived by itself 5 minutes after pastas had arrived. Cheese plate arrived 30 minutes after all other plates were cleared, about 90 minutes into our meal.5 - At this point the bartender was lightheartedly joking about a lot of the staff being from Iowa and this being the reason why things were taking unusually long.  So I responded that in that case he should put in the order for my macchiato now, so by the time it came in another 20 minutes, I could have it and we'd be on our way.  The macchiato never arrived.6 - Also during service, after finishing my first glass of wine I asked the bartender for a 2nd glass of the same.  Despite me sitting right in front of him, he forgot the wine and when I reminded him about 10 minutes later he promptly poured 2 glasses for us, although I was the only one who ordered it.7 - Everything having taken so long and been so inconsistent, I asked for and paid for the check without paying much attention to it.  Later when I thought about how little the amount was compared to the no-bargain menu prices, I realized that none of our 5 drinks (1 martini and 4 glasses of wine) were on the bill.  There was no mention of extending this as a courtesy to us for our troubles, so I am assuming it was an oversight. [I was simply bringing this to Il Buco management's attention in my email]8 - Your old-style cocktail glasses are a nice touch, but I perceived them as being very small, I'd guess 6 - 6.5oz to the rim.  Since I dont know how much a martini costs I cant comment on the relative value of my martini poured, however, if you are charging in the $14 - $15 range as most similar establishments would do for a standard 8.5oz martini, I think you may be insulting some guests without realizing it.I wanted to share the above with you, not as a complaint, but as feedback from someone who cares about the Il Buco brand.  I hope you will find it useful.----------",4,2,2,Burak K.,"Manhattan, NY",16,8,2

Dark meat too, not a boring breast. 5 - Ribs. I was stuffed at this point, but they were still great as everyone mentioned. Feeds 2 as a meal imo. 5 - Bison tartar. I generally don't like meat tartares, but this was really good. 5 - Sausage.  The sauce on the side is part of what made this so delicious. 5 - Olive oil with the bread was insanely good, fruity undertones. Yes, undertones. 4 - Lasagna - rabbit was really tasty and tender like it had been stewed for hours.  This is the only pasta I could've eaten as a whole meal if we weren't eating family style.  White pastas get boring to me.4 - Gnudi/ Ricotta pasta.  Simple. Good. Would get boring as an entire meal tho.  4 - Ricotta appetizer. This was really really simple, but really good. The appetizers in general were better to me than the pastas.3 - Bucatini.  I'm just not into white sauce pastas. Not enough sauce or flavor imo. 3 - Uovo - it's a deviled egg. Nuff said. 3 - Cod appetizer. Like a good fish and chips w/o the chips. Nothing too wow here but solid. 2 - Spaghetti.  3 of us ordered it, it was pretty salty, and all 3 sent it back. I liked trying it but probably couldn't eat a whole bowl of it.  They were nice about letting us send it back with no fuss.1 - Chairs. Yes, I am now reviewing chairs. Their chairs suck. Uncomfortable. Management, please get rid of your uncomfortable metal chairs. Thank u. If you want romance, go to the other location. This one is a bit brighter, better for groups imo.",3,2,1,Kevin W.,"Manhattan, NY",45,548,18
4.0,8/26/2012,"I think I had the most amazing sandwich of my life here despite the service being somewhat terrible. I came here with a good friend on my lunch break since I work around the corner. We got the octopus appetizer which was delicious. I think it is very easy to overcook octopus and this was cooked just right. Tender and juicy. I ordered the Pan Bagnat panini which is essentially tuna belly, olive tapenade, greens and a perfectly cooked hard boiled egg. When the sandwich arrived on a large looking baguette I thought to myself, ""I will never be able to bite through this"". However I was pleasantly surprised to find that the bread was the perfect combination of crusty and soft. I could bite through the whole sandwich and it was heaven. Not sure if I will come for dinner but I know at some point I will be back for the panini sandwich. Even if it means coming by myself :)",0,0,0,JuJuBean H.,"Somerville, MA",0,10,0
2.0,8/19/2012,"We were so excited to get a reservations, and were equally disappointed when we left.  The food was either fabulous (salumi, gnudi) or ordinary (ricotta, chicken with lemony avocado).  Our server was sweet but clueless, pouring out our bottle of wine before our main course was served.  (Maybe that was because our main course was served 3 hours after we arrived.)  Then, after 4 hours having 1 appetizer, 1 salad, 3 entrees, 1 dessert, and 2 bottles of wine, we were comp'd 4 fish sticks (crocchettes).  So after paying $111 (without tip) per person, and speaking to our server, the manager, and a top-notch Italian consultant, there was only 1 false apology and 1 accusation that being 10 minutes late creates many delays.  What a shame ... we had so much hope ....",0,0,0,Aruna I.,"WALL STREET, NY",0,5,0
1.0,8/18/2012,"This ranks as the WORST dining experience I've had in NYC in the 13 years that I have lived here. The meal took 4 hours and this was not due to a leisurely pace. We waited for 1.5 hours for a ricotta salad to show up. In the meanwhile the table next to us who sat down after us finished their entire meal while we were still waiting. To apologize we were given salted cod sticks which were so salty they could not be eaten. As our entrees were finally served the table next to us with its new occupants were finishing up. My cacio pepe was clumpy and the broccoli rabe so salty it was inedible. I've never had such terrible Italian food. When we asked to speak to a manager, she came up and told us we arrived late and this was the cause of the delays. Are you kidding me? Not to mention this was an outright lie. This place really needs an attitude adjustment given the numerous excellent Italian restaurants in the city. They need to take customer service seriously and the chef needs to start overseeing the quality of food coming out of the kitchen given the prices. They did not offer to comp one thing (except those cod sticks). I will never go back and will tell everyone I know not to go.",3,2,1,Nisha I.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0

3.0,7/22/2012,"3.5 stars. This review is just for the retail bread.  For those of you who knows me well, you could take away the rice, the noodles, the pasta, but if you deprive me of well-crafted bread, then life is not worth living anymore. Alright, that is an exaggeration, but it is like how others' feelings towards iPhone, cigarettes, and ah-hem, sex.  I mean, food is almost the equivalent of a corporal embrace, hence the 21st century terminology 'food porn'.  I would even travel to another borough just to buy 'good' bread, if time permitted, otherwise, I do have some staples around the city.  Recently, I realized Whole Foods' bread just does not cut it for me anymore.  They are starting to taste too commercial and darn I say, artificial to me.  I had heard great reviews on Kamel Saci's fresh, baked bread, so I decided to travel downtown to taste the water.  I actually had my mind on a spelt or lentil loaf; but sadly, the bread menu list is not updated. (Note to management: Please correct the list and not disappoint potential customers) So, no more lentil or spelt.  The staff recommended the cereal bread ($6) and I was very happy that half a loaf ($3) is possible as well.  Armed with my halved slice, I got home and started to dig in.  Like most French bread, the crust is crisp and chewy.  In fact, a bit too hard for me to chew and my jaw got kind of tired after awhile.  The 'flesh' was dispersed with whole grain cereal.  It was soft, pillowy and as a 'crust gal', I was surprised that I could prefer to eat the center instead.  Overall, the bread was good, not revolutionary, as there is a French bakery in my hood that also sell whole grain bread.  While bread is a commodity, Il Buco's do not come cheap, but everything is baked in house, using organic ingredients, and yes, a little goes a long way.  After letting myself eat true, artisan bread, I just could not go back to the Wonderbread-ish stuff anymore.  So yes, this is a bread review, but let me know that there are other edibles and coffee available for a quick pick me up and a sitdown restaurant in the back.  It is like a little European escape from the hurried Broadway or the hipster NYU blocks a few doors down.  It is a welcoming place, but I will probably stick to the farmer's market bread, at least to support the local bakers.",0,0,1,GarGuPi L.,"Flushing, NY",87,496,1696

3.0,6/26/2012,"3 stars... but the food is easily a 4... the service and annoying bread service knocks it down to a 3.First thing you notice when you walk in is the smell. Combination of the salumi and kitchen really heightens the anticipation of the meal and for the most part they deliver. Started off with a sampler salumi platter. It was fine. Nothing that blew my mind. Also had the spaghetti with bottarga. You get a creamy taste of the sea. Awesome and unexpected. Highlight of the meal was the spit-roasted short ribs for two. First off this is a massive plate of food. The outside of the meat reminds me of really good burnt ends. The crunchy bark was amazing. As was biting into whole peppercorns. And for $38, good deal. Easily feeds 2, probably more like 3.So while the food was great, I'd have to say the service was annoying. The waiter was constantly upselling everything. Really got annoying at the end right after everyone ordered their own dessert, he started trying to sell us on the after dinner cordials, most of which are $15-20. He was telling us how rare these drinks are in the city. We declined. He keeps going... ""Maybe you can share. Get 1 and 2 people can try. How about the mascato d'asti?"" Look. I'm not paying $12 for a glass of sparkling wine. Another thing was they charge $1 for bread. I really thought the bread here was going to be amazing. It sucked. No really. It did. If the breadstick maker at the olive garden tried his hand at making bread for the first time, the outcome would have been better than this. Put me on the L train and send me to Roberta's for their bread any day. Maybe that's ruined all breads for me going forward.

3.0,5/30/2012,"This was a decent place (nice decor with ok food), but in my opinion, it was overhyped and overpriced. In addition, the service was slow and inattentive, which made the whole dining experience worse.My husband and I went there for lunch on a Saturday. It was not full at 1 pm on a Saturday, but we had a reservation. It was easy to tell that half of the patrons were out-of-towners.Now when I think back, the best part of the meal was probably the complimentary bread basket. The Ciabatta was so aromatic, soft, and crusty that I couldn't help buying one in the bakery on my way out. However, the one sold in the bakery at the store front was not as fresh as the one we got in the restaurant. What a shame!We shared a spinach salad. The salad was so unbearably salty that I almost wanted to send it back. My husband ended up scrapping the salt and breadcrumbs off each leaf with his fork and finished this dish. Each leaf of the spinach was huge and beautiful though.The worst part of our experience was the disconnection between the waiter and the kitchen. We waited for at least 20 minutes for our main course to arrive. We tried to get the attention of our waiter, but he just casually told us ""it is coming"" before even bothering to check first. Our guess was that the kitchen didn't get the order until we asked the waiter.My husband ordered the Lasagnette, which was a small pasta dish with rabbit. The pasta was al dente and delicious, but to be honest, it was not spectacular enough for the price of $20. I ordered the Porchetta. The roast pork was succulent and fatty, but they stacked it up so high in between two burger-like Italian bread (maybe it was Filone) that it was so difficult for me to eat. So I ended up deconstructing the whole Porchetta. The nice touch was that they added a couple of small chunks of fried skin inside the meat, and it added some crunchiness to the texture. Overall this was a delicious dish, but their ""hamburger"" twist was not good for my jaw.As for the dessert, we shared an olive oil cake, which was average. The olive oil cake at Maialino or even cafe Abraco was so much better!We were seated at a table next to an entrance leading to their basement. Toward the end of the meal, we started to smell some odor coming from that basement. We told our waiter, and he dismissed us first. Then my husband insisted and asked him to close the door, so he finally did so, reluctantly.Maialino is also about the same price range, but their service is so much better and more pleasant!",0,0,0,Tina Y.,"New York, NY",0,196,0

I've had the cheapest wine on the menu, and it's totally fine/eminently reasonable, so unless you're trying to impress someone I'd just order that.  It's something like 7 dollars a glass.I'd give this place 4.5 stars if i could -- the service has always been excellent, the atmosphere is great, the food is delicious -- it's really just the pasta that leaves me unimpressed.",1,0,0,Kevin D.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,31,0
1.0,5/23/2012,"The first time I came here was back before they started getting reviewed and became the ""it"" new place to try.  The service was great, the food impeccable, and you felt welcomed.  Our server encouraged us to try anything and everything and gave great recommendations.  Here, I thought, one can be a real foodie and have a rewarding experience.  Then they became popular.  I noticed a steady decline in the quality of brunch and lunch.  Every time I ordered the same sandwich for lunch, it would always have different bread or substitutions that made the taste suffer.  A week ago, we had a dinner experienced that sealed the deal for a one-star rating.  There were 4 of us.  Each of us a foodie, and have enjoyed epic meals together in some of the top restaurants around the world.  The restaurant was only two-thirds full.  We ordered a bottle of wine and decided we'd like to, in true foodie manner, order about 8 appetizers, a main course, and some sides, all to share family-style (which was encouraged on our first visit), and if we were still hungry for more, we'd order more.  As we gave our order to the waiter who was visibly perplexed at the unconventional nature of our meal path (but typical for people who like food experiences), he rolled his eyes and firmly said ""NO you order an appetizer, a main course, and you order everything at the same time"".  We politely explained that this is what we'd like to do, and trying another approach he may understand more clearly, if we want to spend more money after on more food, we'd like to do so.  Rolls his eyes again and said ""So you only order one main course for 4 of you?!"".  We thought he may have a hearing problem, so we rambled off the 8 appetizers, one main, and sides again and asked what he wasn't understanding.  He leaves the table.  The manager comes and basically berates us for ordering this way and says ""NO you are NOT ordering more food after, it takes too long, the kitchen doesn't have time for this, and I need this table back at 9h30!""  It was 6pm at that point and I can assure you, this meal would not be taking 3 and a half hours.  We kept polite and explained again that we'd like to order a whole bunch of dishes, enjoy it all family style, they can bring out each dish whenever it's ready in whatever order and yes we can order it all at the same time.  The manager storms away.  We were shocked.  The food arrives, one dish after the other and we were very pleased with our decisions and all of it was excellent.  It's now 7h45pm and we're given the desert menu and ordered 3 dishes.  Now, we know they're pressed for time since they have to speed through our table in 3 and a half quick hours to get us out of there for the next table, and surprisingly, how long does the dessert take to arrive?  Over 25 minutes.  Pre-made.  My overall review is that while the kitchen staff works hard and produces great dishes, it's the chefs that get the short end of the stick, because their work is so ill represented by a lousy staff.  The wait staff couldn't have put us off more.  To think we had given them SO much business since they opened and recommended them to all our foodie friends, we're thanked for our loyalty by a dismissive staff that ultimately wanted us to play by THEIR rules so we were out of there in time for the next table.  When it wasn't even at capacity.  They've gone downhill fast and if they think their style of restaurant management benefits their loyal patrons, we might as well put a vacancy sign in the window.",3,1,1,Jonathan P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,0

3.0,4/10/2012,"I'd say 3.5 stars.  And YELP stars, not New York Times stars!  I just don't get that review at all.  The bottom line, this place is very good but not great.    First off, the communal seating is bananas.  It's NYC, I've been in plenty of crowded spaces, but this was too much.  You are totally on top of the person next to you.  Not comfortable, and for 3 NYT stars, you shouldn't be uncomfortable.The service was decent, although the bus staff consistently tried to take both wine and food plates away before they were done.  Something of a pet peeve, but exacerbated by the fact that it's so loud in there that when you ask them to leave the plate, often they cant hear you.As for the food, it's very good.  Although there are some disappointments.  The bread is fine, really not better than that.  The cured-meat plate is fantastic, as is the porchetta  The pasta's were good, but not memorable.  And the octopus just had too much going on.   Far too many ingredients, overwhelming the octopus, which was a bit overcooked/rubbery for my taste.In my opinion, Osteria Morini is a much stronger option if you are ok with crowded/noisy.  And the food at Maialino and Torrisi are far superior.",0,0,2,Ron W.,"Larchmont, NY",83,105,9
3.0,4/8/2012,3 recent stars in the Times finally drew us in after having passed by here several times earlier this year.  Waiter service -- at the front high-tops for walk in brunch -- was initially a bit hard to snag (the hostesses were clearly not into helping connect table to waiter).  Our waiter and busboy were pleasant and helpful once we got on track. Many things on the menu look tantalizing.  Appetizers and sandwiches average $12-$13 or so.  We settled on the sausage/fennel with lentil salad and the kale/anchovy/bufala panini.  The panini was crap- bland and soggy.  The sausage was delicious.  The atmosphere is farmhouse chic and the space was sunny on a beautiful Spring day.  This was good enough to try but I cannot guarantee it hooked me enough to want to come back.,2,0,0,Jason N.,"New York, NY",307,671,1117
3.0,4/2/2012,"This place is frustrating.  On one hand, it's lively and fun, and the food is delicious.  On the other hand, it's way too packed, you're crowded and bumped even while eating, and the wait for food is interminable.  We ate late, around 9pm, and ordered some assorted meats, which were amazing, appetizers of fried artichokes, asparagus with poached egg and clams.  All three were stupendous, especially the asparagus.  And then we had the cacio e pepe, also cooked perfectly.    Of course the main problem was that it took about an hour and a half to get any food, which meant that we went through two bottles of wine.  Luckily it was reasonably priced.  The waiter was apologetic, and clearly was trying his best, but something is wrong with the kitchen when cured meats take an hour, or small appetizer dishes are an hour and a half to make.   So I don't know - I'd still recommend it, but know what you're getting into, and know that you'll wait a very long time for a meal, and will likely be crowded and have to shout to hear your dinner companion.  I assume they'll eventually get their system down, and it won't be quite the slog to get to the (great) food.",0,1,0,Seth E.,"Washington, DC",0,15,0

Then I realized I was still in NYC. But the ingredients still come from Italy, which is the key thing: it means that all the charcuterie and cheeses are delicious (great pecorino selection), and the other dishes  are simple but flavorful, seasoned exactly to the right point (cicoria salad, zuppa di verdure). Not to mention the brick & wood decor with wide open counters overlooking kitchen and wine shelves.

Don't eat upstairs unless you want to yell across the table all night. Lots of communal seating which is sometimes fun unless you're seated next to old people that have to yell at each other from across the super wide tables. We requested a quieter seat which resulted in a bar setting with backless stools. Not comfortable. If half your seating is going to be bar seating, at least have chairs with backs. Come on.ServiceMediocre. Took them 25 minutes to take our food order. One app came out promptly, the second app came out 30 minutes later only moments before our entrees arrived. Had to pour our own wine all night. Waiter cracked a joke at our expense to the other waiter assuming we didn't understand Spanish. Idiota.FoodMixed bag here. Cured meats were fantastic, as expected. Second app was a pan fried salted Cod. Bland, soggy, tasted like fish sticks. Bronzino was perfect.

3.0,3/5/2012,"4 star food, 2 star service. Surprised that it's a 3-star NYT restaurant, it should really be a 2 at the most.Bread Basket: Not as good as NYT made it out to be. There were only 2 different kinds of bread, served with olive oil and sea salt. One of the breads had pecans and golden raisins in it, and the other was plain. The bread also came out cold.Ricotta Gnudi with Brown Butter and Sage: Wonderfully light, fluffy, and delicate ricotta balls, texture was perfect. The dish was served with fried sage, brown butter, a touch of aged balsamic (there should have been more to add more acidity), and topped with shaved parmesan and freshly ground black pepper. This dish was great, but it didn't blow me away. Service was disjointed and brusque. One of the waiters had his extended to fill our waters, then got distracted by something else, and decided not to fill up our pitcher. Our water pitcher was more often empty than full. A diner at our table fell off his chair because the chair broke. There was a loud crash and he fell on the floor. The servers quickly replaced the broken chair with a new one, and they went off on their merry way. The restaurant didn't even offer him anything, like a free dessert or something, which is something I'd expect a 3-star restaurant to do, especially because it was THEIR chair that was faulty.Decor is nice. Expect a long wait, especially if you're a group larger than 2.This is one of those restaurants where I wouldn't oppose if someone else wanted to take me here, but I wouldn't spend my own money here again.",2,1,1,Rebecca Y.,"Washington, DC",52,438,361
5.0,3/3/2012,"If I could give Il Buco more stars I would. It is arguably the best dining experience I have ever had. (I even looked at my top rated Yelp reviews just to make sure there wasn't one that was better.) What was amazing about my meal here was that every single dish was stellar. No disappointments, just pure mouth magic every time.The restaurant has family-style communal tables. It's not great if you want an intimate and romantic dining experience but it's fantastic if you want to meet new people. The menu has really interesting things on it, and we were hard pressed to limit ourselves to a few options. Quail and rabbit figured on the menu too.For appetizers, I had the foie gras with marmalade on toast. It was a textural and flavor explosion: creamy, rich and savory foie gras with tangy marmalade on top of crisp and light toast. It was excellent. I also had the charcuterie plate, which had 8 different kinds of cured meat. Also excellent.For our entrees, I tried my companion's short ribs. It is incredible. I felt like I had a party going on in my mouth. Impeccably spiced, nuanced with flavors, texturally interesting with a slight charred and crisp outside with fork-tender flesh, and the occasional chunk of melt-in-your-mouth fat - it was absolutely amazing. I know I'm praising it to the skies here but it was just the best. My porchetta was good as well, but unfortunately it paled in comparison to the awesomeness that is the short ribs. Also, there were enough short ribs to feed about 3 or 4 people, I think, so while it might be the priciest entree on the menu, the deliciousness and the sheer volume of it makes it quite worthwhile.We couldn't finish our food, and had to take the leftovers to go. Service was wonderful; we were given a hunk of bread so that we could make meat sandwiches for lunch.

2.0,2/29/2012,"In a word: incongruent.An Italian Vineria is casual and welcoming.  Here's why our experience wasn't. Made a reso for two here for 6p for a birthday dinner.  We were walked through a largely empty restaurant to be seated at the back of the restaurant at a counter facing the kitchen. Under, basically, spotlights.  IMHO this table should be offered as a special table (""would you like to watch the kitchen prepare food"") or as a last resort (""I'm sorry, we're full, but we have one place we can seat you..."")  Guests should not be seated here without a word as to why they're not sitting at another table.Alright.  I asked to be sat somewhere ""more chill"" (I was still surprised that they'd seat us here without mentioning anything).  We were taken to a hightop, despite there being a bunch of empty tables, both private and shared.  We were looking for a more intimate experience, so asked to be seated at a private table.  Told they were booked (strange - I though we had a reservation too...) we were told we could be seated ""upstairs"".  Not knowing what upstairs contained, we opted to try it out and trekked upstairs. We get seated at a communal table, and aren't particularly excited about Il Buco thus far - I wouldn't say we're high maintenance, but I would say that being made to feel comfortable as a customer is important to having a good experience.  So far, not so good. We check out the menu and are baffled by the prices (i.e. $38 for short ribs).  It was totally incongruent with the communal tables and familiar servers.  A Vineria is casual - these prices are fine dining prices.There's also a stressful vibe about the place - perhaps they're suffering from the recent NYTimes review.  The servers didn't feel comfortable, and hadn't been trained to serve artfully.  Not a problem at a casual dining resto, but when I'm paying $30+ for an entree, I don't want the server to reach between me and my dining companion to fill a water glass when he can go around. That's just one example. Another is the servers arguing with each other in Spanish when they were clearing our places.  Just tense and awkward.We decided to leave after a drink (delicious),  bread and olive olio (delicious), and salumi plate (delicious) and do the birthday dinner at a place with a great all-around experience (Danny Meyer, I'm looking at you.)  Il Buco was looking to be a $200+ dinner and we just weren't up for a sub-par and incongruent experience even if the food was delicious.",6,5,3,K A.,"Vancouver, Canada",1,20,0

I needed a snack for my flight home later in the evening and thought that a simple Italian meats sandwich would be perfect. I. Was. Right. I think I was right bc the sandwich was decadent, simple and delicious. Salami, shaved parmesan on the most perfect ciabatta and lightly drizzled with olive oil. I ended up eating the sandwich nearly 8 hours later and it was still heavenly. As I waited for my sandwich I took a seat at the espresso bar and enjoyed a rich Crack Cookie. I was expecting light and fluffy but my first bite was rich chocolaty goodness. I needed coffee immediately to wash it down so I opted for an iced Americano. I tried a sip as is and left it that way as it was that good. ALL the gentlemen working were quite the lookers. Another reason why I would frequent this joint regularly if I lived in NYC.

5.0,11/29/2011,"New Yorkers' slavish devotion to 'mangi Italiano' is interminable, but perhaps it's because of places like Il Buco and now Il Buco Almentari & Vineria. Reinventing and perfecting Italian food is a passion for many and IBA&V is one of those places you will eat at again and again until it becomes a second home.  The restaurant is large; sectioned into a gelateria, coffee bar and salumeria up front, step down in back to a lively dining room with a long  bar and communal table seating that encourages camaraderie among patrons, which is nice when you eat alone, as well as individual tables. The kitchen is an open hive of activity. What isn't visible is a prep area the size of Staten Island beneath your feet, where dozens of other cooks toil away baking, curing, roasting, etc all hours of night and day.If your eye wanders skyward toward the Warren Muller custom light fixture, you may notice there is a party room upstairs, with a large adjoining terrace.The food is wonderful; start with fresh bread with IB artisanal olive oil, panzanella, grilled octopus, crisp lemony artichokes, and amazing oxtail terrine. Then onto a selection of fromaggi and salumi, assorted pastas, rotisserie chicken broiled in a rotisserie that looks like an antique Bugatti , and of course Porchetta alla Romana.  Save room to sample the wildly flavorful house-made gelatos, like caramel or other dessert treats. If you can't trust your own instincts regarding wine, then trust your server, I've never been steered wrong and have in fact learned  more about Italian wine eating at Il Buco than anywhere else.  In New York restaurant competition is so intense it takes more than guts and money and even talent  to make a great restaurant, and it seems like Il Buco Alimenteri & Vineria  has that ineffable magical ingredient to become a Noho fixture.

5.0,11/3/2011,"I don't often leave restaurant reviews, but I was angered when I looked at the two one star reviews.  This spot is a GEM.  It's a spot for locals, a spot for lovers of italian bistro fare, a spot for those looking for a super friendly, electrified atmosphere to enjoy a fine glass of vino.  It is not a place for the bridge-and-tunnel contingent or those on a tight budget.  Last night I had an incredible meal which consisted of crispy artichokes w/preserved lemon, rustic beans, broccoli rabe, and gulp, one of the best servings of short ribs I have ever had in my life.  From crispy, to juicy and tender, topped with olives, onions, tomatoes, arugula, and other goodies, this slow roasted dish almost had me in tears.  It's noisier and less intimate than Il Buco, but the food is head and shoulders above.  This place is not for everyone, just those with good taste.",3,0,0,DM A.,"New York, NY",37,96,3
4.0,10/29/2011,"I'm a HUGE fan of Il Buco, and now I'm a HUGE fan of Alimentari!  They picked a nice segment of the market and are doing it REALLY well.  Gussie up front to get some fine sundrie style italian products and also cheese and salumie oh and dont forget the gelati.  If you wander back toward the kitchen the full menu is at your fingertips and so will your lips after ordering some of their excellent family style offerings.",4,0,2,Tim W.,"Manhattan, NY",118,528,359
5.0,10/23/2011,"We loved this authentic Italian food experience. The appetizers were excellent. We loved the artichokes and the octopus? The main courses were exceptional. We had the short ribs and roasted chicken....beautiful. Perfect for 4', add the salad.  Adored our server Alana, who was gracious and imformative.",6,0,2,Rebecca L.,"Martinsville, NJ",0,7,2
