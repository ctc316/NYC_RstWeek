4.0,4/27/2019,"This place has been a favorite of mine for years. Strong drinks, great guacamole and fundido and a variety of tacos to choose from. This place is always busy, so be sure to make a reservation, there is a front section with the bar and then more seating down the hallway in the back.  The restaurant is always loud, so if you are in a large group, you'll have a hard time chatting with everyone.The taco selection here is vast, and they have a daily taco that switches out.  Same with the margaritas, there at least 6-8 to choose from.  The chips and guacamole are tasty and used to be served with a smokey cashew sauce, which they have now made a salsa, which is more like a dip.  I always enjoy the food here, and the brunch is good too!",0,0,0,Stephanie L.,"New York, NY",15,77,206
5.0,4/19/2019,"This restaurant is AMAZING. The customer service is extraordinary; the staff is kind and helpful, and your food is out very quickly. We had the Halibut Ceviche, chicken tacos, guacamole, and lamb barbacoa tacos. The ceviche was so flavorful. The chicken tacos were simple but like an explosion, a perfect combo. The guacamole was a perfect concoction of different flavors, as well as the lamb tacos. The ambiance is uniquely aesthetic. The lights are slightly dimmed, and there's a plain white brick wall with a beautiful mural on the other side. You can come slightly dressy, such as for a date, etc. or causal. The area is very nice too, so you can walk around after. If I could, I would rate this a 7/10!",0,0,0,Nadya D.,"Lititz, PA",0,3,1

3.0,3/23/2019,"This place was once an oasis for melted cheese and tacos and it lived on everyone's special list of special restaurants to try in New York. Last time I visited the food was perfection, in every way, unfortunately i came to discover today that there has been a significant drop in quality of food - NONE of the $300 order we ordered was actually impressive or even delicious. While drinks are still very tasty and waiters are adorable, if this place doesnt fix its kitchen operations, im sure thisnplace wont survive another season.

1.0,3/1/2019,Probably one of the biggest rip offs of my life. The tacos are basically all $18 or up for 2 tacos. They are so small and filled with just meat nothing else. Comes with no sides. Not worth it at all. Then we told them it was our girlfriends birthday and they brought out a dessert without asking us for permission and CHARGED US for the dessert that we DID NOT ask for. Complete waste of money do not go here unless you want to spend a lot of money for no reason. Wish I could get a refund.,0,1,0,Alexa M.,"Manhattan, NY",231,2,0
5.0,2/25/2019,"We really enjoy dining at Empellón (Midtown) and decided to check out this location. We absolutely loved our meal here!Regardless of which location you visit, definitely try the All Seven Salsas, especially if you like trying out an array of spicy salsas. We also ordered the Pork Tongue Tacos and Carnitas plate. Both were sooo good! The Carnitas plate was probably the highlight of our meal, as the meats were so tender and juicy. It's a larger plate meant for sharing. Great tortillas to accompany the fillings too! We were sad that this location didn't have the Avocado dessert found at the other location, but we definitely walked out feeling stuffed anyway (bonus: our total bill didn't even cost us much at all for the entire meal!)",1,0,0,Jung Y.,"New York, NY",392,35,178
4.0,2/22/2019,"Came here last night with some coworkers. Hostess was a little rude about us wanting to switch tables (she had a 'very specific floor plan!') but ultimately accommodated after 10 minutes. We started with a round of margaritas and I got the cucumber one - was expecting more spice than just the rim but it was still really good. We ordered a bunch of plates and I tried the following :- scallop ceviche - delicious!! Super fresh and there were two different types of mixes-chorizo queso fundido - OMG this was so delicious! Meat was well seasoned and the cheese was great-plátano sopas - tasty but definitely dry. Wish they had some sort of sauce to put on top-fish tacos - plain but very goodOverall a much better meal than expected. Service was great and attentive, and our waiter was joking with our table the whole night. Pretty solid spot in the neighborhood.",4,0,1,Kristie P.,"New York, NY",201,137,407

1.0,2/14/2019,"I had a work event at the midtown Empellon and was super impressed. Food, service--all amazing. So I was more than excited to learn one of my girlfriends booked a table for some friends on Valentine's Day. We showed up for our reservation for 5 guests at 8:45 at 8:30, with four of us. After a back an fourth with the host for not confirming the reservation via voicemail, he said he could see what he could do for us depending on 'his book' with incredible attitude. No time frame. Ok. Valentine's is a crazy dining night, I am understanding of that but in an attempt to find an alternative, we found an available table there for 4 at 8:45 on Open Table. I understand the game, they would give us the table at 8:45 and act like it was a favor, which is exactly what happened. Whatever, we were super excited for guac and margaritas. So we were seated and proceeded to have a fabulous meal. Great service, delicious food. Our 5th friend who we originally RSVP'd for, arrived after all our plates were cleared, ready for the check and our waitress grabbed her a seat to sit comfortably at our table. No less than 3 minutes later the host came over fuming saying there was absolutely no way we could have a fifth seat at this table (it was 9:45 and thinning out at this point). Our waitress offered to move us the larger booth but the host stepped in and asserted himself as the 'head maître d' shared he WAS willing the to move us to a different larger table BUT now it wouldn't be an option because he demanded we leave IMMEDIATELY. Went fromcouldn't have 5 at the table to You have to leave ASAP. Things just totally spiraled in the MOST bizarre way.  (Wow that escalated quickly ) He actually had hands on the 5th seat my friend was sitting in ready to remove it. I WILL say our waitress was so gracious and was clearly in an uncomfortable position. I have lived and dined in New York for 11 years and truly have never had that sort of response from someone in a customer service representative. Still baffled. Paid 115 for that meal.  Yikes.

5.0,2/9/2019,"Despite our being late for a 7:30 reservation by 20 minutes, the host was kind enough to use his ""magic"" to find a nice table for us (they were really busy). The restaurant is a lot larger than you expect as it has a back room which is about the same size as the front. We got the Brussels sprouts, fish, and steak tacos. The Brussels sprouts were by far our favorites (highly recommend that you try it).",0,0,0,David H.,"Huntsville, AL",0,9,0
5.0,1/21/2019,I came across this gem via a dear friend I have known for over 30 years. We shared a few taco varieties.  all were delish. The highlight was a new desert on their menu which was a frozen disk with soft caramel inside. oooooohhhhh ahhhhhh,0,0,0,Douglas B.,"New York, NY",1,52,0
3.0,1/5/2019,I'm going to give this place a 3 only because the food was good and drinks but definitely not good enough for the price and being pushed out of our table. For the amount of money I was charged I should be able to enjoy my meal in peace without being asked if I was ready for the check 3 times. I found it to be so rude and it ruined my experience.

2.0,1/3/2019,"I don't understand what happened! I was here 2 years ago when my friend asked a bunch of us to be her bridesmaids - and we remembered the food being good... Fast forward to last weekend, she and I went again with our SOs for dinner and we were severely disappointed. We started with the guac and chips, celery root with salsa and baby red potatoes since those were apparently the only things that didn't have dairy. All of these were pretty good though it seemed like the other dishes could have come with the dairy on the side. The waitress didn't seem to want to be helpful in finding loop holes for food restrictions and originally just told us that all the starters had dairy until we pressed her further.Then we for the Pastrami Tacos, Red Chili Duck Tacos, Lamb Barbacoa Tacos and the Sunday special of Roast Pork Tacos. We were shocked with how mediocre to bad each of these tacos were, honestly. The Pastrami I can understand is pretty out there and could be chalked up to a personal preference thing, but I enjoy a normal Pastrami sandwich and the Sauerkraut was so overpowering in the taco that it was hard to eat. I gave half of it to my BF who didn't think it was too bad, but wouldn't order it again. The Lamb was bland and while we were hoping the Roast Pork Tacos would be hard to mess up, that too was bland and disappointing for something that's supposed to be a pretty straight forward staple. Especially since it was a special, we thought it would be special...By the time we got to the Duck, we were full of dissatisfaction and so-so food that we couldn't really finish. This taco actually wasn't too bad so it's unfortunate that we left it till the end. The whole experience was just so expensive and so unsatisfactory, it's not at all what we remembered from a couple of years ago. Maybe it was our choice in tacos, maybe it was just not a good day in the kitchen, or maybe there was a complete rehaul of the menu that I wasn't aware of but I don't see ourselves going back there any time soon.",1,0,1,Emily R.,"Manhattan, NY",8,60,108

3.0,11/17/2018,"Found this place by accident! Very nice ambiance and the wait staff was incredible. The issue was that the prices were too high for what was being given.

2.0,10/6/2018,"Empellon Taqueria is an OK place to enjoy small plate tacos and margaritas during its happy hour. I do have some major complaints about the place however.As I am a person who regularly goes by myself to restaurants after work I was able to immediately grab a seat around the bar area. What's nice about that is the bar seating has full service. What is not nice is that the ""bar"" seating is setup to be a bit awkward. You see the bar seats line around the bar as you expect... but they also wrap around a small section of wall then end around the front to be front window seats. So you have this little cove of seats that are not waited, not near the bar but your still suppose to give orders to the bartender. This forces you to awkwardly have to grab the bartenders attention if he/she is not looking towards this direction and at times it feels like they are so caught up on something else they don't look over. The wall part of this alcove is probably the worst seating in the entire restaurant and last time I was here I was smake dap in it.Foodwise, the portions of the tacos you get here are also very small for their price. This is true even with the happy hour menu. Perhaps the type of taco's they have here are a little more fancy then other Mexican places (such as chili duck) but I can almost complete a full bite of the $5 tacos. The portions are so small I can't appreciate them nor savior their taste even if they were great quality.Drink wise I think what I got here was good. The margaritas are tasty and though are a little pricey I think its worth it during happy hour. This is one of those places that put salt around the rim of the glass of your margarita which I really like.Simply put, I don't think this type of restaurant is my type of place. The place is fairly fancy and I assume I would of had a better time if I was seated with a waiter or at the front of the bar. Still though I didn't care for the taco prices here and I do know of other Mexican restaurants I would prefer more then this.",2,0,0,Cory B.,"Brooklyn, NY",40,120,723

The service is always exceptional, from the hostess to the waitress they really go above and beyond to ensure your experience is fantastic.3. The FOOD!!! Omg I could eat the brussel sprout tacos every night for dinner.  And the cashew salsa is also my favorite.  There is something for everyone on the menu and yes they can do gluten free tacos!  Very veggie friendly as well.4.

4.0,6/28/2018,"I popped in here once for cocktails and really liked the place. It had a nice, authentic Mexican vibe, with spectacular, colorful wall art and a great margarita menu...how can you go wrong? I only grabbed one drink when I was here though and I simply can not review a place without trying their food...so I was excited when my gf decided to have a birthday dinner here and I could actually review the entire experience. I started with their spicy cucumber margarita which was great, but 70% ice cubes, so I complained nicely to the waiter and he promised to make the next one more of martini than an iced packed margarita (and thankfully he fulfilled his promise). I will say, the margarita was excellent and half my friends ended up with the same drink. For food, we started with chips and guac and chips and salsa. The guac was very tasty and the salsa was good but definitely spicy. Then we ordered the scallop ceviche and the halibut ceviche. The halibut ceviche was okay...it came with pieces of mango and onions, but was a bit fishy. Not my fav. The scallop pieces came in two different sauces. Again, they were okay. Not my favorite ceviche dishes.Next, we ordered the shishito pepper queso. It was melted cheese on an iron skillet with lots of shishito peppers and a side of small flour (soft) tacos. You can't go wrong with melted cheese and peppers, yum! For our last and final course, we ordered a variety of tacos and sweet potato flautas. The tacos were small but tasty. I tried the duck tacos which came with fried pulled duck meat in a honey sauce. The sweet potato flautas came five to a plate - (5 thinly wrapped fried flautas in a lettuce wrap with cream). Overall service was very good. Our first waiter was really friendly and accommodating and then his shift ended, so we switched to another waiter, but he was friendly and helpful too.

3.0,6/26/2018,"Probably the best Mexican I have had in Manhattan to date, but outrageously expensive. Food quality was fantastic but I can't justify $16 for guacamole unless it's on a tasting menu. The cocktail menu all revolves around smoke, even in drinks that don't involve mezcal, which is a bummer if you aren't into smoky flavors. I will say that the Carnitas were absolutely fantastic. They perfected the crispy family style dish as it should be. On the topic of things that are done well, their Halibut Ceviche was perfectly balanced, and had great texture.

The food was always plentiful and delicious, and the drinks just kept coming. However; this year they cut it to one margarita per person (still $40 each), and the chilaquiles were basically some wet chips with a poorly poached egg on top. The fish tacos were two very small pieces of fried fish sitting atop a tortilla with some shredded lettuce. No pico, no sauce; no nothing. As bare as can be. The change in margarita policy was enough to never go back; but the expensive wet chips and plain fish was the nail that sealed the casket.

This happens way too often at many places, I really dislike it when service treats customers as if they are doing us a favor. On a different note, we loved the bar! Our server was good. Cocktails were great and ambiance was too! My girlfriend and I got the queso fundido and shared a few tacos (barbacoa, lobster, and duck carnitas). This place exceeds on presentation but falls short on other aspects. The queso fundido looked beautiful with the green and red colors, I just wish the chorizo had more flavor, saltier? spicier? Cheese was just OK (I am always harsh on this), but my girlfriend liked it. This is not your problem, but it is impossible to find a decent Oaxaca, Asadero or even Adobera cheese in the US. The tacos: The quality of the ingredients was impressive. Tortillas were a bit thin for me, too little salsa, and too much meat to tortilla ratio; but overall good. For the record, I was born and raised in Jalisco and grew up working in the family restaurant. These tacos to me, are higher-end-boutique-tacos. Great quality of ingredients, great presentation, and well-cooked, nevertheless: These tacos do not taste Mexican. But they don't have to! Right? You are doing your own thing, which is great, and I applaud you for it, but certain things have to be said. The duck was super rich and flavorful, I thought it needed more acid, something like a pico de gallo. This is just me, I like my tacos with a good amount of salsa. I am used to having three four different salsas on the side that come with the tacos at the table, it is very foreign to me to have to pay extra for them to come separately. There was not a lot of onion/cilantro to be seen either (maybe I am being too traditional).We will definitely be back, and dine with an open mind.",0,1,0,Robert J.,"Montreal, Canada",0,8,1

5.0,3/11/2018,"For Starters; Dammmmmmn!Secondi: Although its been a minute, this is still one of my favorite places in the W.Ville (West Village fools). I was debating on where to spend my birthday and after spinning the globe my pointer finger landed here at W4th and 10th st on a perfectly busy Friday evening. Tacos? Yes! Guacamole? ""Abso F'N lutely"" (thats not a word but the guac is stellar), and the cashew salsa is so good its the type of thing a cult provides at its meet and greet.I am trying to remember what I had to eat, because I started off with mezcal and needless to say I'm a cheap date. I was so impressed with their new drink list! They have classic margaritas plus variations such as the ""Spicy Cucumber"" and the "" Pink Grapefruit"", but then they have a new set of cocktails, my head exploded I was so stoked. If you're like me and like it strong go for the ""Highlander"" Oaxacan Rum, Scotch and Rosemary its the type of drink that makes me feel more confident than I should be when placing bets with strangers. My table ordered the roasted parsnips, pumpkin seeds and salsa papanteca as one of the starters. The parsnips are cooked to a tender bite, paired with the crunch of the pumpkin seeds and the robust flavor of the papanteca I can say that I really didn't feel like I was eating a vegatable dish. It is hardy and textured in a way that one who feels like they're missing out if protien isn't involved, would really enjoy this.OH My Gato the Tacos! You can put a man on the moon and have pastrami tacos, ok friends. The pastrami with pickled cabage and mustard seed relish, whaaaaat? Ok let me just tell you that it was actual mustard- seeds garnished on top. If you have never seen or eaten a mustard seed it is an actual thing from which the mustard spread comes from, so I thought that was super tight. The pastrami comes from short ribs, I didn't even know that type of magic existed. Dessert: By this point I had another neat mezcal (Don Amado to be exact, chocolate on the palate, smooth finish) so I am going to do my best to justify what happened here. Alex Stupak (Chef Owner) is known for his dessert makings (I've heard) and although I try to lay off dessert since its almost bikin season, I felt it was my duty to taste test here. The Kisshu Mandarins, little tiny mandarins lay delicately along the plate, as you take your cuchara and crack it against the hard shelled capsule, let ooze the Anejo Tequila-Caramel Sauce as it coats the inside of your mouth like, ummm, well it just delicious thats all.Before I finish, the may reason I come back to this place is that its my West Village cheers. The staff will recognize you by your second visit, make your experience feel whole by their warmth. They are knowledgeable about the dishes and beverages which makes you feel like ""ok great they're taking my fake gluten allergy seriously"". Mainly they are just really cool people that I like to eat around. I don't care how good the food is, the staff is what determines what type of taste will stay in your mouth after departure.

1.0,3/4/2018,"Yikes... where to start.I was invited for brunch here with a group of seven, so I'd say the sample size for this review is quite accurate. The interior of the restaurant is fun and beautiful, large paintings on the wall and exposed brick, with tables and chairs not being too cluttered.For starters, we walked in right when they opened for Sunday brunch. The table we sat at was large, but lacked coat space. The server was friendly and attentive. Five of us ordered coffee and he made sure to keep the refills coming. For appetizers we ordered two orders of guac and chips with smoked cashew salsa and red salsa. I thought the chips were pretty good and the guac with smoked cashew salsa were a fun combo. We shared one order of melted cheese with red + green chorizo which was good too.As for the actual brunch menu - not much to offer. One of us had ordered red snapper ceviche and the waiter came back and told us that ""the chef doesn't think the red snapper is up to quality"". Call me a cynic, but I'm calling bullshit on that and assuming they just didn't have it and didn't want to admit they didn't have it. Instead she had shrimp ceviche and a side of fruit. Two of us had the waffle with blueberry compote, another the churro french toast, my boyfriend the scrambled egg fundido. The other two I forget.Not that it really matters for me, but the plating of the waffles was just sad. It was a waffle cut into fours with a cup of blueberry compote and a cup of butter. Not even syrup. THAT'S IT! I have no idea what was wrong with the batter they used for the waffle, but it tasted as though I was eating burnt, airy batter! There was no density nor flavor to the waffle whatsoever. I can make better waffles with a packet of pancake mix and week old milk in my mini waffle maker at home. For fourteen dollars you're basically robbing yourself.The churro french toast was the completely the opposite in terms of batter. It was uncooked on the inside and again was lacking. My boyfriend's mom was quite disappointed, and she always loves to order french toast for brunch. I actually felt embarrassed for this place. How do you manage to screw up two simple dishes?My boyfriend's scrambled egg fundido was ""too cheesy"", as he likes to put it. I love cheese so I didn't see this as an issue. Except the portion size was extremely lacking on his and for $14 and you're getting a mini skillet of basically JUST cheese...The cost to food to quality ratio is just insanely off. I will not be coming back here, and in fact I will be recommending AGAINST this place for all my future brunch outings.",1,2,0,Katie M.,"New York, NY",267,52,119

We tried the skirt steak (yummy and hot), shrimp with pipian, lamb, duck, and goat -- have to admit I didn't try the goat but all who did loved it.

The tacos were pretty underwhelming for $18 a duo - chicken had very little flavor, skirt steak was decent but my boyfriend found the taste strange, and we both agreed the shrimp with pipian was the best (accented with pumpkin seeds).

3.0,8/31/2017,"I seriously don't understand what the hype is about here. Contextually, I love tacos. And I think the foundation of the taco, the tortilla, should be the most important merit on which a taco is judged. The tortillas here are ~flour~ tortillas and are kind of terrible, and I wasn't impressed by the flavor balance of any of the tacos we had (the aggressively bland fish tacos and the limp brisket). The fillings lacked acid, and the salsas provided just didn't add much to the shallowness of flavor. While we did really enjoy our appetizers and margaritas, the tacos were so disappointing that I left feeling like the meal was a waste of money. Every $2 taco from a truck I've ever had has been better than the bougie tacos we got here. The service was really excellent, and I loved the decor; however, I won't be back.

The bartender was extremely nice. But I noticed that the happy hour specials aren't really ""special"" at all, meaning the prices are not discounted compared to the regular menu. It's around $9 for one tiny taco, and $14 for 2 cocktails - but only for one person, so what's the point if you are just trying to have one drink? Ugh. Anyway, I tried the steak and fish tacos and they were good, but nothing special; the fried fish needed more flavor.

But on happy hour you can get one for $9.  What a door buster!  Why do they bother? Margaritas are 2-for-1 but only for one person...i don't know why that matters so much to them but it certainly makes their menu feel a little tricky and stingy to have so many weird parenthetical notations and exceptions. For those unfamiliar with this neighborhood's arms race of overpriced Mexican food, that's one steak taco, of the size you expect at a taqueria, for $9.  A lobster taco will run you $13 per taco.  The shrimp taco was good, but was two shrimp for $9.  I expect high prices in Manhattan- but I expect the tough competition will mean that food is excellent and expensive. This was average and expensive. Great selection of mezcal and the high prices will usually keep the crowd levels down.  There was no heat, not even moderate heat, in any of the food I got.  A lot of creamy and smoky flavors.  To be fair, I didn't request extra heat,will do that if I go back.

The bottle is only $35 and proves to be quite the dinner party experience if you decide to indulge. We were a rowdy bunch and asked our waiter to open our bottle. He brought over this tomato juice shooter as a chaser with our tequila shots. It was a great compliment to the smooth tequila. We were a party of 5 and the Casa Noble bottle gave us around 3 rounds of shots. We ordered the sweet plantain sopas and the meatball sopas. I definitely recommend ordering the meatball sopas. The sweet plantain sopas (just as it is named) was way too sweet as an appetizer for me. I ordered the brussel sprout taco and the duck taco (special menu item). The brussel sprout taco (despite raving reviews) tasted just okay to me. It wasn't anything I would go back for and I wouldn't have ordered it in the first place if the reviews I had read hadn't been so adamant. The duck tacos were AMAZING. You could tell the duck had been simmering in marinade for days. Our waiter was fantastic by the way. I wish I had asked his name but he was really helpful with the menu and just had fun vibes in general. It definitely added to our great experience! All in all, I would come back here.

3.0,5/12/2017,"Empellón Taqueria = fancy Mexican. It's a nice place to take a date if you want to impress him/her, and you're craving some Mexican food.My boyfriend claims that this place serves the best tacos that he has ever eaten in his life (even though he has been to LA and Mexico). We're both meat eaters but get this - his best taco is the BRUSSEL SPROUTS taco. So naturally when he brought me here to eat that, I was pretty skeptical.We came in a little before 8 pm on a Wednesday and the place was poppin'. The wait for a table would have been 45 minutes. But since we didn't mind if we didn't sit down at a table, we just ordered drinks and tacos by the bar.First thing's first. The drinks. He says cocktails are pretty good. But I ended up getting the michelada since I love beer and bloody marys, so it's kind of an in between. The tomato juice had this smoky taste to it that I didn't really care for but overall, it was a good michelada. We also decided to do some tequilia, and the bartender was super knowledgeable, and didn't, try to G us. We told him that we wanted a smooth, sippable tequila, but didn't want to break the bank. So he recommended a smooth one (at $12 a shot, which came with a shot of that smoky tomato-y mix) which wasn't too bad. Mind you, I never drink tequila, especially not after my college days. But this one wasn't TOO terrible.On to the tacos - it's $16+ for two tacos, so I don't really think it was that worth it. I guess I just have this idea in my head that really good tacos can also be really inexpensive. It was good, don't get me wrong, but it was probably more of a splurge for me.While I wouldn't crown this place as the best taco ever, as my boyfriend has, it is still pretty good.

3.0,4/2/2017,"Came here with a friend and high expectations. Empellon Cocina is one of my haunts (that melted cheese!) and my friend is a salsa-making fiend and follows Alex Stupak on Instagram. Unfortunately, our lunch didn't blow us away, but I'm chalking it up partially to our standards.Called ahead while we rambled our way to West Village. No wait at 1 pm on a Saturday? Sold. The room was buzzing and looked full when we walked in, but we were seated immediately. Classy but non-intimidating space. Loud conversation but not deafening.We started with chips and salsa-- the roja and the arbol. Roja seemed very one-note to me but the arbol was wonderful. Smoky, tangy, creamy. Could have eaten this all day.For tacos, I did mixed mushroom and he did lamb barbacoa. Mine tasted pretty purely mushroom and l wouldn't say I was enthused, but it was competent. Layering the arbol on helped a lot. The barbacoa was disappointing. Texture wasn't tender, the sauce wasn't strong, and the cucumber made it watery instead of enhancing the flavors. We had also been excited about the tortillas but they seemed ho-hum to these Texas natives.Portion size on the tacos was smaller but was good for us and won't be a problem if you fill up on chips or get an appetizer. Service is impeccable here; staff is well trained and I felt that we never kept waiting too long.Would put it at a 3.5 because it is a a lot to pay for relatively unimpressive food (though price is in line with others in the neighborhood). Rounding down even though I liked the experience more than I liked my meal, and it's the perfect spot for meeting up with a friend-- but aren't we ultimately here for the food? I don't see myself running back but if I found myself in the West Village I would give it another shot. Right now, looks like the move here would be a margarita, a few beautiful salsas, and a couple relaxed hours in good company.",0,0,0,Liz S.,"New York, NY",952,772,1843
3.0,3/29/2017,"Firstly, the food here is amazing. They have unique menu items and great flavor in the food. The downside is that the portion sizes are ridiculously small - I mean like finger sandwich small. You will need to order an item from each menu area in order to be full.  Ordering from each menu area was actually suggested by our waiter. Now I know why. The tacos are pricey, and you only get two or three in an order. The tacos are so small you will need to order two orders of them in order to feel satisfied - and that can get expensive. Both my friend and I actually got food somewhere else after we left the restaurant. My friend went to a taco truck (the irony), and I got something from the Whole Foods hot bar. This is tragic. That being said, I would go back - only this time with more money to spend to order an item from each area on the menu as suggested. The food is that good.

4.0,3/5/2017,"My husband and I met some friends here for dinner about a week ago. It was a Saturday night at 7PM and it was packed! I highly recommend making a reservation if you can. A lot of people who didn't have a res were waiting for a table when we arrived and even more when we left. Some of my friends had some wine and some got margaritas. They had a very interesting cocktail and margarita menu. Lots of choices. We all split guacamole to start and our waitress hooked us up with a few dipping sauces since we got 2 orders. We also got queso with shishito peppers. The guac was pretty good and the dipping sauces were amazing that came with it. Each with their own unique flavor that paired beautifully with the guac. The queso and peppers were great! They came with corn tortillas but I enjoyed with just on their own. They had a lot of options for tacos and a couple of different ones for vegetarians, which I was pleased with. I wasn't stuck with the requisite peppers and onions in a taco with beans. I ordered the brussels sprout tacos, my husband got the special of the day: duck tacos, and people also got the chicken and carnitas tacos. You can get 2 or 3 and we all went for 3 but when they came out, they were much bigger than we anticipated and I think I would have been happy with just 2. You also can not mix and match in your order so our server suggested sharing with others at the table so you can try many kinds. The flavor of the brussels sprout tacos was amazing. I couldn't get enough of them. Truly delicious. My husband LOVED his duck tacos. He raved about them for a while. Everyone seemed to really enjoy their food. We didn't order dessert. There were only 2 choices and neither of them interested us. This was a great taco place! I would definitely come again. Our server was incredible. She was so enthusiastic and helpful and friendly.

4.0,1/5/2017,"3.5 starsWent for a Sunday Prix-fixe meal with a group of 7, and although I felt it had good value ($30 for 3 courses), I found the food was very hit or miss. If you order right, it can be a very good meal. Ordering from the prix-fixe menu can be confusing - it ends up being 1 appetizer per person, 1 cheese for 2 people, and 2 tacos per person (you can only order 2 of the same tacos, so swap as you like afterwards). For appetizers, I would also recommend the shrimp, cauliflower and octopus. Skip the the fluke ceviche, which was surprisingly lacking flavor. In terms of melted cheese, I really enjoyed the shishito peppers version, which has a small hill of charred shishitos sitting over the queso fundido. Ask for extra tortillas because there's a lotta cheese in the deceptively small skillet, and eat quickly because the texture gets weird after it cools down. Chorizo cheese was good as well, but heavy. My favorite tacos were the fish tempura and grilled shrimp, and the lobster if you don't mind the $10 supplement. The lamb was quite gamey, and the others didn't wow in flavor as I expected. Overall, the experience was a little underwhelming - I liked empellon cocina much better.

1.0,12/28/2016,"This review is for the terrible service and atmosphere. The food was good.. but not memorable. I had recommended this place to my coworkers as I had heard great things - we were all very excited. We had a reservation for 14 people on the night of cinco de mayo this year, of which we all were on time to. Our high top table was awkwardly situated in front of the bar in the main room, right when you walk in thru the front door, instead of in the back room as we had anticipated. Thus, during the entire night, it was too loud to hear anyone, and people at the bar were hanging their coats on our chair backs and bumping into us while our group ate - but again, it was cinco de mayo, so we understood. SERVICE: We didn't get our drink orders taken or guac/chips until a half hour into our reservation. The spicy cucumber margarita was good, so we all ordered two when we ordered the second time since it took so long to receive our first round. We ordered the pre-fixed 6-course cinco de mayo meal and had a great time until the wait staff started telling us to leave because it had been 2 hours into our reservation. We had just received our dessert and had full cocktails (2 each) untouched and were kicked out at the 2-hour mark. On our way out, we overheard the hostess complain to a waiter ""I mean they've been here 2- hours, like, get out, seriously"".... We had received our second round of drink orders and a dessert that your wait staff was slow in getting to us. We ordered on time (actually very fast since we were all starving and ordering off the pre-fix) and your wait staff kicked us out and audibly complained about our quiet 15 person group.... maybe next time you should anticipate that a 15-person reservation with a 6-course meal might need more attention or might need more time.

Service at this point was good, because they were concerned with the quality of the meal. They took it off the bill and asked me to order alternative tacos. Because the previous tacos were so salty, I went with chicken with a cream and salsa sauce. I knew just from the smell when the plate was put in front of me that the chicken was freezer burned or old. One bite and it was confirmed. The manager/owner approached me and said that she checked with the kitchen and that no chicken at any time was frozen. So, I have to assume that it was not fresh. The bartenders were nonplussed when I sent the second dish back. Them being in the service industry, I expected them to not show their distaste for me so outwardly.

Our bill was $160 for two people and we got dollar slice on the way home because we were still hungry. I ordered the chicken tacos and literally got a few chunks of rotisserie chicken on top of these paper-thin soft tacos (actually they reminded me of wonton wrappers, kind of gummy and not sturdy), and I think I spotted a small sliver of an onion on there. That was it. $16. What?Pros:- Drinks are great- Very ""sceney"", always packed, in a great location in the West Village, good music, etc.Cons:- WAY overpriced for a very small amount of food- Appetizers were just ok- Tacos were sad. So sad. Such sad little tacos!- Our waiter was kind of rude in general and was rushing us out the door even though we weren't there that long. He dropped off our check (before even asking if we wanted anything else), then came back twice to pick it up, look at it to see if we had put our card down, and then shuffled off.Pro trip from a local!

We had set up an hour of unlimited drinks with dinner but as soon as we were seated we were told it would be extended for our entire meal for the inconvenience.

We ended up sitting in a corner area of the bar facing the front window. We had to go to the bar to place our drink orders, order our food, grab napkins, etc. through the Saturday night Happy Hour crowd. This took a very long time each time we wanted or needed something. We had very little room to eat comfortably and the noise level around us made it kind of hard to hear each other. I appreciate that the staff staggered our choices, since our corner was so intimately sized. Of all the things we ordered the standouts were the Halibut ceviche and the sunchoke salad. Their guacamole, as so many people have already noted, was chunky and heavenly. The two salsas that it came with were also very good - arbol and smoked cashew.

Tasted like nothing. Sauce in the shrimp ceviche was pretty good, we would order that again. Best food of the night was the fish tacos -- they were insanely good. We also loved the Brussel sprout tacos - very different and very tasty. Short rib pastrami tacos were interesting -- if you like pastrami with mustard, you will like these. The chicken tacos were really not good, though. Chicken was salty and the flavors were really off. Don't order the chicken tacos. Also, don't think this place is known for their dessert -- we had two, one was a passion fruit with marshmallow thing-really really bad. No clue why anyone would make something like that.

4.0,2/20/2016,"My experience at Empellon T for Valentine's Day dinner with Mrs. R was much like Jason P's, with just an off note or two. First, our table location, near the serving pantry between the two dining rooms, was a little drafty, and on a cold night this was annoying but not so much so as to make me ask to be moved. Secondly, we too were surprised at the ""small portions"" (more on this below). But our server was super personable, without being smarmy -- good!  I'll echo Jason on the salsas:  intense, savory flavors. Also the queso (we stuck with the shishito peppers since we love them) was heavenly. Tacos superb, chocolate flan cloud-like. Overall this was a well-executed set menu; we left feeling un-stuffed but not hungry or unsatisfied, but confused over why the $60 prix fixe would be pitched as a bargain, I received a call from the reservationist a few days afterwards. Apparently there had been a foul-up in the instructions given to servers about the second course (in which we chose the delicious queso). Seems that we should have been given TWO ADDITIONAL CHOICES, beyond the queso:  a ceviche and a salad. To ADD TO the choice we had made. Now I get it! That would have made the meal much bigger (and maybe too much so). But the reservationist was profusely apologetic over the error, and even though I clearly said we were content with our meal and would absolutely becoming back, she offered us a generous dining credit (I think it was $50 but I'm not certain). SO:  Watch this space for my next post, after Mrs. R and I return to use our dining credit.

The atmosphere was nice and the restaurant was kept nice and warm despite the freezing weather outside. The menu was a five course pre fixe including chips with salsa, queso Fundido to share, two tacos each and a chocolate flan. The food was delicious! The chips came with two of their salsas: smoked cashew and Arbol. When we first got served, I didn't think much of them as they were not any traditional salsas. However I was shocked as they packed a lot of flavors. The queso was also very good, we substituted the lobster instead of the shishito peppers. The house made tortillas were tiny, but they came out warm and it was the best tortilla I've had. We got a combination of fish, skirt steak and short rib pastrami for our tacos and they were all damn good!Overall, the portions were small and it was $60 per person.

Both were such nice touches, especially the dessert after they had already given us four cucumber margaritas on the house. The tacos are definitely the star of the show, though the smoked cashew salsa is a close second. Duck carnitas was the winner. Even the kind of boring sounding chicken and kale was outstanding.

It's probably worth it to just order a bottle of wine but I like my effing tequila and so that's that. (Plus you're a huge freak if you drink wine with tacos in my humble ""but I'm always right"" opinion.The seven salsas flight is pretty good. The Sipil pak and smoked cashew were my favorite but the salsa borracha and habanero came in close. The salsa verde was missing that super green element that I love in jalapeño but tbh that was pretty good too. Things to skip: both types of queso fundido we had (trumpet and chorizo) were quite terrible. I love queso fundido and was so disappointed! The dishes they serve them in aren't placed in the broiler and so of course the cheese solidifies (and I love solidified cheese! Cold Nachos, anyone?) in way that is NOT appetizing. Like layer of hard cheese and layer of grease. The mushrooms were overcooked and the chorizo needed a bit more seasoning and char. You should also skip the ceviches. I refuse to relive the halibut and the shrimp is essentially a glorified, lazy Tex-mex version of a shrimp cocktail. Imagine a sweet cocktail sauce, throw in some extra salt and carrots in it and ¡voila! The guac is good. You'll probably order it so I won't have to talk about it. The tacos are good, too. I only wish the tortillas were made with less lard (or whatever) to Lethe corn shine through- I didn't taste any. My favorites were skirt, Brussels sprouts, lamb Barbacoa and chicken. The fish tempura was great also! I had high hopes for mushroom but the sauce they are cooked in just makes the tortilla soggy. Thinking this filling is much better for a sope.. Which brings me to sopes! These are probably the best I've had outside of queens/BX in a long time!! The crust has awesome corn flavor and has a perfect crisp to soft ratio. If you order the smoked plantain, do not expect a big smoky element to the plantains... It's more subtle here. No dessert really- just 1 or 2 options and all given verbally tableside. The service here was superb and much, much better than I was expecting. The host team was also killing it- the place was packed and they never broke a sweat. Pro-tip, y'all: being nice to those who work in this industry will get you a far, far way! I'll come back, but maybe just for drinks at the bar. Too good for great people watching to give up!

They showcase their tacos, of course, but the menu is also full of fantastic veggies, ceviches and quesos. Let me explain this queso. It is a skillet of melted cheese topped with your choice of shishito peppers, black trumpet mushrooms, lobster or chorizo. Both times I have eaten at this restaurant, the queso fundido has been the star of the evening. Most recently, for five people, we shared the mushroom queso and it was sublime. The black trumpets had a phenomenal taste and texture. They reminded me of truffles but slightly more subtle. The queso is brought with warm tortillas.We also shared numerous other appetizers including the shrimp ceviche, the octopus ceviche, the beets and the butternut squash. All were good but none can compare to the queso.Next, for tacos, we each had two (although the menu says they must be ordered as a plate of two or three tacos, they are very accommodating and brought us plates with five): the lamb barbacoa and the fish tempura. The lamb was slightly lacking, in my opinion, in its flavor and uniqueness. It was also very greasy. However, the fish tempura was perfection.

4.0,11/13/2015,"This is the taqueria that reminds you what's so great about the West Village of NYC!  It's got a cool vibe, with a hip atmosphere that makes you feel good about yourself as soon as you walk in the door.  We sat in the bar area with a group of 6, and it was tremendous fun.  It's loud, but it just adds to the energy of the room.The tacos...pretty damn good!  The meats are slow roasted and succulent, the salsas add the right amount of flavor and kick.  We had the Smoked Cashew and De Arbol (along with the excellent guac).  The Cashew gets a lot of Pub here on yelp, and it's pretty worth it, but my favorite was the Arbol.  Banging spiciness and flavor to match!In our party of 6 we had many different tacos, but my three favorite were the Duck Carnitas and Lamb Barbacoa, along with the fish tempura, with creamy slaw and lime.  The fish was truthfully as good as the meats!Good drinks from the bar round this place out...I would return!",0,0,0,Steven W.,"Washington, DC",646,468,0

3.0,11/5/2015,"Went here on a recent Saturday night at 8:30. There were plenty of tables available, we were directed to the bar, no problem. Nice selection of margaritas. Loved the classic. Bartender asks If you want another one and  is quick to take your glass from bar... Um wasn't quite done with that yet..... We were seated in back. The tables are close, everyone can hear everyone's conversation if they're interested .  Had the chips and two choices of salsa, was good I wouldn't say a must have. But the display is really nice.  We had the chorizo dip, is was delicious.would recommend that.. Ordered the duck tacos and the skirt steak tacos. Both were good. The server got our drinks wrong but it was so hard to get his attention, the food was spicy so we just stared drinking them. When we finally got to mention it, he was like oh yeah, I'll take care of it. We were nice about it but he didn't do anything about it.  Our credit card was on the table because it had been returned from the bar, when he asked if we were done he just took the card from the table before showng us the bill. The check was fine but I didn't like that. Over all, this place has a cool atmosphere with high priced( but tasty)  tacos, service lacking, not great vibe from hostess to bar to server.

5.0,10/24/2015,"Mexican food has come a long way from the barren wasteland that Manhattan used to be 20 years ago - back when the Chinese-run ""Fresco"" empire thrived and spread across the city like a poison ivy rash or the only other options were stuffy, overpriced places with underseasoned, bland food or TGI Fridays-style margarita joints with underseasoned, bland food. Empellon Taqueria may not be cheap, but it delivers in a big way when it comes to authentic and exciting flavors. In fact, Empellon reminds me of some of the more adventurous restaurants I've been to in Mexico City where chefs are establishing a new tradition of Mexican cuisine.I highly recommend getting all seven salsas, which provide a stimulating panoply of flavors, with the smoked cashew and the citrusy habanero being my favorites. This also gives more options for pairing with items you order. For me it's always a variety of tacos, with my wife and I usually splitting three different orders of two-taco plates (think of it as taco tapas). Most of the tacos we've tried have been excellent, with the perfectly crispy tempura fish taco being our one must-have. The brussel sprout tacos (my dearly departed mother must be turning in her grave now that I love brussel sprouts) are also great, but they've been taken off the brunch menu. Only real miss was the braised bacon tacos, which weren't as flavorful as I had hoped, but these have been removed from the menu anyway.Another must have for my daughter is the churro French toast, which my wife and I will steal bites from. It's really more like Drake's coffee cake French toast (the big boy, not the junior) with a wonderfully crisp and crumbly coating over a tender, fluffy center. The margaritas are solid and the guacamole is great - what more could you ask for from a Mexican restaurant? I also highly recommend their newly released ""Tacos"" book, although there are no smoked cashew salsa or brussel sprout taco recipes - still need to visit to enjoy those - and I can't see myself grinding dried corn to make fresh tortillas like they do at Empellon, even though the end result is much better.Who cares about what table you were given (at least you got one) when Empellon is serving delicious, innovative food that's not outrageously overpriced? I've also found the sevice friendly and efficient during each of my several visits there. They were even patient and held my table when I was very late for a reservation due to hellish traffic caused by the MS bike ride one recent Sunday.

5.0,10/14/2015,I was recently in for lunch on a weekday and everything was excellent.  We had the queso appetizer with trumpet mushrooms and were fighting over the last bite because it was so good.  At one point the manager/hostess came over to check on us and gave us recommendations on our next round of margaritas and they were just as good as the first.  I had the fish tacos which were probably the best I have ever had.  My friend had the chicken tacos and she said she wanted to cry a little when they were gone.  And they really saved the best for last because the passionfruit flan was amazing.   I will definitely be back and I can't wait to try everything else.,0,0,0,Rebecca H.,"East Hartford, CT",0,7,2

1.0,9/18/2015,"My boyfriend and I came here to dine last night and the service was HORRENDOUS. We made a reservation four days in advance for a Thursday night, so there was no reason not to be seated promptly at our reservation time. Once we were seated, the hostess automatically led us to high tops going down the middle of the restaurant while there were several lower tables open. I asked her if we could be seated on a lower table, and she automatically refused and said it was reserved for larger parties. When I requested her again, she said she would go talk to her manager and ask if anything could be done. She returned and claimed her manager said it was reserved for large parties coming in and that we would have to wait 45 minutes to get a lower table, so naturally, we settled for the high tops.Within 5 minutes of sitting down, the hostess seated two parties of 2 at the lower tables. My boyfriend and I saw this and approached her, and all she said was ""You're going to have to talk to my manager."" We went to the manager who said she was never made aware we wanted to be seated at the lower tables and would move us. She also mentioned it was the hostess' 2nd day training. (Frankly, a 2nd day trainee hostess shouldn't handle a packed restaurant in the West Village on a Thursday night). For the rest of the night, we were treated coldly by all of the staff (our waiter, the hostess, and both managers) The food was decent but not good enough to make up for the horrible service and the noise level. Unless you're interested in shouting across unusually long tables and dealing with condescending staff, I would recommend checking out other Mexican restaurants within a 5 minute walking distance, like Ofrenda and El Toro Blanco!",4,1,0,Sweta S.,"New York, NY",154,13,2

Again, they were both so delicious, I couldn't choose which one I liked better!Their cocktails are really good and strong, but beware if you ask for a chaser for a tequila shot they will give you a very spicy, smoky, thick, tomato-y juice that is not for everyone (including myself).",0,0,0,Emily C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,93,0
3.0,5/14/2015,"SO... based on how trendy the place is, i was already questioning how good the tacos could be. This place is definitely not a hole in the wall--it's aesthetically pleasing, the menus weren't sticky, the lighting was dark enough that my eyes had to adjust before I could actually read the menu. But they were pretty good--just not $6 per taco good. We also ordered guac and chips, which came with two delicious salsas (one was smoked cashew, the other was arbol). The smoked cashew was great--certainly not like any of your usual spicy salsas. The arbol was more standard in taste, but had a twist with the kick, and I enjoyed it a lot. The bowl of guac was tiny, but actually lasted us through all the chips and some of the tortillas that came with our order of red chorizo potato queso (best part of the meal). As for the tacos, I got the fish tempura, and my boyfriend got the lamb barbacoa. They were both great, but again, I'm not sure they were amazing enough to warrant the high prices. That being said, I recognized that we were also paying for the culinary experience. The restaurant itself was simple in decoration, but packed by well-dressed young people. We were coming from spin class, so our outfits were a little more casual... I noticed a couple experimental items on the menu--including pork tongue--in my fairly limited experiences with Mexican cuisine, I was surprised to see how different this menu was from the usual Mexican place menu.

4.0,3/16/2015,"After a busy morning touring Liberty & Ellis Islands, my sister the chef suggested we stop here before heading up to Times Square. Being of Mexican parents, I heard TACOS and my eyes lit up. When we arrived at the place, my brother in law and I got skeptical. My sister did warn us it was different so we both took her word for it. We didn't have reservations, but they gladly took us in and made room for us. As we sat down, looked at the menus, nothing said original Mexican food to me but judging from the atmosphere and looking at the pics online, I figured I'd delve into a new dish. Their flour tortillas are handmade and corn tortillas are available upon request, which is what I ordered. To start off we did have the Guacamole with two salsas (smoked cashew and arbol). Different yet very good; I get it. They're using authentic Mexican ingredients and putting a twist to it. The arbol sauce wasn't too spicy, had a mole taste to it, and adding the smoked cashew to it was even better. The drinks here seemed to be very good although we opted for a beer. Not many on tap but they do have Mexican beers in  bottle or cans. We ordered different tacos so we could see what the fuzz was about. The Pork shoulder w/Chilmole, Chicken black kale w/salsa verde, Lamb barbacoa w/cucumber and salsa borracha were very delicious. I have to admit, my brother in law and I were impressed. Usually tacos come with onions and cilantro but this place puts a different twist on them using kale, cucumbers, epazote and other fresh ingredients. All in all, it was an eclectic experience. The only drawback to our experience was a table of noisy ladies loaded on margaritas already, it seemed. One was so loud, my ear drum was buzzing. Don't even get that when firing my weapon doing Army stuff. One order of tacos was screwed up but they comp'd it and brought out another one. To top off the experience, our waitress was always checking on us and we met another waiter, whom we conversed with in Spanish and English and introduced himself to us. Carlos sent us some high end mezcal on the house to finish off and head off to Times Square.

Although 7 of us were there on time, one of our friends was stuck in traffic. Even though I told the host to please just seat us, she said our whole party had to be there. Fine. 10 minutes pass, and traffic isn't moving. I told the woman that we would just start eating without our friend. Still, she refused to seat us. Our friend gets to Empollon 5 minutes later. What happened? The woman gave our table away! On my boyfriend's birthday, the host gave our table away. We then proceeded to wait AN HOUR to be seated.

2.0,2/22/2015,"We really enjoyed dinner here recently. Very inventive Mexican-inspired flavors and fancy margarita-like cocktails. It was packed on a Friday night and I highly recommend making reservations (nice that they accept them).Sunday brunch however was disappointing. There were some cleanliness issues, but also just boring, under-seasoned dishes. The cheese omelette tacos are just a small omelette on two tortillas, and the chilaquiles are just soggy corn chips with what tastes like left over pulled chicken. They comped a dish for us and offered a free cocktail to make up for the aforementioned issues, so I'm going to chalk that up to an off morning.Update: I visited here for dinner on a Friday night. Even with reservations made weeks in advance, the hostess was rude and seated us in the bar area instead of the dining room (which I requested when I made the reservation). When I commented that our group had hoped to have a conversation at dinner instead of scream at each other, she sarcastically said that she'd turn down the music. Overall, she seemed annoyed and bothered to take the two minutes to seat us. The food was also overpriced and mediocre. This placed has gone down hill.

3.0,1/29/2015,"The week before, I had seen this place featured on TV for their lobster tacos and chicharrones. We made reservations for 3 for Sunday at 12:15pm. Two days before, we got a phone call to confirm the reservation with the stern warning that reservations are only held for 15 minutes and that the party must all be present before being seated. Fair enough. When we got there, we were, of course, a teeny bit late (3 minutes) and ended up running to the restaurant to keep our table. There were seriously only 7 diners in the entire place.I came in for the chicharrones and thought I had done my homework! From the blog part of Empellon Taqueria's website on Oct 7, 2011: ""We are proud of our chicharrones at Empellon and even though they don't sell that much Im never taking them off the menu.""Guess what? No chicharrones! Oy!Service at first was great but towards the end of the meal, as the place filled with people, we were left to ourselves. We had told the server that one diner hated cilantro and she said not to worry, she'd take care of us. Well, we were told which salsa contained cilantro. We got the seven salsas with chips and guac. All great, though the hottest salsa was too hot to finish. Really loved the smoked cashew salsa. Ordered tacos: lobster, fish, brussell sprouts, chicken, and pork shoulder. Every taco had cilantro on it so one person had to pick the cilantro out of each taco she ate! Our favorites were the brussell sprouts and fish tacos. The lobster tacos were just ok - there's corn in it and it had a gummy mouth feel, but at $13 each, I expected more. Service should be better.

I'm not a huge fan of plantains, but wow they were smokey with a hint of sweetness and I couldn't get enough of them. The mushroom tacos were also deliciously smokey. The lamb tacos were good and surprisingly filling, but a bit on the salty side, so I was dying of thirst afterwards. The restaurant fills up around 7 or 7:30 for dinner. Go early if you don't have a reservation and don't want to wait. My only big complaint is that it was 20 degrees outside and there was no heat in the main dining room.

Our favorite things were the guac, the spinach and chorizo quest fundido (this is ridiculously delicious), and the chicken and kale taco. Seriously, don't leave without trying that queso fundido. We were also impressed by the drink selection. We all had delicious margs. But perhaps more importantly, they also have A BOTTLE OF TEQUILA ON EACH TABLE that you can buy for $29. This is a pretty sweet deal, given how expensive restaurant alcohol usually is. We may or may not have had two of these. They bring you this weird savory chaser for the tequila (almost like a salsa) and then you are supposed to drink both like a delicacy. Anyway, it's delicious and fun, and we probably got 10-15 or so shots out of each bottle. The ambiance is really nice. It's an upscale setting with trendy decor.

Foodwise, the guacamole was tasty, but not superior and was served smeared in a shallow plate without garnish. The roasted broccoli was served cold, reminiscent of leftover Chinese food with clotted hoisin. Then came the special halibut ceviche style taco--also served ice cold, with mayo, kind of like deli seafood salad with that composite fake crab. The shredded chicken taco was bland and fleshy, although it was served hot! The margaritas were 70% ice cubes, though the remaining fluid was flavorful and dry. We had to ask for slices of lime--wasn't the lime crisis over in May? Later in the meal--in lieu of another hielorita--the Malbec was a full-bodied, terrific choice.

2.0,12/3/2014,"We really wanted to love Empellón, and we tried very hard to, but it was not the experience we had hoped.Three of us ate here, on reservation, on a busy Saturday evening. We each got margaritas and decided to split the house guacamole and chips with two salsas (smoked cashew and arbol).And here's where we should've left and gotten the rest of our meal somewhere else. The margaritas were fantastic - two of us got the spicy cucumber, and the third the yuzu. Well balanced, not too strong but definitely not weak, great flavors. We agreed that the guacamole was some of the freshest, brightest that we've had - so delicious. Would go back for guac and drinks without hesitation.Well, maybe mild hesitation, or smuggling our own chips in. We asked for more chips four times and they never came - what a waste of the leftover guac! We would've happily paid extra for more chips. But this was about par for the rest of the service, too - we never got checked on for how the food was, nor whether we wanted more drinks.For the rest of the food:A's order: mixed mushroom tacos with rajas; brussels sprouts tacos with malted hummus and hazelnutsM's order: mixed mushroom tacos with rajas; lamb barbacoa tacos with cucumber and salsa borrachaR's order: from the Mariscos appetizers - Octopus (with parsnip, pumpkin seeds, and salsa papanteca); Skirt steak tacos with mojo de ajoI only tried my food, so I can only really comment on it - both dishes were the definition of one-note. The octopus appetizer was a nice first bite - good texture, nice strong flavor. But then I didn't really want to keep eating it - it's so strong, it's like an amuse bouche or canapé that you just want to enjoy a tiny bit of. And I love octopus. Struggled through the rest of it, but wouldn't order it again unless sharing with a whole lot of people (non vegetarians).My tacos were greasy - super duper oily and fatty steak with a gloppy sauce. I didn't finish the second one - it was dying for something acidic or crunchy, or both! (""My kingdom for a lime!"")A and M found theirs about the same - the mushrooms were gloppy and wanting acid, the lamb needed more salsa and brightness.We were so excited about this really interesting menu, but I think we'll either stick with the wonderful Añejo uptown, or keep looking elsewhere.",4,1,0,Rebecca G.,"Baltimore City, MD",104,363,295

Go for the guacamole & 2 salsa starter - the guacamole is perfectly balanced, just the right level of spice, lime & salt. The cashew salsa is a winner. Also highly recommend the sunchoke salad - despite my lackluster second visit am definitely coming back for this salad. Also recommended are the barbacoa tacos & the scallop dish.What didn't I like? The skirt steak taco was a disappointment. I love love love skirt steak because of the fatty juiciness of the meat so I had to order them but they were really really plain. They needed more salt & a whole lot of acid - just bland. The sopes were okay - I would save the stomach space and try a queso fundido. Was most disappointed in the lobster tacos - save yourself the wallet hit! Nothing worked - the creamy sauce was too rich, just a flat dish over all.Service? 4.5 stars. Request CoCo. She was perfectly attentive - knew just when to approach and check in. Gave us great recommendations & was very sweet.

The chicken was nicely cooked but too spicy and slightly salty. The Tuesday special, which is a steak tartare was a complete disappointment! Steak tartare is a delicate dish composed of beef tenderloin, hand chopped into a very fine dice, the taco was a mix of greasy chunks of meat. The lot was nice and tender and the pineapple have it a very sweet note. The lamb was delicious and very well seasoned, didn't like the combination of olives as I personally think lb should be paired with something fresh, like a yogurt and dill pico de gallo.

All in all, I'd say it's still a little pricey for what you get but they have nightly taco specials so I would recommend going for those. I did think that this is better than Cocina as you would actually be able to enjoy a good meal with a reasonable budget. I do wish they have the house masa chips that they have at Cocina though.",2,1,0,Ryna D.,"New York, NY",227,1549,2438
4.0,9/11/2014,"I have been to empellon more than enough times to make sure this review is right. The space is comfortable. A casual atmosphere, which is good thing. The Mexican paintings on the walls are great. The service is average. Hospitality is what this place needs more of. drinks may take a little time sometimes. All in all you will not be waiting too much time for anything. Now we get to the food. The tacos are great for what they are. Don't take that in anyway bad. Flour tortillas are a great choice for the things being done at empellon. Though at times i tend to compare flavors to the authentic taco flavor profiles. The corn tortillas made from masa will have no equivalent. Especially fresh. But back to empellons tacos. The lobster and field corn tacos with epazote are quite ingenious and flavorful. The beer braised tongue tacos are just phenomenal, my favorites actually, with potatoes a small great kick. The queso fundidos are great but go for the green chorizo. You will not be disappointed. They also serve miniature sopes. I would say these are good but not great. All I ask empellon is can we get fresh masa tortilla tacos as a special. To my favorite part of the meal. Cocktails. The mezcal old fashioned is my go to staple. It is so well done. Empellon pretty much won me over with a couple of cocktails. And I have pretty much tried most of them. Also their take on a negroni is quite tasty for those who are into that kind of drink. All in all empellon is a good go to restaurant for tacos. Though a little on the pricey side for those that have an issue with that. Also if you're looking for authentic tacos, this isn't the place. This is chefs stupak take on it. And brought up one level in my opinion. Playful yet thoughtful and flavorful yet savory.",0,1,0,Mario N.,"Bronx, NY",15,16,21

4.0,8/21/2014,"I have to say, the food here is amazing. Not your traditional Mexican food menu. It's worth a try to get something different but if you're expecting the usual feast of refried beans, rice and all the fixings that normally come with tacos, this is not it. I ordered 2 skirt steak tacos instead of 3, expecting that it would have been too much... I got 2 tacos on a plate. For $14, marinated skirt steak cubes on 2 corn tortillas drizzled with some sauce. Not even doubled up tortillas, just 1 for each taco. Also had the guacamole with the 2 sauces. Again, the taste is amazing. The roasted cashew sauce, I've never had anything like it. Tequila served with sangrita is what made me decide on 4 stars. That's the way all good tequila should be served. Great Mexican but a bit on the overpriced side. I left the place still craving Mexican food. Going to have to find me a dive that I can feed 10 people for the amount I spent here.",0,1,1,Anthony L.,"OZONE PARK, NY",40,119,6
3.0,8/20/2014,"Decent food but I was slightly disappointed after all the hype. It's upscale mexican food, but I thought it was quite expensive given the portions. The queso fundido with peppers ($10) was delicious but only comes with two tortillas... it was just cheese and whole roasted peppers, nothing special. It was about four spoonfuls of cheese. The fairytale eggplant salad ($9) was a tasty small salad, beautifully presented. The steak tacos were the most disappointing. For $14 for two, I was expecting mind blowing tacos but the meat was mediocre steak meat (maybe it was overcooked), and there was nothing special to them. They were just crazy overpriced tacos. I'm equally content with my $2 tacos at the corner taqueria, but maybe I'm just not a taco connoisseur? Also, despite the restaurant being 1/3 empty, they were quite pushy about getting us out once we had finished eating, which is incredibly annoying at a ""nicer"" place.",2,0,1,Stef S.,"San Francisco, CA",132,779,6

5.0,7/6/2014,"Serious tacos in an upscale restaurant that doesn't take itself too seriously.  Al at the bar and Mary were exceptionally friendly.  Al (a woman) and I (a man) had a great time talking about tequila and what it is like to have a surname that is gender non-conformist. The space is beautiful and elegant and generally quite packed.  We went July 4th weekend and were lucky to have our pick of places to sit.   Al, the aforementioned female bartender, was wonderful explaining the cuisine, in particular the 7 salsas that accompanied that guacamole.  The staff seemed really excited about the cuisine.  After eating there, I was too.Cucumber Margarita - I couldn't stop licking the jalapeno tincture on the rim.  Great balance of spicy and sweet, not too sugar-y.   I'll have to ask my friend to remind me what tequila we sampled...I have a feeling, they have quite a selection.  Guacamole and salsas -    My favorite were the cashew (smokey and pleasant...Al called it ""salsa crack) and the habanera which was HOT!  Between these salsas and the jalapenos in the guac, my mouth was on fire before we were done.  TACOS - Chicken and kale - I was hungry started with these so i started with these.  Al said these were a bestseller but really tried to push something more interesting on me: the crab cake and sea urchin Saturday taco special.  So I ordered both.  The chicken and kale did not disappoint, with tons of fresh cilantro these were some of the freshest tacos I've tasted.  Pork shoulder - Sweet and yummy.  Brussel sprouts - with malted hummus and hazelnuts, these had a nutty/earthy flavor and were a nice complement to some of the other spicier fare.Crab cake and sea urchin - Saturday special.  Excellent!!!!  Well worth the $24 for two tacos (what?).  The bill ended up being a little higher than we would have liked...drinks are reasonable and I suppose you could get out of here without paying a fortune...but go ahead and splurge a little and you won't be disappointed.",1,0,0,Dana S.,"New York, NY",1188,13,3

5.0,6/27/2014,"IN SHORT: An upscale taco and tequila bar that nonetheless caters to the younger culinary sophisticate crowd. Chef Alex Stupak manages to literally push the boundaries of tacos (in fact, ""empellón"" means ""push"" in Spanish) to a degree that showcases the quality of his Mexican-inspired ingredients.THE STORY: I love that Empellón Taqueria doesn't promise too much. It doesn't pretend to be the most authentic representation of Mexican food in the city - the guacamole even comes loaded with jalapenos that surprisingly balance the creaminess of the avocado and don't overpower it with spice. And it doesn't pretend to use only classically Mexican ingredients - the Brussels sprouts tacos with malted hummus and roasted hazelnuts are actually one of my favorites with their earthy, nutty textures.Empellón's only promise is to serve incredibly crafted bites in taco-form. Stupak's creations are clearly inspired and informed by Mexican cuisine, but they don't attempt to replicate anything, inevitably avoiding failure.All the tacos are served on fresh housemade flour tortillas, but the crispy Lamb Barbacoa tacos with cucumber and salsa borracha and the Fish Tempura tacos with cabbage and lime mayonnaise, which were flaky, bready, and creamy all at the same time, are the two biggest hits. The selection of mezcals and tequilas is also extraordinary, promising excellent cocktails and margaritas as well. The simple Mezcal margarita with Fidencio Clasico, fresh lime, and smoked salt is a perfectly rich and smoky addition to the smoked cashew and arbol salsas that come with the guacamole, though the Spicy Cucumber margarita with St. Germain, cucumber puree, and jalapeno tincture may be one of the best I've had. Empellón Taqueria definitely has me sold on its thoughtful and deliberately upgraded Mexican food with a twist.",3,2,2,Ali M.,"New York, NY",31,234,245

Looking for some milder options, we opted for the Sikilpak - pumpkin seed, cinnamon - and the Smoked Cashew chipotle salsas. Both were unique and delicious, but my favourite was definitely the latter, pairing nicely with the guac. Next, we ordered the duck confit taco with bits of spanish sausage adding extra flavour and texture to a classic dish. Finally, the fish tempura tacos had an airy crispy batter and was almost too big to fit into the soft corn tortilla! I would have liked a little more lime mayo on this.

4.0,4/27/2014,"Mexican cuisine isn't typically an area I tread into, but after hearing so much about Alex Stupak's establishments in NYC, I eventually decided to make a visit for brunch at Empellón Taqueria, the West Village counterpart to the original Cocina.When I first entered on a Saturday afternoon, I was pleasantly surprised at how empty the space was; there were only a few tables that were occupied and a couple of guests sitting by the bar, chatting with the bartenders. Just based on the decor, I'd guess that Empellon attracts more of a crowd during the evenings; the graffiti that acts as a backdrop to their bar coupled with an otherwise stark dining room is easily overlooked at night, when the lack of sunlight and the predominance of candlelight is more forgiving.Empellón's brunch menu is well thought-out, with an array of options that include some of the more familiar brunch items as well as several dishes with a Mexican slant. While my friend opted for the safer Buttermilk Pancakes, which he later deemed a solid plate (albeit a little sweet), I decided to go with the Scrambled Egg Fundido. It was served in two components; the first, a small iron skillet to hold the scrambled egg fundido and the second, a container to keep the flour tortillas warm. The fundido is a perfect concoction for those who lean towards the savory side of brunch; the eggs were fluffy and light, the chunks of potatoes well roasted, and the addition of melted cheese and chorizo added creamy and spicy elements to the dish. I had some fun taking forkful by forkful of the fundido into the tortillas, and I was especially happy I'd been given flour ones, instead of corn, which I typically find far too grainy for my liking.Service was friendly and efficient and while the restaurant did start to fill up later in the afternoon, there was none of the hastiness or clamor that's typically associated with a weekend brunch in the West Village. I'd definitely recommend Empellón Taqueria for a quality meal, especially on weekend afternoons when you can actually enjoy both the atmosphere and the food.",13,6,8,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827
2.0,4/15/2014,"Went here with my husband for brunch on a Saturday, around 1pm. No tables, but was told there is full service around the bar and at the window. So we decided to take a seat in front of the window to people watch. We were told by a friend about their excellent french toast so gave it a go. Big mistake...Service was horrible (as it was another time we were here late at night for drinks; should have learned our lesson). Finally ordered from the gentleman who brought us water; I got the chilaquiles and the spritz cocktail, my husband got the breakfast margarita and skirt steak tacos, we split the chips and guac.Everything took WAY too long to get to us; maybe 20 mins for the chips and guac? The guac tasted very fresh, and the cilantro was placed on top which was nice since I'm not a cilantro fan and could pick it off. The chips were half stale half ok.Food came about 20 mins after that, still no drinks. The skirt steak was tender and had good flavor, but other than that, my husbands tacos were very unmemorable. The chilaquiles were awful, no flavor at all. I asked if they had hot sauce, and our server returned (10 mins later?) with a little cup of sauce that we later learned we were charged for. The sauce was great though, but sadly the only great thing. Cocktails came when we were half through our entrees; the breakfast margarita which was supposed to be really fruity tasted like a cuervo mix with a splash of tropicana oj. Not great, not awful. The spritz cocktail was good, but might have been about 4oz poured over ice.**The worst part of the meal by far was the service. Food and drinks were basically meh and overpriced, but we really didn't know who our server was and couldn't get a check to save our lives.

It needed something - heat and citrus I think. Next we ordered the fish taco, pork tongue, duck confit, Brussels sprouts, and pastrami. All were completely different and well executed. My favorite two were the pork tongue and sprouts. The tongue was incredible but everyone else at my table thought too spicy / I love heat in my food!  On the other spectrum the sprouts were served with hummus and hazelnuts.

The ambience is intimate and trendy and it's a good place to come on a date. I ordered a glass of Malbec which was decent, although nothing to write home about. For the main course, we ordered tacos - I ordered the mixed mushroom tacos with rajas. The tacos were really delicious but lacked seasoning. I asked the server to bring me some salt. The mushrooms otherwise were well cooked and tender and quite delicious. My boyfriend ordered the pork tongue tacos - he liked the tacos but thought they were a little overpriced especially for the quality of food and quantity offered. We were still hungry after each ordering 2 tacos each. So we decided to order the guacamole which comes with 2 salsas - the smoked cashew and arbol. Both these salsas where absolutely delicious! The smoked cashew is very rich and delicious while the arbor is light and spicy (be careful!) I also asked for soft corn tortillas with guacamole (instead of the chips) and they said they would have to charge extra for those. This seemed a little odd to me - it's a Mexican taqueria, why the extra charge of soft vs. fried corn tortillas? Also, the guacamole I thought lacked seasoning so I asked for extra lime. I also ended up adding some of the arbol salsa to the guacamole to enhance the flavor.Overall while I liked the ambience of the place and the service is good, the food I thought was lacking in seasoning and could benefit from a touch of salt / a hint of lime.",3,3,3,Akrati J.,"New York, NY",1373,211,712
5.0,3/24/2014,"A couple years later, and still great! I came here with 3 other people for dinner. We ate pretty light because we had just had afternoon tea at the Mandarin Oriental a couple of hours earlier. Excellent cocktails - I had the spicy cucumber margarita which was divine. I loved the jalapeno tincture and the cucumber puree. I opted to skip the St Germain (as I do not like my drinks too sweet), but my friend had it and loved it. So if you prefer a bit of sweetness in your cocktails, this is still a great pick. If not, just ask for no St Germain.For dinner, we ordered guacamole and the 7 salsas. They bring the salsas out in order of mild to spiciest. The last one - salsa habanera - is pretty darn spicy. The different between the 6th and 7th salsas is pretty huge. I thought that the salsa de arbol (6th) had a bit of heat, but really wasn't ""spicy"" per se. But that last salsa challenged even my capsaicin-loving tastebuds. I think the smoked cashew and tomatillo-chipotle (2nd and 5th) salsas were the crowd favorites.The tacos come 2-3 to an order and average $5-8 per taco for the most part, except the lobster which is understandably more expensive. We had the pork shoulder, duck confit, and lobster. The pork was pretty classic Mexican with pineapple alongside the pork. The duck confit had some spice to it as well, but the avocado puree helped cool that down. Our favorite was definitely the lobster. At $13/taco, it is pretty pricey, but if you can afford to splurge, it was delish.Service was quick and easy. Granted, we ordered pretty easy dishes, but we were in and out within an hour, which suited us fine because we wanted to watch part of a college basketball game before heading to Comedy Cellar.",0,0,0,Christine C.,"Manhattan, NY",105,184,8
1.0,3/24/2014,"I've been to Empellon Taqueria many times and really enjoyed the experienced. On Saturday night, I took a group of out-of-town foodie friends and I am sad to say that the experience was miserable.  The noise level was through the roof which is to be expected on a weekend. But, to make it worse, the place was so crowded, we were constantly jostled by people trying to get through the restaurant. Clearly, they need to take a table or two out of that front room to have better flow.  The waitress was not at all friendly, didn't write down the order so had to keep repeating it before she got it right and then was rushing us through the whole meal. We were never asked if we wanted dessert, or if we wanted more drinks (we did and had to find her to tell her) and the busboys were clearing plates and glasses faster than we could finish our food.  It actually became a bit of a joke because we had to literally swoop down and hold onto our glasses so they wouldn't take our drinks away from us before we were done.Although the food is consistently good and the margaritas are fabulous, I will not be coming back here again.",0,0,0,Anita B.,"Chicago, IL",76,1,0

On my way out, one waitress actually bowled me over to get past me. I don't like bright headache-inducing lights on a a restaurant, but I think Empellon goes a little too far with the mood lighting. At about 7:30, they turned the lights so far down we couldn't see our food (which is a silly thing to do with such good food on the able) and jacked the music up to an uncomfortable level. Dear Empellon, we get it. You are supercool and sceney. If you tone down the attitude a little, people will still come for the food and drinks. Knocking down your patrons isn't a great idea (even if they've already paid). And waiting till 9 before turning the lights off won't scare away your preferred clientele.

I've never ordered something here that I didn't like but the skirt steak tacos are something we get every single time we go, they are out of this world.

Their different flavored margaritas are always delicious, I've tried several (one with rose and hibiscus, one with pineapple and habanero, another with cucumber and something else spicy, all of them were delicious.) Both of the desserts they usually have available (chocolate flan with cinnamon ice cream and a passionfruit tart) are both exceptional and we always hve to order them no matter how full we are.The service is always friendly but unobtrusive.

3.0,3/1/2014,"An almost heavy rainy day mixed the mental agenda into deceiving my thinking that my lunch was booked on the restaurant's sister establishment on the East Village, which by the way only opens for dinner.  The problem was fixed by channeling my route to the doorsteps of the West Village, where I should have been showing twenty-five minutes earlier.  The modern, romantic French-y like sitting was almost vacant from diners when it was only approaching 1:00 PM on an early Friday afternoon.  It could have been the rain, I though, justifying the vacant place.  But, no; the interior, with its dark brown leveled tables and chairs, was pushing the envelop to a better evening dining, in a candle-lit ambience. Best of all, and despite taking advantage of each possible space for diners' hosting, almost everyone can enjoy a full view of the dining room.  The Restaurants Week's menu of the Taqueria--whose items were taken from the restaurant's lunch menu--was consisting of three appetizer choices, three taco selections with a serving of two per order, and two choices of desserts.  Doing the simple math to examine the worthiness of the $25 prix-fixe special, I realized the special offer was not special at all as nothing was discounted.  I actually paid less (only $25.04, tax included) when I went a la cart ordering only a guacamole (not included in the special menu) and three Brussels sprout soft tacos.  I made it sure to ask the friendly attentive hostess of whether both menus provided guests with the same portions, except from the two pieces of the taco selections on the special, and she just confirmed.  A regular order of a guacamole was served (for $8, and the size did fit the appetite of two people), revealing a strong personality.  Despite the pale green color, the creamy dip was having a limey finish that I absolutely appreciated.  The guacamole was still enjoyed when my tacos arrived--$10 for two pieces (considered as an appetizer), and $15 for three pieces (as an entrée).  The marriage of the smoky charred Brussels sprout of the tasty corn tacos was toned down by a bed of a settled hummus puree, which I believed had a dash of smashed refried beans.  And the combination was topped off with a crunch of split hazelnuts.  The plate served was a pleasure to the eye, and a satisfaction to the forever-appreciative appetite to Mexican cooking, even when it has a modern twist to it like the approach this creative restaurant possesses.My disappointment for the not-so-special ""special"" menu this establishment presented for the Restaurants Week was certainly compensated for by the delicious meal I had.  And as Chief Alex Stupak thinks,  ""Mexican cooking is Awesome,"" I walked away pleasantly as this ""awesomeness"" was enjoyed albeit the few bites I had.  (Review of Empellon Taqueria Lunch Visit on Friday, February 21st, 2014)P.S.

The food is over priced for what it is and to be honest, it doesn't taste any more amazing than Blockheads.2. It's called Appetizer and Main Course for a reason. My wife and I went her for Valentine's Day dinner. Ordered an appetizer and two mains. The appetizer was on the table for no more than 5 minutes when the server decided to bring out our main courses. I get that it's Valentine's Day in NYC, but for the price I'm paying, don't rush my meal and over crowd my small table.3. The drinks are small and over priced. $17 for a glass of chardonnay is a tad bit obscene.4. The check came and there was an extra charge on my bill for $21. When I mentioned it to the waitress she didn't even look at the bill and said she would remove it.

The house margarita was tart and refreshing. We were excited to try the octopus ceviche but the restaurant was out. We tried the smoked cashew ""salsa"" which was essentially cashew butter but certainly tasty. The house made tortilla chips were flavorful and crunchy though a little thick. The fried fish tacos were delicious but lacked the acid bite I long for in a taco; we ended up asking for limes. The flour tortillas were tender and chewy, very tasty. The fish was perfectly cooked. The price on the tacos was a tad high-$18 for generic white fish. We also had the refried beans and yucca fries. The beans, made out of black beans, tasted strongly of smoke and bacon, and lacked texture. The yucca was cooked well and nicely crispy but I was really wishing for a sauce to pair with it.

5.0,2/6/2014,"I've  said it before, I'll say it again and one thousand times over, I love Mexican food. Love. One of my most favorite places to go for some amazing drinks and delicious Mexican food is Empellón Taqueria in the West Village.You walk into a dimly lit room with high ceilings, but still gives off a warm environment. There's also another room in the back, I've dined in both before, and honestly, it doesn't matter which room you're in, the food will all taste just as good. There are contemporary twists to the decor with some classical Mexican influence.The drinks here are really great, and I'm a margarita aficionado. I got the Spicy Cucumber (Pueblo Viejo Blanco, St Germain, cucumber puree, jalapeño tincture, fresh lime, chile salt). It's a little bit sweet, a little bit spicy and a lot of amazing.To start off, I got some of their Guacamole. The chips are thick, salty and crunchy. The Guac is fresh and simple, just using basic, delicious ingredients. It's creamy, but has a great texture with the pieces of avocado, chopped raw onion and fresh jalapeño slices.Then, I got one of my favorite things, their Octopus (parsnip, pumpkin seeds, salsa papanteca). The octopus is sliced into little medallions, tender and flavorful with a bit of a sweet and spiciness from the salsa papanteca. Then, you have a great contrast in texture to compliment the octopus from the parsnip and pumpkin seeds for crunch.

Attentive, without being overbearing. Food - delicious. Started with the guacamole and 7 salsas, although we ended up finishing only 3.

The brussel sprouts tacos were delicious (good option for vegetarians) and I was pretty full with the appetizer portion. Dessert was incredible.

I was not a fan of the cashew salsa, it had a burnt taste to me but the pumpkin seed salsa was great. It was unlike any salsa I have ever had before. The guac was good too. For dinner, I shared 3 appetizer size tacos with a friend. We had the pork, chicken and fish tempura. The fish was a little over battered. The chicken had kale and cheese which was good.

The only truly bad/bland item I have ever had is the Kale/Chicken Taco (and I really love Kale, so that was a bummer) Anyway, when you buy the guacamole go for the ""all 7 salsas"" as it is only $3 more than getting just the two and therefore WELL worth the price. The lobster tacos are priced EXTREMELY high but I would be lying if I said they were not well worth it. Go for an ""appetizer"" portion (2 tacos).The service here is very good and they seem to have let go or minimized the presence of some pretty annoying employees who seemed to work there at the start. This is a great restaurant and a lot of care is given to the food. For less gut-bombiness ask for tortillas with the guac rather than the chips they come with. Or, if you want to go in the opposite direction, ask for the queso WITH chips, since the tortillas they come with (while traditional) do not do much for the consistency and add no crunch whatsoever as a counterpart to the gooey cheese.

3.0,11/14/2013,"I'm so confused. This is a very unconventional take on Mexican food. The salsa and the ceviche had pumpkin seeds in it. WHAT? I mean don't get me wrong I'm a fan of exotic salsas but roasted cashew? Its not a salsa anymore, let's just call it a dip.I suppose I had strong expectations of a solid Mexican food place, but, as per usual this is new wave New York food. Fish tacos I would recommend as well as the shishito queso fundito.

5.0,11/6/2013,"I've visited 4 times so far, twice for lunch, twice for dinner. I am officially obsessed.Tacos- My absolute favorite is the chicken taco, the ingredients have been switched up each time I came in but it is consistently amazing! MUST TRY the sweetbreads taco, it is incredible. Don't be afraid of it, just tastes like the best fried chicken you've ever had.Mushroom rounds out the top 3, it is to die for.Go for the fish tempura if you can handle spice. All are worth a try, love the scallop one too.Sikil pak is the best salsa hands down. Some were above my spiciness tolerance but the verde, and smoked cashew are safe and delicious.I personally love the brussel sprouts served whole with a soft boiled egg, good flavor a light addition to the meal. Also the beets are seasoned to perfection with some heat, also a great option.I've only tried the octopus ceviche, which was really tender.If you order a queso expect to be pretty full after, but definitely worth a try if you aren't concerned about that. The fresh tortillas are sooo good. We had the chorizo and it is hard to stop after one bite.Can't forget about drinks.

This past weekend, i went for dinner to try the tacos, which were not that impressive, especially for the price. The guac was not anything special, maybe underseasoned. The salsas were really good, but the chips were stale. We told our server and he promptly brought out another batch, which were also stale. I ordered the fish tacos, which weren't bad, but I like the ones at Cascabel Taqueria better. My bf ordered the brisket tacos which were good, but nothing to write home about. Needless to say, we skipped dessert and won't be returning. The place was packed..seems more like a trendy restaurant than one for foodies.

Not what you expect when you walk in a fancy place.Our experience: The two of us walked in, put our name down, and the hostess guy told us that a table would be available within 30 minutes.  We waited at the bar for 45minutes, seeing that a table next to the hostess staff had been free for a long time. Since that table was located just next to the hostess desk, in front of the entry, we thought that nobody was going to be seated there. We then asked again about our table, and the hostess guy told to wait for another 15 minutes. After 1 hour at the bar, and hearing other guests complaining, we asked again. Guess what: the hostess guy assigned us to the table next to him: it had been free for at least 40 minutes, was next to this unfriendly staff. We left. So I can't judge the food.

Then my friend that ordered the g & c had to leave so she asked for her check. The guy gave her a bill that said $25 on it so she paid with cash including some tip. About 15 minutes or so after she left the guy came back to me and said that he miscalculated my friend's bill and charged him $2 too little. I said that she already left and she asked for her own bill and it's not our fault that he miscalculated. I wasn't being cheap. It's just unacceptable that he was trying to make us cover for his own mistake. It's only 2 dollars. I said that she paid her bill and left and he shouldn't bother us with it and it's not our responsibility. He said he was sorry and told the girl bartender about it, who made a face. I thought we were done.In the mean time we had another friend join and he wanted to pay for everything at the end of the night and he knew about the ridiculous request from the bartender. Once we left he said that once he paid he saw on the bill that they did charge us for the difference of the friend who left earlier. They added her bill to ours and just deducted $25. It's just so crazy and unreasonable.They already asked if we were willing to cover for their mistake and we said we didn't want to, just because it's so unreasonable, and they still found a sneaky way to make us do it.

2.0,10/2/2013,"Don't believe the hype. You'd be better served by getting Mexican at your local joint for a fraction of the cost.The overall feel of Empellon is intriguing - swanky with dim lighting and an inviting bar, exactly what you'd expect in the West Village. However, looking just past the surface lies a limited menu, hit or miss service, and food that isn't that great. The selection of tacos is surprisingly slim for a Mexican restaurant, and I found myself debating which one I wanted, not because I was so intrigued by how they sounded, but because it felt like each contained at least one ingredient I was turned off by.  After finally selecting the lamb, my main course arrived with 3 disappointingly small bland tacos garnished with skimpy toppings of cucumber slices and odd-tasting cheese. As a generally hungry person, and for a whopping $21, I expected much more than the 10 bites I got.On the service side, the hosts were nothing short of rude, and made our entire group so uncomfortable we couldn't wait to leave. Beginning before the bill was dropped we were given stares saying ""hurry it up, what's taking you so long?"". Yes, there was a line to get in, but rather than politely asking us to be mindful of those waiting, we got the privilege of eyes looking on us, impatiently  and constantly checking in.  I'm always happy to respect a line, and understand the importance of moving along, but after making a reservation and being within an allowable time for a meal, I couldn't help but be turned off by the whole thing.Bottom line, Empellon is fine. The setting is great, the food is ok but overpriced, and with other hosts I'm sure the service is fine as well, I'm just not planning on coming back to find out",5,0,0,Andrew S.,"Manhattan, NY",142,90,2

1.0,9/10/2013,"The first time I went to Empellon (about a year ago) I thought it was pretty good food for a pretty ridiculous price. Two tiny tacos for $15? And yet...I was walking down 10th and decided that maybe I should give it a second try. The food was never bad, it was just a little overpriced. So I walked in. And this time it was the food that caused my outrage. I ordered the Ceviche with mangoes. And if I had never had ceviche before I'd never have it again after eating this. If you are a sea otter or for some other reason like raw candied plankton, go for it...even then, ew. It was mushy and sweet and totally disgusting. Now you might blame me for making such an order in the first place, and you're right, I've gotten used to trusting the chef to make bad-sounding things taste spectacular. We've all trained ourselves in this--it's what makes foodie-New York (or any place for that matter) so exciting. It's like a jackpot you can't imagine winning but usually do. Not so in this case.Undeterred, I asked for a different Ceviche. And it was just as bad. Inedible. The Beef tacos (HOW CAN YOU MESS THESE UP?) were grisly and small, like they were made from Jack and the Beanstock's sad, neglected cow. And the prices were outrageous. I paid $60 for two glasses of wine some ceviche and guacamole. UGH. Going here is a mistake you mourn for more than a day.I've been Yelp-delinquent for over a year.

3.0,7/15/2013,"On a rainy friday night this place was packed. My boyfriend made a reservation through his Amex concierge service but someone messed up and the reservation was put into their computer system for the following wednesday. Since his confirmation email had the correct information, I'd have to imagine it was an error on the restaurant's end. They told us they would work it out, and we were seated about 25 minutes later. We ordered drinks and were able to grab two seats at the bar; my strawberry margarita was delicious and I loved that they only salt half the rim! We ordered 2 apps: the short rib sopes and the queso fundido with shishito peppers. I love cheese so I loved the queso and the sopes were good but definitely a super small portion for the prices they charge. We split appetizer portions of 3 different tacos: the fish, steak and lamb barbacoa. The steak tacos were stuffed with quite a bit of steak (surprising after seeing how little short rib was on the sopes) and topped with a spicy crema. I loved them. The fish tacos were a little too filled with cabbage and radish for me, but the fish was perfectly crisp and delicious. The lamb barbacoa, while my least favorite, were still quite tasty and a nice change from the usual taco offerings. I'm a little confused as to why they use such large plates for such small servings of food. We had a problem fitting the plates on the table and ended up having to stack plates. When the check came, we noticed that they hadn't charged us for the drinks that the bartender said she would transfer to our table. We notified our waiter when he took the credit card and someone (i'm guessing the manager though he didn't introduce himself as such) came over and told us the drinks would be on him. When our waiter brought back the credit card slip, he added the drinks on. We were confused but obviously wouldn't say anything. While the food was pretty good, I don't know that I would rush back here.

2.0,6/7/2013,"Our group of 4 came here on a Monday night and it was nice and crowded. We went to the back room which is nicely decorated (feels like El Paso), but which isn't terribly spacious (you'll clip other people's chairs/bags/jackets as you get up to go to the bathroom). The service overall was friendly if a bit slow. We started with the guac and all 7 salsas, which was great, except you do have to ask for more chips, because they don't give you a ton relative to the number of salsas. Although to be fair, the quantity of each salsa is fairly small too - the size of those metal ketchup cups you often see when you get a burger and fries at a bar. Still, it's fine when you have 7 of them. We also had the chicharrones, which were puffy and crunchy, but waaaay too salty and a little too slick feeling (but then again, that's probably just the nature of chicharrones). They came with a wonderful tiny cup of refried black beans topped with one of the spicy salsas, which I liked so much I got the $5 side dish of them, which fortunately was a rice bowl sized affair. I tried the shortrib pastrami tacos, which were okay, but definitely too salty and not tender enough (or hot enough) for me. I've had better rib meat in Chinese restaurants and Katz's and from my own crock pot. The fish taco I tried was pretty good though - they use a deep fried batter, which wasn't super crispy and didn't have any particular taste, but the fish was very fresh, not at all stale-fish tasting (which is why I usually avoid fish entrees). I also tried the mushroom and spinach queso fundido, which was terrific - but then it's hard to get melted cheese wrong. The server said this would be pretty filling, and I suppose it would be if you ate the whole thing, but the portion that we got seemed more like it would be a good side dish (which is what it was for our table). I also tried the milk chocolate flan with cinnamon ice cream - the ice cream was fantastic, tasted and felt like it was made in house (not very smooth or creamy, more like a sorbet - but fruity and cinnomony and just refreshing and delicious!). The flan, however, was served in a clear round glass bowl that looked like a fancy bouquet vase, and consisted of a very thin scrape of milk chocolate pudding-type stuff on the bottom of the bowl, with what appeared to be finely ground graham cracker dust on top. Pretty disappointing, even if it tasted fine. You could only really get it with the tines of a fork and taste it - no big mouthfuls or anything. Still, the ice cream was very memorable.

3.0,5/29/2013,"I came here tonight for dinner. Like others, I thought the food was pretty good however the food was a bit pricey. We ordered the guacamole ($12) and the octopus civiche to start off with. The guacamole was satisfactory but for $12 the portion was not very big and also I was not a big fan of their chips. We did not enjoy the octopus civiche which was very salty and was unlike any other civiche I have ever eaten. It was more like a salad.After having our starters, we decided to share the steakskirt tacos ($14) and the sweetbread tacos ($18) -- both appetizer portions which consists of two tacos. I've had better steakskirt tacos elsewhere at half the price. The sweetbread tacos were seasoned really well however I didn't think it was worth the price.As for drinks, I had the Por Que No and the Yuzu Margarita. The Yuzu is really good while the Por Que No had a spicy kick to it.The food and service was good but after spending $140 for two I don't think I will be returning.

3.0,5/23/2013,"Short review: It's good, but holy god is it expensive for what it is.Long review: Drinks: House margarita has a bit too much bite, but the reposado margarita was perfect. They only salt half of the rim, which I thought was weird. As someone who likes a little salt with each sip, I found myself lacking by the end of the drink. Furthermore, they are way too small for 13/14 a pop.Food: The guacamole is awesome. Absolutely a must get. There is a perfect amount of spicy kick and just the right pinch of salt. The cashew salsa that accompanies it is also unique and delicious. Our table ordered several tacos and shared them all. We split the lobster, pastrami, shrimp, and fish tacos. In my opinion the pastrami was the best closely followed by the lobster. Strangely enough, what put the pastrami over the edge into excellence was the grainy mustard topping. The shrimp and the fish tacos were just alright and I probably wouldn't order them again. The service was friendly and prompt. I feel like the only thing holding Empellon back from 4 stars is the price. The tacos themselves are not very large, and several of the taco entrees run $20+. I've had comparable tacos at several other places in the city, for much much cheaper. Bottom line: It's good, but the wow factor isn't there to make up for the cost.",0,0,0,Nicholas M.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",83,121,15
3.0,5/22/2013,"I won't complain about the food, atmosphere or service.  My biggest gripe (and it's a decisive factor in me returning) is the price.  Granted, this is the West Village, but the portions are more like appetizers and they charge you an entree price.  For example, the short rib tacos were $14 (appetizer) and $21 (entree).  The only difference was the app came with 2 small tacos and the entree came with one additional taco.  Though they were very good, I don't think the portion size should've commanded those prices.  Don't come here with an appetite or you'll leave just as hungry.  Strong margaritas at $12 a pop also.",1,1,1,Matt A.,"Brooklyn, NY",93,218,16

My mom had fish tacos and my aunt chose the skirt steak and everyone was extremely pleased. Drinks were also amazing.

5.0,4/18/2013,"When you think of places to go for a guys night out, you're pretty much limited to two types of places: divey, burger joints or steakhouses.  While each of those categories has its merits, sometimes you want something better than a burger without having to go to a stuffy steakhouse that is going to set you back $200/pp and leave you in a food coma.  Sometimes you want a place where you and your buddies can have some delicious food and quality drinks in the presence of a cool, good looking crowd.  And when you're looking for that, you should look no farther than Empellon Taqueria.  Everything about this place is spot-on, from the amazing guacamole & salsas to the queso fundidos to the tacos (both the lobster & short rib pastrami being the highlights of the latter category for me).  The drinks, particularly their ""Por Que No"", are incredibly good & potent, a perfect way to kick off a night out.  And the service and attention to detail are indicative of Alex Stupak and his team's pedigree--no request is refused and whether it's your first time or 100th (as it probably is for me at this point), you're treated like a regular.  I cannot more highly endorse this place.",0,0,0,Eric Z.,"New York, NY",0,1,0
4.0,4/15/2013,"My favorite friend and I got a terrific Travelzoo Deal for lunch here. We were pleasantly surprised at both the charming ambience and the food. Presentation was glorious on the roasted beet salad - and it was even better tasting. This app. consisted of beautiful small pieces of freshly roasted red and orange beets, splashed with bits of crema and micro greens. The chef here obviously knows the value of presenting ultra-fresh ingredients. The squash salad was delicious even though I would not have expected to like it chilled. The skirt steak was tender and had that succulent grilled flavor - really delicious. The house made tortillas are a delight. I had a tempura fish ""taco' (like a fresh crepe, not the crunchy kind) with a nice kick. I usually do not like the idea of eating battered fish in a tortilla - yet it was tasty and the crunch factor comforting.We shared the chocolate flan for dessert. I feel that it is misnamed. It tasted more like a fabulous dense, creamy pot de crème...and the H.M. cinnamon ice cream on top had a perfect creamy consistency and delicate taste. This otherwise fab dessert was slightly marred by a ""Streusel"" topping- which was basically a crunchy, almost sand like brown sugar...total overkill...we scraped it off as best we could to savor the creaminess of the divine flan. The margaritas pack a punch, though I would like to see small lime wedges in them. And I so wish that they offered fresh fruit margaritas...not just a mango-habanera and a smoked banana - for, while intriguing...I want the fruity sweetness of a passion or mango margarita without the heat. But this little gem with excellent, friendly service, is a special retreat in the Village and we both look forward to return visits.

I've been to the Cocina for a birthday party when they first opened, another expensive meal, $100 per person, so I figured we were talking the same ball park. I had a brunch reservation on Saturday to meet my sis and I arrived a bit early. The place was jumpin, it's pretty small with a hip west village vibe. I sat at the bar to wait and perused the drink menu to order a cocktail. The bartender, Liza,  was not a fan of me at first, for some reason I seem to produce ire in girls upon first meeting? but she ended up being lovely. Maybe I seem uber high maintenance? ME???!! naw   : ) I decided to go with the Rooster's Claw, habanero pueblo viejo reposada and mango. Now I was a bit hesitant because of the mango, mes no like sweet, but it was fabulous!! Super spicy with just a tiny hint of sweetness. More than a few of these and I can sense a Hangover 3 trailer developing. When my sis finally arrived we sat down to eat. Everything on the brunch menu sounded delish and we went with the guacamole with two sauces to start, excellente, scrambled egg fundido for sis, and lamb barbacoa tacos for me. The fundido is served in a cast iron skillet and it's basically scrambled eggs with roasted potatoes and chorizo..triple yum. The lamb barbacoa tacos were fabulous but here's where my gripe comes in. They serve you 2 street size tacos, no sides, and charge you $14. That's $7 a small taco!! where in any self respecting part of Mexico is that OK? Hey, I'm a Cali girl and I can throw down with the best of chicanas and this is no bueno. Brunch for 2 was $90 before tip. That's like a months salary in most parts of Mexico.

We find it extremely unpleasant. Anyway, Empellon Taqueria, from the outside, was a cosy looking respite from cold and wet Saturday but after about 5 minutes at the bar we were ready to go back out in the relative quiet of NYC traffic and rain thanks to the ridiculously loud music. If the hostess hadn't giving us a table when she did, we would have missed out on some great food though. We shared 3 appetizer size plates which consisted of a Lamb Barbacoa that was exceptionally moist and tasty and just the right amount of spice, while the pork cheek pibil, with pickled red onion and a salsa habañera though too spicy for me, my partner thought it was very good. The Braised Bacon Tacos with lettuce and lime mayonnaise was also very good. The minimal, way overpriced wine menu was best avoided so we washed it down with a delicious homemade red sangria that was particularly good.

4.0,2/15/2013,"Order: Chicken tacos, pork tacos, seven salsas, guacamole and the 'por que no?' to drinkThis is a great place to go for an upscale Mexican dinner. Now, when I say Mexican, I mean Mexican with a twist. Between growing up in the Southwest, living in San Diego for four years and my many trips into El Mèxico, I've consumed a lot of real, authentic Mexican food. Authentic Mexican occupies a sizable space in my heart, but I still have room for great, modern interpretations of the original cuisine. That being said, I really do like this place. We've brought a number of people here, and you always seem to have a good time. Need to know what to order?? If it's your first time, order the following1. The 'por que no?'. This cocktail is amazing ... if you like pineapple, cilantro and a bit of spice! 2. The guac. This is some tasty guac ... just order it.3. The seven salsas. Now, you might look at the menu and say 'why would I order 7 salsas when my guacamole already comes with 2'? Well, because the salsas are very small and they have so many different types of salsa (seven, to be exact) that it would be a true shame not to try them all and decide on your favorites. Plus, this is fun for a group - everyone has their favorite. Mine: Salsa de arbol. 4. If you're a group of two, split the chicken and the pork tacos. Those are my two favorite items on the menu, and that way you can share in the deliciousness and pick your favorite for next time. 5. If you're wondering about dessert, I can't help you.

I liked their guacamole-it was quite filling!  My boo really liked the chicharrones-he was pretty impressed with how they were made differently from other spots.  I got the cheese omelette tacos which were good, but I liked my boo's eggs & steak a lot better, as well as our friend's scrambled egg fundido (and how they were on cute mini skillets!).  Ah, well...next time!But yes, their food was great, and I liked their tortillas.  The server was also very friendly and quick with refilling our waters.  He also gave great recommendations!",2,0,0,Lili K.,"Manhattan, NY",287,2515,159

4.0,1/22/2013,"Two of us had the 7 different salsa and guacamole.  It was off the chain!  :-)  The Habanera salsa is very spicy but had great flavor.  I also loved the smoked cashew salsa.  Plenty of food for the two of us to share but we got for the Octopus Ceviche which was delicious.  My friend had the fish tempera tacos (3) and I had the Skirt Steak tacos (2).  They were both good but I loved the steak tacos with a bit of Habanera salsa on it.  The balance was perfect.  My friend's margaritas were strong and good.  I liked the taste of the Yucca in it, definitely not something I have ever had in the past.The ambiance was right.  I liked how the restaurant flowed and the lighting was perfect.  We sat at a two top table in the window, the middle table of the three.  I appreciated the view outside the window since its always nice to people watch in the Village but the table was a bit 'long'.  I felt like my friend was too far away to have a private conversation.  While I realize its hard to balance a big enough table for food with intimate dining, I think they should maybe invest is smaller tables up front so that my two neighbors werent 'all up in my b'ness'.The staff was very professional and knowledgable of the menu.  When we did have her attention it was undivided.  It did seem like they were quite busy (Monday night dinner) so at the end when we were looking to pay we couldn't get her attention.  We also got the wrong bill and I had to track her down to get the right one.  These are very minor in the grand scheme of the evening.I will definitely be going back as I felt the food, atmosphere and service was great.",0,0,0,Laura D.,"Brooklyn, NY",10,12,3
5.0,1/21/2013,"I am always nervous trying a new Mexican place in NYC because they are typically  disappointing.  Empellon will not disappoint you.  Start off with a Rooster's Claw margarita - the habanero gives it plenty of kick but does not overwhelm the other flavors. We tried the salsa verde to start.  It was pretty good overall, although I thought it could use a little more spice.  The green chorizo queso fundido was our favorite appetizer.  The cheese was melted nicely and the green chorizo gives it a great flavor.The skirt steak tacos were also fantastic.  The meat was very tender and the mojo de ajo sauce complimented the meat well.  The fish tempura tacos were pretty good, but not as good as the steak.  I thought the lime mayo on the fish tacos was really good, but the dish could either use more of the mayo or more lime flavor in the mayo.The service was also flawless start to finish.  Our server explained the dishes to us and made sure we were taken care of the entire time.",0,0,0,Matt M.,"Manhattan, NY",62,322,18
4.0,1/18/2013,"I came here for a Restaurant Week lunch, and really enjoyed the experience! The food is light, but if you are willing to pay a bunch to get a lot of small dishes, it'll fill you up.The service was incredibly friendly- my server was willing to explain most of the dishes for me, so that I could figure out which one I most wanted to eat, as they all looked so good!My appetizer was an octopus ceviche, which I found incredibly delicious- a great mix of sweet and savory. I saw a complaint about it on here but I think that was a problem with expectations- after asking the server about the sauce on the octopus, I knew what I was getting into. The only thing I wasn't expecting was how big it was- octopus is pretty heavy, and I couldn't finish it knowing I still had tacos and dessert ahead of me.When you're done with your appetizer, it is whisked away and they start cooking your tacos, which took about 2 minutes to be finished. I had the fish tacos and they were excellent- definitely spicy, but in a great way that mixed with the not-over-battered tacos. There's nothing super fancy about these tacos, but they are made with very fresh, high-quality ingredients, and that's what I'd really want from a taco rather than a crazy mix of flavors. That said, I think if it hadn't been for Restaurant week, I wouldn't have come here, since even the very best taco doesn't feel like it's worth that much money.The dessert was excellent, a flan with a mix of flavors- caramel, chocolate, cinnamon ice cream, and a brown-sugar type thing on top. Amazing, and I wish I'd been hungrier when I came!The price tag is a bit more than I really want to pay, but for a light lunch prix-fixe I'd come again.",0,0,0,Michelle B.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,20,0

By chance our table received some ""free"" brussel sprouts that we didn't order but were pretty good. The tortillas here are better than any other place and so is the salsa. It isn't your typical salsa which I happened to like. Guacamole came with two of them; the cashew and the arbol. Both were delish but I loved the cashew one the best. We all were putting it on everything we ordered! An interesting item on the menu is the Black Trumpet Mushrooms and Guaje Seeds Queso Fundido. Definitely topped everything, especially with the salsa and guac added to it! The mackerel ceviche was incredibly fresh and unique. I ordered the fish tacos based on all the yelp reviews and don't get me wrong they were really really good but not the best i've had. I understand they were fried but it was a little tooooo fried for me. Really greasy. But other than that it was great and everyone else liked their tacos as well.

Most unusual was the cashew, favorite was the chipotle, so hot it might kill you the habanero.  Highly recommend trying the green chorizo (put some on a chip with salsa - yum!) and the sweet plantain sope.We decided to share some of the tacos so we could try a couple, which was a good idea.  I had the skirt steak tacos (2 total), which I loved, and then split the short rib taco with my friend (1 each).

The hummus was also really great, but what really made the dish for me was the actual tacos themselves - they were fantastic. Soft, chewy and warm - totally hit the spot and their mild taste/texture played well with the flavors of the filling. But, just to warn you, its not a lot of food.

4.0,7/31/2012,"To be honest, I didn't come to Empellon with the highest expectations. High-end taco restaurant in the west village? Pastry chef doing tacos in new york, a city much maligned for its mexican food? Could you blame me for being just a little bit skeptical despite the critical praise heaped. But....Empellon delivered.  Having eaten incredible fish tacos in LA (at ricky's) less than a month before, Empellon's fish tacos came about as close to them as possible.  crispy, fried, flaky fish. crunchy cabbage. lime mayo. homemade tortilla. The only difference comes in price--an entree-size portion of 3 tacos is $18 (you can also get 2 for $12).  Sure you can get them for less than $3 each back in LA, but Empellon at least does a damn good job in bringing the flavors that seem to get lost on the way east. Also, let me not forget about the guacamole, which come with chips and 2 salsas. Actually, let me rephrase that...let me not forget the smoked cashew salsa that comes with the guac, chips and chile arbol salsa.  While all were good, it's the smoked cashew salsa that I found myself gravitating to the most. It was unlike any other salsa I'd ever tasted--from the vibrant yellow color to the creamy yet smoky flavor, I was dipping more chips into that. And it's merely an accompaniment that you get with the guacamole.  Finally, this being a place whose chef was the former pastry chef at WD-50, we tried the chocolate flan with cocoa streusel and cinnamon ice cream. This was not some avant-garde blip of sweetness, but rather a smart, comforting combination of textures and flavors, which capped this meal perfectly. About the only thing that bothered me was the overbearing service--our server seemed to hover and rush us at every stage of our meal. However, Empellon has now given me a little faith that a high-end taco place can actually be good.",2,1,1,Eric K.,"New York, NY",62,159,26
5.0,7/29/2012,"Alright this place is crazy good. Seriously, there's no other words in the english language to describe the food and drinks here besides ""crazy good"". We went here last night and basically did a huge tasting of the menu. 5 people allows for a real exploration of what the kitchen can actually put together and I was impressed by pretty much everything. We started with guacamole. Lemme tell you about guacamole. I love it. I know good guac and I tend to think that I make really good guac. These guys blew me away with how simple yet delicious the guac was. So good in fact, that we had to place a second order because the first just didn't last all that long (that's what she said?). The appetizers were equally awesome. I'm a fan of Queso Fundido and why should I be? It's cheese with some other stuff added to make it ""food"" instead of just ""melty cheese"". Well we got two orders. One with shrimp and the other with chiles. Both were fantastic and the tortillas they served with it were warm and tasted homemade. There was also an order of quail egg sopes as well as meatball sopes. Didn't really fall in love with either but that's alright. No one bats 1.000. Alright so I've told you about the appetizers and the guac and to be honest, you should be fine with this review as it is but fuck that...the tacos were incredible. I know tacos. I live in Austin, TX the home of tacos. These were incredible tacos. I split an order of fish tacos and an order of lobster tacos with the others at the table. Both were phenomenal. Though if I had to choose I'd have just gotten the lobster tacos and been super stoked on those. My only real complaint is that the music in the restaurant was pretty loud and affected conversations at the table. That's not a big deal though so don't let that reflect on the overall dining experience. I'd recommend this place to anyone. It's pretty pricey but that's NYC for you. $40 for three tacos is crazy by Texas standards but in NYC it's pretty much the going rate.",2,0,0,Matthew R.,"Colts Neck, NJ",15,72,1
5.0,7/18/2012,"Scenario:You've been stuck in a car for 16 hours. Driving from Florida to New York in one night is not really your ideal situation. And naturally you've gotten into a huge scuffle with your mate over the radio station - for 12 of those grueling hours you'd had to listen to Alice Cooper screaming and you're about ready to punch a small child...not your child though, some one else's.In any event, you take the wheel and drive straight to the West Village because 1) you're sick of grimy metal music and 2) you're feeling like having a classy lunch and 3) you need Mexican food...stat.So you park...somehow, and you drag that person you just spent too much time with into Empellon. You're seated in a brightly lit back booth. Mirrors abound and nifty decorations lend gaiety to your otherwise bleak mood. You just stare at each other. Nick, your waiter shows up at your table. You can ask him questions. Because unlike every other waiter in New York, Nick cares, and has eaten the food at his establishment. He's probably an aspiring actor, but when your primary food source is salsa, you won't have to spend hours at the gym sweating off fries. And you want chips - so you order chips and guacamole. Nick recommends the salsas that come with the chips, but your skeptical that the salsas listed as accompanying the guacamole is really any good...deals usually involve the least popular items. But Nick explains that the arbol is actually amazing - it's slightly sweet, pureed and creamy, something unlike any salsa you've experienced.Your fish tacos come with a fat piece of battered fish...but there is no gap between the batter and the flakey, moist white fish. Nick recommends the chipotle salsa for your fish tacos. You oblige and wham! You've just eaten something so magical that you no longer want to ""shoot a Russian Unicorn"" or anything vulgar like that.And after a great meal, you and your companion, partner, love, whatever, hold hands and walk out smiling. If listening to Alice Cooper for 12 hours is what it takes to eat, breathe and live Empellon, then it's worth it.

My fellow crackhead friends, never having dined at Empellon, respond to this line with glazed stares and crazed itching all over their bodies. My friends are such cards.Anyhow, the chips, salsa, and guacamole here easily rank amongst the best I've ever had. The salsas are extremely innovative(protip, go for the arbol) and each one has a unique taste. The smoked cashew has a delicate, subtle flavor that is unlike anything I've ever had on a chip. The tomatillo chipotle was so smoky that I accidentally called a meeting of local Native American tribesmen. The salsa verde was the weakest of the group.Now, on to the tacos.The fish taco is badass. You receive a nice, thick piece of fish with a delightful lime mayo.The skirt steak taco is good, but it isn't as good as the fish taco.I have to give props to Nick. He is an excellent waiter and seems legitimately invested in the food here. He's really friendly and took the experience to the next level.

4.0,7/2/2012,"I think it may actually be a crime to call this place a ""taqueria."" The space is chic and classy, the food totally modern and inspired, and the entire vibe just very trendy. A typical taqueria for me evokes images of a dingy bodega with a small counter dishing out greasy, hot tacos mostly for takeout... not a beautiful restaurant like this. But, I would be very happy if every taqueria I've come across actually resembled Empellon.Empellon has a few different tacos on their menu, but being I was there for brunch and there were just so many other things on the menu, I chose to forgo the tacos. Maybe next time! As for the food I did order, the scrambled eggs and green chile hash, I very much loved. The seemingly simple dish had the perfect balance of richness from the soft-scrambled eggs, spice from the green chiles and garnish of raw jalapenos, and a slight crisp from the fingerling potatoes. A sprinkle of cotija cheese and cilantro rounded out the dish beautifully. Every single bite was like a party in my mouth, and I was pleasantly surprised by how satisfying the small portion actually was - because the flavors were truly that bold. The bf ordered the red chile braised short rib torta with guacamole, onions and salsa roja which he also enjoyed. Again this was nothing like your average greasy gut-bomb of a torta, it was really refined and quite dainty, sandwiched between a fluffy round brioche bun. We also tried one of their multitude of salsas, the tomatillo-chipotle, served with thick, freshly fried tortilla chips. I was amazed at how smokey and thick the pureed salsa was; I wonder how they get it to be so damn creamy...Empellon really is something special. I think Chef Alex Stupak deserves all the attention he's gotten for his recent restaurant ventures, as long as he keeps creating wonderful food like this.

Surprisingly, they don't play any latin music either. Cocktails are unique. I'm usualy not a cocktail person, but their unique/deifferent cocktails attracted me so much. A cocktail ""Por que no?"" was soooo good. It's tequila with pinnapple juice and cilantro in it. It's refreshing, and I loved the smell and herby taste of cilantro. The naming is cute, too. Another one I tried was tequila with mango juice and habanero. Wow, it was spaicy and nicely combined with sweetness and spiciness. I enjoyed them so much. Guacamole came with two kinds of sauce: chili and something creamy which I didn't like. Guacamole was just Guacamole. Nothing special was in it, but with pretty plates. Cheese with shishito peppers are ok. Again, nothing special: it's just Mexican cheese with shishito peppers.Overall, I enjoyed this place, but I just prefer an authentic Mexican cuisine, which I'm used to.

Way too greedy/heavy. Three appetizer size taco dishes (2 a piece) which were all quite good. - Fish tempura- Lamb barbocoa- Some sort of fancy mushroomsThe service was off all night. Drinks came out ten minutes behind our first appetizers, subsequent courses would be served when there was no room on the table and we weren't done with the previous course (or two), and a cocktail that was purchased for us by another table was brought out when we hadn't even started the one in front of us already.

4.0,6/4/2012,"If you're looking for delicious designer tacos in an upscale setting, then Empellón will surely meet your needs. Chef Alex Stupak calls his place a ""taqueria"", but it doesn't look like any taqueria I've been to. Make no mistake that this is a pretty fancy translation of street food, and it is on the pricey side, but, hey, the flavors are bold, unexpected and pretty darn satisfying all things considered. I found the place online when I was trying to figure out what the most acclaimed new restaurants were in New York that opened this past year. This one landed in New York Magazine's Top 10, and the added bonus is that it's open until midnight. Why was that important? Well, Jamie W. and I were watching a lot of shows when we were in town.I made an 11:30PM reservation (yes, 11:30PM...hey, it's the city that doesn't sleep) because we were seeing ""Once"" on Broadway that Saturday evening. We were already buoyed by a great show by the time we got to the West Village. We arrived really early, like ten minutes before eleven, and heard the beat-heavy club music coming out of the speakers. We got nervous that this was going to be one of those dark trendy clubs masquerading as a restaurant. The hostess turned out to be quite cordial and seated us right away next to the front window. The place was roughly 3/4 full, so it wasn't too overwhelming from a volume perspective. The menu was extremely enticing, and we were starving since we had not eaten since the early afternoon.Luckily even before we ordered, we received a ""box"" of tortilla chips that tasted baked rather than fried (a big plus from my vantage point) and four different dipping sauces - a salsa made Veracruz-style with roasted tomatoes, olives and capers; a smoky green tomatillo version; a buttery-tasting one made of mashed pumpkin seeds and cashews (my favorite); and a super-hot salsa made of arbol chiles which the waiter hid next to the condiments to avoid us overindulging in it (see photo). Delicious flavors all around. We then went right into two appetizers - both quite adventurous in execution but a bit mixed on results. The first was the $14 Octopus with Parsnip and Salsa Papanteca, which was made of pumpkin seeds with chipotle and arbol chiles (see photo).The octopus was fresh, but the marinade was almost too overpowering to enjoy the creation fully. The second appetizer was the $13 Roasted Beets with Sorrel and Sikil Pak marinaded with orange juice, a nicely refreshing contrast to all the spicy flavors we had so far (see photo). Once we were finished, we were served a complimentary amuse-bouche, a trio of sopes, lightly fried, filled with the Veracruz salsa and topped with a poached quail egg (see photo). A nice treat even if we were feeling guilty over the decadence of the fried masa. And finally the tacos arrived. When you order them as appetizers, they come in pairs (...you get three with a dinner order), and of course, they always look smaller than you expect for the price. The more modest is the $14 Lamb Barbacoa with Salsa Borracha made of orange juice, mezcal, and pasilla Oaxaquena (see photo).They were so good, steamed for hours apparently with a nice sweet finish that balanced the smoky flavor of the lamb. Now hold onto your pants, but we also ordered the $26 - yes, $26 Secreto de Iberico with Pineapple and Salsa Pastor made of serrano, bacon, roasted tomato - which was a fancied-up version of carnitas that was ridiculously good (see photo). Yes, that would be $13 per taco, and they were devoured in about two minutes flat. Was it worth the price? Jamie would be shaking his head, spendthrift that he is, but I have to say the pork was prepared so beautifully that the price slipped my mind. We were too full for dessert, which was ironic since Stupak is known for his artful desserts. But alas, something needs to wait for the next visit. Seriously, does this sound like a taqueria you've been to?FOOD - 4 stars...really stellar tacos, some excessive marinades and oh yes, the ka-ching factorAMBIANCE - 4 stars...dark...clubby...hip...and not really a taqueriaSERVICE - 4 stars...attentive though a bit hard to hear amid the musicTOTAL - 4 stars...worth trying if you can get over the price point",8,2,7,Ed U.,"San Francisco, CA",4521,4629,37977

2.0,5/26/2012,"Nothing at Empellon Taqueria tasted particularly bad. My problem with the place is that you can immediately tell that the chef has no deep knowledge of Mexican cooking. I dare say that most of the dishes barely tasted like Mexican food. We started with the guacamole and salsas, which were particularly disappointing. The cashew salsa didn't seem to go with tortilla chips at all. It tasted more like something you'd get in a halal cart. The other salsas were bland and excessively creamy. Where the hell did this guy get taught to make salsa like that? We also had the queso fundido, the fish tacos, and the lamb tacos. Again, it all tasted fine, but not Mexican.

From start to finish we were treated like VIP guests. The manager even sent out a round of Tequila for everyone on the house. Our waitress Coco was excellent and recommended what may be my new favorite cocktail in the West Village - The Ernesto. A must try for any Mezcal fan (there are over 30 Mezcals and 40 Tequilas available at Empellon). The combination of smokiness paired with sweet tangerine is perfect. The energy here is fun and vibrant. Everyone in the place seems to be enjoying themselves as well as the tasty food. Right away they brought out chips and guac with 2 accompanying salsas for the table. The smoked cashew and the arbol salsas were just as good with the guac as they were alone. The menu at Empellon works very well for a group as everything can be easily shared. We started with the short rib sopes and the roasted beets with pumpkin seeds. Both of which were tasty but small, definitely appetizer portions. The next dish, and perhaps everyone's favorite was the Queso Fundido with porcini mushrooms. The gooey cheese and mushrooms come in a pot with tortillas on the side to make into a cheesy taco like dish. Here is a fun fact for you: The tortillas at Empellon are an adaption of Resler's (Alex Stupak's wife - and also a Chef) grandmother's recipe. Empellon goes through about 9,000 of them a week. The tacos are great. We ordered the lobster, fish, chicken and the hen of woods mushroom (prob my favorite - I must have been in a shroom mood), all of which were great and perfect for sharing. The sweet plantains are out of this world!!! For dessert they brought out chocolate flan with a candle and everyone started singing Happy Birthday. They also brought out Bunuelos with Cajeta and warm honey, which are like sugary donuts. Both were delicious, but I always prefer anything with chocolate.

Margaritas are clearly not from mix and I like the spiciness level.The decor is really lacking.  If I didn't know I walked in from West Village might think I was in the burbs circa 1997.  Even the signage outside is so un-cool, the font is straight out of Sizzler.  Music is way too loud for a straight up restaurant versus bar/rest and really whoeever is making the playlist needs to be regulated.  Usually I can block these things out, but it's that pervasively bad.  I think if the menu could just be transported to a different space that was more intimate and relaxed it could be a great restaurant. The prices and quality of the ingredients say 'nice place' the decor and ambiance are too similar to Diablo Royale across the street and I don't think that's the vibe they're going for?",0,0,1,Talia R.,"New York, NY",49,510,0
2.0,5/4/2012,"We went with a KGB deal and were very disappointed.Food was OK, but we got a total of 8 chips with our order of nachos.  (And there were no chips in a basket on the side!  At $10, that is $1.25 per chip!)What really bothered me, though, was that for the $16 coupon they added $5 of tax and a $10 tip!  Now, even if we'd paid full price for everything, it would have been less than $46 (because they wouldn't let us have flavored margaritas, so I assume plain margaritas cost less), but they charged us a mandatory 20% tip on the made-up price and they charged us sales tax on the made-up price.  It was really unseemly.",0,2,0,Alisa R.,"Manhattan, NY",102,87,0

5.0,4/28/2012,"I rarely review anything on Yelp but this place was so good I have to say something. We sat at the bar, which, not having tried dining at a table, I think might be the better choice, and ordered the beets, the scallop ceviche, the lamb tacos, the steak tacos and the chocolate flan. The scallop ceviche was to die for. If I were sentenced to only eat that one dish for every meal the rest of my life, I would die happy. It comes with this foam and cream and some kind of magic Mexican-food fairy dust or something. The golden beets were also incredible. There was cream, sorrel and an all-around surprising deliciousness. I think they could remove the oranges and it would be just as tasty.The tacos were really good too, as was the dessert, but I really think our starters were the stars on the menu. Our cocktails (mezcal margarita and a negroni with mezcal) were just okay but after reading the other reviews, I think we could probably order better next time. As some other reviewers mentioned, it can  be a pricy meal, but I thought it was worth it, especially since I felt very full when I left. It was so good that last night I was joking I wanted to go back again tonight. I am looking forward to trying his new EV place!",0,0,2,Laura S.,"New York, NY",16,8,0

We ordered the lamb barbacoa tacos which were very savory and the sweetbreads tacos which were interesting yet still very good. (a little on the salty side and tasted like soft 'chicharrones'). The octopus appetizer dish was very flavorful and one of my favorites. I would recommend that they work on the presentation for this dish as it tastes way better than it looks. It was served on a small bowl which resembled a bowl of bar peanuts. It is a pricey place (for mexican), but you're really paying for originality and the upscale decor.

4.0,4/13/2012,"Came here for dinner on a Wednesday night with a few girlfriends. Lovely atmosphere- dimly lit and spacious enough considering the area. Contemporary decor but nothing overly stated. First we sat at the bar and had a few drinks- like many reviewers I highly recommend the Por Que No. Very interesting take on a cocktail, spicy and full of unique flavors. The margaritas were also excellent as was the rooster claw cocktail. As for the meal- amazing. You can absolutely tell this is the former pastry chef of wd-50 behind this meal. Everything is savory and packed with pockets of deliciousness. The guac was great- nothing exceptional but the chips were really delicious and salty that came with it. The creamy sauces on the side were also really unique. The sopas as appetizer (black bean and quail egg and the plantains) were exceptional. I would say the quail egg sopa was my favorite part of the entire meal- completely genius. We shared the chicken, lamb wit pickles, and steak tacos as the main meal. The taco shell was so perfect- warm and a little fluffy,something I had never seen before. The chicken and steak tacos were mouth watering- meats were moist and the flavoring was perfect. I will be coming back again and am eager to try the cocina.",3,0,1,Rachel T.,"New York, NY",4,113,1
3.0,4/8/2012,"Empellon was ""fine.""  A lot of mixed feelings, as expectations were set seriously high by the buzz on food blogs and in NY Times over the fiesty Alex Stupak's new mexican spot in the West Village.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing either - and it's certainly pricey enough to set expectations for an amazing experience.Saturday night is poppin', as one would expect, around 9:30.  We were able to snag a reservation for 10, so killed time at the bar tasting margaritas.  The Rooster's Claw is SPICY - made with habanero peppers, it's impossible to tone it down, and it's a super-strong spicy aftertaste. A good mango flavor, though, that's thick and reminiscent of Indian mango lassi.  I also tried the Por Que No - which I preferred.  Made with serrano peppers and cilantro, it's a lot lighter and still has the spicy kick I was looking for.  The bartender was a little surly, though, which I didn't like - especially when we're ordering $15 cocktails, thankyouverymuch.Guac was ok, but a little too thin.  Instead of salsa, served with 2 creamy sauces, which was kind of strange.  The hearts of palm salad was good - pretty straightfoward.  The Sopas are a mix between bruschetta and sliders - little funnel-cake like crusts topped with meatballs or short ribs.  The short rib ones were delish, with crunchy red onions, but the meatball ones lacked flavor.  Tacos - scallop and skirt steak.  I liked these best - the skirt steak tacos were topped with an awesome garlic crema and carmelized onions.  Definitely a must-order as a staple of the meal.  The scallop tacos were interesting, with a spicy raisin sauce, which I liked.Service was pretty lackluster - didn't know the answer to various questions we had about the menu, a little slow, not too friendly.  We had a good time, it's a cool scene - lively and bustling, and the decor is nice.  Overall, it's decent, but just too pricey for what it delivers.",2,0,0,Emily R.,"Manhattan, NY",452,361,4

It was busy but not as crazy as I expected. We started with cocktails at the bar as we waited for the rest of our party and for our table to be ready (probably sat 20 mins after reservation time - not terrible for a Sat night). The bartender was fantastic. We weren't familiar with a lot of the ingredients on their extensive cocktail menu. We told him what we like (fruity drinks for me, scotch/whiskey, spicy drinks for my fiancé) and he brought us 2 phenomenal cocktails.  La Gitana and Roosters Claw were my favorites.Service was friendly and helpful. For our group of 4 we shared everything. We ordered chips and guacamole (guacamole and salsas were great), the hearts of palm salad, shisto pepper queso fundido (awesome, plus we did a side of red chorizo which we also put in the tortillas), short ribs sopa (must have), and 3 kinds of tacos. The steak and lobster tacos were both incredible. Lamb barbacoa was good but didn't stand out as much as the other two. Finished with the flan for dessert which had a delicious caramel topping.

Fish presentation was a little odd... it looks like a big, fried, fish log... but the taste was very good. Bartender was just okay.

1.0,3/1/2012,"It's taken me a while to getting around to writing this. To be quite honest, I wasn't even going to bother. But after thinking it over some, I thought it was best to do so, if only to save some unsuspecting prospective customer from receiving the same treatment I did. This was back in December. A friend and I dropped by this place early in the evening, unaware that it was a ""scene."" The maitre'd - very young, fashionably husky, with beard and glasses - immediately amped up the 'tude when we told him we didn't have a reservation. Almost as if we were drooling bridge and tunnel party crashers at some exclusive cocktail party during fashion week. We would've left immediately (im way past my days of tolerating imperious ""door people"" just to gain entre into whatever hotbed of glamour they are the gatekeepers of) but his partner at the podium said there was a table available. Fashion-husky boy grunted and walked us over to it but not before telling us we had ""one hour!"" to eat and be gone. Fine. We're fast eaters. One thing really threw me though. As he was laying the menus down on our table I asked him where the bathroom was. His back immediately stiffened and he turned to me and shot back ""when I'm DONE seating you, I will tell you where the bathroom is!"" No joke. A very nice busboy in back of me then stepped in and pointed to where it was. ?????Anyway. The place was packed. Our polite waitress was completely overwhelmed. And scared. That's when I noticed all of the staff looked scared - the waiters, the busboys, the bartenders. Then it really hit me. This was one of those establishments that fosters an atmosphere of terror in order to get their people to perform. As a former bartender/restaurant manager/waiter, I know this type of place very well. I worked at a couple of them. It's a tone that starts from the top - usually from a very irascible, tempestuous manager-type (gee, I wonder who that could be in this case?) who feels out of their depth so they overcompensate by treating their underlings like crap. Ugh. The food was fine I suppose. And though I spend on average a couple of hundred dollars when I go out to eat, the food here didn't seem worth it. The tacos were OK. The salsa was a bit thin and watery. Drinks were good. Though throughout, husky fashion boy kept walking by our table and shooting us dirty looks. I guess to remind us to be mindful of the time. The problem was, the service was SLOW due to how crowded it got. By the time we asked for our check the maitre'd was seeing red. Literally. As we scooted out as fast as we could, he gave us an extra scowl and said something under his breath.Granted there are two sides to every story. So feel free to take this with a grain of salt. But as a former restaurant worker I always go out of my way to be polite, overtip (much to many people's chagrin) and be deferential to any request made by the management/waitstaff.

2.0,2/24/2012,"Finally stopped in last week after begging my boyfriend for months to take me here ( he was highly adverse to paying $9+ for a 6"" taco) but, I guess he was feeling in a good mood and took me on a Thursday night.  We walked in, and I saw what great ambience the restaurant had, and as we sat at the bar, what an impressive drink menu...so many tequilas!  After a quick wait we were sat at a table, to start we ordered some guacamole, it was good, just plain guacamole, just like the kind I make fresh at home. It comes with two salsa, one of which is cashew, now I am familiar with experimenting with cashews (I made quite a delicious cheesecake during Christmas time using soaked and ground cashews in lieu of cheese) but for me, the salsa didn't work.  It tasted odd and the other one I also wasn't totally impressed with.  Moving along we had the sopas which were nice, again I was not amazed, and then the tuna, which was fine, the tuna came in 4 completely nonuniform pieces, not conducive to sharing, and again was fine. Then we had the tacos, 2 of each, a scallop, mushroom, and steak.  The steak was the best, which I suppose it should've been.  The others were just fine, they had those weird salsas on them I'm pretty sure.  The waitress talked us into a Yucca side dish and then never brought it out.  So, all in all, I feel like I'm being harsh.  If it wasn't so over hyped and expensive I probably would have liked it, but I was only disappointed.",1,0,1,Mary K.

It's a cozy restaurant with dim lighting and a cool mural on the bar side of the wall, and margaritas... They had me!Once we were seated, I asked our waitress what she recommended or what's most popular on the menu. She didn't answer my question but rather explained each section of the menu. Perhaps the entries below will explain why...2 stars for the salad and app. 4 stars for the guacamole:I don't know if i was more disappointed when i left from ""Ha ha habanara?.... Melt down"" or the price of the check being that I didn't care for the food. It wasn't like I found a hair or a spider in my food- I die! House Margarita - slightly tart, watery, not smooth and not tempted for round two. For $12 a pop, I think not. The guac: simply delish- slightly chunky. The chips: the thick ones. I could make a meal of this and I basically did. My friend got the red and green chorizo with tortillas and she offered a bite so I willfully scooped a small spoonful on to my tortilla. Being no stranger to spicy food (or wine),  I had no fear. Well, I must have gotten a habanero or some type of super hot something because it was so spicy that my throat was getting scratchy, I kept coughing, my eyes were watering and couldn't talk for ten minutes. I basically had to eat more chips and guac to soften or comfort what I was dealing with because the water wasn't helping and the margarita was long gone. My friends looked at me with their eyes bugged out and offered me more of their food when the water wasn't helping.I also ordered the salad with watercress, pineapple and apple. That didn't work out so well either. I had forgotten what additional ingredients were in the salad and couldn't decipher what I was eating (mayonnaise, dressing, cheese?) so I just stopped all together.

4.0,2/5/2012,"Empellon has steadily made waves upon its recent arrival to the dining scene, offering its take on this lovely oxymoron: an upscale taqueria.  Those who know me know I have an obsession with tacos, so having Empellon near the top of my to-visit list was inevitable.It turned out to be quite a convivial scene.  Upon entry, there's a boisterous bar area on one side, a long communal table down the center, and smaller tables on the other side.  There is a smaller, somewhat quieter dining area in the back.  But make no mistake, the atmosphere is lively, seating tight, and noise level (music + chatter) makes this a poor option for an intimate conversation.  Service was friendly and very good.Many options for drinks, with a well-priced wine list and plenty by the glass, a very extensive tequila and mezcal list offered by the 1.5, 2, and 9 oz volumes, margaritas priced by your choice of tequila, tempting house cocktail selection, and a smaller draft and bottled beers list.  My companion and I took the cocktail route, starting off with a Por Que No and Rooster's Claw, the two with hot peppers in the ingredients, and I was pleasantly surprised to find them fantastic, well-blended, delicious, and packing real heat.  Follow-up cocktails later in the dinner (La Colibri and El Burro) were very good also.The one-page food menu is broadly divided into small seafood and vegetable sections, queso and sopes sections, and the largest, the taco section with 10 choices, conveniently available as appetizer (two) or main (three).  Perfect for sharing.  Table snacks include guacamole, raw oysters, chicharrones, and salsa with chips.  A multitude of sides complete the offerings.The food met expectations, taking casual Mexican fare and elevating it via presentation, accompaniments, and execution, although not always exceeding the pleasure of a well-made original.  Guacamole was competently flavored, with excellent earthy salsas; I prefer a chunkier texture and more heat.  Our first course of scallop ceviche, however, blew us away.  It may be the best ceviche I ever had.  Perfect, tender scallops with a bit of chopped pistachio, a spritz of bright yuzu, on top of what seemed to be creme fraiche, creamy and sour, made such a perfect flavor and textural combination.  The smoked plantains with creme sopes were sweet, soft, and creamy on a crusty base.From the taco menu, we selected three as appetizers to share.  The beer braised tongue was the best.  Fish tempura (the only fish on offer) was very well fried with a crisp, light panko crust but not meaty enough; could not like it more considering my personal bias for grilled fish tacos rather than Baja style.  Skirt steak was least impressive but still tender and flavorful.  Can't say I loved the taco tortillas; to me a bit dry and stiff.Surprisingly, the last arrival made as much of a hit as the first, the green chorizo.  Looking like a small bowl of ground meat, we initially thought it was a condiment for the tacos (by this time, hearing our waitress describe the dishes was getting challenging).  The chorizo had an incredibly earthy, tangy, rich flavor that is hard to describe but impossible to forget.Somehow, we made room for dessert, sharing a moist tres leches cake with refreshing goat's milk ice cream and creamy banana pieces.Empellon impressed overall with its warm and festive ambience, superb cocktails, and good food.  While I felt the food did not always succeed, it was always interesting and where it was best, it was fantastic (i.e., scallop ceviche, green chorizo).  I will certainly be back soon.  Reservations highly recommended.",4,0,1,Valery C.,"Forest Hills, NY",56,837,9616
2.0,2/4/2012,"I was expecting something brilliant from this sheik and clean lined space.  We were able to be seated fairly immediately (at around 9:30 when we walked in).  The service was very fast, which was great because the place was starting to get too packed with people visiting the bar, lots of bumping of chairs and tables the way they had the place set up.  Don't go here for dinner too late as you won't be able to hear the other person and will be really annoyed by the bumping from bar-goers.  The guacamole was incredible, probably among the better guacs i've had in a while.  I'm a guacamole purist so I don't like tomato or red onion.  This was good guac!  We also ordered the quail egg and bean appetizer and the beef tongue tacos (which were incredibly dry).  We were pretty disappointed in the end.",2,0,0,Ash C.,"New York, NY",72,301,6

With the guac and salsa appetizer, the two salsas we picked were the habanera hot sauce and the smoked cashew, both delicious as well.We were seated all the way in the back near the kitchen which was less noisy than the front and more roomier also.  Walking through the front I felt a bit cramped and was immediately glad we were seated in the back.Great place, would absolutely come again!",0,0,0,Sheila C.,"Manhattan, NY",144,215,45
3.0,1/31/2012,"I expected a bit more from Empellon. The setting is nice, the service is adequate and food is good -- but not amazing. We tried 3 different tacos: scallop, beef tongue and sweetbreads. I will say that the beef tongue was really delicious. The other 2 were decent as well, but we found the tortillas to be a bit dry across the board. Tasty overall, but none of them totally blew me away. If I'm going to pay $9 for a taco, it better do just that.The cocktail menu isn't bad, but I felt like 90% of the drinks were: 1 part tequila, 1 part fruit, 1 part spicy pepper. It's a winning formula, but a little more variety would have been nice.Would I go back if some friends wanted to check it out? Absolutely.

4.0,1/30/2012,"The extra star is because I'm really looking fwd to Empellon's new restaurant, billed as an interpretive twist on Mexican cuisine. My friend and I tried a few dishes from said new restaurant and liked the concepts. For instance, I sampled a fish taco.. sounds pretty straightfwd no? Well, according to the chef, former pastry chef at WD 50, the taco shell was made of ground fish. The ceviche filling was topped w plantain cream, caviar, and herbs. The taco shell was outstanding that it threatened to over-power the entire dish, but it was still one ore the more creative ideas I've tasted recently. We also had a very fondida-esque dish w mushrooms; i'm slightly lactose intolerant so I liked this dish less.. but it was hearty.

The restaurant was just as beautiful and service just as impeccable as I remembered. I brought along my same friend as last time and we were happy to see the restaurant was bumpin' on Saturday night. We both enjoyed their inventive cocktails--La Gitana, Sangre de Bruja [yummy witch's blood!] & Rooster's Claw...they're just as good as you'd expect by their price! The best part of the occasion was meeting [cutie] Chef Alex himself! He was very friendly, seemed genuinely interested in our opinions and down to earth. He served us four dishes and came out and described each one.  Each dish was delicious and creative in flavor and texture....something to look forward to at the Cocina! My last tidbit: I didn't realize before that Empellon really draws the 40+ crowd. Not that that's a bad thing, I just didn't notice the first time I went. As a result, they were completely packed by 8pm on Saturday and it looked like it was tough to catch the attention of the bartender....but that's a good thing [for Empellon], right?",0,0,0,G F.,"Portland, OR",66,91,16

The recent positive reviews seemed tainted seeing as these guests were brought in special by the chef. Nonetheless, I'm happy to report that Empellon did not disappoint. My three friends and I had a diverse range of foods and all of us enjoyed them all. In particular the lamb tacos and the (pork) tongue tacos were killer. The salsas, including the famed roasted cashew, were great. Our server forgot an app of ours and without our complaint comped it. Service can only help a place, and we were pleased with ours.

4.0,1/20/2012,"Apparently I'm not the only one David invited to taste some of the new dishes for Empellon Cocina, which is Alex Stupak's soon-to-be new restaurant. And here I thought I was special...although I did much enjoy having the opportunity to taste and comment on the new dishes, and have them introduced to me by Chef Alex; it made me feel like I was a judge on Top Chef, my ultimate dream job (and lets face it, I totally eat more than Padma does!).My courses were as follows:Clam Gordita. This was great! I especially loved the crispy shell and the contrast of the cool, crunchy cabbage against the softer clam and insides. I would probably order it again if I came into the new restaurant.Stuffed avocado salad - I loved the smoky orange sauce, whatever it was. This dish was very filling and was solid, and definitely required the knife and fork it came with to eat. Not the most exciting thing I ate that night, but definitely good.Tortilla soup - I think this was our favorite of the new courses. Sometimes I think chefs send out soups where they actually pour the broth at the table just to seem fancy and sophisticated, but this time it definitely made sense to keep the crunchy tortilla strips from getting soggy. If anything I wanted more cilantro because those bites were so good (and anyone who knows how I eat soups knows that I like to construct the perfect bite, with a little of everything, every time). We also really liked the chilis in it, gave it a nice kick.In addition to all this, they also comped us a pair of the lobster tacos (maybe because they delivered the courses we had ordered at the same time as one of the tasting courses?). So, I guess my only complaint is that the waitress didn't really do an adequate job of preparing us for how many courses we were getting to taste, because in addition to all this, we had ordered a queso fundido, plantain sopes (THE BEST THING EVER! ORDER THIS!!!!!), AND two pairs of tacos (beef tongue and lamb barbacoa), so I was literally stuffed to the brim. My fiance and I managed to finish one lobster taco between the two of us and then bagged the remaining five to take home. Full disclosure, although I expected them not to be, the tacos were absolutely delicious the next day as leftovers. Who'd have thunk they would have held up so well? Just goes to show I guess!I really would have preferred to write this review on the new restaurant's Yelp site but seeing as it doesn't exist, I have updated my 4-star rating to...4 stars. :o) Totally deserved though.

5.0,1/14/2012,"Empellon.  What can I say?  Mexican food in the USA is tacos, gauc, pico de gallo, and sour cream.  Mexican food at Empellon is actual Mexican food, which is delicious.  I almost want to be mad at Mexico for keeping all these flavors secret.  Chips and guac are delicious.  I'm not saying to skip them, cuz you shouldn't, but you would be sad with the remainder of your life if you didn't get the chicharron.  Effing amazing.  Crispy, hot and steamy.  And GINORMOUS.  Trust me.  HOWEVER, the chips and quac comes with cashew salsa which is legitimately one of the most delicious things I'v ever tasted.  It's like crack with chilis in it.I know nothing about what a sope is, but I know that next time I see them in Mexico I will get them.  The short rib was the best (when is short rib not the best).  I'm not one for oysters, but they serve them with their sangrita.  Oh.  Sh*t.  That's all I'll say about that.If it's more than two of you get more than two queso fundidos.  It's almost a DIY taco, but that makes it sounds not as yummy as it is.  A crock of bubbly, melty cheese with toppings that you scoop into hot tortillas.  My server told me that the pots the tortillas come in were made especially for this restaurant.  That has no bearing on how delicious the food is, I just thought it was interesting.For the tacos, I seriously recommend all of them.  If I had to chose I would go scallop, followed by sweetbreads, followed by mushroom.  But they are seriously all very, VERY good.  Stupak and Co. do good work.  The flavors blend so well, which is something I'm use to in American Mexican restaurants.  I honestly didn't know it could be this good.Decor, music, drinks, all top notch.  When it gets busy in there it can be a little tight, but I personally love that about New York restaurants.  I don't mind a butt in my face.  Totally recommend Empellon.  I hear they're opening up a second, finer-dining location on the east side soon.  That makes me very, Very, VERY excited.",1,0,1,Kai M.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,2,1
5.0,1/12/2012,"If you're a follower of my reviews, then you know I've visited Empellon before. While I did enjoy myself, I was excited to hear changes were made to both the menu and the ambiance of the restaurant.Who knew rearranging tables could make such a difference? Seriously. Making more space amongst the tables kept me from eating on top of the ladies next to me, and it allowed for a more romantic date night.We started with the Nantucket Bay Scallop Ceviche with Pistachios and Yuzu,and boy was it a treat. I can still taste the creaminess of the yuzu and the crunch of the pistachios. I never would have paired these ingredients together, but I'm glad Alex Stupak did. The dish was interesting and extremely fresh.Next up were the Hearts of Palm with Smoked Sunchoke, Lettuces, and Almendrado Dressing. I could eat this dish every day for the rest of my life. I loved the varying textures and the smokiness of the almendrado dressing. Almost like a chipotle mayo but with pieces of almond, it didn't overpower the sunchokes and hearts of palm. Jake and I took turns eating bites of each appetizer until both were completely gone. I think it's safe to say they were pretty delicious.The Queso Fundido with Shishito Peppers was so playful. It's the perfect appetizer for a group of four. We opted for the peppers rather than red and green chorizo since we ordered pretty meaty tacos. I almost would have liked chips to dip in the queso, but the tortillas were light and a nice change of pace.The Shortribs with Salsa Roja were a little messy but oh-so-juicy and delicious. The presentation was adorable -- like a piece of bite size joy you pop in your mouth. It's just enough to get a taste of the delectable short rib without filling up. It literally was the juiciest thing I've ever eaten, and the meat went well with the texture of the rest of the bite.The minute I saw Beer Braised Tongue with Potatoes and Arbol Chile Salsa (pumpkin seeds, sesame, arbol) were on the menu I knew I had to order them. I've never had tongue before, but these tacos made me an instant fan. So soft and supple, I could have eaten the tongue all by itself. I'm glad we also ordered the Lamb Barbacoa with Salsa Borracha (orange juice, mezcal, pasilla Oaxaquena) because they turned out to be Jake's favorite. I'm normally not a pickle fan, but it added a nice crunchiness that I would have otherwise missed. The acidity the pickles brought to the taco was just the perfect touch.Thanks to its new menu and atmosphere, I will definitely be returning to Empellon again and again -- and you should, too.",2,0,0,Victoria P.,"Astoria, NY",25,57,0

The first dish was a fish taco. The taco shell was made out of cod, which was a great concept and you could really taste the cod when just munching on the shell. The cod was mixed with masa and then fried into the traditional taco shape. The ceviche filling had great flavor, and was topped with cream and caviar and went well with the taco shell. Overall the dish was balanced.The second dish was a queso fundido with hen of woods mushrooms, peppers, and a Mexican broccoli-esque vegetable was excellent as well. The queso was a little bit salty by itself but with the tortilla, I couldn't detect the extra saltiness. Overall both dishes tasted like they would be hits.Also tried their Empellon Manhattan and it was a very strong drink, but it went down easily.

5.0,1/10/2012,"Like several other yelpers, I was contacted by one of the operating partners, David to re-visit the restaurant and provide feedback on some of the dishes.  The first dish that my party got to try were the tostadas.  One of my dining companions whom rarely eats seafood but declared that it was delicious and that the shrimp were cooked and prepared perfectly.  I think that the chef said that there was sea urchin in the tostada and since sea urchin is one of my favorite things to eat, I wish that there were more sea urchin flavor in the dish.  We were also a little unsure of how to eat the dish - one of my friends ate it by hand kind of like a sandwich/flatbread while I tried to eat it with a knife and fork, but when trying to eat it with a knife and fork it was hard to assemble a perfect bite with a little bit of everything.The second dish that we got to taste were kind of like make your own tacos with super thinly sliced pork with habanero sauce.  We found the dish to be a little confusing to eat -  we were given a mountain of tortillas so we thought there should be a one to one ratio of pork to tortilla, but when we asked Chef Stupak later, he said that the optimal amount of pork should be several slice of pork to one tortilla.  The habanero sauce was a great match with the pork though and made the dish fatty and delicious.  Maybe it was because we didn't realize that there should be multiple slices of pork for each tortilla, but without the presence of the habanero, I couldn't taste the pork over that of the tortilla.  The dish reminded me of a mexican riff on the momofuku pork buns.  The third dish that we got to try was the chorizo and corn masa dish and was my favorite of the three.  The dish made me think of (in a good way!) of a gourmet hot dog.  I can't remember what the sauce at the bottom of the plate was, but whatever it was, it was very good.I have to say it made me feel warm and fuzzy knowing that someone actually reads these reviews and even better that my opinion might actually kind of matter.  Cheers to Empellon and continued success to them going forward!  Restaurants are about the experiences that we have when we are there.  When a restaurant makes the extra effort  to not only serve delicious food, but also treats diners like friends, you must rate the restaurant as you do your closest friends, with five stars.",0,0,0,Stephen T.,"Manhattan, NY",33,21,0

You can almost taste the effort going into it. And after reading some of the Yelp reviews, its obvious management is constantly striving to do better. You can have a meal here and be satisfied, but you're not going to be thinking about how great the food was when you leave.

I'd been twice when it first opened in the summer and thought the items I tried were hit or miss. Just went back on a Friday night and the first thing that I noticed is that the place was full and definitely had a buzz about that wasn't there in its early days. Drinks have always been spot on here and that hasn't changed--awesome  and interesting cocktail selection. We got to taste items that the chef is trying out for the new restaurant opening on the east side and they were fantastic--great presentation, complex flavors that work and give you Mexican but in ways that you don't usually see. Excited to head there when the doors open.We revisited the tacos--long interesting selection--hedgehog mushroom tacos were delicious. The chicken wasn't as exciting but then again chicken rarely is.We tried two desserts--my husband loved one (chocolate flan) and I loved the other (tangerine-lime tart) but we both devoured both.Each time I've been the menu including cocktails is slightly different--I like that they are constantly reinventing and staying fresh. My suggestion is that the more exotic or interesting the dish sounds, go for it because that's the chef's strength and you won't be disappointed.

4.0,1/6/2012,"I have to give props to Empellon's ownership for truly caring about what its customers say/think about their experiences.One of the owners, David, read my previous Yelp review and messaged me with an invitation to do a tasting of potential menu items for their new sister restaurant opening in March/Feb in the East Village (at the old Counter location, and they are keeping the sexy circle bar which is good news.)  For some reason, I decided to not maximize this opportunity by inviting two of my knucklehead buddies instead of impressing a hot date...but hey, I'm a good friend.They set us up with one of their prime tables and Alex, the head chef, came out and introduced the 3 dishes he was making for us:  1 - The fried clam gordita was well received by all.  If I saw this on the menu, I never would've ordered it because I'm not a fan of clam...but it turned out to be delicious.  The presentation (perched up inside the folded napkin) was a nice touch.  The gordita shell held together nicely, and didn't leave any grease on our fingers.2 - The avocado salad with dates was good...I enjoyed it, but felt a ""pop"" was missing that their other dishes had.  Perhaps the dressing could be amped up to provide a little something extra...3 - The chicken tortilla soup was a homerun, and the biggest hit of the night. The chicken chunks and slender pork rinds were well-seasoned and the broth (which the servers pour from individual teapots) had a nice kick to it.  I could see this being one of their most talked about dishes.  Also, the dessert donuts (which you can get at Empellon now) were decadent.  The honey/orange dipping sauce I almost wanted to drink out of the glass.  Final comment: both times I've been to Empellon, its been clear that the staff really knows the menu, above and beyond what's typical.  For example, when I ordered the Riazul tequila, the waitress brought over a complimentary Sangrita which you sip with the tequila to enhance the flavor/experience...birthing a new ritual for me when I order tequila.  Again, kudos to the ownership of Empellon to reaching out to its customers.  I will be an early patron of their new sister location once it opens in the East Village.",6,0,2,Dominick Q.,"Manhattan, NY",611,194,39
2.0,1/5/2012,"WAY overpriced and NOT GOOD. you could literally get better mexican food at any other mexican place. we got the chips and guac to start which comes with two ""salsas"" which are more like flavored pastes rather than something you want to continue dipping your chips into. the guac was ok, not the best, not the worst. Then we shared the chicken and fish tacos. The chicken were way too salty almost to an inedible point. And the fish tacos were a bit bland. Aaand there was no tasty salsa to add on top to help with flavor. We got a side of plantains which were good but not anything out of the ordinary. The margaritas were ok slash probably the least favorite marg ive had in a while. I had another drink with guava paste after that and it was kindof bitter slash OK but had barely any alcohol.. Eh. I wouldnt waste my money here again. total bill was 85$ for guac, two appetizer tacos (4ea) , a side of plantains and 3 drinks. srsly??!",0,0,0,Arielle A.,"New York, NY",2,53,0
5.0,1/3/2012,"I went back to Empellon and I liked it even more than the first time. I am French [meaning: ""I believe I know food""] and I have to say that I didn't think much of Mexican food... Until Empellon. We had the tacos with the sweetbreads and Maitake mushrooms and the ones with scallops. For both, the taste and the texture make them incredible: the sweet and spicy raisin puree, the soft scallop, the creamy cauliflower or the crunchy mushrooms and the savory sweetbreads. The combination is well balanced and very enjoyable.We also had the privilege to try some new creations for the new restaurant that will open in East village pretty soon. I added photos for those interested :)The avocado salad is amazing, with several grains that I didn't know but loved, as they added a crunchy fun to the avocado and its chipotle salsa. It was very pleasant to be surprised and try something I had never seen before. The tortilla soup was very good as well. The broth is fulfilling and on the spicy side. Good chicken and tortillas (of course) with a cute presentation.We also tried a sort of arepa (don't remember how it is called) but it was a warm little pocket of joy with a crunchy/creamy filling. Believe it or not, we still had room for desert.. We tried the chocolate flan and the tres leches both exquisite. I see people complaining about the price in their review and I agree that a night there isn't cheap but it isn't any food. Each plate is carefully prepared and each recipe has been originally created. In the end, I think the experience really is worth it if you like food. Enjoy!",0,0,0,Clem F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,14
2.0,1/1/2012,"I'm sad to say I didn't like this place at all.  I had the guac, which was totally average. I was excited to try an item on the menu that was described as pumpkin with cheese, but you literally had to scrape the cheese out of it's little serving pot.  I actually had to hold the pot while my friend fought to get the cheese out!  I will give the tacos a thumbs up, but seriously... $20 dollars for three little tacos? The real winner here was the smoked cashew salsa and wish they sold it in bottles. The bottom line is this: if you want Mexican, you can certainly find a better/cheaper joint.  If you want to go to a ""trendy"" place, have a cocktail (I have a feeling they probably have good tequila drinks) and eat chips and cashew salsa, Emellon is all you.",0,0,0,Marie L.,"Long Island City, NY",0,67,9

My friend and I also split the ceviche of octopus and the short rib sope.  Skip the sope and definitely have the octopus ceviche.  Octopus with Parsnip and Salsa Papanteca (pumpkin seeds, chipotle, arbol); Shortribs with Salsa Roja (roasted tomato, chipotle, guajillo).  The sopes come 3 to an order.  Then for our tacos we split the appetizer portion (2 each)Fish Tempura with Cabbage and Lime Mayonnaise (THESE ARE A 5 STAR DISH ALL BY THEMSELVES, definitely get these tacos.)Hazelnut Fed Pork Loin with Braised Pinenuts (Portion of pork was too much for the taco and with the pinenuts a little too sweet overall)Sweetbreads with Roasted Maitake Mushrooms and Tlatonile (sesame, ancho, arbol) (These were way too Salty, which lead to a little disappointing end of the meal).

4.0,12/19/2011,"I'd rather give Empellon 3.5, but it's leaning more towards 4 stars because those damn tacos were so good!We went as a group of 3 on Saturday night. It was loud and buzzy, but we were seated in the back (west) room, so it was a little less loud and buzzy. Definitely a fun atmosphere for a Saturday night. Dark, but visible, and nice decor. The service was really polite, pretty attentive, and oddly enthusiastic at times, as if they were trying out for a play audition. But it's better to be over than under when it comes to service, so I was ok with it. They swapped out the plates between appie's and entrees, and everyone we encountered said ""thank you"" as we walked out.To drink, I had the Casanova (because I love mezcal and I love that it's popping up more frequently now), and the plain margarita. Both were good, but not exceptional.To start, we had chips with 3 salsas: cashew, smoked habanera, and tomatillo-chipotle. The habanera had really great flavor, but was pretty effing spicy. The chipotle was medium-hot, just right for me. The cashew was really interesting, and cooled down my tongue after the habanera. It's noteworthy the salsas are not chunky at all, and come with little spoons in them, which is how salsa is served in Mexico.Next, we got the queso fundido (skillet cheese) with chorizo. This is a completely indulgent dish for only the most serious gormandizers. Naturally, we loved it.For our main course, my boyfriend got a main course (3 tacos) of the tongue, and said they were very good. I split 3 appetizer courses (2 tacos) of the fish tempura, lamb barbacoa, and skirt steak with my brother. Our parents would be proud that we successfully learned how to share. The fish tempura was fantastic, with the lime mayo, and light crispy batter. The lamb barbacoa was good too, albeit a little too saucy. The skirt steak was great, and was probably my favorite.At the end of our decadent meal, we had absolutely no room for dessert, since we are a savory bunch and not really sweet-tooth's (sweet-teeth?).

2.0,12/15/2011,"Made a reservation for 2 at 6:45 for a Wednesday night.  We were seated right away... in a small two top right in the busy aisle.  Not sure if there are many 2 people tables in the restaurant but we were seating in a crappy location.The place is loud.  Loud music.  Loud conversation.  Don't bring a blind date or a first date or someone you're trying to talk to.The waiter was nice... he made some recommendations and explained things as he took our order, which included a beer and a cocktail off the menu... then failed to bring our drinks until I reminded him at least 10 plus minutes later.  Then he took another 5+ minutes before he came over to inform us the beer I ordered had to be re-tapped.  Finally the drinks came.  Felt like about 20 minutes after we ordered. Food We ordered:Guacamole With Chips And Two Salsas smoked cashew and arbol*The GUAC was *below* average.  Seriously, I make better guacamole.  The salsas, however,  were great.Octopus With Parsnip And Salsa Papanteca pumpkin seeds, chipotle, arbol*Probably the best thing we ate.  Really nice flavors and textures.Hearts Of Palm with smoked sunchoke, lettuces, and almendrado dressing*Second best thing.  Very nice.Queso Fundido - Matsutake Mushrooms with guaje seeds*A slimy, greasy mess.  The cheese was disgusting and the mushrooms were just greasy.  Very disappointing.Lobster with field corn and epazote*very good.  Lobster was cooked well... had several nice sized chunks per taco... and the field corn and epazote were an interesting addition to the taco.  Were they worth $14 a piece?  ABSOLUTELY not, but they were at least pretty decent.And for dessert:  Chocolate Flan with caramel, cocoa-masa streusel and cinnamon ice cream*Interesting texture to the flan.  To me it seemed more like a very thick cream, or thick custard... not light and fluffy like a flan.  I guess it was a take on a flan.  But the flavor was good.  The Cinnamon ice cream was hands down some of the very best ice cream I've ever eaten.  I would kill for the recipe.And some kind of pumpkin tart which was weird.  The pumpkin was very pasty.  I didn't really love it.  OVERALL, the meal was not a total disappointment, but very pricey for what it was, with a wait staff that was overbearing and inappropriate during some moments (""What's wrong... you don't like it??"" was one thing he asked us as we were lingering over one of the courses), and just taking way too long with important things such as bringing us drinks.  And my alltime biggest complaint, when they ask you, ""Do you need change?"" when you're paying the bill.  WTF is that?  How about you bring me the change, and wait until I finish my business, and settle the tip and then you see what you get out of me?   The music is very loud...

2.0,12/10/2011,"Empellon certainly has a nice location & atmosphere. The crowd on a Wednesday night was certainly attractive and most certainly employed -- you have to be if you're going to be able to pay for a plate of mediocre tacos that cost $18.I had dinner w/ my 2 former roommates on this particular evening. We started w/ the guacamole that came w/ arbol & smoked cashew salsas. The guacamole was good, but it's hard to butcher guacamole. The salsas were average, even though our waiter insisted that these were the two most popular salsas, particularly the smoked cashew, which I actually found to be the more inferior of the two. In any case, it was a good start.We opted to get three taco dishes, each containing three tacos, so we could try one of each. We settled on the skirt steak, lamb barbacoa & beer-braised tongue, despite our waiter trying to get us to order the seafood tacos because he claimed they were the most flavorful. Since we were focused on eating meat that night and his salsa recos didn't seem to give him much credibility, we stuck w/ our meat choices.The verdict -- fairly bland. The mixture of flavors within each of the tacos was certainly interesting, but it was tough to actually taste the flavors. They weren't coming out too well. I love tacos. They're probably my favorite Mexican food. One of my favorite stands is the East Village outpost of the Tacos Morelos truck, and I've hit the LA & San Diego taco scene, so I have a pretty good idea of what a good taco is. These tacos were certainly subpar, especially when taco platters range from $18-$42 (if you get the lobster).We bypassed dessert. However, it is worth noting that when we checked out the dessert menu, our waiter said, ""I'm gonna save you all time and just let you know that the first one is the best thing we have here."" I wish this guy would help us make an informed choice based on our preferences instead of dictating what's good based on popularity or his own personal preferences.Lastly, the drinks here are quite good & strong. They run about $13-$15, but I think that's kinda the norm now at places like this in Manhattan. One friend & I both tried the Por Que No, and our other friend had the margarita. We all agreed the drinks were of wonderful quality.The final tally, guacamole appetizer + three taco plates + five drinks = $167 + tip.

My first issue was that, upon entering the nearly-empty restaurant at around 8:30 on a friday night (seriously) and asking for a table for two, the host made a face, looked at his computer and ""found"" us a table. While he was looking at his computer, I was incredulously looking at the 30 empty tables. Anyway, we sat down, got some guac (that was mediocre), which came with some cashew sauce and some salsasomething, both of which very very good. Drinks? We got the famous Por Que No and a Margarita. Por Que No? I'll tell you why. Porque it's awful. It tastes bad. The margarita was not even very good, and frankly, it's not hard to make an average margarita. The fish tacos were recommended by our server, and they were excellent, as were the lamb tacos. Not exactly refined tastes, but bluntly good. Unfortunately, they came with a pricetag that suggests they should have been refined. Fail.

4.0,11/2/2011,"Empellon has quickly become my favorite upscale Mexican spots in the city. The food is essentially an innovative take on several types of Mexican dishes (tacos, sopes, quesos, etc.) It's nice that you can choose 2 or 3 portion orders of tacos to sample more of the menu and that most dishes are easy to share. The scene is also fun, with a lively and trendy crowd, good music, dim lighting and dynamite cocktails. Service is friendly and casual, although it can be inattentive at times.I've sampled a good portion of the menu over several visits, and here are my top picks:¿Por Que No? - A spicy cocktail with tequila, pinapple puree, cilantro and serrano. The pineapple does not overpower but provides just the right sweetness to balance the spice of the serrano pepper. If you like spicy tequila cocktails, you may end up drinking a few too many of these.Octopus Marisco  - The octopus is tender and perfectly cooked. The salsa is tangy and spicy.The Queso Fundido with Chorizo or Shishito Peppers - Can't go wrong with either of these. The queso is gooey and delicious, served with fresh, warm tortillas. The shishito peppers give it a nice kick. The chorizo is also a little spicy and very tender, although it can overpower the cheese more.Skirt Steak Tacos - The steak has a nice char and spicy, garlicky flavor from the mojo de ajo. It's rich, but delicious.Scallop Tacos  -  Melt-in-your mouth scallops. The spicy rasin puree sounds weird, but the tanginess compliments the scallops well.",0,0,0,Jay Z.,"Manhattan, NY",156,126,0

4.0,10/26/2011,"Empellón means ""to push,"" and in this case, Chef Alex Stupak (former pastry chef at Alinea and wd~50) is pushing the limits for authentic Mexican cuisine in New York City. Because let's face it, WHERE can you get it? Although it's no Tex-Mex joint, we can now enjoy fantastic tacos, queso fundido, sopes, guacamole, tortillas and beans! The smoked plantains sopes are a sweet treat, and the taco salsas and garnishes are unique and create a vacation in your mouth! Food to get: (see my blog listed under my profile for pictures)-Shrimp Ceviche with Passion Fruit and Mustard-Scallops with Cauliflower, Capers and Spicy Raisin Puree Tacos-Smoked Plaintains with Crema Sopes-Refried Black BeansThe restaurant's decor is a bit spooky. The bar's backdrop is covered in red and black graffiti, roped chandeliers hang in the front windows and a gold statue of Virgin Mary is enclosed in a glass case near the bathroom. Black tables squeeze tightly in the center of the restaurant making it hard to move and preventing any privacy.

I had a 10:15 Reservation, left the place at 11:30 and was never sat. They sat a table that had no reservation before me, and not just that but when I complained to the GM, he did nothing. The staff is slow and incompetent I bet this place will not be lasting more than 6 months. Do yourself a favor and do not go there, the food can not be that good. I am Mexican myself and I can bet you anything you want places like ""La Esquina"" and ""Barrio Chino"" are much better. It was just not the horrible ""dining experience"", but also when they offer us free guacamole and chips, the sauce had peanuts, they failed to tell us and my friend had an allergic reaction, and she ended up in the hospital. She has specifically told the host ( who ordered the free guacamole) that she was extremely allergic to peanuts.. then again. It did not matter. My friend is now suing the restaurant.

2.0,10/17/2011,"I heard a lot of buzz about this place on the food blogs and I honestly do not know why.   This place is definitely overrated, I was expecting a bit more from Empellon.  My main problem with this place was the prices! We are talking about TACOS here.....TACOS! 42 dollars for 3 lobster tacos? 28 dollars for Lamb tacos? I will be honest, I did enjoy the Lamb and Fish Tempura tacos but definitely not worth the price.  I was not the only one that felt this way in our group.  We all felt something lacking from our meal, we couldnt see what all the buzz was about. My other issue was with the desserts.  We ordered bunuelos and chocolate flan.  The buneolos were nothing special, if you really want some bunuelos go to Socarat Paella bar and you will experience goodness. As for the Chocolate flan, this should absolutely not be called Flan. I am Puerto Rican and I know flan and this my friends was not a flan. It was more of a custard and it wasn't that good.  We left this place wanting more and unfortunately didn't get it.Overall, I doubt I will ever come back here.

I mean, the portions are fine, it's the fact that it is mexican food in a casual East Village setting. The guac was average, but the cashew and spicy sauces they serve it with were good. The shortrib sopes were fantastic..the dough they use as the base is outstanding. Sweetbread tacos- very different and very good.. Ice cream cone trio...pumpkin seed, root beer, and mexican chocolate...delicious and unique flavors with an amazing sugar cone. I thought the guac and tacos were a bit overpriced and the drink prices were def. jacked up at $12-14. Those are Midtown prices.

3.0,9/26/2011,"I went to Empellon with moderate expectations.  I've seen Alex Stupak's work before and been impressed and was intrigued by his take on upscale Mexican. However, I'd also read some mixed reviews on Yelp but I went in with an open mind.  While my meal had some high points, in general, I felt that it did not meet expectations especially in light of the cost of a taco.  The good: the atmosphere of the restaurant is cute and my server, Nicole, was fantastic.  The por qu no drink was refreshing and clean and tasty.  The cashew salsa/sauce that comes with the guacamole is unique: buttery and earthy and flavorful.  I also liked how the tacos weren't fussy or overstuffed - my scallops and lobser were the star in my tacos with nice sized portions.  The major bad: the food in general is over-salted.  I noticed it throughout my 3 appetizers to a slight extent but it wasn't until the tacos when it started to build up and become pervasive.  The scallop tacos were truly delicious and cooked perfectly (slightly undercooked so it almost melted in your mouth) but it was also oversatled and kept me reaching for my water.  Then the lamb tacos had some heat but I didn't notice too much saltyness.  Finally, we ended with the lobster tacos and the salt was so aggressive in them that I felt really disappointed.  There were 2 very nice sized pieces of lobster in each taco and all the other flavors were spot on and I could easily imagine what the taco would have tasted like had they simply exerted some control over the seasoning.  The salt really killed it for me.  With the price per lobster taco, I'd rather not risk dehydration thank you very much.  All in all, Empellon had some strong points but I don't think I'll return due to this over-salting issue.",3,1,1,Lisa W.,"Hoboken, NJ",141,211,0

Specifically, the Por Que No cocktail which is a must-get, as is the octopus marisco.  Possibly the best pseudo-ceviche I've ever had.  I might've dreamt about it last night, and I definitely spent most of today salivating over how good it was and how badly I want more.  Can one survive on a diet of octopus and tequila?  With Empellon in my life, I would be willing to try.Other quality dishes include the meatballs and the tomato salad, both of which were divine.Extra stars for impeccable service and a great atmosphere.  Sexy and relaxed at the same time.

4.0,8/31/2011,"Dining-wise, the East Village is all energy and pizazz, with hot young chefs serving of-the-moment cuisine or hyperspecializing into porchetta or okonomiyaki. But the West Village is different. At its best, the wilderness of its ungridded streets encourages patrons to tuck into stellar food in sedate, quasi-Parisian settings (e.g., Recette, the Little Owl).The other type of destination restaurant in the area is the elegantly hip, cozy space filled with casually attractive people who grow louder and louder as the night wears on and the alcohol takes full effect. Think dell'anima or the Spotted Pig.Empellon is firmly in the second category. It's a welcome addition, too, if only for the fact that it breaks outside the European/new American axis to offer Mexican fare dressed to the nines. How appropriate for its well-appointed clientele.I must admit, I prefer my Mexican quick and dirty, but luckily my convive wanted to treat Empellon as I did: like a taco truck. We ordered four plates of them, and our faultlessly genial server immediately pushed an adjacent table into ours. ""You'll need this space for all the tacos.""Now that's what I'm talking about.Some mezcal-laced cocktails greased up the evening for our sole non-taco order, a nicely-executed haute take on sopes. For me, this was all prologue, though. Cascabel on the Upper East Side had previously proven to me that upscale tacos could indeed be drool-worthy, but could a former experimental pastry chef pull off the same trick?Not 100%. The lengua taco seemed drained of its tongue-y essence and one-note in its spicing. The sweetbread taco should have benefitted from the lack of comparison to a traditional forebear, but it too seemed oddly unsweetbreadlike, retaining the texture but losing the funk. Was Empellon dumbing it down? Didn't they know that even the culinarily conservative West Village could still support the likes of, say, pig's foot specialist Hakata Ton Ton...!?Whatever indignation I might have built up -- which wasn't much, since both the aforementioned tacos were still perfectly edible -- was erased by our other two specimens. The carne asada had some tough competition in my head from a phenomenal cart under the 7 tracks in Elmhurst, as well as Calexico's more hipsterish but almost as satisfying take. But Empellon's lost nothing in the comparison, its tender strips of skirt steak cooked to a beautiful pink, the saltiness calibrated the way you hope every haute chef will do but all too rarely get.And a lamb barbacoa taco was nearly as good. If anyone needed a reminder why the ancient method of slow-cooking is still around, here is a good one: the nearly melting meat gave up its flavor generously and continuously. If this juicy blast of game can't convince someone of the justifiability of slaughtering baby sheep, then I'm not sure what would.Luckily, my convive had no qualms with any of that. And much to my surprise, neither do I have qualms with Empellon. Sure, Cascabel does a much nicer lengua (to say nothing of the Roosevelt Avenue carts and taquerias). But the straight meat tacos should pass anyone's standards for deliciousness.Probability of return within 1 year: 50%",3,2,2,Lawrence C.,"New York, NY",82,215,0

Fun atmosphere, amazingly friendly and attentive staff and delicious yet surprisingly different combinations of flavors.The boyfriend and I were greeted by a beautiful hostess (who was the manager, which we later found out)  in a delicate flowered dress with cool tattoos on her forearms. She seated us at a two top and gave us her personal favorite recommendations off the menu. She took the initiative to bring us over tortilla chips and guac and two incredible sauces (one spicy and one savory).  Our server was personable and attentive and spoke with a beautiful accent as she described a couple of dishes. We went ahead and ordered the pea tendrils and mole pablano queso fondido, where we spooned the perfect blend of a chocolate tinged sauce intertwined with smoky jack cheeses onto warm tortillas. An order of the smoked plantains crema almost put me over the edge. The plantains are fried in butter... who can complain here? Then topped with roasted tomato, guajillo and chipotle (which I believe is the crema blend), balancing a savory and sweet taste that compliments that smoky plantain goodness. Let me get to the climax here..the fish tempura tacos were battered perfectly crispy and the lime mayonnaise was divine (note to all: I am NOT a fan of mayo). But the real surprise was the chicken tacos (GET THE CHICKEN tacos!!!); juicy chicken, addictive flavors- who knew chicken and salsa and kale could be so so good? For the grand finale we split the passion fruit tart, which was an oh so lovely combination of sweet fruit, almond cookie, cool mint and a zingy liquor. I'm quite certain Pepperidge Farm will be soon making a cookie dedicated to the dish once word gets out. We didn't even order any drinks, so there was no liquor to influence my review (other than the Mezcal on the tart), so maybe it was the overall experience or maybe I just had a slight girl crush on the manager.",1,0,0,Virginia R.,"New York, NY",138,146,478

4.0,7/26/2011,"OK so it has been a while since my last review.  I blame it on the constant moving around and hectic work schedule.  However I have to rave about my recent stop at Empellon.  Few colleagues and I went there for a late night bite after a work event.  Upon arriving, the place was still packed and buzzing with people, music and food.  Empellon sure knows how to make a good impression - presenting a visual feast through everything you see inside, from the décor, to the vibe and lighting.  The intimate space is brought to life with great music, bar scene and what seems to be an enthusiastic and happy crowd chatting away - probably gushing about how great the food is! We tackled the late night menu, starting with the chips and four salsas then moving on to the tacos and short-ribs burger.  The food was close to perfection.  The four salsas were an explosion of flavor with the mezcal infused salsa being my favorite.  The guacamole was also superb; smooth and fresh.   We then moved on to the tacos and things only got better.  Having lived in Mexico for a while now, I know a thing or two about good tacos and let me tell you that Empellon's tacos, would make any Mexican proud.  While you probably won't find Empellon style tacos on the streets of Mexico, the fusion of flavors, presentation and even the tortilla itself was authentic.  Thrown in amongst the tacos was the Shortrib Burger - which packed a whole lotta taste - it is perhaps the best burger I've tasted in NYC -oh so tender and combined with flavorsome.  I love me some string cheese!We then proceeded to practically ordered more than half of the dessert menu - and despite being full, happily stuffed our face with the mouth watering selection.  My personal favorite is the Tres leches (incredibly smooth!) and the Chocolate Flan.  All in all, there was not a dull moment; if you weren't enjoying the food (best shared with a group of friends) or chatting away with your friends, then you could just simply enjoy watching the crowd at the bar and groove to the music.  I'll be sure to make Empellon my regular stop in NYC and cannot wait to try out their much raved about brunch menu.",0,0,0,Albert K.,"Manhattan, NY",84,9,0

The plus side of this, in addition to the quieter room, is that when you slam your head in rapture against the wall after tasting Alex Stupak's superlative high-Mexicana, your cranium will have a pillowy soft landing. This is not Mexico City, nor does it try to be. It's the West Village, and yes, things are priced too high and it's too much of a scene and Roberto Bolano probably never ate two sweetbread tacos with roasted maitake mushrooms and tlatonile for $18, but there's a reason Sifton and Platt are losing their minds over the food here. It's good. It's usually great. It's probably the best Mexican food in New York. Chicharron. Distinguished by its crackle. In fact, it crackles on the plate. The immaculate crackle. It's doesn't have an assertive porkiness, and pairs seamlessly with a spicy, rich salsa veracruz. Octpous marisco is a perfectly cooked, light interlude -- not over-citrused.

2.0,7/20/2011,"Oh Empellon.  I wanted to like you.  I really did.  I purchased a Blackboardeats 6 course tasting with Mezcal pairings, anticipating a romantic night in an upscale locale, with phenomenal food, and maybe a small buzz from 6 drinks.  The restaurant is gorgeous, perfectly lit and very sultry.  The candles, the ambiance and the bar all scream romance and so it seemed we were in for a real treat.  Our water glasses filled, we awaited our first course as we sipped on our first Mezcal.  The first course was a sweet corn tamale which was very good, paired with fresh salsa and crema.  After this first course, where our drinks and food were served within a reasonable time of each other, things went downhill.  We received our second course of baby octopus, but had to remind the waitress to get us our second cocktail.  This seemed strange, considering that some of the other customers were, before our eyes, getting impeccable service, while we were, well like the kid's table.  The octopus was just ok but the sauces accompanying it were spicy and went well with the Mezcal.  For the third course, we were served a Mexican blood sausage which was the best dish of the night.  For the main we received a small piece of pork loin with greens.  This was by far the weakest dish, and honestly was fatty, served luke warm and faintly reminiscent of my high school cafeteria.  Again here we had to remind them about our cocktail.  The first dessert was inventively flavored masa gelatin which was quite pleasant.  The second dessert was a light and airy chocolate cake that was supposed to be paired with a sweet Mezcal.  After the waitress cast doubting eyes at us, as if we were lying about not getting our Mezcal, she reluctantly served us our last cocktail.Overall, the dishes were ok, and the presentation of some was very sloppy.  Combined with having to beg for drinks, I cannot give Empellon more than a 2.So Empellon, I wanted to love you.  Sadly, its not going to work out.",3,0,1,Lama B.,"Brooklyn, NY",229,592,50
4.0,7/12/2011,"This review is solely about their brunch - and boy I can't say enough about their brunch.  I went there with a group of about 7 others - and we've brunched in many places across the city, and really across the eastern seaboard. We know good food. I started off with a guava belini - which was well made.  Good mix of alcohol and juice.  When we sat down to order, we ordered a variety of things from the short rib burger, to the egg whites, to the sopes (similar to huevos rancheros) to their version of eggs Benedict.  We of course started, with chips and guacamole.  The guacamole and chips come with two different salsa's - that aren't chunky - more like sauces.  But they were both good - a cashew salsa and a chili salsa (the chili one was way better), and the guacamole was fantastic.  Definitely make sure you order some when here - I think they add cucumber to it - which I don't usually see in guacamole, but now I know it makes a difference! When we got our main courses, everyone was pretty darn pleased.  I had the eggs Benedict without ham (and it was truly AHmazing! - delicious, delicious, delicious.  oh wait - did I say delicious!?!).  My friend who got it with ham was happy with the meat.  After our meal, we of course ordered churros - and they were delicious too. The chocolate that it came with was pretty darn awesome - but the churro themselves was what was excellent (they did take a long time to be made fyi).  Happy with everything - including the service.

The three of us split an appetizer of smoked plantains with crema which were unique and delicious. Also had the incredible guacamole with thick, crunchy chips and salsas. We each ordered different types of entree tacos and shared them. The pork shoulder with pineapple chunks was our favorite but the chicken with yucca and pickled red onion, as well as the lamb barbacoa, were close seconds.

3.0,7/7/2011,"This is a restaurant where I will just refer a reader to Sifton's NYT review because he pretty accurately summed up Empellon. My take is this:Food is moderately unique, pretty good, but not great.It is a little on the pricey side for upscale mexican food and the tequilas and mezcal, which are excellent, all start at around $12-$15  per 1.5oz pour.The restaurant is on the loud side, which is good for a fun night, not so much if you were looking for a romantic dinner for two.",1,0,0,Garrett P.,"Anchorage, AK",3,140,0
3.0,6/28/2011,"The other night, I had a dream.  In this dream there were tacos - steamy hot tortillas, heavily redolent of white corn masa, plump with well braised cheap cuts of meat, and spiked with fresh onions and cilantro.  They were, in short, irresistible for the insatiable eater.Unfortunately, the tacos at Alex Stupak's new homage to haute Mexican, didn't fit this description. Instead, these tacos are piled high with not particularly tender or well seasoned proteins on flabby, oversized tortillas with a confusing dabble of faux Mexican flavors.  There was a skirt steak taco with mojo de ajo ($14), while hefty and filling, did little more than to raise parallels to Empellon's predecessors: Rosa Mexicano, Dos Caminos, Talaoache, Centrico and the like.Of course this lukewarm reception followed a gut busting appetizer of queso fundito (melted cheese) with red and green chorizo ($12) over an oil slicked blob of melted Monterey Jack, and served with precisely warmed corn tortillas.  It was a stoner dish if there ever was one, and delicious in its own brutish simplicity.  It also followed a clunky big eye tuna ceviche ($18) with juicy and plump tomatoes and serrano chiles with a dusting of cilantro.  However those lovely tomatoes completely dominated the fleetingly delicate flavors of raw tuna - Greenpeace should be notified of such disrespect towards an otherwise noble fish.But I would be remiss not to mention the guacamole, a house specialty that was urgently impressed upon our table by the FOH staff not once, but three times in the first few minutes of our seating.  Perhaps Mr. Stupak set a quota for his gluey and thoroughly unimpressive guacamole, served with smoked cashew and arbol chile salsas.  Maybe its a bread winner for the restaurant; but then he also shouldn't sell himself short, for there was a competently done tacos al pastor, which were blissfully meaty and well seasoned.  Good enough to buzz about, despite the sobering price point of $12 for two tacos.We had high hopes for Mr. Stupak, who recently departed the celebrated kitchens of WD-50, and his curious take on Mexican food.  Unfortunately, there's nothing particularly dreamy or compelling about the food at Empellon other than slightly misguided ambition and a flight of fancy.",7,3,4,Chris H.,Hong Kong,170,603,2140

2.0,6/13/2011,"Like others have posted, I would probably rate Empellon at 2.5 if available.  We started with drinks and guac.  Drinks were great, no issues there.  Guac was delicious and fresh.  I did have an issue with the three ""salsas"" served with the guac.  All were more like sauces.  I would have loved to see a fresh pico with cilantro and red onion, but instead was left with creamier versions of salsa.  Later we received salsa verdes with our tacos, it was good and more traditional with plenty of flavor.  We also had all three queso fundidos.  Each of these were delicous with plenty of flavor, but lacking a little spice even with the chorizo in some.At the end of appetizers it was a 3 star meal.  Then the tacos came.  We ordered the scallop, fish, lobster, sweetbreads, and beef tongue tacos, and the tuna ceviche. The only one I did not try was the sweetbreads.  Among the others most of them lacked in flavor.  Although they were the most beautiful tacos I have eaten each were placed on a single corn tortilla, which could not have been made in house.  They were dry and overpowered the mild flavors of  most of the tacos.  The only one that had enough flavor to defeat the corn tortilla was the beef tongue.  It had plenty of spice.  However, the other tacos needed a good addition of salsa and lime to bring out the flavors.  I was fairly dissapointed in this dinner I had been anticipating.Desserts did not dissapoint, but I have had better tres leches.",0,0,0,Aaron H.,"Knoxville, TN",0,13,2

2.0,6/12/2011,"I was a really big fan of wd~50 when I had a chance to check that place out a few years back. After reading a review of Empellon in New York Magazine last week, I got excited to try this place. I'm a huge fan of Mexican food, so it seemed like a win-win situation in my book. When I walked in, I was taken aback by the volume. It was really loud near the bar, and I was hoping we'd be seated in the back. Unfortunately, we were seated right in the front bar area and felt a bit crammed between other tables and people standing around the bar. I hate that about some restaurants, especially in the West Village. I feel like it happens a lot lately whenever I get dinner down there during the week. [I feel like an old man writing that statement. Oh well, it's true. Who wants a million people crowding around you while you eat your dinner?]The waitress was really odd during the entire meal. She was practically on top of us for the first few visits to our table and the tables around us (not really her fault considering the space). Then, she pretty much ignored us for the rest of the meal, except for a few random casual drop-ins that were more startling than pleasant. The NY Mag review said to go for the tacos, so we tried the fish tacos. A bit boring considering the other choices, which looked much more exciting. However, I wanted to try and classic and see how they did. I was a bit bummed by the presentation. It was simple, and I wanted it to be more exciting to compare with wd~50. The food itself was mediocre. Not much charm or flair. The decor was decent. I loved the brick and the wallpaper. The colors were great, with a nice clean, white feel at the same time. I really wanted to the food to be a vibrant splash of color that added some necessary warmth into the place, but it just didn't hit a home run. Maybe a place to try again in the future.

Immediately my friend and I sat at the bar, obviously our favorite place to truly test a restaurant - the bartender was friendly and attentive. There were two menus - one featuring specialty drinks and tequilas available and the other listing wines by the glass and bottle - definitely a few great choices to take the load off.We started with the pekoe crab appetizer, a delicious spicy kick with interesting ingredients, it was light and a great way to start off the meal... my only complaint was that I wish the dish was more chilled... it wasn't hot and it wasn't cold, but somewhere slightly in between. With the humid summer weather fast approaching it would have been a nice welcome cold dish.The tacos come in appetizer and full-size portions, I ordered the scallop tacos per the owner's suggestion, they were excellent. The scallops were perfectly seared. My friend ordered and devoured the lobster tacos, a popular choice among diners.

We started with the complimentary chips and dipping sauces which went great with the margarita. Of course we had to have the guac which was delicious.

4.0,4/17/2011,"There's no way I can denigrate a place that gives us the best table in the house on a Saturday night, comps many of our cocktails & is generous with extra courses. You know what's good? Life. You know what's even better? The chicharron starter for the table, crackling & crisp, screaming with grease and porcine flavor as you dunk it into the vera cruz sauce, bursting like a delicious blister. Be sure to request a bowl of salt though, as the kitchen doesn't seem to season it after the skin is yanked from the deep fat fryer. The sopes are nice - if you're not afraid of entrails, get the version with meatballs & tripe. There's a good chew to them. Also recommended is the black bean & egg sope. Be sure to use the wedges of lime and two sauces that grace the table - one is slightly fiery, the other complex and nutty. While I generally don't order salads at restaurants, the green bean one here is zippy and refreshing. OK, you guys got me real good. Had to sneak in some roughage, hunh? Thanks for worrying about my colon's health!Chipotle shrimp tacos were well executed, and the beer braised tongue tacos had a great texture. My friend noted that the tortillas here are of exceptional quality. Margaritas aren't repulsively sweet; that's a plus because there's nothing more awful than the skull crushing headache brought on by a sugar overloaded cocktail. Additionally, the Por Que No cocktail has an interesting note of cilantro, so be warned if you're of the breed who finds the herb to taste of soap. Service is helpful, attentive and charming. Without a doubt, this place will be a success.",10,2,7,Selena L.,"West Hollywood, CA",361,158,8
3.0,4/16/2011,"Went tonight with a couple friends and we decided to all get several appetizers and entrees and have everyone try some of each. The food itself for the most part was pretty good. So why only 3 stars? Because the staff was horrible. First off, my wife and I arrived a bit early, ahead of our friends. It was raining out so we walked inside and mentioned our reservation. We were told we could grab a drink at the bar, which was standing only, no stools. Looking around the restaurant I added up about 13 possible tables which groups could dine at. At this point in time there were 2 taken, leaving 11 completely wide open. We asked kindly if we could just be seated to wait since it was clear there was plenty of space and wouldn't be taking up space that other customers could be using. We were flatly told that we couldn't be seated until everyone arrived. So we stood holding our wet coats at the door while dozens of seats remained empty. Ridiculous.Then our waitress sealed the deal. She wasn't horrible, but she just wasn't all that attentive either. We explained to her we would be splitting everything four ways and she made several recommendations. One of which was a quesadilla that when we received it left each of us, after we split it in 4, with about 1 square inch a piece. In other words a bite per person. That would have been something to suggest getting at least two of. When she came by and asked how everything was we sort of said good, but reiterated to her we were surprised how small it was for four people, which seemingly went over her head as she had no response. I don't know if it was around her dinner break or something too because sometimes she would suddenly be nowhere to be seen and other waitstaff would pop by to drop off drinks etc. When it came time to grab a check so we could head out to catch a show, again she was nowhere to be found and we had to ask several staff members to find her so we could pay.Just a bit disappointing that despite the quality of the food being good, the quality of the staff was lacking.",1,0,0,Pete L.,"Manhattan, NY",36,3,0
2.0,4/16/2011,"After hearing about Alex Stupak's blurred vision to transcend from pastry to mexican haut-couture fanfare, I was a bit intrigued to say the least. To throw in a mix of a trendy neighborhood and a high end cocktail experience, I felt as though I had already seen this.... (Rayuela LES ring a bell anyone?) So, knowing that any new restaurant needs a few weeks to get its legs, I patiently waited to dine at this new west village taqueria.    What I expected was an authentic trip to pure Mexican cuisine, tastes and flavors that would send me from west 4th straight to Oaxaca. What I received was mostly overpriced dry food, complete with a confused playlist of Madonna, Beastie Boys, and maybe some Gypsy Kings mixed in, along with delicious, although overpriced and overly snobby cocktails at a bar I was forced to wait at not because the restaurant was too busy to be seated, rather the maitre'd must not know how to book reservations.    The cocktails were tasty; Extremely overpriced and small for the $12 price tag; and served with a bit of a snobbery which is to be expected these days by anyone claiming to be a mixologist and expert of Mezcal.    The food was more miss than hit. The guacamole was tasty; but then so is the guac at Tortilla Flats, Rosa Mexicano, Dos Caminos, Pacifico.... you get the idea. Like dining at an italian restaurant and not having good bread. We were recommended some cheese dips that were decent; followed by ""sopas"" (essentially corn pastry shells filled with various meats or toppings) We went with one with braised short ribs based on our servers recommendations. Pretty tasty item, perhaps the best, which came as no surprise given the chef's pastry coming-ups. We followed these with various $17 tacos that we couldn't mix and match; rather just eat $54 in tacos, yes $54 in tacos so that we could all feast on dry tacos smothered in cilantro that would've been better; and cheaper, from the late night taco wagon parked on 14th and 8th at 2am. But then again, that taco truck plays authentic music I'd expect from a  mexican place; no Lady Gaga or SoundGarden there.     It was a treat to always see a new concept and a great chef at the helm. It is always a disappointment when that vision falls subpar. I was hoping to see some great new concepts not yet seen in this city or some fantastic tastes unknown. Seemed ordinary overall. Drop the prices, slap up some Christmas lights, and drop the pretentious Mezcal-Cocktail snobbery and sling coronas and shots of Cuervo and give the guys over at Tortilla Flats a run for their money.

2.0,4/9/2011,"We were looking forward to eating at Empellon, and the night started out well. Even though the bar was packed, we were able to get our drinks fairly quick. The Por Que No (well balanced with a little bit of heat), and the Manhattan (the mole bitters were a nice touch), both could hold their own against some of top cocktail dens in the city. Hopes were up, but unfortunately things would only go downhill from there.Plenty has been said about the vibe at Empellon, and everybody has it pretty much spot on- a good looking crowd with schizophrenic soundtrack playing at a level that made it difficult to hear across the table, and a staff that was aloof and not very attentive. That said, if the food was good it would have been forgivable. To start the chips, guac and two salsas were solid and the sope w plantains and crema had some nice smokiness to it, but was forgettable. Then  came the tacos- we had an order of shrimp tacos and an order of mushroom tacos. Both were a pretty big let downs. The shrimp were rubbery, and didn't have much flavor. In hindsight, there's nothing that sounds too appetizing about mushroom tacos so I'm not sure why we ordered them, but they were far from anything to write home (or hype on yelp) about.Maybe they're still figuring it out, but a month in the service and food have a long way to go.

4.0,4/8/2011,"I love me some Mexican! In my opinion, everything in life gets better when guacamole, cheese and tequila are involved.This restaurant just opened up on the corner of my street, so I was intrigued to try it.  The cocktails were really delicious, laced with tequila but with a perfect balance of refreshing flavors.We ordered the Queso with black Kale - delicious! Guacamole scored quite high, was very fresh but could have used a little spice to it. After the guac and queso, we were starting to feel satisfied, but we ordered the shrimp and lamb tacos anyway. The shrimp were cooked perfectly, often they are overdone.  They had a tasty, tangy sauce.  The lamb were pretty good too, very juicy and flavorful.  I need to come back for the fish, beef and chicken tacos, but we were just too full! We didn't have  chance to try the desserts, but I heard they are amaI would say this is a great restaurant to come with 3 or more people.  Perfect for sharing because there are three tacos for each order. We had a little too much food for two.For ambience, it has quite a crowded, loud and lively bar scene which imposes on the diners.  The main room is VERY loud, so loud that you can't hear the person across from you.  And the music was a little too loud as well, with really bad stuff like Madonna. They need to work on that play list a little. I wouldn't advise coming here on a date if you are trying to get to know someone or if you want to have a romantic, intimate conversation.  However, I do think it is fun to come with a group of people because there are some larger tables and a back room which could be used for a private dinner.  If you don't want to be subjected to the loud ambience, ask for  a table in the back.zing.",0,0,0,Laura L.,"New York, NY",293,38,1

2.0,4/1/2011,"I wasn't sure exactly what to write about this place...Was the food good?  Generally - slightly disappointing that the entree list ended at tacos.  If you're expecting this to be a WD-50 / Top Chef sort of place you would be wrong.  It's another nice small restaurant in the west village that happens to serve tacos.  Don't make it out to be more than that.Were the tacos good?  Sure.  Though really should be 2 per serving or a la carte.  Else you need a large party to share.  Could find the same quality of tacos at many places (Esquina, Calexico, etc) for cheaper - Mexican's not quite the rarity it once was in the city.Were the drinks tasty? Yes. Bit overpriced but west village encourages that.Would you recommend it for a party of two?  Heck no.  Few two-tops pushed to corner where every server bumps your chair.Was it a disappointing birthday dinner?  For me, it was.  When you reply to the dessert menu offering with ""check please"" it pretty much sums it up.Overall? This place will do fine.  The service will work itself out.  They'll find a way for people to order tacos for themselves and have some apps.  But I won't be back unless as part of a group where someone else picked the restaurant.",2,2,2,BIG S.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,92,1

Ok, not so romantic that guys would feel uncomfortable but if you want a place for a date this it.The beauty of this restaurant is the simple, flavorful and very filling dishes. I had the tongue tacos as it was recommended to me by the host. I was hesitant at first but after one bite I was hooked. Those things were so good I wanted to lick the plate!

3.0,3/28/2011,"If you're looking for amazing and authentic tacos, head to one of the taco trucks.  I eagerly made reservations when I read that Alex Stupak was opening a restaurant here in NYC.  The place was buzzing and the ambiance was nothing but W.

2.0,3/27/2011,"I ate at Empellon last night and was extremely disappointed.  We didn't have reservations, so the host told us the wait would be 35-45 minutes and we decided to wait at the bar.The bar was the best part of the whole experience.  That's why this places gets at least 2 stars.  We got a seat easily, and I got a delicious mixed drink (some spicy pineapple concoction).  They were also playing some pretty great tunes.  I was excited for the meal ahead.About 15 minutes into our wait, the hostess came up to us to tell us there was a table available - sweet!  So, we moved our drinks to our table and started to settle in with some guacamole (the chips are pretty great).It turned out that it wasn't so sweet.  5 minutes later (at about 7:30), the hostess came back to tell us that there was a reservation for our table at 8:15 and indicated that she would like us to eat quickly and leave. Umm...what? I understand that sometimes its difficult to figure out the seating, but that's not my problem as a diner.  If I'm about to spend at least $100 at your restaurant, never make me feel rushed.We felt a bit miffed after that encounter and decided to get tacos and bounce.  The tacos were a let down.  I got the carnitas and my fiance got the lamb.  Each dish had three tacos, and the plate was unadorned.  I was told that the carnitas was a ""medium"" spice, but it really didn't have any kick at all.  It was just so-so and definitely not worth the price ($17 for 3 tacos?) and unpleasant hostess.  In all fairness, it did just open last week, so hopefully these are just growing pains and the tacos will get better.  If you really want to check this place out, I'd recommend sticking to the bar.  But if you're in the mood for good tacos, I'd recommend Pinche Taqueria over on Bleecker and Lafayette.  Not fancy, but the tacos are insane and service is awesome.",5,3,4,Megan T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0

We walked in Wednesday night at 9:30pm and secured a table without much trouble. I'd call the scene, typical west village.  The service was spectacular, the wait staff were all super friendly and attentive, although some of the runners had some trouble finding the right table (we were offered tacos for other tables at least twice throughout the night). Background music is a bit on the louder side, so you may have to lean across the table to hear your dinner companion. The food itself was good, not mind-blowing but decent and a good option for mexican in the West Village. The food came super quickly (efficient kitchen). We had the guacomole which was well-made and generously portioned (it did cost $10), tortilla chips were freshly fried. We also got the beer braised beef tongue tacos which were good. The tongue was tender, topped with some salsa and queso blaco. My friend's margarita was a bit on the small side, although I suppose you can say they are keeping it classy. Wine by the glass ranged from $9-$15. I would say all in all, definitely 5 stars for service and 4 stars for food, 3.5 stars for drinks/price.

5.0,3/22/2011,"There really is a paucity of good Mexican food in the city, so I was excited to hit up Empellon's opening night. Helmed by pastry chef Alex Stupak (formerly of wd-50 and Alinea), I wasn't sure what to expect - how would those skills translate into Mexican cuisine?  The answer, as we found out, is DELICIOUSLY.  The menu was filled with tantalizing options that made choosing difficult, convincing us before our first bite that we'd likely be back for more.  And then we tasted the guacamole.  It was, without a doubt, the freshest I've had in Manhattan, and it came with two unique and flavorful (if deceptively named) ""salsas.""  They were more like creamy spicy sauces than salsas, but they paired perfectly with the guac.  The milder was a smoked cashew salsa, and the spicy one was a roasted arbol chile that  almost evoked the flavor of Indian curry.  After much waflling, we finally both decided to order tacos - I chose the lamb barbacoa cooked with mezcal and orange juice, and my friend got the beer braised beef tongue with bacon and arbol chile.  Both were absolutely delicious - mine perfectly sweet and savory, and my friend's smoky and spicy.  Moreover, both the lamb and the tongue were incredibly tender - nary a tough or chewy bite.  The tortillas and portions were quite authentic, as was the plating.  We only had one small criticism - one of the tongue tacos did not have enough onions, which provided the crucial crunch to contrast the softer meat.  Aside from that, we enjoyed all of out tacos, each finishing our plates despite being very full.  They were just that good. And then the dessert menu arrived.  We sighed and grinned at each other simultaneously, because knew we had to at least TRY one of the desserts.  We opted for a variation of churros: little fried balls of dough coated with cinnamon and served with cajeta - a caramel made from goat cheese - and orange infused honey.  As expected, it was indulgent and just amazing.  The cajeta was especially intriguing - the goat cheese flavor is recognizable, but it is still sweet and caramelly.  Combining both the cajeta and the honey led to a great deal of eye closing and audible ""mmmm""-ing.  The portion was perfect to split, especially after a meal of surprisingly filling tacos.  The food itself would have warranted the first four stars, but the impeccable service won the fifth.  I headed in prepared to deal with some opening night jitters (or bugs) that needed to be worked out, but everyone was efficient and friendly.  Our server Rose was sweet and very knowledgable about the menu, offering suggestions and explaining the preparation and heritage of the dishes.  The atmosphere was also lovely - intimate without being the slightest bit cramped, and muted whitewashed brick was a lovely contrast to the flamboyant wall behind the bar.  It all worked together in a lovely fashion.  As long as Empellon maintains the culinary success of its opening night, I will be a regular.  I highly recommend it for upscale Mexican dining sans pretention :)",8,1,6,Sarah B.,"New York, NY",100,78,3
