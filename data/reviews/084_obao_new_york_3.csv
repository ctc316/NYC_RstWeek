4.0,4/28/2019,Went here on a Saturday evening for dinner after watching a movie. It is located in Hell's Kitchen and is a short walk from Time's Square. It is best to have a reservation because the place can get really packed. We arrived earlier than our reservation time but we were accommodated nonetheless. They have daily happy hour. The staff are friendly and the food came fast. The Spare Rib on Sugar Cane Skewer was a hit. The Vietnamese Pork Chop was so tender and really tasty. We also ordered the Short Rib Kalbi and it was really good. The price was reasonable.,0,0,0,AnnBella J.,"Queens, NY",44,12,9
4.0,4/28/2019,"Decent Vietnamese/Thai fusion restaurant. They're unfiltered saki is pretty good quality. We got their recommended vegetarian options: dumplings, pad Thai, eggplant tofu. The eggplant tofu dish was really good, the others were nothing to rave at.

4.0,4/25/2019,"This place was on my to-do list for a while. I went there with bunch of friends. First of all, the ambience is wow! Want to go on a date? Just pick this place!Coming to food, we ordered kimchi fries, vegetarian spring roll, vegetarian dumplings, vegetarian pad Thai, eggplant tofu, and pho-ga. Basically, we got all the vegetarian options on the menu. There are limited vegetarian options. I personally loved kimchi fries. The eggplant tofu was made very salty initially, but they fixed our order and it was delicious then. Those two were my favorite items. I thought pad Thai was okay, I have had better. Overall, had a great time there. Would definitely recommend it. Would like it if they add few more vegetarian options.",1,0,0,Sukhada K.,"New York, NY",105,22,35
2.0,4/25/2019,"Disappointed with pad Thai meals we both had the other night. The noodles were a sticky mess, not much flavor and not hot at all. The shrimp were numerous but they seemed just thrown on the plate, not flavorful and also no heat...talking temperature...Singha beer from bottle, can't go wrong! Service okay.

3.0,4/24/2019,"Been here several times - the south eastern Asian fusion food is creative and awesome. Highly recommend the crispy duck w/ red curry. It mixes well with lychee, pineapple and tomatoes. But You know what, with such amazing food the service here is so bad. Each time the girls/waitresses are just so showing their poker face (even a bit hostile). Seems they just do not want to say even one more word with you - Taking orders super quickly and checking your bills even more quickly. Not sure how other people feel but this happened to us EVERY SINGLE TIME.(And it's not even weekend busy time) Sad fact that you can easily feel their strong unwillingness to serve you... only coming back here for the great Asian fusion food.",0,0,0,Shengyi X.,"New York, NY",0,11,1

5.0,4/23/2019,"This hidden gem (to me) was quite a charm. My very best friend, whom I treat like a sister brought me here with my brother who is from Manila. We ate Thai food and we ordered the calamari. Very subtle, which you wouldnt think how great the calamari and the sauce they pair it with. It was too amazing, we actually ordered this again as our 'dessert'! TRULY A MEMORY for your senses to experience. The place is packed, expect to have a little bit of wait for a party of 4 or so.

5.0,4/20/2019,"Amazing food with a vivid ambience. Came here with coworkers, made a reso in advance, which is highly recommended, this place was definitely packed at 8:30pm on a Friday night, so get a table for 7 without reso sounds impossible! Glad we did, but we still waited for about 10-15 mins to have our table ready. The first impression about the inside was surprisingly welcoming and great, the lighting is dimming and playful, they have two floors for dinning, we were seated on the second floor. The menu has a variety of food to choose from, mostly Thai and Vietnamese. Recommend pork belly, the beef skewers with sugar cane, crispy fish, salt and pepper chicken, fried calamari, fried rice! Appetizer were all good, will come back for more.",0,0,0,Christine Z.,"San Francisco, CA",174,119,639

2.0,4/20/2019,"Something you realize and learn to appreciate is good service, and I definitely don't feel like this place delivered. I came here to grab dinner with my friends before a city night out. We couldn't be seated till the rest of the party arrived, so we sat at the bar. It was two of my friends' birthdays, so us three sat down and I decided to order a round of shots. Drinks were ~$14 and we decided to enjoy one with dinner. So when I ordered the shots, I asked the bartender if she had an outlet in the back since I was sitting at the bar - my phone was below 5% and I had a charger but she said no they had nothing. Once we got the shots and I was ready to pay, I realized she entered her own tip.. the shots were $8 each and I paid $32. I didn't realize she entered her own tip (which also happened to be the price of a shot and extremely undeserved) so that was my fault, since I planned to put some singles down. I just think it was a sleazy move. When our full party arrived, we got up to go to the table and I noticed an empty outlet behind the bar. I was angry that she didn't take my phone but I gave her the benefit of the doubt incase she overlooked it. When I went back to ask, they said they won't put my phone behind the bar, and that I could leave it in the front by an open door/window at my own risk. I said I was willing to risk it if it was behind the bar but not by the entrance where there isn't even a table for us to eat by. I told them we were at the bar, and now sitting down and eating dinner. The fact that they didn't have any outlets by our table/wall was irritating but then their coldness and refusal to even try to help was a complete turn off and because of that I wouldn't go back. I ordered the kimchee fries and I feel like they lacked a lot of flavor, but dumpling sauce on the side helps. I ordered the 9 herb infused drink which was probably my favorite thing about the place. Also, the waitress was probably the nicest person working there.",2,0,0,Aanchal K.,"Bethpage, NY",423,139,315
3.0,4/19/2019,Decor is the main event. Food options are more Thai than Vietnamese and average in flavor/texture. Although the Thai iced tea was one of the better versions I've had. I ordered the vegetarian pad Thai which had a gooey texture and lack of flavor and you could taste the defrost of the vegetables. Apps were yummy - we ordered kimchi fries and dumplings - both of which are good sharing options.,0,0,0,Manna S.,"Syosset, NY",1,10,7
4.0,4/19/2019,"I came here for lunch and it was pretty busy.  Nice lively atmosphere, music was cool.  Kinda dim lighting but it was comfy.  I love Thai food and always try drunken noodles with shrimp.  I had that with salad under the lunch special. Both were tasty.  The noodles had some fried kale on top which was different but good.  A twist not like a traditional drunken noodles. Usually they ask spice level but here they didn't.  I also enjoyed the fresh shrimp spring rolls with peanut dressing.",0,0,0,Sonya H.,"Los Angeles, CA",148,26,26
4.0,4/18/2019,"We came across OBAO during our restaurant hunt after a movie on 9th Ave. The interiors were pretty and the place had a lively vibe. We were seated quickly, only available table was with backless chairs/ stools, but we were moved to a comfortable table upon request as soon as a table came available. The waitress was VERY attentive and came across multiple times to take our order, you may or may not dig that.There were few vegetarian options, we started with spring rolls, vegetarian dumplings and kimchi fries - tasted amazing and decent portion sizes. For the entrees we got eggplant tofu in garlic sauce and pad thai. These were the only vegetarian options. The eggplant entree was very salty the first time around. We let the server know and after discussion with the manager, they replaced the dish. The replaced dish was spot on. Pad Thai on the other hand was delicious. We had one meat eater on the table who had a soupy chicken noodle dish, he loved it and enjoyed the large portion size.Overall good experience. 4 stars cause of service glitches, but the manager was nice to bid us good bye in the end. :)",2,1,2,Reema M.,"Secaucus, NJ",188,20,93

5.0,4/15/2019,"Delicious!!! This is for delivery only.I ordered the Steamed Dumplings ($9) and the Beef Panang Curry ($18). Delivery arrived on-time. Order is correct. The steamed dumplings were tasty. They contain a small shrimp. The sauce they came with is more of a thicker consistency soy sauce. It was 5 dumpling for $9. A bit pricey for those I think. I won't order them again. Not worth it in my opinion. The Beef Panang Curry was delicious! I would order it again. There was crunchy green beans and the coconut milk and curry blend tasted SO good. I drank it. There was about a cup of beef total, which isn't bad. The beef was not as tender as I thought it would be and it's sliced thin. Good flavors throughout though. Great portion size too. I couldn't even eat any of the rice that it came with! Love OBAO and I recommend trying it out!!",1,0,0,Kristen G.,"Hoboken, NJ",2,90,261
4.0,4/15/2019,We had the chicken dumplings and fried calamari for appetizers and a roast pork belly and Roast duck noodles for the main course.

3.0,4/11/2019,"I needed lunch and this place was nearby our work, so the co-workers and I decided to go with OBAO.  The interior is trendy with Thai elements.  It was pretty full when we arrived.  I barely read the menu and tried to spot a yellow curry.  Unfortunately, they didn't have it and decided to get the Beef Rendang Curry dish which came with an appetizer.  We decided to get potstickers for appetizers.  The service was good, but the food wasn't the most authentic and the curry dish was disappointing.  There was barely any beef pieces and the ones that were added were minuscule in size.  Also the curry was waay too liquid and lacked much substance.  It only consisted of tiny tiny beef pieces and small pieces of asparagus.  The prices I believe are not justified because the food seems to cater to a crowd that isn't in need of authentic Thai curry.  I won't be going back because the portions are small too.",2,2,0,Ceylan T.,"Manhattan, NY",168,274,2130
4.0,4/9/2019,Walked in with my friend and was seated very promptly. The server came took out order and the food came within 10 minutes. I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai and it was delicious!! The only complaint I have was the music. It was super loud and it seemed like you were at the club. I loved the low light setting with candles though so if you don't mind loud club music playing I'd definitely recommend you go and try the food!,0,0,0,Mercedes C.,"Salem, OR",0,2,3
1.0,4/8/2019,"Had such high expectations but it was all a mess. The drinks were mediocre. The appetizers were underwhelming. And the entree? The pad Thai I ordered was the worst pad Thai I have ever tried. The consistency was SO thick I could only take 3 bites and I was full. It was so difficult to digest. The egg on top was not cooked either. By the time I got home I was already sick. Spent the next 24 hours in bed. I wish I could say the pad Thai was what gave me food poisoning, but I'm pretty sure it was a combination with the drink and the appetizers too. Definitely not returning.",0,0,0,M E.,"New York, NY",0,10,0
1.0,4/7/2019,"Nice spot for beverage and casual dining but, thier foods are just mediocre. Ordered spiced calamari and spare ribs on sugar cane; very shorted expectation. Calamari is not even deep fried and soaked with sauce, worst I ever eat by far. Second, the ribs on sugar cane said recommended by Michelin, the fact is its not ribs!!! its bacon wrapped around the sugar cane. Wrong! Lie!!  Besides, the entrees cashew chill chicken is like chill fried flour barely any chicken breaded. Only the Pad Thai, Pee dee Mao tastes alright. Also, be aware when paying your bill. The waiter/waitress hand over your card payment terminal device along with the printed bill receipt (18% system default, the lowest/minimum tipping setting) on top of your bill, which is unethical doing business practices. If however, there should be an alternative tipping option like 15% or whatever. At here gratitude becomes a mandate though, some and few other restaurants (only when prepaid coupon purchase) also doing the same that applied on top of the printed receipt. Lastly, we gave 18% as by system default but felt sense of unfairness as tipping is suggestive (standard rate 15% domestic/internationally including EU) and its really up to the consumers.",2,0,0,Sean H.,"New York, NY",14,11,26
3.0,4/7/2019,"As soon as you walk in, you feel as if you are in a dingy club, with Snoop Dogg blasting from the speakers. As you enter the dining area, you're greeted with beautiful Chinese lanterns across the ceiling, in a dark atmosphere. The Snoop Dogg music carries you in as you sit down at the table. The staff is very friendly and quickly brings you your food once you order. We started with sharing the chicken pho, asking for two small bowls to split it in to share. The broth was quite possibly one of the best broths I've had when it comes to pho. The rest of the ingredients (noodles, chicken, and vegetables) were a little above average. Overall, B+ chicken pho.For the main dish, I ordered the spicy eggplant tofu with a side of soy sauce. The portions were relatively small compared to the giant pho bowl for the first course. The tofu and eggplant were cooked very well, with a side of white rice to compliment the dish. The combo ended up being spicier than I had hoped for, but I still enjoyed it overall. A- for the tofu dish. Overall, I would come back here for the food, but not for the atmosphere. I had a hard time separately the club-like atmosphere for the high quality food that was offered. I recommend that they turn down the music a little and change the playlists.",1,0,0,Taylor E.,"Washington, DC",457,108,199

2.0,4/6/2019,Called a few days before for a Saturday night reservation. We were meeting 2 friends who were visiting from Texas and wanted Vietnamese food. Reviews and pictures from Yelp were impressive and menu seemed reasonable. We arrived at 7 and were seated pretty quickly even though the place was packed and bar was hopping. We were a little disappointed that the restaurant had a B rating in the window. We were seated at a table by the bar and the waitress came to us right away. I ordered the soup with shrimp which was spicy and very salty. I ate the four shrimp and the mushrooms in the soup but left the broth. My husband and I ordered the whole grilled branzino which I expected to be big since I often buy the whole branzino at Costco to bake at home and it's so big I can never finish it. This was the smallest branzino I had ever seen!! And there were absolutely no spices on it because it was tasteless! It was also the most expensive item on the menu! I found myself just trying to pick out the fish bones and trying to find something to eat. I picked on the chopped green beans that were on the side because I was starving.  For dessert we ordered the green tea ice cream and the waitress informed us that they were out of green tea ice cream! So we ordered the Thai tea ice cream for four people and she brought us 3 spoons. Left not impressed and starving. Going home to eat.,0,0,0,Maria M.,"New City, NY",0,20,28
2.0,4/6/2019,"I haven't been to OBAO in over a year due to moving away from the area and honestly it was probably for the best. My friend and I arrived for lunch around 1 PM on a Thursday afternoon. My friend took a few more minutes than me to arrive but the hostess let me still sit inside to wait for her at our table. As soon as I was seated it was pretty evident that the table was very wobbly and the quickly fixed it after I let them know. After my friend joined me, the server arrived fairly quickly to take our order and I chose my normal meal: A pho ga with fried dumplings lunch special. It wasn't long after we ordered that our food came out which was very impressive. However, the food itself was not as awe-inspiring. The dumplings were yummy; however, there was too much sauce drenched over it. It would have been better if it was on the side and the patron can just dip as much as they wanted. The pho ga's broth was good, a little bit on the lighter side but I don't really mind that. However, there was not that much in the bowl apart from the noodles and broth as well as a few pieces of dry chicken and some scattered onions. But it did come with a good amount of bean sprouts, lime wedge and jalapenos. While the food was just ok, the part of the meal that was truly unsatisfying was the fact that even though there was less than 10 tables occupied in the whole restaurant, the servers kept hovering around us while we were catching up and trying to enjoy our meal. They kept trying to rush us by constantly asking to take our bowls away even though we were obviously not finished yet. It would have been one thing if we were loitering for hours and/or the restaurant was full and/or about to close for the afternoon; however, it was the complete opposite of that - it was pretty empty and we were there for less than an hour. That whole experience just left a bad taste in my mouth so I will probably not be back again.",5,3,5,Deborah W.,"Manhattan, NY",231,136,251

When I arrived at the restaurant I was told the second floor was closed although I saw several patrons walk down the stairs(could've been management or private). I was seated in the middle of two tables with diners on both sides with plenty of other open tables. I'm not sure why restaurants want to crowd all theirs diners in one spot. It's annoying and unappealing. The hostess rolled her eyes because I asked to be seated elsewhere. Food was very delicious and well presented. I ordered a Pad Kee Mao and Pho Ga' with Fried dumplings.When paying the bill On their handheld IPad I noticed the waitress selected a 20% tip on the top(if this is a default setting, that's unethical).

The service was very prompt - gave us our menus, took our orders and served us the food.I had the Grilled Pork and Shrimp Bun. I have to say it was pretty good- I wish there was more sauce to mix with but it was a very tasty meal nevertheless. A downside is that the entrance area was really crowded because there were so many people waiting for a table.

The crispy noodle didn't add much and wasn't very crispy. It just got soggy. The chicken was very dry so I didn't eat that.  The egg noodle absorbed the curry flavor so that was good. The noodle wasn't cut up so the strands were hard to pick up and long flickering sauce on my dress. It was weird that the server asked if we were splitting the bill since she picked up one card. I asked what she meant so she said I didn't open the bill holder so I don't know if we left another card. I thought that was odd and lazy.

We came on a Sunday afternoon and the place only had to other tables filled.  I had a party of two, but I dislike sitting at a small table facing my guy. I'd rather sit side by side and since the place was basically empty asked to sit elsewhere. They said they had reservations. We couldn't have the table behind where we were seated that we requested. We were given a table set for  three facing a wall that was lopsided and very Uncomfortable. So, we went back to the two seater. Then the waitress asked if we were okay and told her no. We went back and forth about the reservations they had for the table (meanwhile we were there for an hour and nobody ever sat at that table!) she finally offered me a nice cushioned spot in the corner that was perfect. I got the Pho. It was really good. I couldn't finish it all and requested that they separate the noodles from the broth. I was told they could not! So silly.

This place has a mix of different Asian cuisines from Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, etc. Food are not memorable but are solid and flavorful dishes (spare ribs on sugar cane skewers is a must). Thai ice tea was a little on the sweet side but strong tea flavor. Prices are decent for a restaurant located in the theater district. It's an affordable, wallet friendly place for a pre- or post- theater meal. Decor is made up of beautiful traditional elements such as the floating lights/lanterns and wooden bamboo like fixtures making it not too shabby for a date spot, either.",0,0,0,Eva Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,35,8
4.0,3/19/2019,"A solid 3.5 in my book but I'm giving bonus credit to the host, Chad.The restaurant was packed on Friday and wait times were in excess of an hour. Fear not, we had a reservation. We had made a special request to be seated ahead of time before the full party arrived to surprise my friend for his birthday. We had flew in other friends from around the country to surprise my bud for his birthday. The middle aged lady-host did not quite understand that the restaurant had granted us this request even though I could clearly see someone had made a notation on the reso. She simply said sorry, restaurant policy, and smiled. Believe me, I understand restaurant policy - and had your colleague rejected our request on the phone, we would have made reservations elsewhere for the surprise birthday party. Enter Chad, the counterpart to the no-no host, a much friendlier and younger and tolerant person to deal with. He said he'd seat us promptly to get the party started. But the damage was done and other parties were seated ahead of us. The birthday boy arrived and the surprise happened on the stairwell instead of a table. Oh yes, the food. This is my second time here and none of the dishes were all too memorable. The duck confit sticks out, dark meat with a crunchy bite from the crispy skin. Too small of a dish though, especially for sharing. I would recommend this place for a date night because of the atmosphere, and also the encouragement to dine family style. Given the more clandestine Viet and Thai spots in lower Manhattan, this is an okay substitute at best - both price and quality wise. But cheers Chad, thanks for stepping in and keeping the party alive.",2,0,1,Christopher Y.,"Manhattan, NY",333,100,66

2.0,3/15/2019,"I had been to this obao once several years ago with a foodie friend and I remembered staff being Thai-like polite and warm, so I brought my visiting friends again for an early dinner around 4:15pm on a Thursday in March 2019. I wanted to bring my friends to a restaurant where I felt I was treated like family and can enjoy our time.I was disappointed.This time around it feels like a Chinese-run over priced fusion restaurant due the straight up rudeness, lukewarm customer service & the attitude we received from the staff. From the moment we entered to our exit, I only got one eye contact when we left & she was working as take out / deliver.Despite nearly empty at 4:15pm, we were kept waiting at the entrance for a while and seated in a tight space (-1 star for New York with no time to waste). The portion of food was very small but the price was relatively high (-1 star). Our water was filled once during our stay from 4:15pm to about 6pm. All the staff looked miserable and made me want to leave while waiting to be seated. It wasn't until we said ""it's ok, miss, we can go somewhere else"" that our pretty hostess became slightly less cold & moved faster.We ordered two pad see ew, a basil fried rice with shrimp, and a shrimp pad thai. Our order came fast and hot, they were all ok, just small enough portion like a kid meal. For dessert we had yuzu cheese cake & green tea chocolate and they were ok; I liked that they were not overly sweet, but they are nowhere near the amazing dessert I can get from Spot dessert bar. I give 1 star for ambiance/interior deco and 1 star for the swiftness of our order.

Appetizer: We got the calamari, it was pretty good. Great sauce. Incredibly small portion tho. For the price I think we received 10 small cut pieces. So $1 a piece pretty much. Entree: I had the beef pho. Broth was not complex and included about 5 thin strips of beef. For $15, super over priced. Service: Not only were staff rude, but after dinner we stayed a bit to chat while I finished my mojito and they did not refill my friend's glass of water. They overlooked our table the minute we finished eating, so that they could rush us out even though the restaurant wasn't even filled, there were open tables, and we hadn't closed our bill yet.

I got a carafe of their house sake and the pho bo (beef pho) substitute with vegetables though. I don't like meat in any of my soups so I had it be made without the beef. The lunch special came with a choice of appetizers, I went with the salad. Standard vietnamese salad with peanut dressing. Everything was DELICIOUS. Service was good. Atmosphere was nice.

2.0,3/5/2019,"This review is based on service: I popped in on a rainy evening wanting to warm my bones and have a soup that I've grown to love now that I live in Los Angeles, Pho. I ordered the fried spring rolls, which I had to send back do to them being over cooked and simply inedible. The Pho was very good, deep rich broth, they didn't skimp on the cilantro/jalapeño/sprout side, which I was happy about, I'm not sure if they make their noodles but they were not over cooked and enough to get full, the soup I ordered was suppose to be spicy, it wasn't, so I had to add a spicy sauce myself. All in all the food was good and did what I needed it to do. Now the service, I didn't expect five diamond service, but I do expect not to sit and wait 15 minutes before I'm even asked if I would like a glass of water, I also find it nerve racking to be asked if I'm finished as my spoon is being lifted towards my mouth, this happened a few times. My water wasn't refilled, I had to ask for chopsticks, I never did get to order my drink, and at the end though the soup warmed my bones, the service was cold and uninviting. I will try it again because the soup was yummy, hopefully the not so good service was a fluke.",0,0,0,Nubia J.,"Brooklyn, NY",76,28,4

Ordered soup for appetizer and it was so lemongrassy that was impossible to eat. I asked for Pad Thai with cooked egg instead of poached, but waitress said that was how they served it and couldn't make any modifications. She seemed to have trouble understanding that I cannot have undercooked egg or shrimp. How is that even possible? All they can do is to serve Pad Thai without egg. I told her that it would not be pad Thai and asked for other recommendations. She offered another option warning that it was spicy and suggested Pad Thai without egg again and more time to think. They do not even offer chopsticks although pretend to serve authentic food. We ordered ribs as well which turned out ok, nothing remarkable, not spicy at all and even slightly sweet.

5.0,2/4/2019,"Ugh, loved this place. Came with a friend and we showed up at around 7pm on a Friday night. It was pretty packed already and we had a 15-20 minute wait. From all the people in the waiting area and how crowded the restaurant looked, 15 minutes was great news. Right when I got the menu, I was so torn. I wanted to try everything. My friend and I each got a Tom Yum soup, which was pretty filling as an appetizer. There were 5-6 huge prawns in that soup. SO bomb, so soft, and I mean 5-6?? That's so many!! Haha they really hooked it up. As an entree, I got the cat fish clay pot with Chinese broccoli - which anywhere else would probably be a lame choice but I literally love cat fish and desperately needed some greens. My friend got the red curry with duck. We were also served complimentary cups of rice. The cat fish clay pot was so damn good. The sauce wasn't overpowering but went perfect with the fish and broccoli. My friend's dish was even better than mine, my gaah. Hers had a lot going on it. There was pineapple, lychee, eggplant, basil leaves, and duck in there. A ton of flavors coming into harmony. Service was extremely friendly and prepared, low-key almost too prepared. My friend was nowhere close to being done with her dish and one of the waiters asked her if she was finished so he can bust her dishes. We both thought it was odd, but I mean, he was just trying to be efficient lol. I will come back to this place multiple times to try all the things!",1,1,0,Terilyn A.,"Los Angeles, CA",488,88,103

4.0,2/2/2019,"So me and a friend came here right before a broadway play and it was different! The atmosphere had like somewhat of an Asian theme of course since the food was Asian. Although we may have been somewhat late (maybe 5-10 minutes due to traffic) we were seated right away. There are 2 floors, a downstairs and an upstairs. Downstairs was more of like a bar type setting from what I can remember and upstairs was more or less dining. Once we were seated upstairs- I felt like the seating arrangements were kinda tight. You could definitely hear other people's conversations one or even two tables over. As far as the food, it was pretty good. We had to eat in a hurry so I didn't get a chance to really ""taste"" the food like how I would've wanted to. Since I came here maybe a month or two ago, I don't really remember what I had (sad face) but I'm sure I took pix (hopefully) to show what I had. It was a fairly decent experience however, I would have to go back to really give a more detailed description of what I would get and what I wouldn't get.",1,0,1,Uneka H.,"Rahway, NJ",83,286,1129

The ambiance is nice with all the lights.Ordered the roasted duck noodles and the flavor was good, I also tried it with the spicy sauce but preferred it without. I love the wide flat noodles and flavor so I just wish the duck was not dry. So maybe it was a good thing there wasn't a lot of duck? Normally there is more protein in other noodle dishes I've had. I don't eat a lot so I was surprised to finish my dish and still feel a little hungry. So portions are small here! Would recommend ordering appetizers.

Yummy crispy fries doused with kimchi and sriracha mayo. We also ordered the banh mi and pho because my friend and I were just craving it. I will say obao's pho and banh mi are pretty good if that's what you're craving. Not the best I've ever had, but hits the spot. The banh mi is smaller than what you'd expect though. Maybe about half or 3/4 the size of a regular banh mi you'd order anywhere else. My biggest qualm with obao though is the price. A meal here is pretty pricy, even for menu items that typically don't cost as much elsewhere. The extra cost of the food is probably made up by the extravagant and luxurious interior environment of the restaurant. They put a lot into decor and vibe.

The food was, for the most part amazing. I loved the pad kee mao and the pad Thai. Both were really flavorful. The kee mao was spicy, so be warned. Additionally I added shrimp to it. I forgot to take a picture of it. My critiques: the chicken pho was not great. It really lacked flavor. The broth was clear and it just didn't seem to be seasoned. The fried rice was also bland, but soy sauce really helped to open up the fresh flavors. Finally the Bò Lúc Lac was excellent. Very tender and flavorful.",0,0,0,Kristopher O.,"Tampa, FL",199,38,46

5.0,12/29/2018,"What a wonderful find in Hell's Kitchen. Obao turned out to be my family's favorite meal and place to eat during our entire week long stay in New York City. We had reservations elsewhere but discovered Obao on Yelp and decided to eat here instead and boy are we glad we did!Despite being overbooked and not taking reservations, our party of 3 decided to risk it and head over anyways. We were in the mood for Asian after having had great Italian at Carmine's, Steaks at Keen's and more of the great cuisine Manhattan is known for.  They greeted us warmly and were clearly booked solid with a full restaurant and packed waiting area but still took our names down and told us the wait would be only 15-20 minutes. True to their word, 20 minutes later our pager went off and we were shown to our table. The menu itself has quite a few Vietnamese and Thai selections with a few Korean dishes sprinkled in. We decided to go for two specials, their Crispy Fish and Lobster Pad Thai.  These were complemented with Pad See Iew and BÒ LÚC LAC to be shared family style. We had their Fresh Shrimp Rolls and Spare Ribs on Sugar Cane Skewers as appetizers.  Everything came quickly and was beyond delicious!  My only regret after the meal was that we didn't have an Obao back home in Seattle. This place will definitely be a repeat destination whenever we next find ourselves in New York.  The Crispy Fish was supposed to be Red Snapper but they were out and substituted Branzino in its place.  If you are like me and don't know what Branzino is, just Google it as I did to discover it is European Sea Bass and is considered a very green fish at that for how they are grown.  The dish was divine with the fish fried crisply yet falling off in nice pieces and full of flavor.  The soft white meat of the fish with the crispy fried exterior texture and the seasoning made this a great centerpiece of the dinner. We went for the Lobster Pad Thai as it is something we have never had before. We were rewarded on our selection with a wonderful Pad That topped with a whole lobster!  It was nicely cut and the meat from the body and claws were removed for us and cut. The tail was simply split in two making it easy to get the meat out but the overall presentation of the dish was top notch!  The taste was out of this world however!The BÒ LÚC LAC was very well prepared and on point. My wife being Vietnamese have it high praise for it being tasteful and true to the dish.  I enjoyed it a lot but to be honest, not as much as the Crispy Fish or the Lobster Pad Thai.  The Pad See Iew was very good and devoured within minutes by our daughter. Wasn't much left to share family style.  According to her it was the best she'd ever had.  As you can see, we all had the same high praise for the food here at Obao.  The appetizers were fantastic as well but this review is already exceptionally long. I'll stop here and reiterate how much we love Obao and look forward to going back!  If you have the chance, definitely stop in and get a few dishes of your own and explore!  You won't regret it!",0,0,0,Dave M.,"Sammamish, WA",7,10,57

Anyway, we ordered a bunch of food to share including the Samba Spiced Calamari, the Pad Thai, the Pad Kee Mao (our favorite), the Tom Yum soup, and the ""Michelin recommended"" Pho Bo. The servings were overall smaller than expected, especially for the Calamari. The Pad Thai and Pad Kee Mao were good, but nothing particularly special.

3.0,12/6/2018,"This place is really pretty. I love the lights so much!Food was underwhelming, however. Perhaps I have high standards for SE Asian food.Pork belly appetizer was slightly over cooked on the bottom, and I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce they used. I would describe it as an amateurish use of fish sauce - didn't know how to balance the flavors from the fish sauce and it was way too salty and strong and a little awkward with the pork belly.Duck curry had the same problem. The cook on the duck was great, so you can tell that there's skill, but just a lack of knowledge and experience with the flavors. The base of the curry didn't taste like curry. It tasted like fish sauce. They need a chef that is more ept with complex SE Asian flavors. You can't just throw fish sauce and lemongrass into everything and call it a day.I wouldn't mind coming back here if someone else really wanted to, but I myself would not be the one in a group to suggest this place.",2,0,0,Ash N.,"Washington, DC",494,134,212

Furthermore, the quantity for a bowl of pho is relatively less than what you would find at a more traditional establishment.Within the restaurant however, the ambience is great and service is good.

The sauce was very generic (sort of like a watered down duck sauce with a hint of spiciness)Main dish- VIETNAMESE PORK CHOP: 1 out of 10. Portion was fine for the price, however, the pork chop was thin sliced porkchops and they were rubbery and hard from being overcooked. In addition, they had almost no flavor or sauce. I only ate 3 bites. Good thing I had a snack before I came. Service: 7 out of 10. We made a reservation so was seated after 15 minutes. The wait staff was attentive and got our drink orders and food out on a reasonable amount of time. Final thought: I would only go here for drinks and maybe some light appetizers. The one thing going for then is the price but to be honest, if you can't even choke down the food, you are still throwing away money regardless of the price. I honestly do not understand how you can mess up thin slices pork chops. Unlike the thick porkchops, thin slice is one of the easiest and fastest to cook.

They told us they would hold the table for us until 7:45 pm which was fine. We ended up arriving at the restaurant on-time at 7:30 pm and they had given our table away. They were not apologetic about it at all. To make things worse, I had called a week in advance to let them know I would be bringing a cake from an outside vendor in and they said that was fine. Upon arriving the day of my reservation, several employees pounced on me and told me there would be a $5 per person charge for the cake. This is so absurd and ridiculous. That fee ended up costing more than my cake. And, if my table is spending over $600 ordering food, would it not have been a good display of customer service to waive the fee? If you are dining here, please expect nothing more than unprofessional behavior and crappy customer service. I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone.",0,0,0,Priya P.,"Dallas, TX",23,6,0

The hostess ""Moon"" definitely needs to work on her attitude. I went with a friend in the evening around 5/6 pm, upon approaching her, she affirmed that there was a table for two available. I had a hot drink in hand so she informed me that I had to throw it away or drink it up before we could be seated. I had no problem with this request so we sat by the door/waiting area and I proceeded to try finishing off my drink. Afterwards I informed her we were ready to be seated, she then informed me that they had to clean a table for us. We then had to wait for quite a while to be seated. No body walked past us to leave the restaurant and lo and behold there were several empty tables for two clean and available in the restaurant.Not sure what that was all about, but it was certainly rude and unprofessional, especially since I was polite and even apologetic during our entire exchange.On the other hand our waitress ""Kith"" was wonderful! we left a good tip.",0,0,0,Debra A.,"New York, NY",0,4,0

4.0,11/5/2018,"Sometimes if I have not gone to a restaurant in a long time I'm almost worried.  Will it be as good as the first time I went?  Will they be coasting on a reputation and given up on quality?  These were the questions I asked myself as I entered OBAO to meet friends for dinner recently.  Fortunately I had nothing to worry about!OBAO is an Asian Fusion restaurant in Hell's Kitchen that has somehow managed to keep itself from falling into the ""Let's make it good enough for tourists."" trap.  Instead, this place works to serve up ambience, good food and good service (really, the trifecta of awesomeness).  The decor is still the same as my first visit (check out the cool pictures in this review to get a good look at how nice the place is).  I was happy with this because I think the look is somewhat modern and timeless all at the same time.  For the uninitiated, even on a Monday evening this place can get pretty full so I recommend making a reservation whenever you want to eat at OBAO (though bar seating/eating is an option).  The host and hostess were super pleasant and asked me if I had a reservation.  With a smile I told them ""Yes!"" and it made the whole awkward ""Well, let's see when we can seat you..."" conversation evaporate.Alright, let's get down to it.  What did I eat?  Here's a rundown:BRUISEBERRY MOJITO (rum, seasonal berries, lime juice)A light and sweet drink, which surprised me.  I had expected the rum to really dominate but it did not, allowing the berries and lime flavors to come through nicely.CRISPY SPRING ROLLS (pork, shrimps, taro, mushrooms, and sesame oil served with pickled radish and nac chm sauce)Spring rolls are pretty standard but nowadays many restaurants just fill them with a pile of vegetables and maybe a sliver of meat and call it a day.  These however were robust and had a good balance of meat and veg.  Good flavor, good crunch and they came with lettuce leaves to wrap them in.SPICY LEMONGRASS KALBI SHORT RIBS (grilled short ribs marinated with honey and fish sauce, lemongrass, fresh chili, sweet rice wine, onion, and sesame seeds)This dish came in two parts.  A bowl of rice (shaped like a cone, which was interesting) and the short ribs cooked on an iron platter on the side.  It was still sizzling a bit when it came to the table which I *love*.  The marinade was absolutely delicious and while the bites of meat are relatively small, they pack a powerful punch of flavor!I'm really happy I came back for a meal at OBAO and I look forward to my next visit!",4,4,4,Benson Y.,"New York, NY",393,1300,917

4.0,10/31/2018,"I'm a huge Southeast Asian food enthusiast so I was excited to try this restaurant. My experience is evaluated on the following four criteria:Experience: I was part of a larger group and was told that we could not be seated until our entire party had arrived. It was somewhat frustrating to wait, but I understood why the policy was as such. The restaurant is located near restaurant row and is beautifully designed with traditional bamboo straw hat lights and ceiling bells.  The restaurant itself has a unique vibe as it goes for an Asian fusion kind of experience which is reflected in its food as I will discuss below.Service: Perhaps we were in a larger than normal group, which is why the service was slowed, but I was did not think the service was particularly great. Simple things were overlooked such as providing a soup spoon for people who ordered noodle soups or offering lime/condiments. But, again, it could be that we were an exceptionally large group. The pace of the dinner was also somewhat slowed, probably because of the large group size.Food: The food is very much Asian Fusion. I tried a few appetizers and two entrees. For appetizers, I thought the papaya salad was very good, although missing some nuts or something. For entree, I had the Bun Bo Hue, which for a southeast asian food enthusiast, it is hard to find in Manhattan and shared a Bun with pork and shrimp. The Bun Bo Hue is was okay. The flavors were there but was far from a traditional Bun Bo Hue, but again I think this place is going for fusion as opposed to authentic. The Bun with pork and shrimp is Michelin recommended which I thought came out pretty well but was lacking in meats. Still good though and would also recommend.Price: At around $14 a dish, I thought it was pretty reasonable. Appetizers were on the pricier side but over I thought it was reasonable for Asian Fusion near Times Square.TL/DR: Don't expect authenticity.  Good food for good price at the right location.

We came as a couple and ordered the pad thai and duck noodles, along with crispy spring rolls. The pad thai was absolutely delicious! It tasted different from other establishments and had a nice smoky flavor to it. It was plentiful and honestly very well worth the price. I'd recommend getting this, don't shy away just because it's one of the most well known Thai dishes! Now the highlight of the night was the duck noodles. The duck was flavorful, smoky, and abundant. The sauce mixed with the noodles gave it a very vibrant flavor that really stood its own amongst strong competition from it's other counterpart - the pad thai. It was so unique and delicious that we almost ordered a second serving of this, if we weren't so full.Now the bad part - the spring rolls we had weren't good. It was overcooked and hard as a brick. I couldn't bite through it and thought it didn't taste good. Instead of complaining about it after, we decided to tell our waitress and she took care of it. She spoke to her manager and they took it off our bill - excellent customer service! In fact, both of them tried to poke the spring roll after we handed it off LOL and probably realized it was deep fried into a rock... funny. She asked if we wanted something else and we said no.

3.0,10/23/2018,"My friend and I tried Obao for brunch on a Sunday. The wait wasn't too long and we had read good reviews. I was expecting a Vietnamese restaurant but instead I found that it's run by Thai people making their Thai food much better than their Vietnamese food. For starters, we ordered their sliced braised pork belly which was slightly over cooked as the meat was tough though the fat still melted. It had a bit of sweetness to it though you could taste the fish sauce that was added to it. I ordered the original Pho with fish balls (extra $2). The beef was supposed to be rare but instead I got a bowl of 3-4 thinly sliced overcooked pieces of beef, in a broth that did not taste like beef broth, and fish balls. The broth tasted more of fish sauce than beef broth and I ended up adding hot sauce and a ton of hoisin sauce to make my noodles and soup taste better. While I'm sure they used beef broth, it tasted off.My friend ordered their crispy duck confit curry. The Duck was cooked to perfection and was extremely flavorful, but they gave a small amount of curry to go with the rice and meat. The portion size was rather small for the price paid, and they really slumped on the curry though the taste of the curry was amazing.

When we asked the hostess about our reservation she stated that the holding period was only 15mins and that we would be added to the end of the wait list. We asked to speak to the manager who was gracious enough to accommodate us as quickly as possible - we waited maybe 5 minutes before he led us upstairs to an empty table. Food wise: we had ordered kimchee fries - as good as the first time I ever had them about 2 years ago at OBAO. The Eggplant Tofu with spicy garlic sauce was so tasty, with a perfect amount of peppery aftertaste. The Tofu Pad Kee Mao was great as well. Both dishes had perfectly cooked tofu - with just the right amount of flavor and softness.

4.0,10/5/2018,"I came to this establishment with a group of friends before seeing a broadway show. The decor inside is definitely an attention grabber and very nice to look at. The happy hour is decent for the area and allows you to choose between cocktails, beer and wine. Cocktails are $10, Beer $5 and Wine $7. I asked about well drinks since it wasn't part of the menu and was also mot mentioned to me when ordering. Well drinks are $5 during happy hour. The food was good not great. We had an array of apps to share consisting of calamari, pork belly, spring rolls and dumplings. All were good. However, the calamari was in a spicy sauce that made it soggy. I love my calamari to be crispy. For my entree I had the pho. It was a large serving and I couldn't finish it. Flavor was good as well with the added spices that I had asked for on the side. Now for the negative. Our waitress was this tall pretty woman who could not break a smile and was not friendly at all. Each time we ordered more drinks or asked for the sauces that go with the soup she would bring it with an attitude. One of my friends is vegan and he asked a question about what a particular dish was made with and she spoke to him as if he was a child like she wanted to make him feel stupid or something.

1.0,9/29/2018,"I've never paused from a weekend trip to write a review before, but OBAO deserves 15 minutes of my time for this one star review. I made reservations and arrived on time. My first impression was a disappointment from what I had expected based off other reviews and their website. Despite the decor this is not an elegant establishment. It reminded me of an off-the-strip place you'd find in Las Vegas with way over the top music pumping and an under dressed crowd in sneakers and drab Ts. Ok- disappointment but I pressed on with an open mind. Right from being seated service was slow and unacceptable. It was late and we were hungry so I placed an order for appetizers immediately. Our waitress disappeared and we didn't see her again for a full 20 minutes. She then arrived at our table and asked, ""what was it you wanted for appetizers?"" We reiterated our choice in appetizers and made entree selections. At this point my companion was about to walk out. I should have heard him out, but I like to cut people some slack and thought the restaurant could turn the experience around so I suggested we wait for our appetizers. Almost 40 minutes after our arrival our appetizers showed up. The steamed dumplings were lack luster and tasted like something you'd buy in the frozen section at your local grocery store. There was nothing special or authentic in either their flavor or texture. The sugar can skewers were tasty and that is about the best I can say about this place. Our entrees showed up, dropped off by staff with a tray loaded with multiple tables' entrees. This is important! Our waitress did not deliver us our meal or check to make sure it's what we wanted or stop back in to see how the meal was going. Some random dude just plopped off our plates and sauntered on for more deliveries. The Pad Kee Mao was goodish but a huge let down. It tasted like a standard frozen/packaged noodle stir fry you could find at any strip mall Thai restaurant, uneventful, loaded with msg, greasy, and worth about the $7 bucks you'd typically pay for styrofoam take out. The chicken was over cooked, the noodles tossed and fallen apart, and two small leaves of kale were mixed in. My Pho Ga was what really did it for me. The broth was under seasoned and nearly flavorless, the chicken was way over cooked, chewy, and dry, and it was absolutely not worth eating. I set it aside planning on sending it back to the kitchen so I could order something else but OUR WAITRESS NEVER SHOWED UP. Not a single staff member stopped by to check if we were enjoying our meals, needed more refreshment, NOTHING. After over a half hour my date finished his meal and I was still sitting there with an untouched bowl of soup. I put my jacket on and prepared to walk out. My date is apparently a gentleman and called for a manager. He highlighted our disappointment asked to send my meal back and explained that I was ready to walk out but that he would take the bill. The manager muttered an inauthentic sorry and returned with the check. There was absolute no effort to right the situation. Not only was the apology half assed, no attempt was made to rectify the debacle, we were not offered even a full glass of water, instead the bill arrived greedily with THE ENTREE I SENT BACK TO THE KITCHEN CHARGED, although slightly discounted. Unbelievable! He paid the tab, which was kind because I was unwilling to give them a dime I was so furious, and he tipped our waitress who was absolutely worthless in delivering service. Only after this interaction did our waitress show up obsequiously asking, ""Oh is everything ok? Did you enjoy your meal?"" Um no we didn't and the false caring was salt in a wound. We left immediately and warned some loitering indecisive potential customers not to bother, save their money, and go elsewhere. They followed suit and took there wallets in search of a more worthy NYC establishment.",8,1,2,Iggy P.,"Austin, TX",364,73,301

Eh... has his it pros and cons. The Steam Dumplings were pretty good taste wise, but lacked any real heat. And I don't mean spicy. They're weren't all that hot for being a steamed dumpling. I'd say a little over room temperature, warm. Salt and Pepper Shrimp were super good. Definitely order these. Pho Bao.... way to much cinnamon in the broth, came with odd short noodles. And they added the tai basil to your bowl. Which I'm not to fond of (I don't add all the typical Pho side plates additions) Basil fried rice, was actually good. Does say it has a ""spicy basil sauce"" but it doesn't really have any kick to it. So don't be afraid to order it if you're not into spicy. It's not to much heat. But being all that was good.... if all you're looking for is a good bowl of Pho. Just skip this place and walk across the street to the noodle place. lol",0,0,0,Candace L.,"Oakley, CA",247,24,23

For example, my pad kee mao was garnished with crispy kale bits which i surprisingly enjoyed and my cousins pad thai came with a poached egg.The only thing that threw me off was $3 for substitution of meat which seemed a little steep but maybe I'm just not used to the Manhattan prices?

The goldleaf is even more epic in person. Maybe will go into the incredibly friendly, diligent and all-around great bartenders, hostess and wait staff. Every request that we made was worked out for us with an awesome attitude. Should we go into the substantial wine list of winners? I recognized almost most every one on the list -- quite a rarity at a Thai restaurant. Do you not even get me started on how good the food was. I still have dreams about that dessert. The little green mountain next to the pistachio ice cream is made of chocolate mouse with pistachio shavings, that had a volcano of dark chocolate ganache oozing from the middle.

We were both craving pho, and had heard good things about OBAO's food and cool interior, so we decided on the place for lunch.I thought that the interior was beautiful and had a great ambiance! The food was a couple of dollars more expensive than your average neighborhood thai restaurant, which is fine because the decor was above average. However, I thought that the pho was wayy overpriced, because there are great pho places in Chinatown/LES that are authentic and cost $10, if even. Here, I think we paid around $16 for the pho, which is ridiculous! The pho was fine and tasted good, I just thought that it was way overpriced, because pho is usually super cheap.

It was insulting. They should have had the correct fore-thought to inform us when we made the reservation. To rub salt to the wound, we were asked to sign an acceptance document for this!2. Money spent in the bar while waiting was for all the mess to clear up was not included in the $35 per head requirement. We had to order extra desert to cover balance3.

The usual tender pork belly was kinda chewy and the seasoning was bland, not like the tender, melt-in-your-mouth savory version that I was used to from a number of previous orders.

Once I got to the restaurant though, I changed my mind entirely and got the Pad Ew Siew (spelling might be wrong). It's a large flat noodle dish coated in a savory sauce, garnished with beef and some vegetables. It's perfect if you want noodles but don't feel like committing to broth.My friend is deathly allergic to shellfish and the staff was very accommodating for to change her Basil Fried Rice from some seafood to tofu. I sampled her dish and couldn't taste the basil but the spice really did have a distinct Thai kick to it, so if you're looking for something out of the ordinary but not too, this is it. The more you eat it, the more spicy it gets, so have fun. Lol her face was getting progressively red as the dinner went on.The decor is really fun. I can see myself here on a pleasant weekend night after a few drinks. What really impressed me were the lesser known Southeast Asian dishes. I haven't tried them but I'm definitely coming back to.

Food was nothing short of amazing.For appetizers we ordered the Kimchee Fries and the Spare Rib on Sugar Cane Skewer. Both were packed with flavor and hit the asian fusion mark on the head. The Sugar Cane Skewers had elements of Vietnamese cuisine and was a delight to try. For entrees I ordered the Clay Pot Catfish and my friends ordered the Bun Bo Hue and the Spicy Lemongrass Kalbi Short Ribs.

4.0,8/20/2018,"I'm normally pretty skeptical of places that serve various cuisines - in this case, Thai and Vietnamese. But I decided to give OBAO a try anyway and I'm glad I did. I came in at around 5:45 on a Thursday with a friend. Happy hour is only until 6. You can get $10 cocktails, $7 wine, $5 beer, and $5 sake. It would be nice if their happy hour was extended by a bit because 6 is pretty early (especially since there are many other Thai places in the area which have happy hour until 8).But onto the food. To start, we had the fresh shrimp rolls (poached shrimp, bean sprouts, mint leaves, and scallions wrapped in Vietnamese rice paper served with hoisin peanut sauce) and the spare ribs on sugar cane skewers (grilled thin sliced spare ribs wrapped around sugarcane skewers, crushed peanuts, and sesame oil served with hoisin peanut sauce). They're not really spare ribs - more like thinly sliced pork, wrapped and cooked around a stalk of sugar cane. Still, it was good. The sugar cane really elevated the pork by giving it a nice, sweet flavor.For my entree, I had the Pad Thai. It was a little too sour for my taste, but I really liked the fact that it came with a poached egg on top, which is what made me order it in the first place. I've never seen that before and it was a nice change of pace. I had a bite of my friend's pad see euw and I really enjoyed it.Next time, I'll probably try the duck noodles or some of the Vietnamese food.",2,1,2,Mel T.,"New York, NY",444,1319,3267

Hanging lanterns, natural wood, dim lighting almost made it feel a bit like a nightclub. Definitely very trendy. My colleague ordered a beef pho, I ordered the duck confit red curry and a glass of wine since we just made happy hour. The service was super quick and on point, my water glass never got below halfway. The food came pretty quickly. My colleague really liked the pho. My duck was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The curry had a small amount of heat and a great depth of flavor.

We sat upstairs across from the bar, and the bartender appeared to be flooded with all kinds of tasks that were not involved with making drinks.We loved the kimchee fries the most.  All the ingredients together went well, sometimes you'd get a bite that was all kimchi, but others were balanced and the sriracha mayo made the kimchi less tart. I'm also a fan of scallions, so I would have been happy if there was a cup full of them on my fries. We also ordered the vegetable dumplings; I didn't enjoy them as much as my husband did. I felt like the sweet potato was overpowering. I dipped them in the accompanying sauce, but it just tasted like I dipped some wonton skin in soy sauce.  I would not order these again. The spicy lemongrass kalbi shortribs were only ok. They came on a sizzling platter of grilled onions with some jalapenos sprinkled on top.  Aside from the jalapenos, there was nothing spicy about the kalbi and I didn't taste any lemongrass either.

They have lunch specials that comes with a small appetizer and a main entrée. I would also describe the food as Asian fusion. I had the Pad thai. Friends had the pad see ew and the short rib banh mi. My pad thai was delicious. Some of the best thai food outside of Thailand, I've had in New York. And this did not disappoint.  It came with a poached egg on top that I broke and mixed into my noodles. Lots of veggies and shrimp and pork. I tried a little of the pad see ew and it was pretty good as well. My bf did not really like the short rib banh mi. Portion seemed a little small, and not just because he's a growing boy. And the bread to meat ratio was off - bread was way too thick. So I probably wouldn't recommend this dish. For the apps, I think I tried the tom yum soup as well as the fried and steamed dumplings.

Kui Teaw Laksa - definitely would order again, but my only complaint is that it came out lukewarm...as if it was forgotten on the ready table and brought out 15 minutes later...3. Cashew Chili Chicken - expected medium to large sized chunks instead of minced chicken served with rice, but still appetizing The food seemed to come out slow as well, which would probably explain the cold noodles.

When we were ready to order and requested separate checks for each table, our server flatly said that she would NOT be able to accommodate our request even though we hadn't yet ordered a thing.

It didn't. Our server had no recommendations when we asked for some. Food took forever to arrive. When we finally asked what was happening, our server claimed that the soup was taking a long time and holding back the rest of our order. (Must be the only restaurant serving Vietnamese food where soup preparation begins only once an order is placed). The food was average. Nothing spectacular that I couldn't cook at home.

4.0,7/7/2018,"Obao can be a little overwhelming because there are a ton of tables shoved into a pretty small space and it's always jam packed with people; it can get a little cramped but generally isn't too bad. Even when it's really busy, the service is excellent with some of the most efficient servers I've ever seen. We were in and out in probably 40 minutes, at 5:30pm on a Tuesday.We started our meal with the papaya salad to share, which came with fish sauce, peanuts, basil, etc. Your usual suspects. It wasn't bad, but I thought the papaya could've been sliced a bit thinner and there could've definitely been more peanuts. The fish sauce was good though. It was a big portion size, even sharing it between two people. I had the pho bo, which was perfect for the rainy weather. I wish they had more options for pho beyond just bo or ga--the bo was good, but damn it if I don't love pho tai gan more than anything else on this planet. The broth was tasty but could've used a touch more anise. The noodles were cooked perfectly, as was the braised beef. The raw beef was okay, but a little thicker than I like and not the best cut, so it was great at first but a little tough as it cooked more in the hot broth. It all went very well together, but I wish that they had gone with name-brand hoisin and sriracha sauces, because both dipping sauces were a little grainy which was distracting to the flavors. Don't worry though, none of that stopped me from slurping it all down and giving myself warm soup belly. The guy had the pho ga, which he said he liked a lot. I tried the broth and it was very light but flavorful, with a touch of ginger which I'm not used to with pho ga (though admittedly, I don't like chicken broth as much so I rarely get it). He said he liked his dish a lot, because it was light and didn't feel weighty before we were about to see a show.

They gave us a table of 4 & the other 4 were told to wait for 20 more minutes to get another table, which beats the purpose of a family dinner. We had a new born with us, it was raining that night so we were helpless & hungry, we had to just wait! Even after waiting for 20min, all they could accommodate was seats at the bar, which at first they said could serve food, but later failed to do so. 4 of us sat down at the bar instead of waiting for the table and we ordered our food & drinks just like everyone else at the bar. The guy from front desk says something to the bartender in their language and she said we couldn't place the order.We didn't understand why and they wouldn't tell us.

3.0,6/29/2018,"I had been wanting to check out Obao since it was rated pretty well on Yelp.  With so much amazing Thai in the area, I struggled to stray from my go to spot.  With a friend visiting I decided to make a reservation on Open Table about three weeks before her visit. On the day of her visit I called to confirm times for happy hour.  The gentleman on the other end said happy hour was till 7.  When we arrived at 6:15, I checked in (I'll get into that whole debacle).  My friend grabbed us seats at the bar so we could pay the happy hour price.  The special cocktails were made up of a lot of juices.  I got an herb infused vodka drink and it was so so spicy.  I couldn't drink it. My friend got a gin jalapeño drink, what was very mediocre.  When we got our bar tab we were charged full price.  I explained that I had called to confirm happy hour times, but the bartender said he couldn't honor those prices.  Honestly, it was a $5 difference and now they lost what could have been a loyal customer.  Before all this I checked in.  The hostess said I didn't have a reservation.  She made me stand there for about ten mins with my Open Table app open to prove I did have a reservation.  She scrolled between her computer and my phone. I felt uncomfortable especially because she wasn't saying much.  She then proceeded to check others in as I awkwardly stood there. Finally I interrupted to ask if we will be able to get a table.  She said yes. It was a pretty awkward start to our night out.  At this point I debated walking out but I really wanted my friend to have a good dinner. At the table my friend ordered Sauvignon Blac.  It was so expired that it tingled on her tongue.For dinner I had pad see ew.  It was my first time trying it.  The beef was tender.  My friend had pad Thai.  It was served with an egg on top.  Portions are much smaller than most Thai restaurants.  The ambiance is nice and our waitress was pleasant but I doubt I'd return or at least bring friends there since the experience is so unpredictable.",9,4,4,Chrissy H.,"Manhattan, NY",135,399,1291
3.0,6/28/2018,"Stopped by OBAO en route to NJ from MA for a wedding, so of course my friend and I were extremely hyped! We even parked in a lot to quickly grab a table to chow down. We stopped in during happy hour, so we grabbed the lunch special of pad kee mao with steamed dumplings as the starter, with Chinese broccoli, cashew chicken chili, and a bowl of rice, on the side. The food arrived shortly after ordering, with the portions surprising us in how small they were. We requested the pad kee mao to be of medium spicyness, but I thought it didn't have any sort of kick. All of the dishes weren't as a flavorful as I thought they'd be, and I was sad there wasn't any Sriracha, hot oil, or soy sauce on the table to make up for that. All this, plus three cocktails at $10 apiece, totaled $80 with tip! I was shocked that we got so little food for that bill.

HahahahahaFriday date night with an friend and she suggested to come here~~~~~ she said their food is great and their pork belly appetizer was DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!! So of course we had to go cause once I hear crispy pork belly........ we just had to go!!!When we first walked in, there were so many people!!!!! Inside the restaurant was already a lot of people. There were people waiting ahead of us. Then there were people behind us trying to get in. But our wait time was about 15 minutes so we didn't mind waiting. When we were called we were seated upstairs~~~ Thats right, they got upstairs. The upstairs ambiance was more dark and dimly lit lights. Now I'm not gunna lie, after we decided on the restaurant I was already looking at the menu and trying to decide what I wanted to get...... which in my head was EVERYTHING!!!!! But of course we didn't do that. While looking at the menu again I still couldn't narrow down what I wanted to eat.......... Eventually we had to and we did!!!!  The got the stir fried beef thick rice noodle and I got the curry noodle and we got a pork belly appetizer to share!!!!!! Her food looked great. My food looked like there was nothing in it, but please dig into to find ur food. Cause it is definitely there and delicious. But omggggggg was she ssoooo right about them pork bellyyy!!! It was crispy on the outside, juices on the inside and the sauce over it was just the right amount to cover the pork with a lil sweetness and the picketed shredded carrot and daikon were perfectly balanced. Crunchy, sweet, salty and vinegary. Then we also had drinks to pair it with and I can't remember both drinks but I believe the tall purple looking one was called a bruiseberry mojito??? And that's not the best part!!!! The best part was that they were promoting an alcoholic beverage and went to each table and asked if they would like to try ( and of course asked if we were of legal age) and gave us a shot to try. Which was delicious!!!! Wish I had more~~~But this is definitely a place I would love to come back and try more food from their menu. The waiters and waitresses were all super nice and very pleasant. Would come back again. 3 food and 2 drinks plus taxes and tip came out to be about $85.

4.0,6/21/2018,"At a place with such chic decor, you wouldn't expect such decent pho. As Ali Wong once said, a legitimate pho restaurant must have a bathroom that doubles as a supply closet with a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner. OBAO is nice and swanky, so although I didn't go to the bathroom, I doubt this was the case. Yet the pho was well-flavored and rich, and my only issue was that they also removed any trace of onion or scallion when I asked for no cilantro (I snapped a pic of my friend's because mine looked so bland). There was also a fair amount of meat in the bowl, and though the bowl wasn't large, I felt full afterward.

Well made blueberry mojitos started things off on the right foot. We shared a few apps, the samba spiced calamari, done nicely, not super crisp but tasty and not greasy; fresh shrimp rolls, really light on the shrimp and the only disappointment; steamed dumplings, better than decent with a spicy chili soy sauce; and my favorite, the slow cooked pork belly, tender with a bit of extra umami from the fish sauce. For my entree I chose the roasted duck noodles. Delicious, again with a kick from the Thai Sriracha. Service was competent. Water was refilled, plates were removed, and we never felt rushed.

We ordered Tom Yum Soup for starters which was very flavorful, but a bit watery to my liking. The pad Thai was tasty and came with a poached egg which I've never seen before, and the other dishes that we ordered (cannot recollect the exact names) minced chicken with basil and hot chili peppers was excellent, red Penang chicken curry was alright, could've used other veggies, but had mostly string beans, however the curry as such was very flavorful.

4.0,5/26/2018,"Obao hit the spot for an Asian meal.  I like the concept of crossing over between Thai and Vietnamese.  Two of my favorite cuisines.  Two of us shared four starter plates as our meals.  We had the ""Fresh Shrimp Rolls"", which were the tradition Vietnamese Summer Rolls as I know them, and came with a peanut dipping sauce. Yum!  ""Spare Ribs on a Sugar Cane Skewer"" which I was not sure how they can do that.  It was boneless rib meat wrapped around a sugar cane stalk and grilled.  Unique and very good.  The ""Papaya Salad"" was delicious.  Not sure where the papaya actually was, maybe in the sauce. :)  And last, we had the ""Sambal Spiced Calamari""  Delicious again.  I also had a great drink called the ""Flunk Flink"", a concoction of lychee-infused sake, coconut rum and honey and lemon juice.  Really good!Great place!",1,0,1,Stephen B.,"New York, NY",46,282,45

Its not exactly Vietnamese or Thai, somewhere in between. Usually, thats a red flag for me. I love a restaurant that has a clear concept that focuses on few dishes that they can execute well. Somehow OBAO manages to put out both great dishes from two distinct flavors from the two countries. I tried the pho bo, pad thai, and tom yang soup appetizer. All three was above satisfactory. I really liked their southern style pho. The umami is rich and the aromatics hits you hard, just how a proper bowl of southern pho should do.

3.0,5/20/2018,"TLDR: Pricey, small portions. Spare Ribs with Sugar Cane is great.I wasn't very impressed with this place at all. I understand that some places in NY are expensive, because the neighborhood is touristy or trendy. But even with that in mind, this place isn't worth the money at all. The prices are crazy expensive, and on top of that, the serving portions are super small. Just went on their website, and even their mission is a joke... ""delicious affordable food""? Pad see ew for $15??? And it was such a tiny bowl as well. Even my wife thought it was a small portion and she barely eats much at all. The taste was decent. It wasn't so out-of-this-world delicious that I would be willing to be overcharged for it though. The Pad See Ew was salty and sweet, which I like. As said before, hardly any noodles, and hardly any meat. Don't be fooled by the photos, the woks they serve in are tiny hand-sized woks.  The best thing we ate were the spare ribs with sugar cane, even though each skewer was one small strip of meat wrapped around. But it was very tasty. I'd pay $8 for them, but not the $10 they were asking.  The Chinese broccolli (Gai Lan) however was way too salty and oily. That was the worst dish.The servers were speaking Thai, so I would guess that this is a Thai owned restaurant with a little bit of Vietnamese thrown in. I would definitely order more of the Thai-inspired dishes instead.Overall, we were mightily let down by both the restaurant and the reviews.

Not super busy but one seemed to be serving tables and the other is obsessively washing glasses for the entire 10mins I am there, sees me and doesn't acknowledge me. I finally walk up to her and ask what it takes to get service at the bar. She expresses the fake surprise that is well known in Asia (I'm from Malaysia). Well needless to say, I said forget it and walked out. I will leave the tourist (and 'locals') to falsely prop up their reviews.Never again.

I ordered fresh shrimp spring rolls and cashew chicken. First the spring rolls - they were excellent and the dipping sauce it came with had a great peanut flavor. My one complaint is on how the rolls were cut ... they were cut in thirds so some of the rolls had both ends open. This makes for difficult eating and impossible to dip - after the first bite, the roll starts to fall apart. The cashew chicken was unique - there wasn't any basil in the dish and the chicken was deep fried (it was listed as such in the menu, so not surprised - just have never had fried cashew chicken). I asked for the dish to be extra spicy - it was!  It had pieces of fresh Szechuan peppers - and lots of them.

4.0,5/12/2018,"Great find. I'm always up for Asian anything. But my luck with Vietnamese places has been spotty, at best. But OBAO is that moment I've hoped for, where it was above average, and a place I'd go to again, something I rarely do. It was a random decision to come here on date night. We were on our way to the movies, and we're running late. So, I opened up Yelp and stumbled on this gem. It's a beautiful space. And while it was a packed house, we didn't feel crowded in. But, you need to come in knowing, it's not intimate. And the constant hustle and bustle is too frenzied to come here to chill. The first impression was not great by any means.  After waiting a bit for the hostess to acknowledge us, she was not what I'd call the friendliest. In fact, she a bit of the opposite. With her headset on, the way she was talking, you'd think she was on some presidential secret service duty. And, with a good many tables still available in the back, she wanted to sit us squished in between tables. And, when we pointed to another two top, she clearly was annoyed that we wanted one of the two dozen unoccupied tables, and not the table is directly in the path of where everyone and anyone goes by. She refused us  a table in the empty and much roomier section, 50 feet away.I love the energetic vibe here. The waitress reminded me of a Vegas casino concierge host, with her fast moving action, serious tone, big black book, and that head set the staff love. The service was okay. Don't expect cheery cherry and small talk me with some personal interaction. The servers are very serious, and focused on turn around and top sales. It's very robotic and carefully choreographed. No personal interaction. Seemed a bit rushed and disinterested. The bussers and runners though added the shot of cheery and smiley. The food, OMG good. And that's a big plus. True to form I had the pho bo.  Didn't care for the Spring roll, but that's because I don't like cold spring rolls. As a dish, being objective, it was fantastic, and a definite plus for anyone who likes cold rolls. Energetic. Fun. Packed. Two floors. Great food. Reasonably priced. Great for going out with a friend or friends, or on a  fun date night. I might be willing to go back. But it's not on my must go back to list. . Well, maybe. Probably not.

We had left to ""move the car"" and came back to the appetizers waiting on the table. Great. First red flag: be sure to remind the host that you would like your main course shortly after the appetizer. If you don't say anything they will wait til you're done.

We had to call another very helpful server on duty to bring out our food, because our first waitress constantly overlooked our table and had yet to ever revisit us, even after serving people NEXT to us... who had arrived AFTER us. No eye contact, no check ups, nothing. I could have brought it up as a *different* issue, because it was soo apparent that we were being ignored, but I'm not going to pull that card today.

2.0,5/5/2018,"Been to New York a couple of times and haven't been to any really good restaurant but I kept my faith until OBAO brought my expectation of Asian food in NYC to a new low. This place is a bar restaurant; the second floor has a dining space just like a normal restaurant except they make sure your dining experience is horribly enhanced by blasting club music nonstop and barely having any lights so that you can't properly read your menu. I was expecting some buns on the menu but they don't have any ""bao"" (the white soft bun). Think the name should be ""Obao without bao."" The food was mediocre. The Khao Soi was way too salty, barely had any meat and looked totally different from the picture in the menu. I never expected actual food to be the same as in the menu but this was a whole new level of transformation. When we asked them to fix the khao soi, they brought out the same bowl diluted with water which was STILL salty. The fried egg rolls were decent but the wrap was too thick and hard to chew. Maybe I'm just picky but this was definitely not your standard crispy egg rolls. Their papaya salad was probably the most ok dish out of the 3 we ordered. Even so, the shredded papaya was too thick. I've eaten authentic papaya salad in Thailand and many in the U.S and they were never that thick. In the end, one cannot trust the rating of Asian restaurants in NYC. And this is one of the place I will never go back.",3,1,1,Quynh P.,"Atlanta, GA",45,83,358

Went here on a Thursday night on my own and was able to get a spot at the bar immediately, while there was quiet a wait for tables - typically a good sign but be prepared! The interior is modern-rustic - lots of cool light fixtures and unique touches! The bar was a great spot to hang out at for a bit even after the meal.They have a good variety of drinks and cocktails to choose from and everything that came out was delicious. The menu overall has a good variety and also traditional items you'd expect from a thai restaurant.I went with the papaya salad and the bun bo hue (with a u not an o!). The papaya salad had a super delicious and balanced flavor profile of sweet and savory and I'd definitely get it again here! The bun bo hue is a noodle dish with braised pork, beef brisket and veggies in a delicious spicy lemongrass broth - really enjoyed this dish as well.Definitely had a great experience in a comfortable atmosphere and can only recommend OBAO!",3,2,2,Pascal K.,"Atlanta, GA",14,86,171

Tip: when you order you have to tell the waiter/ Waitress that you're ordering on the lunch menu side or else they will assume and charge you for the dinner option. Pad Thai: 4/5: it was pretty good and flavorful. Their portions are are generous as well. Kimchee fries: 3/5: it was just mediocre, it was just fries, kimchi, and sriracha sauce. Service: Their service is very attentive and they refill your glass before you ask them too. Ambience: They have a full bar in the front once you walk in and they have ample amount of seating. Overall: I'll try this place again whenever I'm around the area. Their food is good and their service is attentive, just have to give them a heads up.",0,0,2,Susan L.,"New York, NY",179,220,1249
5.0,5/2/2018,"For me, most Thai food restaurants that I have been to have always provided similar/consistent food options and taste within their food. The struggle I have found is finding a Thai restaurant that takes the extra step to make their food different from all the other places. OBAO too me certainly takes that step to make their dishes different and unique. My husband and I stumbled upon OBAO in attempts to grab some Thai food prior our Broadway show. As we walked in the door, we noticed two open seats at the beautiful bar which we snatched up quickly. The bartender was extremely kind and provided us with some drink menus and food menus upon request. Their cocktail list provides several various cocktails which all sounded equally delicious. The cool thing about OBAO is they infuse a lot of their own alcohol to truly make their drinks unique and one of a kind. I ordered the Figatini which was fantastic and highly recommended!For my meal I ordered the Pad See Iew which is a standard go-to for me at any Thai restaurant. The different thing about OBAO's Pad See Iew was that it was topped with some shaved mango. Initially I thought that this was a very odd and out of place ingredient to add, however, once I took the first bite, I was mind blown with how wonderful it really tasted. It was an ingredient that made the dish stand out from any other restaurant and it was something that made me have a desire/craving to come back. OBAO is a beautiful restaurant with gorgeous décor and beautiful hanging lights throughout. The service and staff are wonderful and they all work really hard to ensure a pleasant and enjoyable dining experience for all customers. Highly recommended!",2,0,2,Kyle S.,"New York, NY",320,158,750

We came here to meet a friend after wrapping up the first night of our event and it was packed but luckily for us we had reservations (whew). Once seated we ordered drinks and I chose the Thai Sabai, which consisted of mekhong, vanilla vodka, coconut rum, orange juice, pineapple juice, fresh lime juice. I am not sure what mekhong is but my drink was delicious (I had two of them and was feeling quite lovely). Since we were starving we ordered quite a few things off the menu, which included the calamari, salt and pepper shrimp, spare ribs on a sugarcane skewer (my favorite), pad thai,  short ribs, and a chicken dish that I was sauteed in chilies and green beans. Everything was absolutely wonderful. All those flavors literally exploded in my mouth and left me wanting more, even though I was stuffed to the gills. Oh and if that was not enough, we even ordered the chocolate forest for dessert because why not? Needless to say they pretty much had to roll us out of the restaurant and we ended up walking the mile back to our hotel just so that we could walk some of it off.

There are cheaper but there are also more expensive.

2.0,4/12/2018,"My wife and I had a chance to check out this place. The foods were ok, but the reason that I give only two stars to this place is because of their service for takeout. We used the yelp app to order foods for to-go. We found out that it takes about one hour to prepare the foods. We did not expect it takes that long for three dishes. But, we wait for one hour.  After one hour, I went to the restaurant to pick up our foods. Unfortunately, the foods were already cold. Moreover, the half of the soup that we ordered was already gone because the person at the restaurant did not treat the packages properly. While finding our package, she droped other packages on the floor and threw them again on the chair.

2.0,4/12/2018,"It's a shame given how incredible this experience could have been....but the service made it so that the entire evening was ruined with the food hardly salvaging any good feelings.They brought us the wrong order TWICE without apology, and even giggled loudly at our frustration. This came after extremely slow service to begin with, even for simple drink orders. No cares, no apologies, no corrections. All we asked was for any vegetarian dish, and agreed to whatever the suggestion was. The first round came with chicken, the second was an entirely different dish, still non-veg.... For the food that did arrive, since we were seated near the kitchen, we could see our food lying on the counter for ages, already cold by the time someone finally noticed to bring it to our table.The parts of our order they got right were fine, but after two chances of bringing the right dish, frustration overcame us and we didn't bother asking for a third attempt when we had already eaten the rest.

2.0,4/9/2018,"WHY does this place have a 4/5 rating? WHY??? The service was slow, and some dishes were too expensive for what you get. Came in on a Sunday around noon and the restaurant was pretty empty. However, 30 minutes later the place was decently packed.I came with a group of 3 and we ordered a bunch of stuff to share. The Pho Bo is $14. Your standard beef broth pho with thinly sliced rare beef. Nothing special or outstanding to make this worth $14. Now, I get that a lot of places in NY are overpriced because... its NY. But $14 for this pho was ridiculous. The portion isn't terrible, but the broth came out lukewarm. The side veggies (lime, basil, bean sprouts is a small portion fyi- if you ask for more they will probably charge a ridiculous amount of $). Because my friend was sick, she wanted more broth for the pho. We asked to order a side bowl of the beef broth. Now, at MOST Vietnamese/Pho restaurants extra side of pho broth is usually free or $2-3. OBAO charged $5. Are you serious? So this mediocre pho came out to be $19 with the extra broth... If you get anything out of reading/scanning my review DO NOT ORDER THE PHO. So ridiculous.We also ordered the Papaya Salad (3/5), the portion was small, not that seasoned. The Tom Yum Soup (4/5) was standard but had a decent amount of shrimp and mushrooms in it (4 shrimp). The best thing that was worth ordering/price was justified was the Vietnamese Pork Chop ($14, 5/5). It was A LOT of meat (I think like 6 pieces of Pork Chop) and came with a side of rice. I can't speak of the other dishes at OBAO (the pad thai that the table next to us ordered did look good but can't say how it tastes if the pho was any indication of how their noodle dishes are here).",5,3,2,Yoona K.,"Seattle, WA",288,173,566

The noodles had a smoky taste. At first I thought it was their signature flavor but then I figured out why. They precook their food early in the morning and keep it warm in the pan. When I received my pad see ew, it was warm and not hot like I usually get at other restaurants. The service was good.

1.0,4/1/2018,"Came here last week while visiting NYC with some friends. We were all excited for our first group dinner and our party of five was seated upstairs.I ordered the catfish and there were nice chunks on top of a some greens. The sauce for the dish was fine but the catfish itself was a bit dry and the rice had a mushy texture that seemed like it was cooked with a bit too much water. Still, I looked forward to each bite. The service though, the service was terrible. I've worked in the restaurant industry for almost ten years now and it was incredibly frustrating how bad service was in a place with high ratings and mid-range prices. Took probably around ten minutes for anyone to even greet us/give us water. Okay, I understand, it was a weekend and I've definitely done some quick checkups on my smaller tables before I went off to a larger table.Waiter was terse and didn't even tell us her name and just went into the fake smile and, ""Are you ready?"" Ordered some drinks and told her we were in the industry and would definitely take care of her. I don't think she even heard that part because she was just so focused on moving on. Proceeded to ask a few questions and it didn't seem like she knew any details about any dish on the menu. ""It's good."" ""Oh, this one is very popular."" Okay. Cool. Just seemed annoyed that we were even asking. THE WORST PART///One of our friends was a vegetarian of eight years and one of the items she ordered was a veggie spring roll to start. It came out, and she takes a bite. She immediately pulls her phone out to put a light on it because she knew it didn't taste like veggies. It was the meat spring roll. We tell someone that we need our waiter. She comes by, and we tell her, ""She got the meat spring roll when she ordered the veg-,"" our waiter doesn't even let us finish to tell her that she was a vegetarian. Just a quick, ""Okay,"" and proceeds to pick up the plate then quickly shuffles off without even an apology. If my manager found out I fed a vegetarian meat, he would at least go to the table and apologize on behalf of the restaurant which had me wondering if she even told the honcho what happened. Our entrees came out and she did a quick, ""Everything okay?"" and that's the last we saw of her for a while. Only the server assistants came by after that and she was obviously avoiding our table. I know she wasn't busy at this point as the place was clearing out and she was just standing in the corner by the POS system. She dropped our check off, and of course had gratuity on there. I wouldn't put gratuity on a party I messed up on and didn't even attend to. I would also feel miserably terrible having fed a vegetarian meat. She did tack it on tough, because why not? Even if service were decent my coworker and I would have left a hefty tip on top of gratuity. Spent $70 (most of it on drinks) for decent food and, again, frustratingly bad service.This is the type of service I expect at a TGI Chilibee's, not a place trying to be a trendy/upscale Asian Fusion restaurant. There was also electronic music playing which I would expect at a nightclub. Odd choice with the dim lighting ambiance. We were looking for this place to give us a memorable experience. It did, but in a bad way. At least it's still a story to tell? If you're a party and get an admittedly pretty middle-aged lady, ask for someone else.In short, I wish I had more hands to give the service four thumbs down.I hope someone read all this during a satisfying poo since that'll be better than the OBAO service experience.",0,0,0,Mac K.,"Atlanta, GA",24,6,0

We also had two appetizers, the spare ribs on sugar cane skewers and shrimp rolls. The spare ribs were thinly sliced and super tender but also marinated heavily. When mixed with the sugar cane, it's an intense flavor explosion in your mouth. Make sure to spit out the sugar cane after you suck up all the juice because that is super hard to chew and swallow.

4.0,3/17/2018,"The best Thai I've ever had. Visited twice on my recent trip to NYC. Would be 5+stars but they have a hostess named Eve who has the most horrible customer service I've ever experienced. People whoare not friendly should not be in customer-facing roles. I hope the owners read this review and work on fixing this. It's actually concerning because I have an obsession with Thai food and have eaten it all over the country and without a doubt, this is by far the best. The bad service and attitude from the person who is the face of the experience will run customers away. She's rude. She's doesn't greet you. She ignores questions. She talks aggressively. But the food is so good I can't go lower than a 4. I chose this place for my bday dinner and everything was phenomenal except the service. And we spent ALOT of money. Went back the very next day to get more. She didn't say welcome back and acted like we weren't welcome. After spending the kind of money we spent two days in a row, you'd think she'd be more friendly. Put her in the back if she can't get her attitude together. Also, they have a signature drink that have basil seeds in it. Some of the seeds got on the ice and the seeds that looked like mold were floating around in our sodas. We didn't know what it was at the time as it looked like mold and didn't belong in soda. She didn't apologize or anything.  No comps or anything. She acted mad that we addressed it. Then the bartender came over and told us about the signature drink and how the seeds got on the ice. She was nice and made me the actual drink for free. It was really good. But, again, Eve was very rude about it. Do something about her before she negatively impacts your business. And tell her that she never knows who she is serving.

The noodles weren't the flat ones that pad thai is typically made with -- they were thin round rice noodles.

1.0,3/2/2018,"This restaurant is absolute trash. It was all downhill the moment I walked in. The hostess berated me for telling a server, who approached me, that I was looking for a table for one. She proceeded to seat me at a table in the back when the restaurant was near vacant. It was obviously the worst seat in the house because the entire table shook constantly, as if I were on a plane going through turbulence. As I waited for my food, I listened to another customer complain to the server that he had been waiting over ten minutes for someone to take his order. The food was an utter failure. The beef in my Pho Bo, which is their speciality, was over cooked and stale. The noodles were in that prepackaged ball shape, and it took me a few good tries to finally break them up. While I waited for my check to be taken, I watched the ten people working the floor pick at their fingernails and talk amongst themselves, completely ignorant to the fact that there were customers in the restaurant. No one came, so I finally had to deliver the check myself. If there were a show called NY's Worst Restaurants, this place would bring home the gold every season.

There was: (1) radio communication between the servers and the hosts; (2) hot, young servers with Usain Bolt energy; and (3) portions that are just, JUST, enough to fill you up and leave you begging for more.  It's enough to leave you with scabbed knees, crying.All this reminded me of the most perfect relationship I've ever witnessed.  The Titanic.  That piss-poor prick and that upscale skank had what god envisioned for us.  They dated, they fucked, then one of them died.  It can't get better than that.Do you think it would have been as romantic a movie if that hypothermic asshole had lived to get henpecked about taking out the fucking trash?  Of course it wouldn't be.  That's why the only perfect relationship is to kill someone after the first hookup.In other words, do everything delicious and decadent.  Then?  Run!  Run as far as your legs will carry you!The relationship you have with OBAO will be perfection down to every last detail and it will go by fast.  They greet you, they seat you, the staff communicates on their intra-OBAO radio and they send a hot Thai girl with great legs and a short skirt over to your table, all in under five minutes.Drinks order? Taken. Need more time for food?  No problem. *back in two minutes*  Food order?  Taken!  Nine-and-a-half minutes later, my Roasted Duck Noodles Dinner and Miss K's Clay Pot Fish Dinner show up.  Under double-digit prep time but yet, the food was so hot, I had to toss it to release some of the heat.  It was silky, like noodles should be, the duck felt like it had been roasted since the premiere of 'Full Metal Jacket', and the heat level of the side sauce was just right to complement the rich noodles and duck.Miss K's fish was crunchy on the outside and soft and flaky on the inside.  I only had a bite because she hadn't had much to eat all day.  In retrospect, I should have snatched the pot, ran to the men's shitter and eaten every bite of the fish, leaving her to pay the check.  We can always have fantasies . . . .Our curvy waitress bought us our check quicker than a player puts his clothes on after he seals the deal.  This is the part where I felt like I was being fucked and chucked but I didn't care.  I was satisfied.  And isn't all that counts?  That should be the only thing that counts.  Five.  Goddamn.  Stars.",6,7,5,Prateek S.,"Boston, MA",118,186,721

We got there at 7:25 pm and had a reservation for 7:30 pm and were immediately told that we had to wait at least 15 minutes. While we were waiting for more than 25 minutes, people without reservation (!!) - we overheard their conversation. Also while waiting we tried for 20 minutes to order a drink at the bar and were purposely ignored. Obviously you don't want to make money either. Once seated, service was ok. Food not really though - the shrimps in our starter weren't even cleaned. Gross!!! Don't go there. Save your money.

I was pleasantly surprised by the prices given the location and ambiance of the place, although I wasn't thrilled with the portion sizes. I tried the Kimchi fries--good, but not very sizable--and the Bo Luc Lan. The beef was a bit on the dry side but overall it was a tasty dish. Rice included in the price of the dish. Only main knock on the service was they took 15 minutes to bring out a soda we had ordered and we had to ask them three times and received no apologies afterward. Maybe they had to go buy it from a nearby bodega...Anyways, good experience. Would come back.",1,1,0,Shawn J.,"Manhattan, NY",266,93,28

The place also seemed pretty popular, but didn't have to wait since we had a reservation.I ordered the Pho Bo which was pretty good. The meat was tender and it had a relatively flavorful broth. The noodles also looked really good, so I may try that next time. The Riesling I got was also pretty good and not overly sweet.

For $9, you get an awesome selection of Thai noodles and other Thai dishes. I've been to their Hell's Kitchen location and the vibe is quite fun and laid back. They also are accommodating of large groups and space, so you can either walk-in with a short wait or make a reservation.My favorites are the pad kee mao and the simple pho bo, which has a great, filling broth. Overall, Obao's dishes are so flavorful and well priced- I've always been happy with the appetizers and entrees here. Another nice aspect about Obao is that you can order their dishes through Caviar or their website (which I saw is currently giving you 10% off).

The food is mediocre, more on the Americanize fusion side but definitely a very extensive menu so there is something for everyone. I wouldn't come here to satisfy my tastebuds as there are so many other restaurant better for enjoying asian food. Presentation is great as is with the decor and service. If you like exotic cocktails this place has the menu for it and are quite tasty (beware of alcohol content). I rate based on food quality and it's edible but nothing outstanding. The shrimp curry I ordered was mostly just soup and very little in terms of actual content and just very salty. Portion size were smaller given the price (again, could just be Manhattan pricing). Slightly disappointed as the pictures all looked very promising but then again it's hard for a restaurant to serve multiple cuisines and excel at it.

To be short and simple: nice aesthetics, mediocre service, and food was flavorful but portions were underwhelming.The decor here makes it a very pleasing sight to catch dinner with some old friends, but that's about it-- and it is definitely not enough to entice me to come back especially with my other opinions on the place.Coming here on a Saturday night, you would assume that they'd be prepared for one of their more popular nights, but unfortunately they were out of fries and out of one of their most recommended appetizers (the sugar cane one). Instead, I got the pork belly instead. The pork belly was good, very fatty and I enjoyed the sauce. I thank myself for ordering an appetizer even though my top two were gone, because the actual meal took quite some time to come out and I was starving.My friend ordered the chicken rice dish entree (sorry, can't remember the exact name) and I ordered the garlic eggplant dish. When the dishes first came, I had a small heart attack because the portions seemed really small.... (but then a rice bowl came subsequently afterwards).I'm going to say that all in all, the food here is very flavorful. It's pretty good, but for some reason... it just isn't enough? Is it the portion vs the price? Is it the price vs the amazingness of the food? I don't know how to explain this, but I feel underwhelmed.... and that's surprising because I WAS SUPER STARVING (so a lot of thongs would have been delicious to me).

5.0,12/27/2017,"As a native Southeast Asian, I can give a 5-stars review to a Southeast Asian restaurant if it goes above and beyond the standard. Obao, evidently, has proven to be the case. The food is mainly Thai-influenced with some hint from the neighboring countries. I can't speak about authenticity on each item in the menu, but definitely on the spices they use and the taste of the food. My recommendations: + Crispy Vietnamese Spring Rolls (5/5): not your regular spring rolls for sure. There was hint of sweetness to it which was unique. + Spare ribs on sugar cane skewer (5/5): similar to Satay Lilit Bali, this is a great appetizer to share. Meat was so tender and rich in flavor. + Pad thai shrimp (5/5): this is the festivity on the table! Every bite was a treat, and I could attest the excellent combination of sweet, salty, and crunchy spices in it. + Kwetiaw Laksa (5/5): nice job on the santan (coconut milk broth); love the shrimps and beef slices in it. Caution: broth was spicy! + Bo Luc Lac (4.5/5): beef was tender and flavorful, though I've had better ones in the past. Great dish to share for a family-style dinner. + Obao chicken (4.5/5): sweet and sour battered chicken.

We handed the birthday cake to our server at the beginning of our dinner, for us to eat after. The manager kept mentioning that kitchen closes at 10:30. We had stopped ordering food way before that. Then when it came to ask for the cake, the manager told 1 of our friends why she didn't mentioned that earlier because the kitchen closes at 10:30. We were shocked, it was like we asked them to make a cake. We brought the cake and we were willing to pay $2.50 per person as a house charge for bringing the cake. Then what happened next was just very very rude, unprofessional and offensive. She asked us to eat ASAP AND LEAVE. WE HAD  DISCUSSION FOR A LITTLE WHILE, AND THE MANAGER WAS POINTING OUT THAT WE WERE WRONG. If they had just been polite about the restaurant closing soon.

After we ate our appetizers, the servers informed us that kitchen would close in 30 minutes and we ordered all our food.

I wish I'd gone with Pad Kee Mao, that might have been better...the duck was just some kind of ground meat, you would not have been able to identify any kind of duck flavor.

The Lady Boy Daiquiri is my go-to cocktail, but as a heads up - it packs a bit of heat. The spice is great to balance out the flavor of the daiquiri and the chia seeds add a unique spin to it the drink. I've tried a few dishes here and my favorite is by far the Kra Pow Gai Kai Dao.

We ended up getting a second order!My friend got the veg bun, and I got the tofu and eggplant. She liked it, but wasn't extremely impressed. The bun wasn't like normal bun- not really a cold noodle salad- but had a lot of cooked vegetables and not a lot of noodles. Despite that, the dressing was delicious and she had no real complaints.

5.0,11/5/2017,"Yelp definitely steered me in the right direction with this place! Came here for my lunch break looking for some authentic Vietnamese food. Not only did I get great food, but the inside of this restaurant is amazing. The memorizing light fixtures on the ceiling and Buddha statues in the back transport you to a far off world of elegance of zen. They have a great lunch special with an appetizer and a main for only 9$. I went with the Obao salad and the Pho Bo. The tofu in the salad was surprisingly dry and shriveled but still had some good flavor. But the peanut sauce on the salad was out of this world amazing! Like drink it right out of the bowl good, which I may or may not have done..... The Pho was tasty as well. The thin sliced steak in the Pho was really the shining star of that dish. So tender and flavorful. When I saw a nearby table get served the Pad Thai I immediately got order envy.

4.0,11/5/2017,"Again on the hunt for Bun Bo Hue, I decided to give it a try here. I came here on a Friday night around 10 PM and we had to wait around 15 min.Pros:-The flavor of the broth here is acceptable but not the greatest. I felt that they could have added more lemongrass because I honestly did not taste it that much.-Even though it was not very spicy, they gave chili flakes on the side which made it taste better. Together with the lime, the broth was actually somewhat decent.-The decor was very nice; a fusion between traditional and hip decor. They were blasting EDM music which I thought was interesting but I get it.Cons:-Price and portion size. The bun bo hue was $14 and it didn't come with that many noodles. I wish they just gave a little bit more.-I could definitely tell that it is Americanized but that can be a good or bad thing. The meats they used were brisket and pork belly, which isn't traditionally used. I can see why they did that though.-Too much meat (for me). They gave so much pork belly! For once, I thought the meat/noodle ratio was off but opposite to what you would expect. The pork belly was also a bit weird for me since it's the type that belongs in ramen or something.Overall this place is fun but pricey and the portion sizes aren't great. My friend previously told me about their lunch specials and I did glance at them. They seemed more affordable and I believe they start at around $9.",1,0,0,Sam L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",373,97,270

We didn't have any reservation but we were seated after 10 minutes which was really fast. The staff is super friendly. The reason why it is not a 5 star is because our water glasses were stained with lipstick from previous customers and then when they changed it a waiter stuck their fingers on the new glasses to hold them better ‍.

It was beyond delicious - super fresh, green, light and perfectly seasoned. I absolutely did not expect it to be so delicately balanced in flavour.

2.0,10/27/2017,"I always hate giving negative reviews, but my lunch here was far from great.  We took advantage of the lunch menu, which comes with your choice of appetizer with entree.  I had the Steamed Dumplings to start with and the Kui Teaw Laksa for my entree.  Both of the items were bad.  The dough from the steamed dumplings was overcooked, so it was falling apart.  But the components inside tasted very grainy; it was quite odd.  There were two dumplings for the appetizer, but I only finished half of one.  However, the Kui Teaw Laksa was worse, unfortunately.  I really like laksa for the coconut milk base and how spicy it is, but neither was the case here.  The soup base was super water-y, so seemed to not have much coconut milk in it.  And it was not spicy at all, which is how I prefer my laksas to be.  Even with the chili flakes on the side, I had to dump all of the flakes in it for any kind of spice in my soup.  It was hardly noticeable even after that since the base was so water-y.  It was as if it drowned out any kind of spice or flavoring.  It was very bland, as if it hadn't been seasoned which is definitely not the case with laksas.  Of the dish - I liked the three pieces of prawns in the soup, but everything else was disappointing. Service, on the other hand, was a positive, especially from our hostess.  We had planned to head to the airport after this lunch so she allowed us to store our luggage in the storage closet.  But I can't say I'd be back given the lackluster food.  It was a waste of a $14 lunch, so would advise to eat elsewhere.",1,0,0,Jacques I.,"Bellevue, WA",102,1611,2772
3.0,10/25/2017,"The food is average but the service is absolutely horrendous. I hoped this would be a new thai gem near my office but I was so disappointed. Half of our party arrived on time for the reservation, but they wouldn't seat everyone until all showed up (not uncommon in new york). However, once we were all gathered at the restaurant, we were told it would only be a few minutes, yet we waited and waited to be seated - after asking the hostess a couple of times why we were waiting so long and she almost yelled at my friend telling her that since the rest of our party arrived ONE MINUTE later than the 15 min reservation grace period we would need to sit down and wait. The tone was honestly what bothered us most. Had she stated the restaurant policy in a thoughtful manner, it wouldn't have come across so rudely. This left a sour taste in our mouths for the remainder of the meal. Throughout the meal we attempted to get the server's attention multiple times to no avail, at one point she even made eye contact with me and looked away quickly, ignoring our table. The service here exhibits no quality or consideration for the customer's needs.In terms of food, we ordered the basil fried rice, the pad see ew, the spare ribs on sugar cane and the cashew chili chicken. Food was average, pad see ew was way too sweet with the mango relish on top. The only thing that I'd say was well prepared was the chicken and basil rice.

My friend and I were excited to take the food back and eat it at her place since we were both pretty hungry. Upon opening the takeout boxes were so surprised at how small the food portion was. For $15 per entrée I expected a decent sized rice portion or noodle portion considering this is Asian food at the end of the day. I got the bun bo hue and it came with a small portion of rice. Personally I did enjoy the bun bo hue even though it was spicier than I would normally like it - I like spices, I just suffer though the pain as I eat. My friend did enjoy her pho though, she said it was what she expected. Perhaps the portions are more reasonable when consumed in the restaurant.

Once she arrived, it took a while for us to be seated and although she was about 15 minutes late there seemed to be open tables, so it was a bit annoying.

The broth was not infused with the usual spices that's found in traditional Vietnamese pho. Also, the noodles were way over cooked. The correct way to cook the noodles is to swirl them in a strainer over boiling hot broth for about 20 seconds so that they are soft but still retain their texture.

Though we had reservations, we still had to wait until our entire party arrived to be seated. This location takes up two floors, but like most restaurants in the city, the tables are pretty close together. I came with five other friends and we were seated on the second floor in a narrow table in the center of the space. Throughout the night, the serving staff would be squeezing past us to serve other diners in the back. It wasn't super uncomfortable, but it was noticeable. We ordered the sambal spiced calamari ($10), pork belly ($9), and two spare ribs on sugarcane skewers ($9) for our appetizers. Each was good, but not amazing. The spare ribs were my least favorite. The meat was chewy and it was hard to tell if we were supposed to swallow the sugarcane or not. I guess that's up to personal preference. I ordered the khao soi ($12) as my main. The portion was very generous and the flavors were on point. I believe that the kitchen is on the first floor so by the time the dishes arrive to the second, they were warm, not hot. After digging around in my noodle soup, I found clumps of egg noodles (not a fan). It seems that Obao does Thai better than it does Vietnamese. My friends who ordered the pho were disappointed by the portion size and the taste. Those of us who ordered the Thai dishes had no complaints. Though my take out experience was better than my dine in experience, Obao is a good place for a date night or dinner with friends.

What keeps bringing us back is the food as well as the restaurant's beautiful design (the second floor which is only open when the first one is full is worth noting) . This particular time it was my belated birthday dinner with my mom, brother and fiance. I've made a reservation for 6:30 pm on a weekday, which might have not been necessary as it started filling up later than that. Two of us have come there early but they wouldn't seat us until we were all there, which is quite standard even though it never ceases to annoy me. Once we were all there we were seated quickly and got the menus. The menu has a decent amount of options, but not so many where it becomes overwhelming. Between us we ordered the steamed dumplings (chicken & shrimp, shitake mushroom, sesame oil, chili soy sauce) and kimchee fries (spicy pickled cabbage, spicy mayo, scallion, cilantro, sesame seed) which was shared by some of us. For mains we got the pad kee mao (fresh rice noodles, egg, tomato, onion, bell pepper, basil chili sauce. One with chicken and one with tofu) a chicken pad thai (bean sprouts, chive, peanut, poached eggand) and a pho ga (sliced chicken, rice noodles, ginger-anise chicken broth). Like many other Thai places I've ate at, they let you customize the protein for most if not all dishes, which I like. The kimchee fries were pretty good, it was still spicy even though I did not taste any spicy mayo on it and there wasn't that much kimchee. My go to at Thai places is the pad kee mao and Obao does a pretty good job with it. We also got some drinks as we were essentially celebrating both my birthday and recent engagement. I got a glass of valdo but can't say I was a fan. The service was quite attentive, possibly too attentive. The dishes were brought to and cleared off of our table very quickly and they didn't seem to be using any common sense when it came to when is a good time to approach us and when to wait a minute (we were approached mid toast). Once we were done and said we weren't going to order any dessert, we received the check within a minute of that. It was clear that they were trying to rush us in order to seat the next party. This wasn't the first time this happened but this was the most obvious occasion as we wanted to stay longer and converse.

I had an excellent dining experience from the quality of food to the atmosphere to the service. If you're looking for an Asian fusion restaurant to take a close friend or date then this is the perfect place. Now onto my experience. Immediately on entering you notice that the design of this place is spectacular. There are pretty lanterns hanging from the ceiling which creates a beautiful decor. Their menu really has something for everyone and has dishes from both Thai and Vietnamese cuisine. My friend and I decided to order three dishes and share them, which worked out great. We got the cashew chicken, the flank steak banh mi, and the pad kee mao (noodles and chicken). The cashew chicken had crispy pieces of fried chicken with vegetables, roasted cashews, and a sweet and savory sauce. The flank steak banh mi came with chopped pieces of steak in a baguette served with a spicy mayo. It was absolutely delicious, my friend and I got sriracha sauce to put on top of it and that really took it to another level. Last, the pad kee mao came with lots of tender sliced chicken and wide rice noodles. The basil flavor really stuck out in this dish. The pad kee mao was actually my favorite out of all the dishes and I am not even a huge noodle fan. Our total came out to $40 ($20 pp) which I thought was totally reasonable.

I know it's counterintuitive to get Thai food with out peanuts (Don't judge me!), but I did get it that way anyway. And it was delicious. The noodles and sauce are separately unique.

It was extremely oily, the duck was dry (which seems almost impossible to mess up, especially since it's in a curry), the pineapple(pictured) and lychee was canned.I honestly tried to eat it, gave it a few sips. Dunked my rice into the curry. But all I was getting was oil.

When he asked us to tell him again what they were he followed up the request with ""Don't say anything else or you only confuse me"". My order came 25 minutes before my friend's order and when his came it was not what he asked for. Every time we pointed any of this out to our server he scolded us.

However, I was VERY thirsty afterwards for like 8 hours and drank a lot of water. Not sure if it's from Obao, but everything else I ate that day was the same as my mom, and she wasn't thirsty at all so I think it was the Khao Soi. My mom got the curry duck entree, which she really liked. We also shared the Spare Ribs On Sugar Cane Skewer, and that was really delicious too. I wish they had put more meat on the skewer, but the taste was on point.Service... oh the service. I hadn't even finished my dish, and the waiter was about to take my plate. I had to tell him I wasn't done yet. Then when I put the last spoonful in my mouth and haven't even chewed the food, the waiter came back again and took my plate away. Like darling, what's the hurry?

3.0,8/29/2017,"Average restaurant with a touch of thoughtful decor in Midtown. Yes, it's pretty amazing to find a place that serves pho in this particular neighborhood. I had no idea that this place even existed until my friend, who lived in the neighborhood, suggested to try it out. Food - not great and not bad. Portion is on the smaller side. Price is on the higher side. You know where I'm going with these types of reviews. Pho Bo - 3.5/5.0Balanced pho broth with a reasonable portion of noodles. Meat ratio to the rest of the ingredients (bean sprouts, noodles, basil) is quite questionable. This isn't an outstanding bowl of pho but pretty tolerable for where this restaurant is located - Midtown. I vote pho over salads on any day. We all know that corporate America food hits a boring note after a while. Lavender Tea - 4.0/5.0I was expecting to get a cup of tea and that was it. Little did I know that they actually give you a clay pot of tea. So really - you're paying for 2.5 cups of tea. Not bad for the price. I was actually looking forward to the tea more than the pho itself. Atmosphere is the generic Asian-fusion kind.

I take that with a grain of salt since it is a City agency in charge of these ratings but there were some reviewers complaining about dirty conditions in the restaurant. I didn't notice any obvious dirty things, maybe it was the sunglasses obscuring my view.The hostess greeted us and said there is a 10 to 15 minute wait. OK time to go, my daughter has a bus to catch at the nearby beautiful Port Authority. As I was about to walk out the door she said we could sit at the bar. That's fine so we sat at the bar and were promptly served. They have a great deal for lunch. Entrees from $9 to $11 including an appetizer. They did not mention that the appetizer was served in baby sized bowls. I had 2 tiny shrimp dumplings which were very good. The eggplant appetizer was grilled, not seasoned and chewy. The Tom Yum soup was OK. For dinner I had the Pho Ga. It was OK but the Ga was tasteless.

Serious dust buildup on vents but I still held hope. Opted for water after seeing the dirty, caked-on residue on the jars that hold bar ingredients and garnishes. Service is mediocre. No personality and this is more reflective in the lack of ambiance. The decor attempts to compensate but the choice in music just was a complete turnoff.  About 3-4 tracks of Kodak Black came on and I was embarrassed and offended. An ""Asian Fusion"" restaurant blasting rap music - uncensored - that mentions ethnic slurs every 30 seconds while I eat noodles in a hoity toity crowd angered me and made this a regretful choice.Cherry on top was the bathroom.

You know how people tend to smell like their house, so if their house stinks very badly they end up smelling very badly even if they took a shower? Well that was the case with the food. It seems like the place (or maybe the kitchen) smelled so bad that the aroma permeated the bags and the food. I'm not a picky person when it comes to food (and I'm definitely not wasteful) but the smell was so bothersome that I got ALMOST halfway through the food (which was actually pretty tasty) and had to stop and throw it away.

4.0,8/14/2017,"We were looking for a place by one of the local theaters so that a friend of mine could grab a bite with us and then head over to dinner. Obao appeared on the list of Yelp recommended locations, and I hadn't had Thai in a while. Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by the friendly staff and ordered  a drink while we waited on a friend cabbing over. The cocktails were really yummy and had some creative combinations of tropical flavors. Some were sweet while others had a lightly spicy kick. My personal favorite was the Fig-A-Tini, but I also enjoyed the Flunk Flink!The wait staff was attentive and the environment was absolutely gorgeous. The lamps downstairs had an incredible visual effect, especially coupled with the Thai statues against the back wall. The upstairs vibe was also very effective with thousands of little bells on the ceiling and the bamboo umbrella chandelier. My only negative comment was that the downstairs lamps could use a bit of a dusting. Outside of that, it was a super cool effect.When our apps arrived, we shared to get  a taste of everything. I was thrilled with my Steamed Dumplings (shrimp & pork) and the Crispy Vegetable Spring Rolls were very good -- slightly different from other places, with a soy dipping sauce instead of the typical sweet chile sauce, but good nonetheless. My friend's Tom Yum Soup was very good, but bordering on way too spicy for all three of us. Finally the papaya salad was very good and had just the right amount of kick without going overboard. For my meal, I ordered Khao Soi (Chiang Mai Noodles), which is a northern Thai style crispy egg noodle curry, with chicken, pickled cabbage, red onion, and bean sprouts. It was absolutely delicious and I will definitely be looking for that in other restaurants moving forward. It was prepared like a coconut and yellow curry soup, had a small kick to it, and really blew my socks off. Great job Obao!

Has the perfect amount of sweetness, and you can't really taste the strong peanut flavor in the sauce.There are plenty of options in the menu, so there is definitely something for everyone!

They have a good deal with appetizer and a dish, especially for the weekend (it was something like free app with an entree, which was maybe $20, but not even). Very fair prices! And it was fast service! I ate their soup and spring roll app. Yum! The soup bowl was HUGE and had lots of stuff in it (I'm terrible with names but trust me, huge and yummy!)

3.0,7/28/2017,"Got their $29 3-course lunch as part of NYC Restaurant Week on a Wednesday. At first glance,  the inside of this places looks awesome. The food had a modern feel, the entire staff is wired to walkie talkies, and the place oozes class.For my 3 courses, I got the calamari, some penang beef dish, and condensed milk ice cream. The calamari was great. A bit sweet, but it was nicely fried and breaded without being too much, as so many versions of fried calamari can be, and it had a strong Southeast Asian flavor to it. This was probably the highlight of the lunch. My friend got the pork belly salad for his first course, which I got to try, and it was just... bizarre. The salad was a combination of pork belly, onions, cilantro, and apples, with a ton of sweet dressing on top of it. I don't think it worked at all. The pork belly itself was fine, but any positives there was completely drowned out (literally) by the rest of the salad.The penang beef dish I got was good, but nothing memorable. It had thinly sliced beef in a Thai curry-like sauce with string beans and rice on the side. Everything was decent here, and I was especially happy to see green beans in a dish, but it seemed like way too much presentation for a quite simple dish. The ""homemade"" condensed milk was also pretty good, especially given that it's an interesting flavor to see in full, real ice cream form, but it was definitely a bit sweet and heavy, which can work if you're into that. I felt that $29 was a bit steep for these courses, since with restaurant weeks I generally expect somewhat of a ""deal."" Though the food was good, I have a hard time justifying coming back and wanting to pay the same amount for the same food.All in all, I felt that this place tried a bit too hard without tying up all the important ends. We got in at 12:30pm, but struggled very hard to get out before 2. Given that this was standard NYC lunchtime, I'd be surprised if I was kept for 90 minutes without pushing the tempo! After the first course, we waited probably more than a half hour for the second (main course), which were simple pho, pad thai, and curry dishes. And this wait came after us having to repeatedly ask about when the next course would come. The wait for dessert was also a bit long, considering we had already expressed that we were in a rush multiple times. You'd think that with walkie talkies, telling one waiter would result in some cross-communication, but we had to tell multiple different people each time to get things going. Normally, when I'm in for cheap, good food that doesn't try to be anything more, I care little about the service or the ambience, but this place was clearly aiming to be a nicer establishment, and for that, they should definitely step their service up.",0,1,1,Michael Z.,"New York, NY",454,165,358

We got the fried dumplings Japanese eggplant, shrimp laksha and pad ke mieu. The fried dumplings were served in a sweet chilli sauce with a light flaky outer layer on the dumplings that gave it crunch without cutting the roof of your mouth. Japanese eggplant was served in a fish sauce (which you've probably had if you've had salty sweet Thai food). I don't eat fish but the sauce is heaven! The eggplants are baked then coated in fish sauce and scallions that gives a full variety of texture and flavor in the dish. The laksha was a tad bland but they give you sriracha and hoisin sauce which I added and remaining fish sauce. The pad ke mieu was the best thing ever!! The saltyspicy basil mixed with the sweet spicy bell pepper and the sour lemon drizzle was A-MAZ-ING!!

The lamps overhead were really cool but you might want to overlook all the dust build up on them. (Gross)The food.....where do I start...The calamari wasn't bad. I little heavy in the frying oil but still good. I liked the dipping sauce. We ordered the spare rib on the sugar cane since everyone on the yelp review seemed to enjoy it. I'm sorry to say but we had to send it back. It was so greasy. My friend and I just couldn't handle that much fat on a piece of meat. To make up for that we ordered the papaya salad. That was ok, a little spicy. I'm not sure we tasted that much papaya to be honest, it tasted more like something else. I ordered the Bo Luc Lac. I liked the flavor of the sauce very much and the meat was just right, not overdone. I didn't like the big tomatoes cut up and would have liked more of the red and green peppers, onion and lettuce. My friend got the Bun Sauteed with Vegetables. She said the taste wasn't bad, not mind blowing but not horrible.

While the seeking emotion tasted very subtle and not strong, I was hit with Asian glow about 2 sips in. The bruise berry has a stronger flavor and aroma so I wasn't too stoked about that one (my friend gave it high marks though!) As for the pho, being part viet myself I am extremely picky about pho (the broth, meat, veggies, bean sprouts, mint leaves). OBAO exceeded my expectations and I could practically taste the freshness of all the ingredients. I was very happy with the way the dish was prepared and prepped.

The food arrived quickly within the promised time to our hotel room. My husband enjoyed the sautéed sesame noodles with shredded oven roasted duck, scallion, and cilantro.

We ordered three appetizers to share: the beef on cane sugar skewers, kimchi fries, calamari and Tom yum soup. The best ones in my opinion were the calamari and the kimchi fries. The beef on cane sugar skewers are Michelin recommended but were okay imo. The dishes we ordered were duck noodles, laksa, pad mee kao, pad Thai and pho. Meat substitution is $3 extra. The laksa could've been a little bit spicier but it was tasty nonetheless. The pad mee kao was pretty good but towards the end it gets a little too sweet and salty. I also ordered a Thai iced tea which was too sweet imo. We brought a cake and it was a cake fee of $2.50 each. We had seven people but one person left. They still charged us $2.50 for that person who left but we didn't want to make a fuss over $2.50.All in all it was pretty good.

The decor in the restaurant is very nice, was very impressed by that. But the food and service was pretty bad. I'm vegan so I decided to get the tofu with mixed veggies. The entree came with only 4 pieces of tofu and the rest was veggies. That's definitely not enough for a meal in my opinion, the pieces were maybe a little larger than a quarter.  My friend ordered pad Thai with chicken instead of shrimp because she has an allergy. The waiter said no problem and the order came out wrong with shrimp and no chicken. Over all the food wasn't very satisfying and it definitely was not very good. Also, service was pretty bad. My friend wanted to let the waiter know that her order was wrong but he didn't even bother to check up on us once during our meal. I had to flag him down for the checks and he finally came.

Most recently though, they overbooked the Hells Kitchen restaurant. We had 6:30 reservations. We showed up ten minutes early to a line that snaked outside the door. We finally managed to squeeze through five minutes later--after being shoved and elbowed by people also trying to squeeze in from the cold. Thy place was a total zoo. The hostesses were overwhelmed and no one addressed the problem of the overcrowding in the foyer and bar area. There was no room to move. When we finally spoke to the hostess, we were told that the guests were not leaving fast enough and that we might need to wait ten minutes. We did, and nothing happened. The place kept swelling with guests who also had reservations and could not be seated. We followed up again only to be told that the guests at our appointed table were still working on their cocktails. Utterly ridiculous.

And when I say a few pieces of noodles I'm talking about maybe five pieces of 3"" long by 2"" wide noodles. It wasn't much of your standard entree lunch portion in my opinion so if you're looking to really eat then you will be disappointed. Also don't look up at the lanterns above you if you're worried about cleanliness. They're all dirty and covered with cobwebs.

We were seated towards the back and given some waters. The water was room temperature so I ordered a sprite instead. We noticed the back of the menu had lunch specials starting at $9 so we ordered from there. My brother had the shrimp pad thai with an edamame appetizer while our friend and I both ordered the pho bo with the eggplant appetizer. Our entrees came a few minutes before the apps, which was a little backwards but it was ok. I prefer a side dish to dip the meat into the sauce and a fish oil to mix in the pho broth - but, again, I was ok with how it worked out. My pho was delicious and I had a hard time telling myself to stop eating it once I was full. All in all it was only $15 each with tip, which is a STEAL in NYC, especially this close to the main tourist area of Times Square. Only downside was the toilet was broken so it was a bit of a port-a-potty situation. Our friend warned us so we waited until our next stop to use the facilities.

4.0,5/7/2017,"Came here last night for an early surprise birthday dinner. We made a reservation for 7:15PM on a Thurs. and ended up getting seated close to 7:45... the place was popping, and a lot smaller than expected. Once we made our way to our table (accidentally smacking several people in the face with my enormous and very extra balloon), we were given ample time to order. We started off with two appetizers: Pork Belly and Fresh Spring Rolls. The Pork Belly was incredibly tender and not too fatty, and perfectly caramelized. The spring rolls were nothing too special--found it to be mainly filled with lettuce, although the peanut hoisin sauce was tasty. For entrees, both my friend and I got the Pad Kee Mao which came with chicken, egg, tomatoes, bell peppers and onions, served over wide flat rice noodles, tossed in a savory basil chili sauce. I must say this was one of the best Pad Kee Mao's I've ever had. Not too much sauce, just the right amount of spice. The noodles weren't soggy, and there was plenty of veggies and chicken. Only disappointment was the missing poached egg-- I was expecting one after seeing that other Yelpers mentioned this, although perhaps the menu has changed since? My two guy friends ordered Pho Bo and Bun Bo Hue, and both were very pleased. The cherry on top? When the servers brought out a surprise dessert! Although I can do without the embarrassing birthday serenade... so sorry to all the diners there that had to listen to 2 more birthday songs that night. And even better was that all desserts here were from Spot Dessert (since this is their sister restaurant). We dug into the Chocolate Forest Cake - a pistachio and apricot-covered chocolate mousse cake with a chocolate filling, served with pistachio ice cream, and crushed oreo crumbs with bits of pistachio sponge cake.

The restaurant is fairly large; there are two floors with many tables fit for small parties and large. We started with the sugar cane ribs and pork belly. The ribs were good, but not that excellent. It was slightly too sweet. The pork belly was nice but no different than any other restaurant that serves pork belly. Of the entrees we ordered, the best I would say was the the pad kee mao. It was spicy and was full of flavor. The pad thai was as you would expect, it was decent. The pad see ew's beef had an odd smell to it, that it was not fresh. The laksa soup was pretty good, though it seemed to lack of flavor. They provided extra spices on the side, but it would have made the soup even saltier than it originally was. Most thai restaurants have a variety of sticky rice (sweet sticky rice, mango sticky rice, etc) for dessert, but here at Obao, they did not serve such.

We had a reservation for 8:15 on a Wednesday night. We arrived around 8 and were told we'd be seated when the last member of our party arrived which I can understand. He arrived ten minutes later and we were led to our table at about 8:20. They took us upstairs and sat us at a booth against the wall to the restroom. Our server came over and politely rook our order which consisted of one appetizer, five entrees and three alcoholic drinks. About 15 minutes later, our entrees appeared. We advised the server that our appetizer and drinks had yet to be served but we were quickly dismissed. We had to ask twice before the app and 2 of the 3 drinks were brought to our table. After asking a 4th time, the 3rd drink was delivered. We began to dine and my meal (Pad See Ew) was delicious. Everyone else's, not so much. Our friends had Pad Thai with shrimp... the shrimp was just short of fully raw. We advised the server who basically said ok, well what do you want me to do? A few minutes later, we felt what could've been a roof leak come over us and directly into our food. We look up and the AC unit mounted above the booth was leaking water. I get up to tell the server who shuffles me over to the manager who says oh, I'm so sorry. We can offer you a discount! UH, no, you can offer to void the entire bill because we've been basically vomited upon by your AC and half of us will probably spend the night wrapped around the toilet after consuming your raw shrimp. After pushing back, they voided our meals but asked that we still pay for the underwhelming drinks.

The restaurant gives lots of shrimps for the pad Thai. Both dishes were delicious and filling. The decor was beautiful and waiters were nice. They also have upstairs seatings. The only thing I wasn't impressed was the B ratings for health inspection. Hope they get a A rating soon.

4.0,4/28/2017,"OBAO is a very trendy Asian fusion restaurant with a good range of food and dishes! I recommend the sugar cane beef skewers. We also had the pla plao fish and the beef pho. Although the pho was Michelin recommended, I didn't find it to be worthy or anything special. I feel like I've had better pho in the city for the same price or less. Other pluses are the cocktails and atmosphere of the restaurant.

3.0,4/22/2017,"Although I would not say that this place is expensive given the location and ambiance, I would say that it is definitely not worth it.. the dinner dine-in experience that is. The lunch special is probably what I would come back for in the future, $9 for a variety of entree options with shu mai. I walked in as a party of two on a Monday night and was told the wait would be approximately 30-45 minutes. We told the hostess that this was fine and she took down the name, and we had to wait inside the restaurant because they do not text you or call you when your table is ready and no buzzer is given either. They have two benches for people waiting, or I suppose you could wait by the bar.. though the bar was fully occupied at the time that I came. Our wait was more like 25 minutes, and we were seated in a small table towards the back. The decoration of this place is beautiful, I mean honestly.. the lights would definitely draw people in!The menu is a mix of Viet/Thai cuisine. It's actually whatever you would get from a small Viet mom and pop shop but at a premium.. of course for the location and ambiance. My party of two decided on the Kimchi Fries $8 appetizer and I got the Bun Bo Hue $12 (spicy lemongrass soup base with pieces of beef) and my friend got steak cubes over rice $17. The appetizers took a while to come out, but the fries were perfectly crispy and tasty. It tasted similar to the fries that are sold at JoJu for around $5. The portion was a little smaller than what I expected for $8 but that's okay. The entrees came out shortly after. The Bun Bo Hue was good, but not delicious. It was just the right amount of spice and the noodles were delicious. My friend's dish however, the steak cubes, came out a little cold. My friend asked the dish to be heated up but then the steak ended up being overcooked. This was disappointing for a $17 dish.The service was good, our server often came back to refill our water and was understanding when we needed our dish sent back to the kitchen.",4,1,2,Maggie Z.,"Middle Village, NY",878,301,731

4.0,4/20/2017,"OBAO is basically the sister restaurant to Spot Dessert Bar.(chacerestaurantgroup.com) Founded by Chai and Ace, they created Chace (Chai and Ace's names together) restaurant group. The restaurant group which includes both Obao and Spot, once also included that buns restaurant in East Village, Jum Mum. Y'know the really affordable one? (Unfort it turned into another Spot)Chai and Ace both Thai, rely on their Thai staff  to curate the best dishes whether that be at Spot or Obao. (Note: the guy who is always spotted Instagramming for Spot Dessert Bar, Mark is not Thai. He's Korean.)It took me about 4 years to finally try this Thai restaurant and I was surely not disappointed. While some may feel it's a bit pricey, the overall aesthetic of the restaurant from the interior design, down to the plating really differentiates this restaurant from other Thai restaurants. Also, thumbs up for having chefs that are Thai. They really try to keep the food authentic here.Bae and I tried two different dishes. I don't know why but he opted for pho and I opted for the Pad See Ew. While this dish is a Chinese popularized dish it is commonly eaten in Thailand. The name literally translates to ""fried with soy sauce."" But the dish I had was more than just soy sauce noodles. It was the perfect ratio of saltiness, veggies and noodles combined. A literal joy to eat, that I ate it all!

4.0,4/20/2017,"I like this place.The food is generally on point, and the lunch selection and price is especially attractive and will not break the bank. I usually get the pho, and while not exactly like a true Vietnamese pho with all the gory parts of the cow, the soup base is decent. You'll pay an extra 50% more than its Chinatown counterpart, but I always remind myself that this place is in midtown and is supposed to be Asian 'fusion'. The other lunch selections are delicious and scaled accordingly for lunch, and I find that the end portions are just about right.I took away a star due to the dust on the wood walls and orange lantern lights. You would think that since it's unique decor, that they would have paid more attention to the cleanliness (or lack of). That's why it's so bizarre that it remains neglected. It would take at most an hour to clean, tops. I was always looking up hoping that the dust would not float down magically into my soup.

4.0,4/18/2017,"I had a very good meal at Obao last night. I couldn't decide between Thai or Vietnamese food, so Obao offered the best of both worlds!  I arrived around 8pm with no reservation, so I had to wait about 15 minutes for a table. No worries. I sat at the bar while waiting.  Once seated myorder was taken within a few minutes.  It took a little longer than expected to get my papaya salad, and, when it came my Bun Bo Hue was also set on the table. I pointed out to the server that the Bun would be cold before I finished the salad and they took it away.The Papaya salad (Som Tam) was good, but lacked the chiles that I am used to that give Som Tam a great heat.  Once I was done, the Bun Bo Hue was brought out and it was piping hot. The flavor and heat level were great!  I added the dried chile flakes that were provided until my lips were burning.  There was plenty of pork belly and beef in the soup, but the amount of noodles was less than other places and they were smaller pieces.  Also, the condiments (basil, bean sprouts and jalapeño slices) were a bit skimpy.  But, overall, the Bun was excellent.I enjoyed the visit and would go back, but the service timing faux pas (salad and entree arriving at the same time), the lack of noodles, and the small portion of condiments kept me from giving Obao 5 stars.

I arrived right at 6:45 and checked in with a male host, who said he'd mark me down and that I should return when the rest of my party arrived. I saw the sign that said they'll hold your table for 15 minutes after your reservation time, so when the other two members of my party arrived right at 6:55, I went back to say that our whole party was there. This time, there was a female hostess, who said that there was no record of my checking in, and she'd already given our table up to someone else. When I told her I'd already checked in, she said sorry, there was nothing she could do. They were busy and I know that being a host can be really tricky, but going against written policies and not having tables for parties with reservations is just bad customer service.Moreover, I asked how long it'd be until we could get a table, and she said we'd have to wait another 10 minutes.

Definitely Instagram worthy for those who are wondering. For appetizers we all ordered kimchi fries and steamed dumplings. The steamed dumplings were standard. Tasted like the ones you'll find at any other Asian fusion/ Thai restaurant. However, those kimchi fries were out of this world. For entrees, my husband ordered the shredded duck with noodles and I ordered the crispy duck confit with red curry. The noodles were good, didn't think they were anything to really rave about. But that red curry was so unexpected delicious. The duck was cooked to perfection and the crispy skin was so good. Not greasy at all. I'm not a fan of adding fruit to savory dishes so I was kind of weirded out to see that my dish had lychees and pineapples instead of the typical veggies you would find in a red curry.

3.0,4/5/2017,"An attractive little Asian fusion eatery on the north eastern outskirts of the Theater District... there's no denying that it adds a bit of variety to a rather homogenous part of town (with respect to the gastronomical experiences one may avail himself/herself of). The place plucks some standard fare from Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese, and other Asian countries, puts it on their menu, jacks up pricing, and calls all things even. While the food doesn't taste half bad... the axiom ""a jack of all trades is a master of none"" is as appropriate as ever when used to describe this place.Went here for a post movie/pre-night time activity (use your imagination) with a svelte aesthetic, and shared spring rolls, pho, and pad see ew... all dishes I'm familiar with and am quite fond of, and all dishes that I'm used to paying peasant's wages on. As I attested to earlier, the food tasted fine, and was even presented on some very handsome plates/bowls... but other than that, the stuff tasted like I could have bought it from another spot that sold the exact same thing for cheaper (and with larger servings... I suppose someone has to pay for the rent for this space, which they do dress up quite nicely).Despite my sentiments of average food, the place has quite a following (although I casually observed the crowd that Saturday night being of a more pale variety... not surprising). If OBAO be the gateway drug for YT people trying FOE (it's pronounced ""pho""), then I suppose this spot is a friendly starting point for the pale majority to be inspired to appropriate more Far East cuisine.

I particular love the fresh shrimp rolls, which is packed with lettuce and chives, and tastes just as fresh as it does healthy. The accompanying peanut dipping sauce is addictive, and I usually slather it onto the rolls. The vegetable dumplings are also worth trying out. The spinach, corn, and carrot are blended together to create a very luxurious filling, and the chili soy sauce offers a good kick!I was also impressed by the Pho Ga, which has a very deep and complex chicken broth. I got it delivered when I was terribly sick, and instantly felt better.Prices are higher and portions are smaller than other Vietnamese restaurants I've been to, but then again, you pay for the location!",1,1,1,Jenny P.,"Arlington, VA",231,723,753

We're from Atlanta which surprisingly has some bomb pho spots to go to so we had high expectations for this highly reviewed place. We waited quite a bit for our pho to come out, but I get it. Orders get backed up, kitchen works in order, no complaints from me there. However, when our food did come out... wow. I asked the server who gave us our food for an extra bowl of bean sprouts since they gave us a single serving bowl and the guy said ""Share"" and walked away. Wait.. what??? Excuse me? My friend then asked the server behind us for a bowl of steamed onions which are apparently 5 dollars an fresh onions are 2. I'm sorry, but she got maybe 8 slices of onion in her bowl... but we were so hungover and hungry so we turned to our food instead. We went to taste the broth which was lukewarm... no steam... no ""ahhh"" you get from that first sip of hot beef broth. You may wonder if our interactions with the servers may have just taken long, but no. We got shut down on our requests pretty quickly. Lukewarm pho, rude servers, and not a single person asking if our food is okay throughout the entire meal. Our hungover selves decided to just eat what we had and... well... see attached picture for the piece of meat from my pho that didn't finish completely cooking the entire time because my broth wasn't hot enough.Half hungry, half full, however you want to see it, we paid for the overpriced and underwhelming excuse of pho and left to finish filling our stomachs somewhere else.

Ordered Pad Thai, papaya salad, and kimchi fries. Asked for Nam Jim. We don't have it. No basic Thai sauce?  What about fresh chilis? Perhaps you can give me some and a little fish sauce. We don't have that. How do you make any dishes? We just have Vietnamese sauce. But it's sweet. We also have chili sauce. Is this Thai restaurant?Tasted pad Thai. Why does it have to taste like you are eating dessert?  Where's the balance of sour, salty, sweet? This dish was sweeter than a donut. Sugared noodles. Papaya salad.... we asked for extra spicy. It's already medium spicy. Yes. We want extra extra spicy. Well. Don't know if they know the difference between spicy and salty but the dish was sooo salty, had to mix it with pad Thai to balance. There were no fresh chili peppers in there. How do you make it spicy? Not that it was. He only ingredient you could taste is salt. Again no taste of fish sauce or pal sugar or fresh chili. Did I mention salt?Kimchi fries were crispy. Had a little of reddish mayo. Not spicy. Not kimchiii. And there was 1 piece of tiny kimchi on the bottom of the bowl. When we were eating and there was still some salad left and I was mixing that with pad Thai to make both edible, the busboy came over saying can I take it.

First diving into the menu,  you can see the extensive list of great dishes.   It was even hard for my group of 6 to pick the ones to try.  Since there are so many dishes I would strongly recommend that a family style approach in order to try all of the different dishes.   Notable things that I tried were the pork sugar canes,  lobster pad thai,  Kim chi fries,  and duck curry.  A must was the pork sugar canes, the combination of sweet and savory was very nicely done and a great way to start the night.  Though there were a lot of delicious dishes, I would not recommend getting the pho.  I personally thought it was pretty standard and  not unique to the restaurant.  Overall, I would definitely come back with friends for a good  night to catch up with a great menu and spacious atmosphere.",0,0,0,Jesse C.,"New York, NY",41,8,0

Super unexpected for me since I've never had it but so yum! For main course, my fiancée had the lemongrass short ribs and I had the cashew chicken, good blend of sweet and savory between our two dishes. For dessert, we had the pistachio dark forest (or something). Let me just say, perfect way to end the night. Good blend between pistachio, chocolate, and apricot.

We shared the sugar cane skewers, and the shrimp roll, as recommended. While the roll was a bit flavorless, the skewers were definitely well seasoned (so get it!) Opted for the clay pot fish myself, which was slightly on the salty side; yet I did love the tenderness of the fish.

One of our party did not get their appetizer until a lot later, I.e. after the other 3 were all finished, and it was kimchi fries (French fries with sriracha/mayo-type sauce). Nothing that should have taken long. No urgency at all on the part of the staff. Only 1 of 4 entrees was good, and the waitress brought our wine as we're we're finishing our entrees.

2.0,1/7/2017,"This review began at 5 stars - the food (I ordered the duck noodle dish and a starter which was not what I actually ordered) was excellent, very truly.  I suspect that I'd have had a better experience if it had been in the restaurant rather than deliver via their website.  It was 10% off, which seemed like a deal at the time.  -1 for delivery that was a half hour after when it was specified, a delivery man who had no functional English such that he could call me on my phone and communicate.  My call to the restaurant was similarly confused - I believe I was hung up on and they called the delivery man. -1 for my food which was absolutely stone cold.  It was so excellent though nearly frozen.  -1 for the fact that my order was incorrect.  I'd ordered a starter and they sent the wrong one.  To the proprietor - you have excellent food, yet the delivery experience should be much better.  Your use of ChowNow for delivery service was woefully ineffective in this case.  The food arrived very cold, very late, and the attempts at communicating were very infuriating.

4.0,1/6/2017,"Obao makes the grade with its warm, soothing decor and flavorful food. The menu isn't particularly extensive for vegetarians, but the appetizer (steamed vege dumplings) and entree (eggplant tofu) that I did have were very satisfying. I'd rank the dumplings as the best vegetarian dumplings I've had in recent years.What could be improved: Service. It was about a 25-minute wait to be seated though we were told it'd be 15 minutes. (Note: We did walk-in; the restaurant is popular and reservations are recommended.) A check-in from the manager/reservationist would have been welcome. After we were seated, our server was brusque and the order request rushed. It seemed odd; I assumed it was because it was almost 9pm; was the kitchen closing soon? Again, not a big deal if you would let the customer know this.Another low mark for service: I enjoyed the steamed vege dumplings so much I placed an order to go. I won't go into details about the in-restaurant mix-up over the order.... Except that on arriving home I discovered the dumplings were meat-filled. :-(Obao--go for the food and the ambiance.

The Pho was great. I got the beef and wife got the chicken. Both were great. We have high expectations for our Pho. I do like to add the chili sauce to my Pho, but they didn't have any. The Pad Thai was not great. A bit dry and too much fish oil for my liking. Their famous spare ribs on sugar sticks were as good as people say. Definitely recommend. Their pork and shrimp dumplings were good especially with the sauce. I am not huge into shrimp but still enjoyed these. The fried egg rolls were also good.

Everything was just perfect!Walked in with no reservations and yet we were still seated within ten minutes. Only down fall is, is that if you're waiting at the bar for a table, you have to close out your tab before being seated.The light fixtures are just breathtaking and the music was completely on point. Had a lot of the 90s hip hop feel. Now.. a break down of the food! The salt and pepper shrimp was so tasty, but if you're at the beginning stages of a new or potential relationship, I'd stay clear. There's no way of eating it gracefully. The pork chops with sweet and sour sauce were good, but their curry simply blew me out the water. Hands down the best I've ever tasted! It's simply a must!Only negative complaint I can say about this place was the ran out of their rib skewers. Don't think I've ever been disappointed like that in my life.

5.0,12/16/2016,"I ordered two of their michelin recommended items. The Spare Ribs Sugar Cane Appetizer, the Pho Bo. Both were as advertised and absolutely amazing. The spare ribs were thin and juicy with a great peanut based sauce that I couldn't get enough of and kept dipping the meat in. The pho was also very great itself, the soup smooth and silky with a great balance of the broth and well cooked noodles/beef. Highly recommend for the large portion if you're in the mood for some warm noodles or pho specifically. This would definitely be the best Pho in the area. On top of these I also ordered the Khao Soi. It was the favorite dish of the waitress I had and I just loved the mix of spices with the flavorful noodles. Don't expect a broth based dish with these noodles. They're more of a hot noodle with lots and lots of sauce to dip the cracker like substance, your noodle and the beef in. Lastly, I could not visit without ordering the Thai Iced Tea. As far as this goes, it's hard to go wrong with Thai Iced Tea and good thing they did not disappoint. A great way to balance out the meal. I hear the lunch special for OBAO is great too. Everything came with huge portions so I can't imagine how amazing the lunch special must be value wise. Definitely a place to check our for authentic food in the area. In terms of decor, it's a very dimly lit restaurant where you'll struggle to see. Places like these often make me sleepy and did not disappoint this time around.

And I'm not gonna lie - I love eggs/egg yolks! The service was extremely fast, and the server was also polite and friendly. It's not easy to have a combination of both. Once we sat down, we basically ordered with 3 min, and the food came in no more than 8 minutes. Oh, we got an appetizer too...I forget what it was. It might've been a deep-fried spring roll - don't get it! It's very so-so. The pad thai and the pad see mao (thick flat noodles) were delicious! When the two plates came to the table, they were still steaming. The flavors were well blended and mixed, and the hardness of the noodles were on point!

4.0,12/7/2016,I made a reservation via OpenTable and it was really easy. They had a lot of availability for dinner.We ordered the pad kee mao and the duck curry. The pad kee mao was a bit on the spicy side but quite good. I really like pad kee mao and its brother pad see yieu so you can't go wrong on these noodle dishes.My duck curry was more like a soup given the consistency of the curry (it was a little bit on the watery side) but the flavors were so rich. I love coconut milk based curry so this hit the spot. They had chunks of pineapple and lychee in the curry and it definitely gave it a sweet taste. The duck leg was a tiny bit dry but I really liked the skin. I wasn't a huge fan of the rice though since it tasted a bit too dried out. The lighting is actually really bright in this restaurant.

5.0,12/2/2016,"Been here several times and never leave disappointed!My first time, on my birthday, my friend and I got the $25 three course lunch special and it was definitely worth it. Food that we had [on all of my visits, including but not limited to $25 lunch special): calamari appetizer: tiny, tiny portion but tender and deliciouscrispy spring rolls: huge, very crispy, pretty flavorfulsteamed dumplings: I'm not a dumpling fan but these are the best! Tender, see-through dough, five dumplings with different fillings [shrimp, beef, chicken, veggies, etc.]vegetable spring dumplings: just as delicious! Even more tender, if that's even possibleshrimp rolls: green, tender, see-through dough with tons of vegetables and maybe one shrimp divided between the six pieces. Least favorite because I didn't actually taste the advertised shrimp--only veggie filling. The peanut sauce that came along, however, was delicious. I ate the general portion with my main dish.Pad thai is THE star--best pad thai in the city [for incredible $13 price too!]: you MUST try it. Most delicious noodles, shrimp, herbs, and poached egg on top which once you split it, coats the dish like a blanket, amplifying the taste by x100.there are three versions of noodles with chicken, beef, or shrimp [don't remember the name on the menu] come with vermicelli and salad in a huge white bowl. Good, filling, portion is huuuge, even my friends who can eat forever couldn't finish it, but nowhere close to the deliciousness of pad-thai.The ambiance is relaxing and romantic, a bit too dark for a day if you want to see the people who you are dining with. But perfect for an evening. Both floors are decorated with bright thematic lights--the total effect is actually magical. You feel like you're somewhere far from the chaotic city.Definitely make a reservation because this place is always packed! Theater district location plus the overall amazingness of this place. The wait time isn't that bad--definitely worth the wait. On Friday and Saturday evenings, we haven't waited for more than 20 minutes for a table of 4.

Before the main dishes arrived we ordered a portion (five to be exact) of steamed dumplings. They were too spicy for my taste.  Pad Thai arrived and it was great,  with a portion just the right size.  One more thing - the bathroom is on the same floor (In NYC customary and usual all the bathrooms at the restaurants are in the basement with the considerable number of the steps down).

4.0,11/29/2016,"I ordered take out from this location. I had the spare ribs on sugar cane appetizer ($9), the grilled pork shrimp bu'n ($14), and the Thai iced tea ($3).The spare ribs was essentially bacon with the fat rendered and wrapped around a sugar cane. It came with 6 pieces and each sugar cane was about 3 inches long. I honestly wasn't quite sure if the sugar cane was edible or if you were supposed to chew on it for flavor. I ended up eating the sugar cane entirely, which was a little tough to bite off, but very tasty! The app came with a noisin/peanut dipping sauce, which wasn't really necessary considering how tasty the bacon/sugar cane combo was.The bu'n (vermicelli noodles served with cucumber bean sprouts, mint, scallion, peanuts, nucham sauce) was a little boring. It was paired with a fish sauce, so while it was definitely healthy, it lacked the oomph that I had gotten from the appetizer. Little pieces of pork and some shrimp were sprinkled on the top, but overall it just lacked something. I probably wouldn't order this again. I don't think it was worth the $14.Lastly, the Thai iced tea was packaged a little awkwardly. It came in one of those Chinese take out soup containers (the half size, not the full size) instead of a cup with a lid. Taste was great but a bit too sweet for my liking.I'd like to come back and try the rest of their menu.",4,3,4,Jasmine W.,"New York, NY",691,179,765

I had the shrimp pad thai minus the peanuts and eggs. It was pretty tasty as well as filling. Everyone's entrees looked tasty and no one complained.  The ambiance was nice, lovely lighting for the perfect selfie lol.

They were piping hot, my only complaint was that it was a little bit to spicy for my likings.For the entree (which came out lightning fast),  I tried the duck noodles.

Lastly, the eggplant tofu vegetable vegetable entree is absolutely fantastic. I have gotten this 2/4 times I've been here. There is something about the spicy garlic sauce that is just irresistible.

2.0,11/25/2016,"I am not sure how come this place got such high reviews because I beg to differ. I went here for lunch yesterday with my bestie/bro. Service was very poor. We literally waited over 15 mins before any wait staff came to take our order or gave us any mind. Meanwhile we saw the menu over at least ten times and knew what we wanted within the first five mins of being seated. Staff noticed we were ready to order yet never came by. One female staff keep punching in bill tab sheets into the computer database while another male staff was running around replacing meal ware (plates, napkins, utensils) on the empty tables. So service was pretty horrible. Meanwhile another two girls came in ten mins after us and they got their orders taken by the female staff whom was doing the bill tabs on the computer within five mins of being seated. Like what the hell. Secondly, the food we order from the lunch special combo (served from 12-3pm) , the waiter never once told us the food was going to be spicy and there is no indicator on the menu either. So when my dish came out it was spicy as hell. I literally had to force myself to eat my dish then order Two Thai ice teas to drown out the spicy hot taste in my burning mouth. To say I dislike my meal was an understatement. In the bill it said suggested tips 18%, 20% and 22%. Are they nuts there was no way in hell I was gonna follow that suggestion for poor service. They were lucky I even gave them 16-17% tips. I would not recommend this place and will not be going back either. The decor was okay and acceptable. The place is Thai/Viet fusion. But trust me for the price, you can go down to Chinatown Manhattan or Brooklyn 8th Ave and get something much better. Don't go here. Not sure what the high reviews from others are about.

The laksa is a noodle soup with vermicelli noodles with shrimp and pork belly in a coconut curry soup. I wasn't a huge fan of the coconut flavored broth and the pork belly was again a bit dry and unflavorful. Overall, the dish was okay but it's not something I would order again.

After the waitress took our order, she told us that there will be a party of 8 sitting next to us and they need the table for them so she moved the table back. The waitress should not have seated us there because their party was ended up to be more than 8 people - there was plenty of seating in the lower area where we could have been seated more comfortably.

The broth was full of flavor, it's not watered down like some other place that I went to recently. The pho was simple and not too much ingredients which I like, sometimes too much ingredients are overwhelming for me. Shrimp Pad Thai - they did not skimp out on the shrimp, flavorful and yummy.

Obao is a step above the average Asian fusion menu for variety spanning Thai, Vietnamese, Korean combinations.  Kimchi fries were a different and welcome inventive touch. Veg dumplings were good. I had the spicy kalbi entree. It was decent, well prepared, but too many onions to beef ratio, and at $20, is overpriced for a lunch item. If you want kalbi for lunch go to one of the great Ktown places in the W30s like Dons Bogam. You'll get great Korean barbecue, and large portions for a lower price. As a dinner price the $20 for kalbi gets to be reasonable, since Ktown barbecue prices go up dramatically at dinner. I would order other dishes next time at Obao: My colleagues raved about the B'un noodle with chicken, and duck noodle dishes they ordered. SERVICE: we were seated for lunch pretty promptly without a reservation, the place was about 75% full. Service was fine, but they even seemed like they were slightly overwhelmed at 75%. I could see how they could be stressed at handling capacity crowds at dinner.",0,0,0,Peter M.,"Manhattan, NY",63,12,1

The decor was beautiful though! We could only be seated when our full company arrived and by the time we got seated, we got a small table for 3 in the corner. The table was a bit small but it's New York! The seats were a worn down, but the atmosphere was great. We were served immediately and food arrived promptly after ordering. The waiters were kind but were eager to get us out the door, so felt a little rushed with our time. We ordered the Chinese broccoli, pork belly banh mi, and khao soi dinner.

2.0,11/1/2016,"Petty, petty, pettyMy wife and I ordered their fried rice for delivery. The rice we got was super spicy, like I need half a glass of water for every bite spicy. I had asked for a ""side of chopped chili with fish sauce"", and judging by all the chopped chilies in my rice it's fair to say that they misinterpreted my request and added it to my meal. Here's the problem, my wife is pregnant and she CANNOT eat anything this spicy. Fast forward to the petty part. I called them to let them know about the problem. After about 10 minutes (no exaggeration) a third person finally came on the line and said they would send us a new fried rice. Of course she needed to make it a point to tell me that she spoke with the kitchen and they claim they did not add chopped chili to my food. That the chopped chili was on the side as requested and that the rice was normally this spicy. Of course they remember with such perfect clarity an hour later. I didn't bother to argue with her, but I've had this dish 20+ times so I know that's not true. And I'm not blind, so I know the chili was not on the side. So about 5 minutes later, they call me on my cell phone to tell me that they want me to return the fried rice from the original order. Haha are you kidding me? You're going to make this poor delivery guy (more on him in a second) bring this fried rice all the way back just to toss it (I hope). I have absolutely no doubt that she was just being petty. As if I have nothing better to do than wait a combined 2 hours just so my wife can eat. So this delivery guy comes and I hand him the rice. Now mind you this rice is only about 60% full at this point because my wife already tossed the rice she piled onto her plate. After all it was 20 minutes all told before this woman called me to say ""give us our rice back"" from the time we got it and we weren't about to scoop it out of the trash. So here I am having to defend myself against some ridiculous line of questioning in the middle of my hallway having to argue with this delivery guy. Are you kidding me??? Worst customer service. Who needs this? The ONLY reason I gave these guys 2 stars instead of 1 was because the food there is usually pretty good. It's just their delivery experience is consistently bad.

We did not receive any of our food or drinks requested.Last week, we waited 20 minutes after ordering our food. The couple that sat beside us arrived 10 mins after us and ordered two glasses of wine with one of the same dishes and the same tom yum soup appetizers we did. (My dining partner ordered the pad kraw pao and the dude ordered a pad thai).So when their food came out before us- that was just astounding. But it happens. We flagged down a waitress and inquired about our entrees, and she told us apologetically that the kitchens were backed up. Meaning that our food orders weren't even prepared yet. Alright, so we politely requested our thai iced tea and perhaps our soup appetizers, since we were very hungry. So it was even more bewildering to us that another table who arrived 20 minutes after us got their soup appetizers and food ten minutes AFTER she politely told us about the kitchen situation.We requested our thai iced tea but did not receive it... Are you going to tell me that the bar area was backed up too? Because I know that thai iced teas are made by the bar counter side- I've only come to OBAO every other week for the past half month (sometimes forgetting to check in on yelp though, oops).

It's located in Hell's Kitchen on 9th Ave and has a welcoming environment from the outside. The decor is cute and actually relaxing once you get settled. Not crowded at all. At first, I thought this was a Thai place (I wouldn't be surprised considering the amount of Thai restaurants in Hells Kitchen), but OBAO actually has vietnamese dishes as well - some of which are Michelin rated!Of course, had to try the Pho Bo. I expected it to be amazing with it's michelin rating, but it wasn't anything crazy. It was good nonetheless -- I found the broth to have a cleaner taste than most I've had. I have enjoyed others more, but this one is just fine for when you need your pho fix especially on a rainy day.On a separate visit, I tried the b'un with grilled pork and shrimp which was super flavorful. I enjoyed every bit of it and the pork and shrimp were grilled to perfection. I also thought I wouldn't finish it, but somehow was able to take that last bite! That said, I've never had b'un I didn't like. So maybe this just lived up to what I'm already used to? Either way, this was delicious.

Right when you walk in the environment is friendly and there is a lot of beautiful decor to look at. It is unique and relaxing, to say the least. There is plenty of seating and the layout is done in a manner that no space is wasted. It looks like a pricey place from outside, which almost steered me elsewhere, but boy were we wrong!OBAO hosts lunch specials daily until 4 pm. You get to pick from their list of entrées and a mini appetizer for only $9! My fiance and I both had the signature Thai dish Pad Kra Prow (chicken, garlic, thai holy basil, string bean, chili). I chose the Obao salad as my appetizer and he had the Tom Yom Soup. We also ordered the Bahn Mi Flank Steak (Vietnamese Style Sandwich with marinated flank steak, pickled carrot, and daikon) and the steamed dumpling appetizer (chicken & shrimp, shitake mushroom, chili soy sauce).My fiance LOVED his soup. The Tom Yum had great spice with lots of flavor. My Obao salad was pretty decent sized with bean sprouts, lettuce and a thick peanut sauce. Quite delicious! There were only two steamed dumplings in the the dumpling appetizer, but they were a good size and was more than enough since we still had food on the way.Our meals arrived and they were generous lunch portions! The Bahn Mi was just OK. Not a lot of flavor and the flank steak was 60% fat. For Bahn Mi, I'll stick to the hole-in-the-wall Vietnamese shops in Chinatown. The Pad Kra Prow was amazing and packed with an even amount of heat and flavor. The dishes also came with rice. For EVERYTHING we ate the bill came out to $29 and some change. WOW. That's an amazing price for anywhere, let alone NYC! The regular menu prices were appropriate as well. A bargain considering the made-to-order, scratch kitchen.

Customer service it is not just ordering your food and delivering it to your desk and then charge the 15% or more for tip. Customer service is making customers feel welcomed and provide a good experience so we want to go back. My company has Obao as a restaurant where employees receive a 20% discount. When I brought it up to them, they were not sure of it. They said if I could show them later on, they would give me the discount even after I paid ( I forgot the company website login when I was there). After I got home, I was able to log in and so I walked the 15 minutes to go back to show them. Website has the exact details. They had me waited for about 10 minutes, awkwardly standing by the door, and a manger finally came. Manager had me sent a screen shot of the details to her but said since we already paid, they couldn't provide the discount now. It was not how they told me before. She said since a 20% is only a few bucks, it is not a big deal to refund it this time. She said she would definitely provide the discount next time I come back. But she just says that and gives me no discount cards or papers indicating so. I doubt she will remember me when I go back next time or she would even be there...

I would order this againEntree-Pad Kee Mao with chickenChicken, fresh rice noodles, chicken, egg, tomatoes, onions, bell pepper, basil chili sauce.This is their version of Drunken Noodles. This was one of the best drunken noodle dishes that I've ever had. The noodles tasted fresh, cooked exactly how I like them. All the sauces and seasoning blended well. Chicken was fresh, spiced well and mixed perfectly with everything else. I highly recommend this dish My friend ordered basil fried rice with Tofu.

4.0,9/1/2016,"There are more Thai eateries along 9th ave than anywhere in the lower 48.  Most of them are decent to pretty good.  Was in the city with my son for the US Open in Queens and decided to have dinner in town.  Normally we've eaten at Pam Thai, but since that's been a couple of years, I decided to look at what's new along the Avenue as there's always something new along with turnover.  A pleasant and worthy selection is Obao's Hells Kitchen resto and then some.  We ordered a couple of Sapporos (on tap, cold and delicious) at $3 a pop during happy hour, and kept them coming. Proceeded to order a couple of apps (the chicken/shrimp dumpling and the calamari).  Both were very well prepared (Thai food is always beautifully presented.  That it's delicious makes for a wonderful gastronomic experience).  Wish there had been more calamari as it was fresh, beautifully fried, with a nice dipping sauce. My son had the Pho with the broth reflecting the braising of the brisket and anise over the course of 8 hours. I went with the Duck Confit Red Curry, which I had some reservations about, as it had pineapple and lychee (don't mind a little sweetness to offset some heat) but that never materialized.  My dish was beautifully prepared.  It could have used a bit more heat (it was ok, but again, I like my curry blazing). A very attractive room as Thai restaurants 'go' along 9th.  Staff was 'on top' of things, sliding in and out without being obtrusive (I like that).  All in all, a very pleasant dining experience.  Good Thai offerings, if not a bit limited in scope, but what they do, they've 'got down'.  I'd return again, without any reservation.",0,0,0,Thaddeus T.,"Interlaken, NJ",1,53,0

I asked if I could get one egg roll on the side or on top of the bowl (a regular option in New Orleans) and was told this is not possible and that I could order a set of 7 spring rolls. I did not do this.  The crisp of the egg roll is such a good topping! If I was with someone else I would have ordered it. The bowl is huge when it comes to the table. Unfortunately it was primarily lettuce and greens with minimal vermicelli.  The chicken was certainly tasty and a good amount of it was there, but the vermicelli noodles were not enough so that's why I gave a lower rating in addition to it not being very flavorful. It was certainly decent but not 5-stars for me. I would give this place a chance again, this time following Yelp reviews' recommendations.

The heat and nuttiness from the sauce combined with the sweetness of the sugarcane complemented the pork very well.The Pho Bo was pho-nomenal! the aroma was wonderfully warm, with notes of cinnamon, star anise and cardomom, and the broth looked rich and hearty. The taste did not disappoint, with the wonderfully well-flavoured broth and the medium-rare meat. Probably the best Pho Bo that I have ever tasted.Will come back again!",0,0,0,Romita C.,"Rochester, NY",37,4,0

4.0,7/11/2016,"Great, spicy thai food that just hits the spot! Obao has three locations - I've never been to the one in FiHi, but I have ordered from the one in Midtown East many times and its been great. My go to order is the drunken noodles with vegetables (pad kee mao) and thai iced tea. Their kimchee fries are also really good! You can tell them how spicy you want them to make your food, but I don't think its a regular scale that they keep to each time. I always ask for the same # of spice and each time, my order is different. Be warned, a few times it came out SO spicy that I think I had a little heartburn (and I have an pretty high tolerance for spice). However, I can't stop myself from going back!This location has a really nice ambiance and an upstairs area that works well for larger groups. Cocktails were pretty good and strong here as well. My one advise would be for them to get a few more appetizers that are veg friendly (in their delivery menu).   I've tried a bunch of Thai spots in Manhattan and this one is definitely on my top three list.",0,0,1,Ridd M.,"Montclair, NJ",193,83,70

3.0,6/26/2016,"A friend HIGHly recommended this place so we decided to check it out. There were 7 of us, with a 6p reservation. 5 of us arrived at 5:45 and we were told they wouldn't seat us until the entire party was there. Fine. We waited. While we waited we took the kids to the bathroom upstairs and noticed that there was a totally empty dining room up there where it was quieter and, frankly, more climate controlled. When we got back downstairs we requested to sit upstairs if possible. They said we couldn't sit there until 6. We said that was fine since our friends weren't there yet anyway. At 6, our friends were less than 10 minutes away and we said that we would order for the whole table since the kids were hungry and everyone knew what we would be ordering. We asked if we could sit if we ordered all our food and drinks right away and they said in response ""our policy is not to seat the table until all members of the party get here"". I said I understood this policy but wouldn't it help if we just ordered right away? 7 times the women at the hostess counter repeated this phrase: ""our policy is not to seat the table until all members of the party get here"". I started to feel like I was talking to a robot or a Stepford wife. They wouldn't communicate with me about why the policy was in place- my assumption was because they didn't want people taking up valuable table space while others were waiting for tables- and this makes perfect sense. But again, they wouldn't consider seating even if we ordered right away. I asked to speak with the manager and she actually repeated the same exact phrase to me more than once. I asked her if by ordering right away we could possibly help the restaurant move their evening along. She said no, then agreed to seat us if we had our friends sit at a separate table if they were more than 15 minutes late. I agreed (I knew they were 2 min away at this point). She then said that we couldn't sit upstairs until 6. I pointed out that it was already past 6. She said, actually, not until 6:15. UGH. Our 2 others walked in at 6:07 and we prepared to sit downstairs when they finally agreed to put us upstairs. Needless to say, my 20 minutes of waiting to sit was totally unpleasant because of dealing with the robots at the hostess stand. I've actually been watching the show ""Humans"" about synthetic humans and these ladies really reminded me of how they can be programmed to be completely circular in their communication and ultimately frustrating.Anyway, we did finally sit- and upstairs to boot- so let's move on.Our servers upstairs were much more human and pleasant. The food was very good. Not great, but very good. We had: crispy duck confit curry which was very interesting, with lychees and pineapples in the curry. A very nice flavor actually. The pad thai comes with a poached egg that you can pop which was a very nice touch and added a creamier flavor than the usual scrambled bits. Sugar cane pork ribs- fun but too little meat. Pork belly- just ok. Pad See Iew- very good. Fresh spring rolls with peanut dipping sauce is something I could eat almost every day and this one was very good. Desserts were not interesting but the kids each had a bowl of sorbet they enjoyed.",0,0,0,JA H.,"Berkeley, CA",0,20,0

2.0,6/22/2016,"I REALLY wanted to like this place. I was so excited because they had Michelin rated dishes. Meh. Okay first off, I met my friend there. She sat at the bar & had a drink because they wouldn't seat her until I got there. Fine. I got there and we were seated, but they wouldn't let us order until my friend closed out her bar tab and opened up a table tab......They also could not split our bill without us telling them exactly how much on each card. They just made everything difficult, which I was not expecting for a ""nicer"" restaurant.The food was not very impressive, either. Which is where my rating mainly comes from. (since food matter most :P...)1) The sugar cane rib skewers were actually REALLY good. I loved them. I would get them again.2) Tasted the pad thai and it was okay...kind of saucy and they used thin noodles instead of the usual ""pad thai"" noodles. 3) I ordered B'un with chicken (Michelin rated). The waitress told me it wasn't spicy (I can't eat spicy foods). I was expecting a noodle dish with chicken and a sauce, some veggies and a ton of flavor. I was very disappointed. My dish LOOKED full and amazing. From the bottom, there was a sauce (which was kind of spicy)...like a soup. Then a TON of shredded lettuce. Then about 1/4 cup of vermicelli noddles. and a lot of chicken. I hardly tasted any peanuts or scallions. I had to spit out more than one bite because this lettuce was bruised, wilted and sour.

5.0,6/20/2016,"Came here as a party of 4 and will certainly be back!Location/Accessibility :  Easy to find on the street, and close to the ACE.  Slightly closer to 42nd St than 50th, but both would do just fine.  Ambience : I loved this place.  The bar area is close to and open to the street side.  It brightened up the restaurant and made the space seem more open.  As you go further into the restaurant, you'll find the main seating area.  While there was plenty of seating, I definitely didn't feel squished next to any strangers and didn't have any random butts in my face from shuffling around.  They utilized their   space well.  I really liked the decor.  I wasn't able to get a good photo of it, but they had these orange light fixtures that from afar, reminded me of ""lanterns"" in the shape of hot air balloons.  The lighting was dim, but not so much that I ever felt like it was dark; it was nice and soft for a relaxing dinner.  They also use mirrors which always helps to make a space look a little larger.  The bar and the tables were the type of wood that seemed a bit rustic, but very homey.  By the time we were finished with dinner, the restaurant was packed, but never did I feel like I had to yell to be heard or that I couldn't hear someone speaking.  If I could pick one word to describe how it felt being there, I would say : pleasant.Service : The bar tender was very prompt upon me sitting at the bar.  She made sure to ask if I had any questions about the drink menu.  The drink came out very quickly.  The only tiff I have is that she put two drinks on the same tab, when I fully intended to pay for my own.  The hostess was very kind upon seating our party of 4.The server acknowledged our table right away.  This is something that people take for granted I think.  I've been to places where I was sitting for 15 minutes if not more before anyone came to the table.  In any case, we were all pretty quick to figure out what we wanted, and likewise, the food was INCREDIBLY quick to come out.  Another thing people may take for granted : clearing of the table.  Not that I need to be waited on hand and foot, but I appreciate that it shows how attentive they are and at what standard they hold their service at.  Bussers (I assume?) were very polite upon asking if they could take dishes away, and were very timely.  It's as if they knew the exact moment to come in.  When we asked for the check, it came and was turned around really quickly.  I suppose I keep mentioning how fast the service was.  While this is certainly a plus, I don't want to take away from the fact that their service was also quality! Food and Drink : I got a drink just to get one, but I'm actually glad that I did. Thai Sabai - This one is SWEET! Just how I like it.  Minimal taste of alcohol. Very enjoyable, nice and cute.  I originally looked at the menu online and wanted to order Pad Thai.  However, the restaurant menu has little Michelin symbols for those items that are Michelin Recommended.  Did you know they did that? I didn't... In any case, that changed up the game plan.  I went with...Bu'n with Sautéed Flank Steak - Absolutely delicious.  I would eat this again for sure.  The steak itself was SO good.  My only ""complaint"" is that I wish there were more steak and less lettuce.  Don't get me wrong.  The lettuce added a great element to balance the dish out; it was fresh and crisp.  I'm just very much more of a meat eater than veggie eater.  Plentiful amount of pineapple, which I also love.  The cucumber was less abundant, but whenever you manage to snag some in a bite, it was wonderfully refreshing.  While for the most part, I'm really trying not to revisit places so as to branch out as much as possible, I definitely want to return here so my boyfriend can try and experience OBAO.  Thanks for a wonderful meal and can't wait to try more!",1,0,0,Amelia A.,"New York, NY",296,167,576

1.0,6/1/2016,"I was prepared to give a higher rating to this restaurant until I had a disastrous take-out lunch. The first time I was here, I dined in w/ a coworker and had the Pad Thai with the Fried Dumplings. The taste was pretty much on par with the other Thai restaurants around the area and the service was good. I thought they deserved at least an average of 3.5 stars..That went downhill when I ordered pork chops for pick up. While it tasted fine (not the best I've had), the pork chop had tiny bone shards in it (which I didn't see since.. really who expects that?)..Apparently I bit into one, which led to me breaking off 75% of my tooth. Now, according to my dentist, I need to either get a root canal and take the chance it may or may not hold up since there's so little tooth OR extract the tooth and possibly get an implant. This lunch turned out to be way more costly than I expected given I have to pay my dental bills out of pocket. It must have been a sloppy job cutting the pork chops. I've never had this happen at any other restaurant..Worst part of this whole ordeal is I'm pregnant and getting any sort of procedure is not ideal. They seriously need to work on food prep. I won't ever come here again and absolutely would not recommend it.",1,0,0,Sandy T.,"New York, NY",18,135,232

Mine was so heavily peppered with black pepper that I couldn't taste any other flavor. So they quickly exchanged it for the same dish but without any pepper. And the second time around, it was so sweet, that I lost my appetite. It tasted like they had dumped sugar all over the noodles. Completely inedible.

The wood lined walls, the hanging decorations, and the overall feeling of being surrounded by a lot of Orange makes for a pretty relaxing environment.I got a basic pho bo which came out extremely fast, to my ultimate gratitude. I don't know if they planned it on purpose, but I found that the tables are a little bit higher than normal, allowing you to slurp and sip at noodles without splashing all over yourself, another element that I was grateful for! The soup is a little bit too salty, but portion sizes are perfect and it was just what I needed to come back to life.

4.0,3/27/2016,I liked the distinct interior and the food tasted authentic. The lobster pad Thai was the best dish and tasted just like the pad Thai in Thailand. The pork belly bahn mi was also very yummy and a must order. The Korean galbi dish was just ok. It was a tad dry so I'd skip it next time. The bass was cooked perfectly but I didn't like the tamarind sauce it came with.

Made a reservation at Hell's Kitchen location, and they were able to seat us immediately at the reserved time, which seemed impossible since it's such tight space. We're a traditional Vietnamese family, so my parents, uncle, and aunt were going to be very picky about the menu. I mean, before we even walked through the door, my mom scolded at me for taking us to a bar at the sight of the full bar, visible through the window.I got the KUI TEAW LAK SA which was SUPER spicy. But I loved it! It did feel greasy on lips, but I thought there was great meat to noodle ratio and the curry wasn't too thick or sweet. My mom was very excited for the Bun Bo Hue, but she found it slightly disappointing because it doesn't taste anything like it! That doesn't mean it didn't taste good, because it did, but the difference was unexpected. I found that disappointment resonated among my other family members, but they ate all their food so I don't think they can really complain. One more thing - if you're like me, I'm not into fatty meats too much, but the pork belly was very fatty (don't get me wrong, that means it should taste delicious!).Also, just wanted to comment on the music that night because it was hoppin'.

It's $9 and you get to pick one of the appetizers and one of the entrees so it's definitely worth your money if you decide to get the lunch set. My friend wound up getting the steamed dumpling and vietnamese sandwich and said that both were really delicious!I personally got three appetizers which were the calamari, the salt and pepper shrimp, and the pork wrapped sugar cane dish. To start, the calamari probably makes it into my top 5 calamari dishes (I love to try calamari whenever I see it on the menu) because it's cooked with different spices from traditional calamari and it just tasted light and delicious. The salt and pepper shrimp was delicious in flavor, but was pretty messy since they leave the outer shells on (probably wouldn't get this one again). Finally, the pork wrapped sugar cane was an exotic, yet really delicious dish (and beautifully prepared) so I suppose the Michelin recommendation was worth it.Apart from the delicious food, the atmosphere was fantastic as well. It looked really modern and I really appreciated the design and layout of the restaurant! The only reason this doesn't get a five stars is because if you don't decide to get the lunch set, it's a little bit more than I'd like to be paying for the quality of the food. Nonetheless, it was a fantastic lunch meal.",1,0,0,Michael L.,"Manhattan, NY",1032,172,59

The lamps, the ceiling decor, etc. The staff is all well versed in the cuisine, and super helpful and nice. They take care to make your experience as good as possible. We ordered basically all the drinks on the menu-- the cucumber cocktail was my favorite. If you don't see it on the menu(strawberry mojito), they'll make it for you.For appetizers, we ordered the kimchi fries(SO GOOD), vegetable dumplings and spring rolls. The dumplings were really good.The lack luster part and why I'm only giving it four stars is the main entree that I ordered-- Pad Kee Meow. It was too sweet for my taste(I know thai food is sweet, but this was overly sweet), and not at all spicy. Granted I've never had this dish before anywehre else, so maybe its just how it tastes, and I'm more of a fan of pad thai. Lots of great options though, and the size was pretty good as well.

5.0,3/1/2016,"I was wandering Hell's Kitchen with the bf looking for food, and we were both getting increasingly hangry when we paused at OBAO. After rejecting all the other food options, we could no longer stand the hunger pangs, and my stomach lit up when I saw ""laksa"" on the menu. For such a beautiful place, the prices are ridiculously cheap. We were amused to see a restaurant week lunch menu because they have a normal lunch special for $9 (appetizer + entrée), and I was already dead set on the laksa. OBAO is one of those rare places where you can take a variety of thrifty and splurgy friends because you can get a fantastically filling, delicious meal for $9 ... or spend $20 for an entrée. Admittedly, the higher-priced items did sound pretty good, but I was not in the mood for anything else. The appetizers were tiiiiiny, but then again, I shouldn't have expected much. We opted for the grilled Japanese eggplant and the potstickers (2 pieces), and both left me wanting much more. The grilled eggplant was flavorful, tender and well-spiced; the potstickers were above average (well-fried, thin skin and slightly sweet and savory filling). Then our entrées came out, and I realized it was not possible to eat everything. The bf's entrée was mediocre - well, no complaints, really, but he got something so completely unmemorable that I can't even remember what it was (and I'm looking right at the menu). Something with basil and meat and either rice/noodles. That's okay though because my kui teaw lak sa was absolutely phenomenal. I was utterly shocked that I could get something so good for this price in this neighborhood. It was full of perfectly-cooked noodles and generous portions of shrimp and pork belly, but the star was really the coconut curry base itself. I could not stop drinking it. The laksa is $12 for dinner (no appetizer), but I'd say it's still a steal - not just for this neighborhood, but anywhere in Manhattan besides Chinatown. (If you know a place that sells laksa for under $12, hit me up!) And if you're in the area for lunch, DEFINITELY come here.",1,1,1,Liana L.,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",490,692,2389

I like the shrimp, and poached egg is an interesting touch. I think the serving sizes are pretty good too--a bit much for me to finish by myself, but not overly generous.

We tried a few cocktails and they were all creative, well made and potent. Good selection of sake and soju.According to the description, the restaurant offers ""south-Asian street food"", which translates into a lot of tasty options. As we were in a good size group, we had an opportunity to try lots of different dishes.Tom Yum soup was excellent, very refreshing. Very tasty Crispy Vietnamese Spring Rolls with excellent dipping sauce. Spiced Calamari (service on the smaller side), Kimchee Fries, and Crispy Pork Belly were outstanding. Papaya Salad was so-so ( I would skip it next time).Spicy Lemongrass Kolbi Short Rib was succulent, Pad Thai was very good, Crispy Duck Confit Red Curry was also very tasty.Interesting selection of the deserts. Have to admit that desserts looked better than they tasted, but this, of course is a matter of personal preferences.Very good service, prompt, attentive and friendly.Place gets very busy very quickly, so reservation is strongly suggested.Overall, great experience.

3.0,2/4/2016,"Had dinner here on a Wednesday night. I was a little wary of the service after having read reviews here, but was pleasantly surprised by the prompt, friendly, helpful staff we had that night. The food fell short for me though. Other than the grilled short ribs on sugar cane, which was delicious, everything else fell just a a tad short. The shrimp spring rolls were bland, even after I drenched them in the peanut sauce. The pho Bo...broth was quite flavourful, but had a slightly bitter after taste. The beef was way too dry and tough. The bun was better - the steak in there was a bit tough but flavoured nicely, but it was mainly a big pile of vermicelli and plain lettuce. I did enjoy the yuzu Eskimo dessert, made by spot Cafe. It tasted like real yuzu - very refreshing and tart.

Mind you this place is literally around the corner from where I live, my delivery has come late by almost an hour every time. Tried to complain about my food turning up cold (banh mi sandwich in my case) and have been hung up on.

The fries, even though I would've loved a little more kimchi in them, were absolutely amazing. The best fries you'll ever have.

4.0,1/30/2016,"This is a nice place for after the theater.  It is open later than some of the nearby asian ethnic places. At 1030 pm on a Friday night we were offered the last table. So the place maintains the high energy level experienced at the theater. We had the tom yum soup which was properly flavored and contained a generous amount of shrimp.  Next was a lightly sauteed chinese brocoli with a hint of garlic that served as a tasty way to get our greens. Lastly, we ordered duck with rice noodles. A cup of hot sauce came with the dish if you desire more heat. This dish was very successful as well.

5.0,1/29/2016,"If you're into asian food, this is the spot to visit! Make a reservation to this popular joint. You can also done at the bar, but it's a little more comfortable at a table. Service was efficient. The entrees came maybe 5 minutes after the appetizer. There wasn't much table space at the bar to accommodate the good and service, hence book early for a spot! Now onto the food. Honestly one of the more pleasant places I've tried for asian fusion. If you want to satisfy your craving for Thai and/or Vietnamese, this joint hits the spot. For dinner, we tried the crispy pork belly and calamari, which were flavored and juicy to perfection. Just looking at the dish made you salivate. For entrees, my boyfriend and I were craving noodle soup. If you want something simple, try the classic Pho Bo. If you want something spiced up and deviated from the classic pho, try the Bun Bo Hue, which tastes herbal and spicy at the same time. The meat (braised pork belly and soft, tender beef brisket) were cooked to perfection, mouth watering and melts with the first bite. Complements the soup and rice noodles.

4.0,1/29/2016,"Hell's Kitchen is full of cool restaurants and bars, but I'm really glad we found this one. I think it's a cute and classy place for a date that still won't break your wallet and that serves delicious, unique food. The only thing I would recommend is to make a reservation because walk-in waiting takes forever. In fact, that's the 1 star I took off for this place - we were told the wait would be 40 min, and we waited 40 min and asked how our table was looking, and the hostess seemed to forget that we put our name in...so she said ""I'll try to find you a table soon."" We ultimately waited another 25 minutes until we pressed her for a more accurate estimate, after which she really did find a table for us. I understand when a restaurant is really busy, but they're pretty terrible at estimating an accurate wait time, which was frustrating.But once we were seated, we were happy. We ordered the Laksa, which was delicious - pretty light for being a cream curry base, delicate flavors that could be amplified with the chili, jalapenos, lime, and basil they provided in a separate dish, and generous with the shrimp and pork belly. And each bowl was $12. The service was good (water glasses filled frequently but no overbearing servers), and the ambience was perfect.

4.0,1/24/2016,"Saturday night happy hour. That sh*t is unheard of. It exists! $8 cocktails got me slurrin all night. We were a big party of 11 and we were required to spend $30/person (food and drink). Challenge accepted. For apps, we got the beef with sugar cane, kim chi fries, spring rolls and calamari as apps. The beef with the sugar was interesting; I'm still trying to wrap my head around the sugar cane. It was yummy, but I'm still trying to figure out the hype. Kim chi fries were pretty nom too except helllllllo, they are kim chi fries. Why you put little kim chi?(mad face emoticon) Dont let my rant get to you; it was my favorite dish. I wish they offered a non-judgmental, extra large portion. The calamari is to calamari as calamari is to calamari. And spring rolls, well, you mess that up, you can't call yourself an Asian establishment. My dish was the clay pot fish. It was a pretty big portion. It was nice and steamy, and the glaze was savory. My favorite part of the dish was the vegetable with it. My sister got the pho bo which was different. The flavor is a lot more deep and complex than what I'm used to, but I still drank it up when she was done. The rest of the ladies got pad thai, which they barely touched. Maybe saving room for all the drinks? Service was good. They sat us when they told us they would, drinks were refilled and table was clear when needed. Even though we had to spend $30 a head doesn't mean you have to. You can easily get away spending $15 during Saturday dinner, although I really don't suggest it.

I ordered the steamed dumplings (2 small dumplings-very well flavored and tender) and the Pho Bo (beef pho). The pho was amazing: light, noodles were perfectly soft but not too mushy and the beef was sliced thinly so drew in just the right amount of flavor.

5.0,1/18/2016,"We ate here Friday night and loved it so much, we came back on Saturday.   First off, the ambiance is fantastic.  It's elegant and hip with a younger vibe, but we didn't feel out of place at all as two women in our 40s.   There was club/dance music, but it wasn't too loud and you could easily have a conversation with your companion.   The food was *WONDERFUL*.   We started with grilled japanese eggplant - technically a side dish, under the entrees.  It was perfectly cooked and had a really delicious sauce and garnish of peanuts and scallions.  We loved it and it didn't feel like a healthy compromise.   It was just delicious.  The second night we opted to start with veggie dumplings and they were also delicious, but I did prefer the eggplant the first night.  I had Kra Pow Gai Kai Dow - the waiter was clearly happy when I ordered it and said it was an excellent choice.  I had it with a glass of prosecco and they went perfectly together.  This was a truly delicious choice.  It was the perfect blend of spicy, crunchy (the crip green beans), smooth and rich, sweet (the rice) and salty.  It was topped with a poached egg that had been dipped in tempura batter and deep fried, yet still managed to have a silky smooth liquid yolk when I cut into it.  I was very impressed.   It was unbelievably good and i had to have it again when I came back the next night.    My friend ordered the pad thai on Friday, which was again, excellent.  It was a fantastic and flavorful pad thai, although not quite as mind blowing as what I got.   The second night my friend ordered the roasted duck noodles which again, were excellent and flavorful. But again, I didn't think they were quite the superstar that was my Kra Pow Gai Kai Dow.

4.0,12/28/2015,"I came with a group of 12 for dinner. We ordered 3 of the appetizers: the  sambal spiced calamari, kimchi fries, and the spare rib on sugarcane skewers. Maybe it was from reading all the reviews beforehand, but I walked in with high expectations for the skewers, but surprisingly it was the simpler appetizers that I enjoyed the most. The sugarcane skewers are definitely not worth $9 in my opinion because though the meat was alright when dipped into the sauce, there was barely any meat at all. I agree with the other reviews that the meat tastes similar to bacon, even looking the part. The actual sugarcane was a disappointment because there was barely any juice and the juice that was in it was lacking substantial flavor and even sweetness. The calamari was decent, but also somewhat lacking. I really enjoyed the kimchi fries. They were crispy and the kimchi and spicy mayo sauce was a nice compliment for additional seasoning.For the main course,  I ordered the shrimp pad Thai and tried the Khao Soi (Chang Mai noodles), which was a slightly spicy curry with coconut milk broth. The poached egg was an interesting spin on the usual scrambled egg in pad Thai. It gave the noodles a creamier texture. I had a hard time mixing my noodles though because they were all clumped together. The Chang mai noodles were really good. The broth was rich and really flavorful. But I would have liked it better without the red onions in the actual soup. Lastly, I also had the Thai iced tea, which was also pretty good, but mine had too much ice. Since the glass was small enough as it was, there wasn't enough actual tea in my glass compared to others.",0,0,0,Annie K.,"Manhattan, NY",62,163,1377

Yesterday my wife called to add 3 to the reservation, making it 11 total. We arrived 30 minutes early for a 5pm dinner reservation. The hostess seemed annoyed that we were early and that we had more than the initial reservation of 8. My wife needed to show her the call log where she had left a message in order for her to believe us. We waited 20 minutes for them to ""set up"" the table. The restaurant was completely empty upstairs and it still took over 20 minutes to get us seated. About 10 minutes in, my mother in law asked about the table and the hostess said, "" Well, you did have a 5:00 reservation"" with a real attitude. Thankfully we were seated shortly afterwards and the great experience began. Our waiter was fantastic. Very attentive and friendly. The food was delicious. We had vegetable dumplings, spring rolls, kimchi fries, ribs and pork belly for appetizers and we licked each plate clean.  Dinner was awesome. The kalbi was phenomenal. The pad see ew noodles were perfect! Sea bass was extremely flavorful. When we were done with our meal and getting the leftovers packed up, my wife's dish was thrown away.

Steamed shui mei dumplings - 2pcs - I wasn't overly impressed with this.  But it wasn't bad.  I'm just a dim sum snob since I have dim sum several times a month in Brooklyn and Chinatown. Tom Yum Kai soup - This was loaded with pieces of chicken, mushroom, red onions, lemongrass, cilantro, and scallions.  It was slightly sour tasting and a little bit spicy.  On a scale of 5, it was about 1.5 spiciness. Very good size bowl of soup.  Entrees:Panang Curry - My coworker ordered this.  It was delicious.  Sweet coconut curry base with lot of beef, string beans, and bell peppers.  I normally don't each a lot of rice, but i would gladly dump all of the rice into the curry bowl and eat everything up.  Kui Teaw Lak Sa - This was amazing.  Very large bowl with the best textured noodles I've tasted.  There was a lot of shrimp and pork (some restaurant skimp on the protein).  The noodles were chewy, but not tough, and very smooth.  The broth was on the savory side.  Bean sprouts were severed separately.  i drank almost the entire bowl of soup. The waiter did not ask for the level of spiciness.  So everything we ordered came mild, which was fine.  Another thing to note was that some of the bowls were chipped.  So becareful if you like to drink soup directly from the bowl.Lunch is very affordable here as lunch special is only $9.  Overall we left the restaurant very full and very satisfied.",0,0,1,Ping F.,"Manhattan, NY",112,240,1484

1.0,12/21/2015,"Bad.We (girlfriend and I) had a reservation at this place for 8:00 p.m on a Monday night, and we arrived at around 8:10 p.m. Yes - it was our fault that we arrived 10 minutes late, but if you're going to ask me for my phone number when I'm making the reservation, then I expect you to call me and tell me if I'm running ""late"" by your standards. My point in saying this is that when we arrived, the hostess told us that we would need to wait 5 minutes for our table. I'm not entirely sure why we have to wait at all if we have a reservation, but I can wait 5 minutes for the people to prepare the table - no problem.After seeing two couples get seated before us - even though they arrived after us and had no reservation - we knew we had to say something. When we came up to the hostess and asked her when we would get seated, she told us that she was looking for us the whole time. It was a complete lie considering we were sitting on the leather sofa right in front of her and constantly tried to make eye contact with her. Needless to say, it was not the right way to start the night.We waited roughly 5 minutes for our waitress to come approach us, and when we told her we needed a minute to make our decision, she came back only 15-20 minutes later. If it had not been for the fact that we came here before and enjoyed the food - and the fact that we were both starving at this point - I certainly would've left. We decided to wait it out and ordered 2 entrees and 2 appetizers. The entrees came out about 5 minutes after we ordered them, which was surprising considering I would expect the entrees to come out AFTER the appetizers. The entrees were good, and we never ended up receiving the appetizers. When the waitress came back after we had finished our meal, my girlfriend ended up asking her if we could just take the appetizers off of our order and our check. In hindsight, I almost wish she hadn't had asked so that the waitress would bring back the check and I would see the appetizers on there - something which I'm sure would've happened considering the fact that it became clear that she was pretty much responsible for serving the entire first floor. Had my girlfriend not said anything, I would not have felt even an ounce of guilt not leaving a tip - something that I have never done and never intend on doing.I ended up leaving a 10% tip, which I felt was way too much considering our experience. Looking back, though, I feel bad for our waitress as I know it's not her fault. Which brings me to my ultimate point:Management, if you have any respect for yourself, stop cutting corners on your labor costs and hire some more waiters/waitresses. I can tell you that unless I come back and see at least 2 more faces on first floor, I will leave in a heartbeat as the service was absolutely horrendous. I would feel ashamed of myself if I had my staff toiling away for me and having no choice but to get terrible tips from all of my customers.The only star in my review is for the food, which is good (nothing to die for, though). I sincerely believe that unless you hire some people soon, you're going to start seeing many more reviews like mine in the immediate future - and your deceivingly high review will start to drop to where it belongs.",0,0,0,Yevgeniy S.,"Derwood, MD",1,3,0

4.0,12/7/2015,"Don't be fooled by the Asian Fusion category -- OBAO has consistently served up delicious, Vietnamese/Thai dishes that hit the spot.  Is it 100% authentic?  I can't say, and frankly don't really care.The caramelized crispy pork belly appetizer is amazing good, and really easy to share.  It's served thinly sliced, still a generous portion.  The sweet caramelized flavor is a wonderful contrast to the salty meat, which in itself was a great ratio of fatty to lean.  After having a large Korean BBQ dinner meal the night before, I thought I would be sick of meat, but found myself unable to resist this.  The Pho Bo is as good as one can find in midtown (if other good options exists, I am all ears).  The broth is savory, the beef thinly sliced and soft, rice noodles generously portioned.  The duck confit red curry is a tad small for the $16 price tag, but is satisfying and comes with a duck thigh, plenty of pineapples and lychee to cut through the thickness of the curry.  Should you crave something  less in the soup/curry realm, and more along the lines of stir-fry and rice, my friend's Kra Pow Gai Kai Dow was fun to hear her try to pronouce and delicious to taste.  Minced chicken (flavorful), holy basil (according to the menu), bird's eye chili (fancy-sounding, added a perfect pinch of heat), fried egg (the soft runny yolk was EVERYTHING).  If I wasn't so happy with my Pho Bo I might have been more envious of her dish.  If you are celebrating a friend's birthday, you may be lucky enough to have your candle-lit dessert brought to your table by an enthusiastic singing waiter.  Desserts powered by Spot Dessert; and although no chocolate lava cake was to be spotted, the yuzu eskimo is citrusy, tart, and creamy all in one -- a refreshing, orange creamsicle-like finish to the meal.  Ask for the off-menu coconut rice (which, frankly, should be on-menu, at all times).",3,3,1,Lu H.,"New York, NY",1218,411,1977

We were led upstairs to a table in the middle of the room. It was a drop lower than the other tables and had red metal stools for seats. There were no backs on them, do we were pondering what to do with our coats (it is December after all).  We asked the hostess, and she took our coats downstairs and hung them for us. My back was hurting a bit from sitting for two hours without support. We all ordered cocktails. The Fig-A-Tini was delightful. My husband had the Thai Sabai and enjoyed it. The Bruiseberry Mojito was the fan favorite.

All of the apps disappeared rather quickly. For my entrée, I had the Bo Luc Lac (seared flank steak cubes, tomato, lettuce, onion, bell pepper).  It was excellent!  The steak was cooked perfectly and the dish had the perfect amount of flavor. My husband ordered the Pad Kee Mao and enjoyed his as well. We ordered a dessert for the birthday boy and it was delivered by three waiters singing. That was a great way to end the meal. The restaurant was super busy and as a result, it took awhile to get the bill from our waiter. So, the kitchen is in the basement (common for NYC restaurants), and they have this awesome food elevator that brings the food upstairs. Definitely keep and eye out for it. I would absolutely return for another meal if in the area. My flank steak was that good.",3,1,2,Michelle B.,"North Caldwell, NJ",322,256,1418

Service is usually good, though on one occasion the waitress forgot our appetizer and then someone else took one of our plates before we were done. Besides those instances service has been pretty decent.Food is really good... I especially love their pho. Though I find it odd that I have to ask for hoisin and sriracha. I wish they used white onion instead of red as well. Their calamari is super tender and flavorful. Short rib on sugarcane is overrated- sorry! It's just a tiny amount of food for the price. Tasty, but not worth it to me. The pad Thai comes with an egg which I've never seen before, but is a nice touch. Tried the laksa and it was amazing, I couldn't help but think about how bad it was for me the whole time though lol...Location is okay, but worth a decent trek I think. Overalls would recommend!!

The sweetness of the sauce complemented the pork really well, and the presentation of the dish was impressive. I had the shrimp fried rice while my girlfriend had the lak sa. We both thought our dishes were delicious. The flavor of the food is more Westernized, but the quality of ingredients is high and the seasoning is spot-on.

3.0,11/30/2015,"Came here for lunch by myself. Standard turn-and-burn Thai/Viet restaurant.Good lunch combo deal ($9) nets you an appetizer and a lunch-sized entree (smaller than dinner portions). I got the steamed/fried dumplings which are the fried versions of the dinner steamed dumplings. The filling is average and not very flavorful, but the chili sauce it's drenched in is quite addicting. (You get two small dumplings for the lunch appetizer.)I got the Pad See Iew, which was very flavorful. I love Pad See Ew and OBAO did this dish well. The noodles soaked up all the sauce well and it was a good mix between sweet and savory. The beef was tender and the mango slices on top were a good addition.I also got the Kimchi fries, which are mediocre. The kimchi flavor is lacking, and the fries are very standard.

1.0,11/29/2015,"I did not have high hopes for this place since this place was located in an area not known for Asian food but it was located in Hell's Kitchen. There were good ratings and they had a lunch special for $9 to include an Appetizer and Entree so thought I'd give it a try. Additionally, Happy Hour also started. (this was last minute btw.) First of all, this place is owned and operated by Thais and not Vietnamese. They've added Pho and a few Vietnamese dishes just to give it a Vietnamese flare.The Hostess was welcoming with a smile and sat us. A male server took our drink orders and was friendly with a smile. The staff subsequent to these two were the exact opposite. Two males brought our food out and tended to us like we had the plague. The plates were dropped on the table, no smiles, and they acted very snooty. They grunted as opposed to speaking to us.I ordered the Pho (naturally) and the Eggplant Appetizer. The eggplants were sliced and grilled and drizzled with fish sauce. The Pho was brought in a deep bowl and a minute portion of bean sprouts, basil, and a slice of lemon. Not good thus far. The Pho looked good until I tasted the broth. The flavor was lacking which would've required a hell of alot of Hoison and Sriracha but still wouldn't save the Pho. There was a strong hint of MSG which later gave me heartburn. My daughter ordered grilled pork chop served with rice and fish sauce. The meat was dry and tough indicating this was not fresh but had been grilled, refrigerated, and reheated to serve. Not impressed. We also ordered the Spare Ribs on Sugar Cane Skewers. This was a joke. It looked like bacon wrapped sugar canes. We asked if this was right as it may be a mistake but was told this was correct. It was also dry like the pork chop dish. Didn't even finish the dish. BTW, both the Pho and the Spare Ribs on Sugar Cane Skewers, according to them, are Michelin recommended. (hahahaha)Again, I did not have high expectations for this place, but the two Michelin recommended dishes did not sit well with.

Despairing at the potential alternative choices, I was happy to find OBAO and give it a try.The restaurant itself had nice modern decor and staff who were, for the most part, attentive. My companion and I took advantage of their lunch special to try out some appetizers. The Tong Yum soup was nice and spicy but on the tangier side - too tangy for my friend's taste, but I polished it off. The dumplings were small, but pretty good.As for the entrees, I really, really liked their pho broth - clear and tasty on the sweet, aromatic side. No murky, overly salty flavors here. Different than most other pho places I've tried. I did miss the presence of variety in the meat though - no tripe or tendon - although eating in a tourist location I expected it. Had quite a bit of noodles left over so I wished there was more meat and veggies, but even that I finished since the broth was so tasty.My companion enjoyed a curry dish, which he said was comparable to others he's had in the past, but not as memorable as the pho.The Thai iced tea was delicious! Wish they used a bigger glass, it was so good.There are other excellent Vietnamese places in the city, but if you happen to be stuck in this area of town, OBAO is a viable option.",3,1,2,Gracie J.,"Irvine, CA",257,835,434

3.0,11/19/2015,"2 stars for the pho* + 1 for the delicious thai iced teaI came here specifically because I was craving pho. The wait was 20 minutes, not bad for dinner rush hour on a Sunday night. Plus I loved the lights on the inside! So my friend and I waited, admired the interior decor and then got seated in the most unnoticeable corner of the restaurant. I was hungry and glad that we finally got seated (and pretty low maintenance when it comes to stuff like this) so I didn't complain. When I sat down, I realized that something was vibrating...IT WAS THE ENTIRE WALL to my immediate left...so that was an exciting touch to my dining experience. My friend ordered a pad thai (made only with shrimp here on the menu) and I got a pho bo and a thai iced tea. When I got used to the wall buzzing, our food came. The pho broth was lukewarm and was served with a plate of bean sprouts, basil leaves and a lime - standard. I'm the type of person who likes my broth burning hot. I also noticed that the meat wasn't cooked through - typical for pho, but a problem since the broth was not hot enough for it to cook. I decided to YOLO and not let a couple slice of round-eye steak ruin my dinner (learned it was a bad idea the hard way later). The broth itself was not the most savory - it was on the sweeter side in my opinion. The thai iced tea was phenomenal, though! I wish the glass they poured it in was bigger. I admit I also got pretty frustrated when it took them over 5 minutes (5 years in hungry land) to get me hoisin sauce and sriracha, and again, bad combination bc my broth was quickly cooling.

3.0,11/17/2015,"EH. We were pleasantly surprised that HH was taking place when we arrived around 5:45PM. We were half an hour early for our reservation (I definitely recommend making reservations for dinner on weekends) so we parked ourselves at the bar and ordered two cocktails while waiting for the third individual in our party to arrive. $8/cocktail is phenomenal for the city! Especially in the Hell's Kitchen area.. We thoroughly enjoyed the 90's hiphop music playing overhead as we sipped away at our drinks. (: As soon as our entire party had arrived, we were seated in the back alcove. The menu is a mishmash of Thai and Vietnamese dishes. I ordered the shrimp pad thai because that's what I get whenever there are Thai options on the menu...The flavor was good, but the noodles were a tad dry. One of the shrimp was completely raw, which I should have taken as a huge red flag. However, I figured that they hadn't wanted to overcook the shrimp so they'd tossed them in with the noodles towards the end in hopes that the heat of the noodles would cook it through.  My friend asked if I wanted to send the dish back and have them heat it up some more, but I thought it would be fine to just stick the shrimp at the bottom of the dish to see if it would cook through. I probably should have sent it back. Maybe it was food that I'd eaten earlier in the day, maybe it was the shrimp, who knows. My stomach was definitely very upset with me on my entire way home from the restaurant. This scares me a little and turns me away from wanting to return. Hence the 3 stars. Also, the restroom situation is quite uncomfortable for two reasons: a) there is only ONE co-ed stall for the entire restaurant/bar...and b) it is smack dab in the center of the restaurant.

3.0,11/6/2015,"Your Average Thai Food with Giant Meat Portions*Note* My review is based on take-out only.Overall: 3.25 StarsObao is different from other Thai restaurants I have eaten at over the years around Hell's Kitchen and somewhat beyond. While the overall flavor of dishes are average the portions of meat/seafood is double/triple the standard of most Thai restaurants. The biggest was the runny egg in the pad thai. I felt it didn't work too well with the shrimp, but with beef and chicken it mixes well.The beef is cooked properly giving off a nice grilled or fried color (dark brown) instead of the sweated beige looking color of the average Thai restaurant.The service trying to be as quick as possible as lunch rushes on both occasions were on completely different spectrums. One day the place was relatively quiet, another the restaurant had a 15-30 minute wait time for a table. The staff was quick to tell me there was a delay with the order due to the volume of people and apologized for the delay on a few occasions. I was happy they acknowledged me and the other customers. I recommend giving this place a shot if you have a craving for Thai food, but want a twist to it.The prices are average for the area, leaning towards the higher end for lunch specials which range from 11-14 depending on the dish.",0,0,0,Philippe B.,"JACKSON HTS, NY",82,281,835

I had finished my water and couldn't get the attention of the server until about 10 minutes later. Mind you I'm starving and very thirsty at this point. We ordered Vietnamese Spring Rolls, Kimchi Fries, and Pho Bo. All of which were overly priced, the flavors were just not there. the pho was under seasoned and the broth was not cooked long enough.

They have an upstairs, but not sure if it's for seating.On the menu there were a few ""Michelin Recommended"" items, one being the Pho and the other being Spare Ribs on sugar cane skewer. We decided to try the skewer since it was recommended. Honestly we all thought it was ok, wasn't bad, but wasn't great. The Pho was pretty good, but not the best I've had. I personally was excited about the Khao Soi since it's not the most common dish at Thai places. It was tasty, but I think the Khao Soi was better at .Viv. Oh and you're better off ordering the kimchi fries in Ktown because they might actually give you kimchi with the fries...Overall the place has a nice ambiance.

4.0,10/9/2015,"THE DINE-IN EXPERIENCE:This is the first fancy Vietnamese restaurant that I've been to in the US (the other time being in Paris). I was really impressed with the decor, great for a date night or a dinner with close friends. The prices for entrees were in the $10-$20 range, very reasonable for New York! I had the fresh shrimp rolls and the beef pho with fish balls. The shrimp rolls were alright, a little too much green and not enough shrimp for my liking (but I guess they're healthy). They're chopped into 8 bite size pieces and one of the pieces literally had no shrimp in it. The beef pho on the other hand was very tasty. If you don't eat red meat, I think the chicken pho is a great option as well! Both are very flavorful. Unlike most pho places, which allow you to choose the size of your bowl, Obao only has one size. It's not overwhelmingly huge but big enough to be filling. The broth is fairly light, didn't taste like it was boiling in MSG, so I felt very healthy eating it. Overall, a great option for a rainy night in the city.The service here was alright. Our hostess seemed kind of clueless. She kept on calling me ""Catherine"" even though I corrected her many times. She also led us to the second floor before redirecting us to the first floor...thank god the rest of the dinner wasn't such a messy experience! I definitely want to come back again to try some of the other items on the menu. The lobster pad Thai in particular looked AMAZING.

They couldn't have notified him a couple of days earlier when he made the reservation??? This was not counting the 16 or 18% gratuity fee written in tiny font on the lower bottom inside of the menu. Later on, when the whole party arrived the manager nicely waived the minimum policy. Not bad although I noticed from waiting outside of the restaurant, somebody was seriously spraying or pouring bleach outside their second floor window or entry way...With our party of at least 10 people, you thought that they would seat us upstairs but they did not.

2.0,9/27/2015,"We were very disappointed by the Lobster Pad Thai with its over-cooked tough and chewy lobster claw and tail. Either it was over cooked or worse I fear it had been recooked. The noodles had a good flavor however when one orders ""lobster"" one expects that to be the star of the plate. No one bothered to ask us how it tasted as I chewed and chewed and chewed. When we asked for the check I shared my disappointment with the waiter, who had been very helpful when we were first ordering. He thanked me for telling him and told me he would share the information with the chef. The $32 for the lobster is simply not worth it. If you're in the mood for a great lobster meal buy a fresh lobster tail (or two) at a grocery store, split the tail lengthwise with a sharp knife, brush it with garlic butter, and broil it for 5 minutes. It doesn't take a genius to cook a lobster. Update Yelpers: So disappointed today (10/02/2015) to receive a message from the General Manager of OBAO who while ""apologizing"" for the experience we had w/the lobster, did so by saying ""I understand completely your dissatisfaction if that lobster came out as you've described here"".

5.0,9/22/2015,"Well, I made a Yelp account JUST to give OBAO 5 stars, if that tells you anything.I came in to treat my mother to a quaint birthday lunch, and we were instead completely blown away. We had ordered Kui Teaw Lak Sa (buckwheat noodles in spicy coconut curry, w/ shrimp and pork belly), the classic Pad See Iew (topped with mango relish!) with the Fried Dumplings (savory shrimp, chicken, and mushroom), and Tom Yum Kai soup (chicken, mushroom lemongrass, cilantro goodness). As a picky eater, I have emphasize how incredible it was that I LOVED ALL OF THESE DISHES. Everything was packed with flavor, but not overly seasoned.Unaware beforehand about the extremely affordable lunch special, we contemplated ordering an extra appetizer because there was no way we'd be full from such a cheap lunch deal, right? WRONG. Portion sizes were perfect. In fact, we were so utterly full from our respective entree + appetizer combos, that we were literally feeling some of that post-thanksgiving snooze and had to take a breather to fight off the Zzzs. To top it off, the wait staff coming together to sing Happy Birthday and present the most beautiful Chocolate Green Tea Lava Cake ever to my mother literally made her start to cry. All in all, the experience was amazing. The interior has a beautiful ambiance (I love the ceiling lamp formation!), the service was impeccable, and the food was incredible.

The ambiance was suitable for us, probably not for an older crowd. There was good selection of background music. We were seated at a nice little table for two upstairs, not too tight, just enough room. We had their crispy calamari appetizer to start because my boyfriend always gets it whenever we eat thai food and it was yummy, loved the sauce. My boyfriend had the red curry, which tasted really good. I had one of their beef dishes, which I also enjoyed. I was only annoyed by the table next to us, a couple who ate more of each other's faces than their food.

The only thing i didn't like was seating. I was seated on the platform portion in the back smakc dab in the middle of where everyone else was eating and directly in the way of the servers it seemed. It was not terrible but it was kind of awkward to be almost flush against another table and so awkwardly placed.

4.0,9/10/2015,"I had a friend in town and desperately needed to find a great lunch spot in the Hell's Kitchen/Penn Station area. A friend referred me to OBAO and O-WOW, did I love this place.Firstly, tourists have a warped view of what's good in New York and I wanted to make sure my friend got to a delicious taste of the city not just the craziness it is that we call Times Square. This place met the requirements of ensuring my friend got a good meal. I ordered the Grilled Japanese Eggplant for an app and the Kui Teaw Lak Sa entree. Both were delicious though I can't speak to the authenticity of the dishes.Secondly, NYC is known for it's (delicious) but overpriced meals. My friend was here on a budget and I wanted to make sure she didn't break the bank. And check, this place hit the nail on the head with the second criteria as well. As a disclaimer, I came only for lunch and they had a great lunch special where $9 gets you an appetizer and entree. If you get both you will be relatively filled. However, one person in our group has a huge appetite (I thought I did but I guess not compared to him) and he still felt hungry after the lunch. But use him as an extreme example, not the norm.Lastly, I wanted a place with a decent decor. Not necessarily a hole-in-the-wall joint because it was a reunion with my friend who I hadn't seen in years and usually these things warrant a photo shoot (don't judge!). Anyway, the place is definitely cute with a darker interior and chandelier lighting. I felt regal in this restaurant.My last point - which wasn't necessarily a criteria but helped - the place is huge so if you are looking to come with a large group, this is your resto!

We ordered Papaya Salad, Tom Yum Soup, Crispy Duck Confit Red Curry, Pad Thai, Pork Chop and Pork Belly Bahn Mi. Papaya salad used to be really tasty here but this time it was just too sweet and no flavor at all. Tom Yum soup was one of my favorite among those dishes this time. Super spicy! And A lot of vegetables (always my favorite!). Duck skin was crispy which I liked, but didn't like the sauce - was kind of too oily and sweet for me.Pad Thai was just great. Liked the thinner version of noodle and it was just perfect and we all liked it! Pork Chop was great too. You could smell the fire and it was marinated perfectly; just a little chewy for me.Pork Belly Bahn Mi was good too! Liked the tender pork belly slice.

I could have went anywhere in Manhattan but I did my research (checked dozens of Thai restaurants via Yelp) and OBAO was the choice. Very nice place. As soon as you walk in the ambience hits you right in the face. Now onto the food. We ordered the appetizers, went with the spare ribs on the sugar cane with peanut sauce on the side. The first bite sent me on a ""Thai high""   2nd appetizer looked as basic as French fries but it wasn't. The spices of Thai make ordinary into extravagant. For the entree I definitely wanted noodles but since I never had them before I had no idea what kind to get. Waitress explained very good. So I went with the noodles that were big and spicy. It was so spicy. But in a good way. Very spicy and very good. In conclusion, my doors have opened to Thailand. I have so much more Thai foods to try.

It is a little crowded so you will be sitting close to your neighbor. As a Vietnamese aficionado, I can be pretty picky so bear with me. Okay, so we ordered edamame and shrimp rolls for appetizers. While they tasted pretty good, the shrimp rolls were cut up in little pieces which made them difficult to eat and they brought the edamame out with no dish to place the empty pods. I had the pho ban which was pretty good although I have had better at more authentic Vietnamese places. If you're really looking for authentic Vietnamese, this is NOT the place for you.

Our visit was during lunch our, so he ordered his usual, pork chops, and I ordered turmeric chicken, plus sugarcane ribs as ala carte.Pork was always good and you can not go wrong.  The chicken had very intetesting flavor profile.  I don't normally order chicken in Thai or Viet restaurant, so to me, it was something new to enjoy. The skin was crispy and juicy inside, just the way I like! I could taste the ginger, touch of turmeric and other spices. I enjoyed it.However, here is the story about the sugarcane ribs. When we tried, some were cold, sadly.... They were slight warm outside and cold inside, so I guess they precook it and reheat as we order.  As much as I hated to complain, I had to address this to the server, so it will not happen again. I politely called the server and told him about it. He was very apologetic and took it back right away.  They replaced the ones we took bites from with new pieces and plated new.  ( I thought they would just microwave it as other places do. hahaha) I appreciated the way they handled the situation and that made it all right. Overall, my visit was enjoyable as usual even though some mishaps happened.  The bill was less than $50 for 2 of us with some HH drinks!!!

Love the decor and the Buddhist statuesFOOD - I ordered the Pad Kee Mao ($11) - really great presentation in these cute steel bowls. Love the basil crisps on top! Noodles were well cooked and the overall dish wasn't too spicy or sweet. Also had the seven-spices fries ($5) which comes with a side of spicy mayo - delicious as well and went with the waitress' recommendation to get these fries over the kimchee fries.My bf got some sort of beef dish and a Thai iced tea which I don't remember the prices of. From the sips I stole from him, I must say it's the best Thai iced tea I've had. Great balance and not too sweet, which was a pleasant surprise! I hate when things are too sweet you can't enjoy them. I personally need a bunch of different flavors in my dinner to fully enjoy so purchase the tea! Good palate cleanser and side.Overall bill including tax came out to $31!

If you don't have a reservation for dinner time there is usually a wait. The pad see ew is one of the best I've had. The sauce they use is a little bit sweater than other places. They also use a lot more oil I think. Not exactly theist healthy but sooooo delicious. The kimchi fries are also really really good. This is my first ever kimchi fries and they opened my eyes to a new experience hahaha. Now I order it every time I go. The beef bamboo skewers is okay. Nothing special. Smoke signal (cocktail) is really cool. As you open the lid smoke comes out (duh) and the taste is okay but not worth the price you pay for. Overall come here for the food.

The Michelin recommended appetizer Sugarcane Ribs skew is very on point. The meat is very flavorful. The meat absorbs all the smokiness from the grill without scortches.

5.0,8/6/2015,"I'm from Los Angeles, where the Thai food is generally sweet and sticky. On the rare occasion you get light dishes that are not drowning with their sauce, the flavor is generally lacking. What I found here at Obao was deep, complex flavors, accurately applied sauce and variety of meat and vegetarian dishes that single-handedly thrust Thai cuisine to the forefront of south eastern Asian food for me. The drink menu is equally impressive, with everything from lemongrass to cured Thai herbs that add a hint of mystery and a burst of flavor to each of your adult beverages.

3.0,7/20/2015,"A friend of mine works in Times Square and was stranded at the office on a Sunday night. I decided to brave the hordes of tourists and meet him for dinner. After reading the reviews on OBAO I was eager to give it a shot. We ended up ordering take out and eating in Bryant Park (yeah yeah, it's a lot of food. He had some company Seamless credit to spare, and he was working on a Sunday night!):1. Grilled Shrimp & Pork with Vermicelli: this is consistently my favorite at Vietnamese restaurants and it was no different with OBAO. Tender pieces of pork and shrimp grilled to perfection paired with crunchy fresh lettuce and vermicelli: it was the perfect summer dish. It was definitely a little light on the vermicelli side, but I'm not sure if that's because we did take out. Still, they were very generous with the shrimp and pork, so if it were this dish alone, I would've given OBAO 4/5 stars.2. Southeast Asian Fried Rice was rather disappointing. Though the portion size was generous, it seemed to consist mostly of globs of rice--perhaps too freshly cooked to achieve the ideal fried rice consistency--mixed with literally two pieces of shrimp, lots of pineapple and tomato, a few chunks of Thai sausage, and a few strips of fish cake. Overall, it wasn't very flavorful. I wouldn't order it again. 3. Pad Kee Mao tasted comparable to what you could get at any decent Thai place. I could take it or leave it. 4. Beef Luclak was a letdown as well because though the menu description says ""seared hanger steak cubes,"" it was more like ""very well done."" Though the marinade was good, the doneness of the beef ruined it for me. Again, I'm not sure if our experience would have been different had this been dine-in rather than take out. 5. Side of bok choy was really salty, but it tasted good. Overall, I really wanted to love OBAO because of its very reasonable prices and stellar reviews. I'd definitely get something from the grill again and give OBAO another try, but so far I have to say its high Yelp rating doesn't seem quite justified.",0,0,0,Cindi Y.,"Manhattan, NY",1,5,0

I am usually skeptical towards Asian fusion restaurants, BUT I feel good to say that Obao has done it right. A lunch special that includes an appetizer and is under 10 bucks? AND it tastes pretty darn good? Aye aye sir! So far, I have had their Pad Kee Mao with the Grilled Japanese Eggplan and Shumai. Can't really complain about any of them considering the price. Reasonable cost & portion. The Pad Kee Mao has plenty of flavor and the eggplant is something I can't really find elsewhere. It's cooked in some fish sauce, which is pretty stinky. But I DIG IT!

I would call this a FUSION between VIETNAMESE + THAI. The menu selections and the overall taste of the food is neither purely Vietnamese nor authentic Thai ....( Except for just 1 dish - The Pho - purely Vietnamese taste and the Panang Curry - Purely Thai taste) ...Now being said that ... THIS PLACE IS JUST AWESOME !!!! ...The Food: As I mentioned .. its a fusion and its pretty mind blowing! ... We tried SAMBAL SPICED CALAMARI AND THE STEAMED DUMPLINGS and fried shrimp as appetizers .. and all were great! The Calamari comes with a clear sauce that is a perfect combination of sweet, hot and sourness!.. Serving size was decent. In the main course they have some unique noddle soups - which can be called a mix of Pho and Thai soup flavor and style.. The SINGAPORE LAK SA and Khao Soi were great! - Rich broth .. lots of meat - a taste of coconut milk and spices. The Pho was pretty decent but not among the best ones I have had in this area.Service: No restaurant can provide a great experience w/o great servers! .. And ours was just awesome! .. He was attentive, patient (yes because we were 6 people and there was some confusion in deciding the main course!), helpful (guided us through the selection process) and had sound knowledge of the food...Drinks:The cocktails were pretty decent .. my only complaint is that they felt more like mock-tails with very low alcohol content and seemed a bit overpriced for the volume they serve..Overall: A great experience !",7,0,3,Jit B.,"Manhattan, NY",41,48,14

Beware that portions are generous - the khao soi could have served two, and the chicken laksa appetizer was more like an entree size.Their cocktails are surprisingly creative, too. The Smoke Signal makes for the quite a presentation when it arrives at the table. If you're waiting for people, the bar at the front is a good place to sit and order a drink.

4.0,7/1/2015,"I've ordered delivery from both this and their Midtown East location, and finally had the opportunity to dine in.  I was very pleased to see how they nailed ""accessible trendy"", and that they are an establishment which comes through strong for both types of dining.  Service is wonderful, if a bit too attentive.  Attractive, friendly, kind, well-spoken, and accommodating staff, who did slow the speed of our service once we made comment (they were clearing apps and dropping entrees while we were still eating said apps).  Pacing was perfect after that hiccup.Sipping Emotions was a divine beverage, albeit short lived due to the huge ice cube which takes up 50% of the glass.Obao was a very solid martini.Ladyboy Daiquiri was just divine.  We both said, ""This tastes like I'm in a back room in Thailand, doing very taboo things, and enjoying every one of them!""Cucumber Batida was gorgeous to look at....but didn't deliver.  Super cucumber flavor...delicate hint of lime...but no real taste of wine or rum.Really loved that all specialty cocktails were $8 for Happy Hour, including at the tables, and that our server told us without our having to inquire, rather than charge us full price.Great $25 Prix Fixe.  Portion sizes are properly adjusted to accommodate the price variance, though you still leave content.  The steamed dumplings (not on Prix Fixe) and spare ribs on sugar cane were exactly as good as when delivered.  Love that you don't lose quality for either option!  Red Curry Crispy Duck Confit was a let down for me.  Good flavors, though quite sweet.  But the duck skin was not properly crisped/put in a hot enough pan/made ahead/something.  The skin was completely flaccid upon delivery, with no rich golden brown.  If freshly made and put into the curry right before delivery, it would still have been crisp, particularly the portion of the leg that never gets immersed into said curry.  Flavors were there, but texturally lacking.The desserts were just...gah!  The Thai Tea Panna Cotta made me put up a hand to stop conversation, as I had a full body moment with that first bite!All of that lusciousness, in and out for a 7 o'clock curtain, and happy for a really good price!",1,0,0,Christopher M.,"New York, NY",1591,1629,394
3.0,6/30/2015,"I discovered this place through the Taste Asia Food festival in Time Square. The Banh Mi's they were selling were quite good, only point I'd make is that I felt the pickled carrots were too weak and could have had more of a zest/sweetness to them.I came to try out the food at the Reatuarant last night with a friend and ordered the vermicelli bowl with shrimp and pork chop. Great flavor on the pork chop and shrimp, the vermicelli however was a mess of broken up pieces that you couldn't really pick up. Looked like the strands may have been damaged in the packets before it was cooked.Will be back most likely because there not much options for Vietnamese in the area if you're craving it.",0,0,0,Andy K.,"North Strathfield, Australia",16,39,15
3.0,6/28/2015,"Pricing was reasonable, favor so so, environment good for those looking for a hip loud trance music place. My husband and I tried this for late dinner while on a business trip. We went in on a Sunday, and it looked packed. Take note that most places are closed on a Sunday so it would be packed. There were two groups of 2 and a group of 8 in front of us. I went in and told the hostess we need a table for 2. She told me to hold on and she will be back. We wait as she sits the two groups of two and the group of eight. All the while giving out menus and doing other things a hostess wasn't suppose to do (but I get it, it's busy). So we wait and finally she comes and sits us, and then sits a table of 6. The tableOf six gets their water before we do. So ok, whatever maybe they missed us. Finally after waiting 10 mins for water a waiter finally notices us and comes and ask for our drinks. I think he picked up on my husband agitation, so he asked if we were ready to order, which we did. Coming from a southeast asian background and a chef myself I eat, taste and critic. I know bad habit; but comes with the package.  We ordered pho, the spare ribs on sugar cane, salt and pepper shrimp, BBQ pork belly salad, Tom yum soup, and chicks and sausage sticky rice. Pho-broth was ok, noodles were too soft and broken. If you know pho you know broken noodles are a no no!!! We had to ask for hoisin and Sriracha. Spare ribs on sugar cane stick- disappointing! I was expecting spare ribs not bacon wrapped on a sugar cane stick! Don't call it spare ribs; it's deceiving!!! Salt and pepper shrimp-ok, your usual. Tom yum soup-good but a little on the sweet side for me. Bbq pork belly salad-I would say I was disappointed. I got, shredded carrots, zucchini and like 3 pieces of Chinese broccoli, tomatoes and other herbs. I was expecting more Chinese broccoli and for it to blanched and not raw. The sticky rice with sausage and chicken was ok. It was like Chinese sausage and two pieces of chicken thrown on top of sticky rice. Eh! Best thing I had- the bruise berry cocktail. That left me feeling good! And you know when you have alcohol, your food is suppose to be ""banging"". I guess I just expected more for NYC!!! But give it a try.

For those not familiar, credit cardology is the study of and general awareness of the ""available balances"" on one's credit cards, and also the art of masterty of ""pending transactions."" At any given moment, you can ask me what pending transactions I have, when they will most likely come out, and what my available balance is. Credit cardology is a life skill, and one that I most definitely possess. So, yeah, I had exactly $10.54 available one day, and I really wanted pho. Like badly. I was over in this area, so I hopped on yelp and played process of elimination until I decided on this spot. Like, I needed pho.Anyways, I get there, and the pho is $11. Son of a. I didn't have enough. However, they had bun bo hue on the menu for $10, which I had never tried but had recently heard Anthony Bourdain put above both ramen and pho on his list of soups. So, yeah, I ordered it. Never having tried it before, I don't have a lot to go off of, but the soup was amazing. I bet there are places that do it better and more true-to-form, but I mean maybe not. So, in the end, I was grateful that I didn't have $11 to my name, cuz it introduced me to bun bo hue. Also, this place seems like it would be a dope spot to have pho at with your friends because they also have a full bar and stuff. It's not so unassuming (a trait that I usually admire in restaurants) as most pho restaurants, so it could actually serve as a place to have a meal with a nice big group. Might even work as a date idea to impress a girl. She'd be like ""wow this place is so exotic"" or some bullshit. Whatever. Sometimes you gotta take basic girls on dates.

I'm normally not a huge fan of pho, but I lapped up every last bit of this one (aided by several squeezes of the hot-sauce bottle they provide you, although the green chiles in the pho are already pretty hot on their own).  The slices of beef were particularly impressive in their lack of any gristle or tough spots.  The space is nice -- lit with the awesome old-school intricate-filament light bulbs.  The staff is friendly.  And the lunch special is a crazy good deal.  I'm looking forward to returning to try out other menu items.",0,0,0,Edward M.,"San Diego, CA",135,383,2

I just remember saying ""OMG another beef!"" when I was eating the noodles. The fried rice is good too for those who like rice more than noodles. There's also not much of a basil taste so those who hate basil (like me) can try this dish. Lastly I tried the Smoke Signal drink and I don't think it's really worth it.

TLDR; Lost some on service and hit or miss food, gained some on ambience.The $8 lunch special is a good deed they've done for all of us.Both times I've gone I had the Pho Bo, which I think is a winner because the broth is just really simple and clean, but still flavorful. Solid.Green curry is also a good choice! I generally never order fried rice (I'm Asian and this just doesn't make sense to me), I respect the Thai fried rice.The steamed dumplings are also great. You'll get two if you choose it as your lunch special appetizer. Not sure what's up with the Japanese eggplant, I found it overcooked and too dry, and it just ain't cute at all. I liked the Tofu Tod better, but the sauce is pretty thick & tangy at the bottom so dip responsibly.I tried the Bruiseberry Mojito and I think it was the Obao Sunray, and they were both pretty bad. Just not mixed well at all, I don't find the drinks to be their specialty. I traded mine in for a Vietnamese coffee.Service is less than avg, though I'll probably go back since it's so close to where I work/study.

It was okay, I've had better Pho from philadelphia. The spare ribs were the best thing about the meal, but the meat was so thin, i wanted more.  They also had a cocktail special, my husband enjoyed his drink, but stuck to the thai ice tea. Service was average (for lunch, only 4 tables were occupied), once they gave you your food, its like they forgot about you. We had to get up to ask for our check. The bathroom was also filthy, wet floors, overfilled trash can, and toilet paper was everywhere. Maybe we would have better luck during dinner?***Hi Jennifer S., thank you for the comment below.

We ordered TOFU TOD, SPARE RIBS ON SUGAR CANE SKEWER, CRISPY VIETNAMESE SPRING ROLLS and PAPAYA SALAD for appetizers, they were all really good but spare rib on sugar cane skewer, was the best one out of the three. the rib meat was tender ; it melt in your mouth and you could crew on the sugar cane afterward which was an interested combination. For the main entree, I had PAD THAI, it tasted excellent. The flavor was in good balance unlike the other Thai restaurants, their PAD THAI is either too sweet or too sour. Unfortunately, I didn't order any dessert because I was too full by then. I will definitely go back to this restaurant to try their other dishes.

It was the most awkward and unusual thing--like they've never seen people come in to a restaurant to eat? I just don't understand how this even happened. But we were finally seated after my friend walked up to one of the employees and asked if they were open for dinner and if we could be seated. As we were walked to our table, we saw that there were plenty of other groups already dining, so I don't understand why we weren't acknowledged and helped.Other than this incident, the food was alright. I decided to try the pho since they were commended on it, but it wasn't as good as I thought it would be.

The pork belly salad was also an interesting mix of flavors, with apples and broccolini mixed in, though the apples were much more subtle than I was expecting.  It was good, but I probably wouldn't order it again.  There were many things on the menu that sounded intriguing enough for me to want to come back, especially since I enjoyed the Pho so much.",1,0,0,Liz A.,"Denver, CO",4,51,0

5.0,4/14/2015,"Truly one of the most delicious Thai restaurants I have eaten at.My friend (Ha L.) has been raving about this place every since she moved to NY - so obviously, it was my first meal when I landed. I came in for a late lunch, around 4pm, and it was happy hour! So I started with a strawberry mojito ($8) because you know, #summerdiet, and my boyfriend got a beer ($3). To eat, we ordered the vegetable basil fried rice with tofu and the pad kee mao with tofu. I am a huge Thai food snob, so I wasn't convinced when I heard about how good this place was...two bites proved me wrong. The Pad Kee Mao was easily one of the best dishes I've had - the noodles were thicker than usual, which I loved, cooked to perfection (some places always undercook) and had amazing flavors (tons of basil and just a little spicy, like we asked). My boyfriend loved the vegetable fried rice so much, he ate most of that dish in one sitting. Keep in mind, their portion sizes are generous. The fried rice was also delicious, but I was blown away by the pad kee mao over it. What I loved about this location, in comparison to the other location (yes, I went twice in a span of 2 days), was that this location was just a bit fancier and classier. You could come in dressed casually and not be out of place, or dressed nicely, as the ambiance / decor was a little more upscale than the other location. Service was fast and for being a hot-spot in NY, I was happy to see that each dish was in the $10-$12 range, rather than the usual $50/meal I spent the rest of the weekend.

3.0,4/12/2015,"If you're looking for authentic Thai/Vietnamese food, this place does not make the cut. The food is catered more to American tastes, which makes sense given the neighborhood. We ordered the Clay pot catfish and Bun Bo Hue. The first sign was when we asked if the Bun Bo Hue was made in the traditional way. The Waiter thought we were asking about the Pho and didn't know what we were saying until we pointed to it on the menu. Most Americans wouldn't know what is BUn Bo Hue. If you're reading this review, do you? I'm digressing, going back to the Bun Bo Hue, the waiter said it was not sweet, but spicy. We were willing to try it.When the Bun Bo Hue came it was too salty and nothing like any traditional ones. We called the waiter to make it less salty, they were kind enough to bring back another bowl that was diluted with water - E(xcellent) for effort, but F for taste.The Cat Fish clay pot also was not made in the traditional way. It was not caramelized, although the favor was fairly good.The restaurant's ambiance was more of a hip/clubby feel. There was loud clubby music playing relatively loud as soon as you enter the restaurant.Bottom line: Thai/Vietnamese food catered to American taste at a reasonable price.

I must admit that there is not a lot of space between the tables.     Our appetite was alright, not starving but we know we should eat for dinner. We ordered two appetizers and two entrees. A dish Vietnamese spring rolls and serving of eggplants for appetizers and pad Thai and OBAO chicken for the main course. Also a thai iced tea was ordered because that's the mandatory drink when you're in an asian style restaurant.     On to the quality of the dishes. The spring rolls were on point but you only get five short ones. Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside( sounds like a commercial but I'm not paid) the eggplant is tasty when its first brought out but if not ingested and cleaned within the first 10-15 minutes, it becomes soggy. Some of the eggplants were a little too grilled (black crust) The pad Thai is standard dish with the staple ingredients though they did add an egg on top. OBAO chicken with the sweet chili sauce was a good mix. The curry rice was not pleasant to eat as it was very crunchy and hardMake sure you do not have allergies!

You have a choice of appetizer and entree, and it's very filling. I didn't really look at the rest of the menu, because there were already a lot of options for the lunch special. I ended up getting the tofu tod appetizer and pad see yew entree. Tofu tod- basically just fried tofu with fish sauce and scallions + dried onion flakes. It was ok.. nothing special. I could make this at homePad see yew- this was pretty good! it was a little salty for my liking, but the pieces of beef were really good. You could tell it wasn't covered in corn starch before being cooked.

4.0,4/2/2015,"As is the case with all Manhattan restaurants, this place is tiny and cramped, but pretty great. We had a party of 8-10 on a Friday night in late March (but of course it was snowing 4-6 inches). Most of the party was out of towners, so naturally everyone was freezing by the time we got inside. The decor is absolutely lovely, even the restrooms are an interior designer's dream. We were seated in the back of the restaurant downstairs (2 levels) and the waiter came over and explained happy hour drink specials to us before giving us a few minutes to look over the menu. I was in the mood for a regular martini, which I was a little disappointed wasn't on the happy hour list, seeing as a gin drink was on there as well as other types of ""tinis"". Oh well. They did do a great job of making it to my pretty high standards, which is how I judge a bartender, so that's a plus. The ordering process was a tad arduous with 9 people, and with several people ordering soups, pho, noodles, etc. I ended up ordering the lobster pad thai which ended up being delicious but huge. Most restaurant portions are huge in general, but I will say they make it worth your money in terms of how much lobster they give you. I wasn't exactly expecting to have to crack the lobster tails myself, I was expecting the meat to be integrated already into the noodles, but I guess the reason they do that is to show you that you get the entire thing (which is nice to know). It was perfectly cooked and not rubbery. I couldn't finish all the noodles but you better believe I finished the lobster.At the end, it was kind of a pain with 9 people when they brought out one check. This is always a point of contention for me with restaurants that never ask when they see a larger party at the beginning whether they will want split checks. The answer is 99% yes. It took far too long to calculate the check with tax and tip (which was thankfully added at 18% to ease things. The staff told us that they had a maximum number of credit cards they could run on a check, which is always annoying to me since I used to work in the restaurant business and know this is almost never true. When very few people carry cash anymore, this isn't responsible business. At the end of the day, we figured things out, but just be careful if dining in a large group here.",3,0,3,Alyssa K.,"Fort Myers, FL",412,484,38
1.0,4/1/2015,Jack of all trades master of none.Started with the spare ribs on sugar cane skewers. The ribs were cooked well but chewing on the skewers released an bitter flavor that did not complement the meaty barbecue flavor at all. Also there was barely any meat for $9Now for the biggest problem. The signature pho bo took 40 minutes to come out! This is ridiculous. Anybody who has ever had legit pho knows it comes out in 10 minutes or less. Problem #2 The flank steak here came out already cooked. It should be slightly rare when it comes out and cook in the soup. Problem #3 every place that serves pho has Sriracha in the original bottles.Yes this is fusion but there are certain elements that just can't be messed with.Will not be coming back.,0,3,0,Jonathan C.,"Foster City, CA",16,51,1

4.0,3/19/2015,"I found this place by accident while looking for Schmackery which happen to be quite close. This place has definitely become a great staple around the area considering its extremely close to my work place. Their lunch special gives you a lot of options and I can never get enough of their OBAO Salad (Peanut Dressing and fried tofu). I had their Pad See Ew, Grilled Chicken Thigh, and Pho Bo which is enormous to be prepared. They offer quite a lot for $8 to $10 and in Time Square is something to be desired. The Pad See Ew is delicious hitting the right notes right between sweet and some salty elements. The Grilled Chicken is refreshing and light as you can taste the turmeric, lemongrass, coconut marinate and the chili sauce on the side compliments it so well. The last entree was the Pho Bo, a giant bowl of soup with everything from eye of the round to braised brisket in a ginger-anise beef broth.The only complaint I have is the food may take a little longer than usual to come out as I waited like 20 to 30 mins for my appetizers last time so definitely take that into account when you go.Recommendations:Pho BoGrilled Chicken ThighPad See EwOBao Salad",0,0,0,George L.,"Bronx, NY",178,96,144

Warning: You might go there and quite possibly fall in love with it.I've been to my fair share of Vietnamese restaurants (still have yet to review them all) and I'll admit that I have yet to run into a place quite like OBAO. I mean, the ambiance alone warrants a second visit. The inside is absolutely beautiful. It looks ""straight out of a travel magazine"" good. There's a nice flow to it... with a high table/bar up in front and plenty of seating in the rear. I absolutely loved the lighting here. They look like little hot air balloons. We made a reservation and were seated promptly. We came at a good time (although we missed the pre-theatre price fixe menu) since it wasn't overly crowded. The staff were welcoming and patient while we narrowed down our dinner picks. We went for the Michelin Guide Rec'd items of course.Appetizers: The Spare Ribs on Sugar Cane was outstanding. Not only did it look delicious (the plating was spot-on) but it definitely lived up to the rave reviews. The spicy honey mustard glaze and hoisin peanut sauce packed a punch. We also ordered the Crispy Viet Spring Rolls - also amazing. They were super crispy and super tasty.Entree: I'm predictable. Of COURSE I ordered the Pho Bo. I was so glad I did. This was some damn good pho. It's like, they took all the best adjectives in the world and put it into one bowl. Bold flavors with the ginger-anise beef broth combined with the sweetness of the hoisin and the heat of the jalapenos/sriracha sauce... it's electrifies your taste buds in the best ways possible. I asked for extra jalapenos (I loveeee the heat) and they graciously brought more. If I lived in HK, I'd easily become a regular here. When it comes to food, service, atmosphere in one package...

The second time I came there with my sister, and we had a seafood version of Tom Yum soup, a piping hot bowl of pho, and Vietnamese grilled pork chop. My only issue the second time I came there and was seated at the bar area was although the lychee drink was delicious with strawberry and blueberry inside, it took so long for the waitstaff to bring it for us.

The noodle is really chewy (the good kind) and I was very satisfied with my choices.The only down side was the service. I know we are a group of 10 but it wasn't that busy in a Sunday night but it took about an hour from we sat down to actually eating.

If I'd known, I probably would have been disappointed.Ordered the pho and pad thai.  While the pho hit the spot on that cold, chilly evening, I certainly didn't think it was particularly amazing. Slightly better quality ingredients than your average noodle joint, though the broth was pretty one-note.

Otherwise, the service was prompt and courteous.  The ambiance was cozy, especially for midtown--enough room between the tables and I didn't feel like I was shouting to carry on a conversation.  Nice dim lighting too.  I wasn't crazy about the music--some sort of techno pop, but at least it was not too loud.  I would return again if I was in the area--the food and service were good and they take reservations.  Happy hour drinks were excellent and reasonably priced too.",1,0,0,jacqueline g.,"New Brunswick, NJ",0,11,0

Really crispy calamari, good kalbi, and reallllyyy good laksa style noodles (forgot the name). My only qualm is that everything was very very oily.The biggest setback was the service. It was a combo of the weekend rush plus some technical difficulties in the back, but service was soooo slow. Our entire lunch took like two hours with a lot of downtime between meals.

The first time I visited this location I gave them 5 stars and since my second visit I updated to be 4 stars. (FIRST VISIT)I didn't get a table I was dining at the bar with a friend. The service was great and the bartender was really nice and friendly. The food was great. Especially liked the Sea bass and the side order of fries. I know what you're thinking, fries? Yes, the fries. What can I say they made them just right and I like the mayo sauce. Overall good experience, will definitely be back to sit at a table.(SECOND VISIT)The first time I went to Obao I was dining at the bar and fell in love with this place. This time I got a table and I didn't feel the same anymore. The food is still great but the service is why I took away a star. It was late enough on a Saturday night so the place wasn't packed. As soon as we sat down our waitress came over to the table and asked if we had any questions. I told her that we didn't look over the menu yet but I'll order a drink. Then literally a minute later she came to take our order again when she clearly saw that my guest just came out from the rest room. When would she have time to look over the menu? I felt RUSHED! So when she came back again the next minute we ordered our appetizers, and then she never came back to our table again. We got our appetizers and were close to finishing them and she still hadn't come over to take our dinner order. I had to call her over. Once the busboy come over to clear the appetizer plates I asked for a napkin, I never saw him again. Then during our dinner I needed a knife and another drink, our waitress was just standing there chit chatting with her coworkers and didn't pay attention to our table. I had to wave her down.

I would not recommend that. Also it should be served with a dipping sauce. We also tried the vietnamese spring rolls which were good but i prefer the real dipping sauce instead of theirs. I have to say their pad kee mao was authentic and good enough spice. The sea bass was good too.The service on the other hand was on and off. As soon as we sat down our server came right away.

I was really happy to see that they have lunch specials on a weekend!! After coming here and writing this review now, I'm surprised it wasn't super busy when we were here.The lunch special prices are amazing! The lunch specials are good from 12PM-4PM daily. It comes with an appetizer and an entree. If you don't order a noodle dish, there will be rice on the side. I ordered the Tom Yum soup and the Green Curry which cost $8! When I ordered the Green Curry, I didn't realize it was a vegetarian option because I always order Green Curry at other restaurants and there's always an option of chicken, steak, or shrimp. I should of read the menu more carefully but the server gave me free chicken on the house. How nice of them :)Portion size is generous considering the price and comparing it to other Thai restaurants. There are other Thai places where you can get the same size portions that cost a lot more. We also ordered the Pho, Chicken and Shrimp Dumplings, Grilled Japanese Eggplant, and Kimchi Fries!! Love that they have many options here - it can please anyone! Loved the ambiance here.

The bruiseberry mojito had fresh blue berries, strawberries, and tons of mint which made for a super refreshing drink. And the cucumber batida reminded me of a pims cup with its use of the cucumber, it was also very good.As for food, we got the spareribs on a sugarcane skewer as a starter.

Genius to sear it with the shell on (shrimp are cleaned) leaving a great crunch without and breading. The texture was delicious and they were perfectly seasoned.Singapore Lak Sa made my whole week. The coconut curry broth is delicious, and even with the pork belly the soup is not greasy in the slightest. Cilantro added a refreshing counterpoint.

4.0,2/6/2015,"On our quest to eat our way through Hell's Kitchen's Yelp favorites, my accountability sister and I had dinner at OBAO on Tuesday. We made a 6PM reservation through OpenTable and as expected had no wait. The OBAO décor is pretty trendy and modern, a good place for a casual date or dinner with friends. We decided to both get the $25 prix fixe and share so that we could try a greater variety of the dishes.Appetizers (3/5): We got the shrimp rolls and the beef satays on sugar cane skewers. Each appetizer came with three pieces. The shrimp rolls were a little dry and probably should have just been called lettuce rolls because there seemed to be one or two shrimp in the entire thing, which made me sad. :C The beef satays on sugar cane skewers were good, but in my opinion a little overhyped. While I definitely preferred them to the shrimp rolls, I don't think I'd pay $9 for them if I ever came again.Entrees (4/5): D got the Pho Bo, which she very much enjoyed. Delicious broth, tender meat, and a high meat to noodle ratio (they ain't skimpin' on that meat!) really hit the spot for her on a frigid New York evening. I got the shrimp pad thai, which came in a very generous portion enough for two meals. There wasn't anything particularly extraordinary about it, it was simply a solid pad thai. Desserts (5/5): The pièce de résistance of the whole meal, and I mean really, was dessert. We got the warm apple cake (caramelized apple, light cream sauce and vanilla ice cream) and the thai ice tea panna cotta (they were out of jasmine that day). Ironically, D and I were discussing a potential sweets fast for Lent when desserts came out, and with every single bite, the spirit became less and less willing and the flesh became more and more weak. These are must-tries! I feel like I'd come back just to try the jasmine panna cotta. Service (5/5): The servers and hostesses were so kind and attentive throughout our entire dinner, giving us suggestions for the meal, bringing me my take-out box early so I could exercise portion control, and refilling our water glasses promptly. All in all a great dining experience!If you simply cannot wait to try a solid Asian fusion meal in Hell's Kitchen, make an OpenTable reservation on OBAO, and be sure to save room for dessert!",1,0,0,Cindy W.,"New York, NY",585,66,151
2.0,2/5/2015,This was a Michelin recommended resto. Hmm well can't say I was impressed. Then again I did not have the features dish the pho bo. Instead I asked for a spicy version of the pad sew. Which should have been think rice noodles with Bazil and beef. Beef was great though no basil flavoring and let's not even talk about how sweet the dish was. If I had wanted and Thai that's what I wouldn't have ordered Secondly i asked if they had any drink specials and the waitress FLAT OUT LIED. She said no. But the. Went to the bathroom and saw a sign for 5 dollar Martinis on Wednesdays. The night I went ! Not cool!On top of paying 13 dollars for a crappy glass of wine. This place does not have wifi.

The spring rolls were delicious and chewy (not crispy) which I like but I don't think others would want chewy.

Huge succulent shrimp with award winning flavor. I'm still dreaming about that shrimp. And that chili salt. Our entrees were both the traditional beef luclak and pork belly chinese broccoli. Both delicious and Id recommend both. Nice size portion, even distribution of vegetables and meat- no short changing on the protein. I look for that! I personally did not care for the sticky rice, so switched to steamed. For dessert we had the green tea ice cream and spiced apple cake.

2.0,12/29/2014,"I was so disappointed. Where to begin? I had high expectations of this place for some good Vietnamese & Thai food. I've always wanted to come have a nice noodle dish for lunch but finally made it to try their Pho Bo the other night. Let's start with the order of my Pho Bo, the girl in the front charged me $11 when the take-out menu said $9 for Pho Bo. Extra $2 if I add fish balls or beef balls. Well, I didn't add any so why was I charged an extra $2? Two dollars isn't something to fuss about but the fact that they charged me was a problem. I paid $11 anyways thinking maybe they just made their own decision of adding meat to my noodles. *Prior to finalizing and publishing my review, I had to check their online menu to make sure if there's any confusion and on their online menu, the Pho Bo was in fact $11. So since the price is right, that means they need to update their menus instead of leaving customers in confusion. (The menu also says in fine print, ""Prices are subject to change without notice"" I think it'd been much better if the menus were updated and/or at least let the customers know that the prices have changed then I wouldn't have left confused and annoyed.) I received my noodles and I was highly disappointed when I opened my bag. The noodles were a teeny tiny portion in a tiny takeout box. I was so upset with the beef, it was already in the soup! The supposedly ""thin sliced rare beef""  did not come thin and did not come rare. It was way over cooked, thick and chewy. In all the pho dishes I've ever tried, the beef comes rare, and thin on the side then you can cook it to your liking.  I attempted to pour the contents of the box into my soup but it clearly did not fit because the container had too much soup. The whole order was clearly not ""take-out friendly"" and the worst was, there was only ONE napkin for the whole order. I might or might not give this place a try again but definitely not having take-out and not having Pho Bo from here. The Pho Bo was a Michelin recommendation, I'm reluctant to their judgement now.",7,4,2,Carrie C.,"Brooklyn, NY",546,336,2421
1.0,12/29/2014,"The one star is for the Pad Kee Mao.  Other than that, I highly recommend NOT coming here and going to the dozens of other Thai and Southeast Asian options in the area.  My fiance and I live down the street.  I came here twice (him many more times) to give it a second chance.  This past Sunday, I had the Pho Bo lunch special.  At $8 plus an appetizer it seemed like a great deal.  My fiance is Vietnamese so we eat Vietnamese food all the time.  It was GOD AWFUL.  It was like drinking a bowl of salty water.  My fiance said he had pho at OBAO before and it wasn't that salty, so maybe it was a bad batch, but inconsistency in food quality does NOT warrant repeat customers.  I don't want to take my chances with bad pho.  Also, the thai iced tea was $3 each, which seems high considering that @Nine down the street has a lunch special for $7.99 where the drink is included and Pam Real Thai is $2 and Yum Yum across the street is $2.50.  I would have sent the pho back except the previous time we were here, we already had a nasty run in with the staff.  A month or so before, we came in around 9pm on a weeknight for dinner.  There were clearly empty tables but the hostess, a girl with short hair, said we had to wait 5-10 minutes, so we complied.  We had several large bags.  We were finally seated at a two person table right next to the main walkway.  Since there were many empty two person and four person tables, some by the wall, we asked if we could be moved so we didn't have to worry about our bags being in people's way.  Our waiter went to ask another associate who didn't even look at him and seemed to bark something.  He came back and told us the other tables had been reserved.  At that point, I went up to the other gentleman, who clearly had an attitude problem and never once looked at me directly, and told him that at 9pm on a weekday, I didn't believe they had any reservations, and if I finished my meal and those tables were still empty, I would be extremely upset.  The female hostess at that point came up and had the nerve (or idiocy) of asking me the stupid question of - do you have a reservation?  At that point I told her flatly that OBVIOUSLY we didn't have a reservation since she JUST sat us after making us wait 10 minutes.  The waiter calmed everyone down and moved us to a two person table by the wall and the rest of the night was okay.  We had the Masamun Curry with Hanger Steak and Claypot Catfish.  The curry was good, but a bit salty and overpriced.  My fiancé found the catfish not as good as the previous time - once again inconsistent food.  Overall, some dishes are good, some are bad, but you can't count on the good ones being consistently good.  The attitudes of the head staff and hostess are appalling and they do not make customer satisfaction a priority whatsoever.",5,4,0,Ada K.,"New York, NY",4,29,1

4.0,11/24/2014,"Given the abundance of Thai restaurants on 9th Ave, it's sometimes hard to keep track of all of them and remembering which ones are stand above the rest. I personally think Obao is under appreciated compared to some of its more popular neighbors a few streets north. Maybe it's because Obao easily seats 3x the amount of customers as some of the other places that makes it always seem half-full. But that means you almost never need a reservation or to wait to be seated.Diehard pho fans will probably disagree, but I think Obao offers a solid bowl of pho, and not just because there are limited competitors in the area. The broth is packed with flavor without being overly salty, and it comes with a generous serving of sliced and braised beef. They also bring you a bottle of hoisin sauce and Sriracha so you can personalize to your tastes.I've also found they're not afraid to turn up the heat. I think I have a decent (not insane though) spice tolerance, and asked for spicy when they asked how I wanted my Laksa, thinking it would probably be dialed back given the fusion vibe here. Nope.

I hate wasting food but I got sick of eating so much beef that I couldn't finish it. Flavor of the broth was fine but they should balance the dish out more. The space is really nice - very big, cool wood walls and light fixtures. Service was not great though - we arrived just before the early dinner rush (5ish) and only 4 tables filled. But it took almost 15 minutes for someone to take our order and give us water when there were at least 8 waiters/hosts/bussers just standing around the POS system.

The Pho Bo is probably the best bowl of pho you can get in Hell's Kitchen (Pho Grand still reigns). Cons:* Although delicious, the Spare Ribs on Sugar Cane Skewer should be called ""Very Thin Pork Belly Wrapped around Cane Skewer"" because of how little meat this dish actually had.

4.0,11/15/2014,"Typically I tend to stay away from trendy Asian fusion places, especially for pho.  I rather trek into the heart of Chinatown to get authentic Vietnamese food than settle for something mediocre in my area.  However I decided to give this place a shot based on a friend's recommendation and with the knowledge that OBAO was Michelin recommended. As a group of four we came on a Friday night at 8pm and the place was busy.  We heard that the wait was 30 to 40 minutes. Good thing we made a reservation ahead of time so we were seated immediately at 8pm sharp. In NYC, you quickly learn from dinning out that you tend to have to wait quite awhile for your table even when you made a reservation.  This was not the case with OBAO this night. That was appreciated.We enjoyed the decor and vibe as it was modern and trendy. Some previous reviews complained about the service.  Well I think management has been paying attention because the service was on point and friendly.

It left me with meat blue balls.Salt & Pepper Shrimp $9 - (8/10) Shrimp was cooked perfectly and tasted freshPho Bo $11 - (8/10) To my surprise there was good depth of flavor in the broth, noodles were perfect texture, and the beef was extremely tender. This rivals some of the legit pho places in Chinatown.Clay Pot Shrimp $15 - (7/10) Nice presentation and portion size here.  The taste was good  and reminded me of Korean style japjae with the glass noodles.

A flavorful, colorful combination, it tastes as good as it looks (see my photo). 4th standout and even a Michelin recommendation per the menu.Add a decent assortment of beer on tap (Sapporo!) and bottles, plus lots of fruity cocktail concoctions, and Obao stands out among the many Thai restaurants on the strip.

Squid is one of my favorites and this appetizer just ruins other calamaris I've tried before. My sister, who is a big fan of Vietnamese pho approves of their Pho Bo. The Spicy Lemongrass Kalbi Short Ribs is rice's perfect companion. It will not only leave you fully satisfied with asian-barbecue flavors but literally leave you full too (it's a big plate). I also tried the Pad Kra Prow which is Thai Basil Chicken. This is a spicy dish which is perfect to thaw you out on a cold winter day. It has a good balance of chicken, peppers & string beans and a pool of spicy soup at the bottom that you can coat your rice with. Prices are affordable but not the cheapest. Food servings depend on which dish you are ordering so I suggest yelping out pictures before ordering them. Food service was always good and their servers are very friendly. I like the ambiance of the restaurant. It's Zen meets chic. The decor is ingenious too because they use ordinary objects and turn them into quite a presentation (like chopped wood as accent wall). The only gripe I have is that the space can be very constricting specially if you're in a large party. But this is not enough to deter me from giving the place 5 stars.

2.0,11/8/2014,"Meh, I've experienced better.  I went in for lunch by myself before a show.  Service was really slow but not entirely unfriendly.  The pho tasted fine, but there were large _chunks_ of beef  in it, like I had gotten the bottom of the broth, it was like there was a pot roast in my soup.  The rare beef in the bowl had no traces of pink, but had been completely cooked through before it arrived at the table.  It was fine, but I don't need to go back.Hi Jennifer, I'm updating my review in response to your comments.  It's clear that you didn't even read my comment or not carefully enough to understand and only respond to bad reviews in order to try to keep your ratings up.  I'll summarize:  slow service, overcooked sliced beef in the pho, and giant chucks of beef from the broth.",3,5,1,Matt S.,"Denver, CO",28,41,7

Romantic even!We had the Laksa & Vermicelli noodles with pork & shrimp. Yum! & a good amount of meat.....not the usual measly portions found in soups. The But it was the dessert that was the champ - that Jasmine pannacotta with blueberries & caramelised balsamic/soy reduction (or something like it) served with a refreshing mango sorbet. I know, sounds bizarre & like too much is going on, but OMG! The pannacotta was so delicate, smooth & creamy. & the sauce added just the right amount of tartness & that hint of bitter caramelization.....& the mango sorbet is like a palate cleanser but also enhances the Jasmine flavour of the dessert.

I can be a stickler about Vietnamese food, but I'd say OBAO lives up to the bar, even in its fusion style. And it's good prices!

We had reservations for 12-13 people and they would seat us for about an hour because  we were missing 2 people.   What was really strange was they demanded we had to spend 25 dollars per person on food if our party exceeded 10 people. This $25 dollars did not include drinks... which is pretty ridiculous because most entrees on there menu are $10-16. We would of changed restaurants if we were informed about this a month ago when we made the reservations but instead they only informed us 2 days ago... The staff wasnt exactly super attentive either, a few times we needed something it was difficult to get a hold of the waiter.On the other hand, this place has a great atmosphere, the decor is really beautiful.

4.0,10/17/2014,"I was first attracted by pictures uploaded on Yelp - the hot air balloon lights are just endearing.  And the actual ambiance is just as nice... if not, better than what the pictures showed. After the first visit I've come back a couple more times and here's why....1. The ambiance - obviously as mentioned.... it's a good place to hang after work (there's a bar in the front end of the restaurant) or to date. I've actually even seen big family gathered here.2. Location - it wasn't far from where I used to work and practically many things too.3. Price - drinks are fairly priced...from $10-15 and they were good too. As for food - even though I wouldn't say they are cheap for Asian food, but it's not horrible if you want to find nice place to sit and eat.In terms of food... I've had my good days and okay days here. Overall, taste is great but inconsistent. On my 2nd visit, we ordered beef luclak and the beef was nicely done with tender & chewy texture. I came back months later, recommending the dish to a friend and her mom from out of town and guess what - the beef was overly cooked and stale. Seasoning was also on the saltier side - they put too much fish sauce in everything. As for pho, I am obviously not going to have any high expectation that it was going to be superb---- it was alright but definitely not worth that price tag. Can't complain too much though because It's not like you can get pho in that area anyways...unless you travel all the way to Ktown Pho32, which has average pho as well around the same price point (but then again, Pho 32 gives you more noodle in a bowl....). Even though other things on the menu can be inconsistent,  Kimchi fries is the bomb. Makes me happy every single time I order it. So definitely. get. the. fries.Lastly for service - they've always be good to me. There was one visit where the service was a bit slow and the waiter seems to be slightly out of it but they pick up thereafter. With all my visit they always have welcoming attitude. Food might only get them 3 stars but with many other details added a 4 stars rating is pretty deserving!",0,1,0,M K.,"New York, NY",2,123,11

Reason for the 3star is the service, waiters were not friendly enough, I had a cold and asked the waiter if the kitchen could split the pho into two bowls, and the answer was very blunt, couldn't be done, he could only give us the bowl and we had to fix it ourselves. It was a tiny table for two, could hardly hold two plates... It would be a lot easier for the kitchen to do it.I'd suggest to the owner change the waitering staff, it will compliment your restaurant.

On the brighter note the decor of this place is really nice.  My girlfriend and I started with two tea ice tea which was perfectly made.  Not bitter and not too sweet.  For appetizer we got the fresh shrimp roll.  I'm not a peanut sauce fan at all, but I gave their sauce a try and it was perfect.  Not an overwhelming peanut taste but just right. My girlfriend had the chicken panang and I decided to try the pork and shrimp vermicelli.  Hands down panang tasted just like how my mom makes it which I have never found a Thai spot even in Southern California that made it as good as they did here.  My girlfriend liked it a lot too as she emptied the bowl.  My vermicelli was good being that it is not really a thai dish, it's a Vietnamese dish.  Could use a little more fish sauce but it was good.  Our waiter was attentive and we got in an out within an hour for being a full house.  This was a plus.  I will definitely be coming back.",0,1,1,Johnny L.,"Irvine, CA",7,29,81

Its a contemporary aesthetic that looks to be a reinterpretation of the 5 classical elements.My boyfriend and I visited Obao, he looked into exotic flavors and found Obao to be tantalizing based on their offerings. He ordered Lak Sa, a colorful mildly-spiced soup with large fresh noodles and whole chunks of shrimp. I took a taste, it was amazing. A sharp flavor with a warm touch. It was delicious.I ordered the Vietnamese Pork Chop which featured white rice, veggies and a vinegar based sauce that complemented the softer flavors wonderfully. The pork was cooked to perfection with colorful grill marks and just the right amount of moisture for a succulent dish.Our only qualm was about service turnaround. The waitstaff are well informed, polite, and very friendly. However the time it took to receive our check and my card back was a little long.

2.0,7/30/2014,"Overall good ambience, poor service only because they are short handed, decent food.Ambience: Really cool open door vibe in Hells Kitchen with a bar in front and classier seating in back.  Well kept overall.Food: (I'm vegetarian) I ordered the tofu and mixed mushroom vermicelli bowl.  Pretty presentation with the sauce in a small sauce bowl sitting on top of the noodles. I warn those that order this to not immediately pour it all on. It's more salty than I like.  The noodles were well-cooked.  The tofu skin was nice but the mushrooms seemed like they came out of a can.  Granted, this happens a lot to vegetarian dishes and the way it was prepared made it not totally bad but I would have easily preferred fresh button mushrooms.  As you eat this dish, the saltier it gets since it's sitting in all the soy-based sauce. This made the last third difficult to eat.  Overall not bad - 3 star.  I also had a Vietnamese iced coffee which was strong (but what I needed).  There seems to be a mix of Vietnamese (like pho) and Thai (Thai iced coffee, noodle dishes, curries), which is curious since there are incredible Thai restaurants close by (Wondee Siam and Pure).Service: everyone was very pleasant to me but they are short 3 or maybe 4 waitstaff. Every phase of service was slow.  Getting a seat, Ordering, drinks, food, check.  Sitting at the bar, I saw more than 10 people leave simply because they weren't being seated.  I saw two parties sit down at the bar to a dirty area that wasn't cleaned in a timely manner.  The service staff works hard but probably get a bad reputation more because of a managerial decision to have so few people working.

4.0,7/29/2014,"Visits - 2 dinners (May '14 and Jul '14). Small parties.*Food* If you are looking for something soothing -- not too saucy or spicy but still tasty, Pho at OBAO is definitely a good choice. For me pho is all about the soup, and sometimes the fishballs. Unlike many pho places in NYC where the soup tastes almost like it's from a generic powder base, the soup here has just the right amount of saltiness, beef flavor, and thickness. Fishball was tangy and was not overwhelming.      If you are looking for something with more flavor, try one of their fried rice or noodle dishes. I did not like the recommended skirt steak -- was slightly overcooked and the sauce was honestly mediocre.*Service* It's a busy and understaffed place, so expect some slowness of service, but they were very nice.*Environment* Bar table upon entrance, average seating space, 2 floors.

2.0,6/19/2014,"The two-star rating lists in brief summary: ""Meh. I've experienced better."" And ""meh"" is exactly how I feel after trekking down to Obao for their 'Michelin Recommended' Pho Bo. First off: This is an Asian fusion restaurant. It is not a Vietnamese place, nor is it a pho joint. You will open your menu to review the pho options only to find the most remarkable thing: a _lack_ of options to choose between. There is ""pho bo""; it is good enough for Obao, so it is good enough for you. Welcome, neighbor. Enjoy your beef, if you can. There are some minor additions that you can tack on for an extra fee, but there is absolutely no core variety. You want some tripe? Sorry. Tendon? Not here. Looking for pho dac biet? ELSEWHERE, SIRS AND MADAMS, for this is not your place. You will not see condiments at the table. Chili paste is absent. Culantro, when provided with your pho, is of the tiniest possible sprig; barely enough to season a few spoonfuls. Dollops of Sriracha and Hoisin sauce are given because they presume that's what uneducated people think pho is all about. You will get bean sprouts. If you like bean sprouts, you will be well pleased; bean sprouts are about to happen. But should they be the memorable part of your pho? I think not at all. Lime? A quarter-share of an undersized specimen, and count yourself fortunate. Let's move to the heart of the pho - the broth. Without a solid broth, pho is nothing. My broth tonight was deeply unfulfilling. The broth ought to be rich, teeming with delicious fats and flavors extracted by simmering marrow-filled bones into well-rendered stock. What I actually got was a pale, tepid impersonation, flavorless to the point of being tap water, and if it saw a marrow-bone at all, it was only to have one dragged through for the need to honor the form of the thing. I have made richer soups from bouillon cubes. I have tasted better stock from a can. So disappointing, when I had my heart set on pho. Next we discuss the meat. Keep in mind that if you're used to thin slices of rare meat atop your pho, you're usually ordering ""tai""; with the rubbery meatballs, ""bo vien""; plain ""pho bo"" is just pho with beef (unspecified) involved in some way. If this sounds unappetizing, it is because it is so. The meat was overdone, having sat too long either in the broth or under lamps for temperature control; the texture, rubbery; the flavor, absent. Certainly not dispersed through the broth, such as it was. Last, the noodles. These were a thin vermicelli type of unremarkable origin. Texture, flavor, and doneness were all fine. I have nothing clever to say about the noodles aside from openly wondering if they were boiled in water I was later served in lieu of proper broth. Noodles happened. They were not enough to earn favor. Tonight I am a sad man. I add a single star above the minimum purely because the Thai iced tea was passable, even though by the taste I feel it sure came from a mix I know well from my local Asian grocery. $3 a glass; more like six packets for $3, add water. But it's New York. We accept a near 12% food tax on our dinners. I will not let $3 tea dissuade me from enjoying the one bright flavor of my evening.",0,0,0,Brian K.,"Charlotte, NC",0,4,0

3.0,6/5/2014,"Despite OBAO receiving the Michelin Award, three years straight, I really don't think their food was all that great and their service was definitely not up to standard.When we arrived there, we specifically told them that we were in a rush and needed to attend a show that started at 7pm. To speed up the process, we all ordered from their pre-fixe menu ($25) but that's when everything went downhill. For the appetizer, I ordered their spare ribs on sugar cane skewers. But instead of ribs, I found that it was more like bacon. They were not as tasteful or full of flavor as I would like and the portion they served was very minimal and disappointing. Their Shrimp Pad-Thai was good but I had better. I didn't taste the burnt flavor from the wok. Instead the noodle tasted more saucy which tells me the chef's cooking skill could use much improvement. The shrimp was also over cooked and it didn't help by submerging them in the noodles where it will continue cooking. Most restaurants that I go to would usually place the shrimp on top to prevent the shrimp from over cooking and to make the dish look more appealing and presentable.As for dessert, I ordered their Jasmine Panna Cotta with sorbet, only to be disappointed they used artificial jasmine flavoring instead of real jasmine. The smell of the jasmine was strong, I almost felt like I was digesting perfume!!!Overall, the biggest disappointing experience with this restaurant is the communication. It seems the staff do not communicate with each other from kitchen to wait staff to waiter and as a result we had to pretty much gulp down the latter portion of our meal just to make sure we get to the show on time!!",8,0,0,Nga C.,"Brooklyn, NY",524,480,2034
3.0,6/5/2014,"The Thai/Vietnamese food at OBAO is good but there were a lot of problems with service when we went.

We need to speed it up. Our waiter was to lackadaisy. He moved around slowly, was slow to take our order even though we told him we have tickets. It was difficult to get his attention. The food was very slow to come out especially the dessert. We had to scarf it down. Minus a star for slow service.Another problem was the food came out wrong. I asked for no scallions and I cannot eat ice cream because I get very sick from dairy. So I asked the waiter TWICE to make sure there is no ice cream on my dessert...dessert came out with ice cream. At that point I was pretty frustrated with lackadaisical service. We kept on seeing the staff bunch up and not moving around enough. Minus another star. They gotta take it more seriously.

My bun no hue though had the right noodles just wasn't right. No pigs feet. No mam ruoc that I could as for. But then again the waiters weren't Viet so maybe he just didn't understand me. Don't come here expecting bun no hue. That's all I can say. The pho I didn't try but my friend who has never had Viet food loved it. So if you're not particular go for it. In addition the portion of my bun go hue was horrible. I think it was 9 dollars but had only a handful of noodles. And it wasn't even a lunch portion. That was the dinner portion.

Got welcomed all the way through both beautifully decorated floors (2, there might have been a down stairs but I feel like that was the kitchen?) I have been craving Vietnamese food for the longest time. It is very hard to find good Vietnamese food in New York and then in timesquare/midtown? FORGET about that. But I found this place on yelp while looking for places close to work that had banh mi. The prices are great and they had a lot of options that are Michelin recommended. It is actually Vietnamese and Thai and the menu represented both cuisines fairly. It is not a fusion place so no over lap in dishes in that aspect. I used open table to book my reservation which was very convenient. Had an iced coffee while I was waiting for my friend to get there. It was just the right amount of sweetness for me (so it might be too sweet/weak for others). We shared the spare ribs on sugar cane skewer appetizer because of all the reviews. It was really good and lived up to the reviews, you can bite straight into the skewer (Michelin Recommended) which was  very enjoyable. I may be biased because I LOVE sugar cane. I had the Beef luclak (Michelin Recommended), it came with a side of rice and it was marinated perfectly and tender, like how a Vietnamese mama would make it! My friend had the pho (can you guess? Michelin Recommended, we wanted to try the best stuff there!) and it was only $9! Definitely going back to try their banh mi and some other items that caught my eye on the menu.

While my husband was out with the work crew, the kids and I took advantage of the opportunity to go out for Thai food since we all like it and he's not a big fan. The ambiance is nice - dim lighting, cute lanterns...very modern. Our waiter was attentive. I enjoyed one drink with dinner, since I was responsible for the kids, and it was quite possibly one of the best adult beverages I've had. Bruised berry mojito. Refreshing, flavorful, & delicious!The kids decided to order a few apps as their meal. They had the beef on sugar cane, which sounded intriguing, but none of us liked them. The beef tasted a little ""off"" and was not tender. (I don't think it was spoiled, just a strange flavoring.)The chicken satay was great as reported by the kids, and surprisingly, the thing we enjoyed the most was the fried tofu. It was the perfect texture, light and airy, and had a great dipping sauce.I had Massaman beef curry that was out of this world. The kids both tried it and said they wished they had ordered it. I requested pineapple to be added to mine, and they accommodated. The only thing I would warn people about is that the beef had a very smokey/grilled flavor, so if that's not your thing, you might not enjoy it.

Obao really sets itself apart. Decor: awesome. Service: on par. Onto the food:Calamari appetizer: HUGE pieces of squid lightly breaded with a decadent dipping sauce. Amazing. Steamed dumplings appetizer: also very good. Pad Thai: comes with shrimp unless you request otherwise. Topped off with a poached egg. Nice flavor too. Kee Mao: you're typical spicy noodle. Same silver bowl presentation as the Pad Thai. Also great flavor. Pad Kra Pow: a must try. Hard to explain but will say that with most noodle and rice dishes, it is a sautée of proteins vegetables and rice/noodles. In this dish, the rice is serve separate so you can truly enjoy the tasty flavors of the dish. Clay Pot Catfish: served in a Clay Pot and a really nice portion of lightly fried and seasoned catfish with vegetables.  This was absolutely amazing and I highly recommend it. Thirsty? Try the Thai iced tea.Looking for alcohol?The cucumber patida is great as are many other of their craft cocktails. Well, what are you waiting for?

Broth was average but probably the best part of the pho (not saying much), noodles are not cooked well, and you get 3 slices of flank...terrible, no tendons, tripe, etc. Spring rolls dont come with lettuce, small and uninteresting. $11 for pho.

We started with the vegetable dumplings and they were delicious!

If it did, I'd like to address this to the middle-aged man with glasses holding a bag of groceries on the northwest corner of 9th and 47th at approximately 8 p.m. on Saturday, January 4th, 2014. I was the frustrated and mopey late 20-something in glasses and a poofy parka that was pissed about every ramen place in a 6 block radius having an hour 45 minute wait. (I know it's popular, but I was NOT expecting anything that egregious, wait time-wise.) He asked if the beau and I were looking for a restaurant. I mumbled, ""...yes..."", and he offered up OBAO. I shrugged, politely squeaked out a thank you, and shuffled on down, not expecting much.Sir, I am forever indebted to you. We had a five minute wait for a table and an AMAZING meal.First off, let's talk interior: hanging lights encased in whimsical hot air ballon-shaped wicker cases, shiny walls juxtaposed with jagged and textured wood walls, music blasting...I was in a better mood almost immediately.After I started sipping on a potent and flavorful Thai iced tea, Adam and I started off with Michelin-recommended spare rib wrapped around sugar cane skewers, topped with peanut sauce and crushed peanuts. Perfection, between flavor, the doneness of the meat, and the blended textures. Next, to satiate my ramen craving, I went for a bowl of the (also) Michelin-recommended Pho Bo. For $9, it was more bang for your buck and infinitely better than any bowl of ramen I could have had that night. The meat, broth, noodles, accompaniments...ALL of it melded perfectly into a huge white bowl. We both took our time eating it, savoring each bite. It literally took us good 30+ minutes to finish it all. It wasn't a meal worth rushing through.Thanks again to this Hell's Kitchen resident AND all of you people I once cursed for making the waits at the west side ramen joints all too long.

The interior has a cool atmosphere, dim lighting, funky decor, and was otherwise intimate/romantic if not for the LOUD dance-pop-utlra-remix music they have blasting constantly. It totally clashes with the rest of the vibe and was annoying as hell. My only other criticism is that they brought us all of our orders at once instead of staggering the meal, so we wound up with the drinks, app and dinner all on the table within seconds of each other.

As for the service, it was a tad bit overwhelming as there were only five tables occupied so the servers were able to give much more attention than needed...I guess better to have more attention than none at all.

We started off with drinks. I had some kind of martini that came in a little metal cup and my date had a spicier drink that had jalapenos floating in it. We both got a second round, we liked our drinks so much.We basically ordered all of the michelin starred food to try. We started off with the spare ribs on a sugar cane skewer which were DELICIOUS. I seriously dreamed about these ribs. They were the perfect combination of savory with a tinge of sweetness and they just fell off the bone.For the main course, I got the pho bo. I actually didn't know it was a soup but it didn't take away from my experience there. The noodles and beef were both very good. My date ordered the beef luklak that was simple (only beef and vegetables) but very tasty. We didn't order dessert but I would definitely come here again and do a full three course.

4.0,10/30/2013,"This and Room Service are easily my favorite Thai places in the area. It was previously called Ember Room but although the name has changed the combination of amazing quality of the food and drinks, affordable prices and excellent service has not. Obao is really fun to come to with a group or just another person to catch up. They have innovative Thai and Vietnamese dishes that full of flavor and really good. The drinks are some of the best I've had recently they have a full list of creative cocktails I'd recommend the Smoke Signal and the Bruiseberry Mojito. My favorite dish is the Pad Kra Prow but most thing's I've tried are very good. They're also Michelin recommended and they mark the specific dishes Michelin decided to recommend.The reason I come here more than Room Service is because Ember Room/Obao is on a really cool program called FoodFan Select so I get a discount on my full bill every time I come which definitely makes me feel better about the inevitable extra rounds of drinks.",2,0,0,Carlo C.,"Manhattan, NY",448,26,0

I have to say, I had my doubts as I walked down 9th Ave, because of the location... but I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived.Obao's interior is trendy for a Thai restaurant, and does not reflect the price point of their menu items. (I would have expected it to be more expensive.) As I was led upstairs, I was even more surprised because it was the perfect setup for hosting an intimate dinner party. We had about 16 people in our group, and there was another large party on the other side of the room. Everyone enjoyed themselves and there were no hiccups in service or food.And seriously, the food was great. The drunken noodles were the best I've ever had - it wasn't greasy and I finished my entire plate. My favorite part? The pleasant surprise of paying less than I expected when I received my bill.Would totally come back again. A great place for a casual date night or gathering with close friends. The only drawback that I can think of is that Obao is out of the way for me, but for good Thai food at a very fair price, add to that the trendy decor and cozy ambiance, I would definitely return!

4.0,9/16/2013,"Formerly the Ember Room - this local pan-Asian favorite has a new name, but keeps a lot of what made the original place so charming.One noticeable difference is how they've expanded the menu beyond the old Thai-fusion base.  Now there's an obvious attempt to try and incorporate some other regional favorites including Pho and Laksa.  Being a fan of both I had to try.One favorite they kept was the crispy salt & pepper shrimp.  That was a popular appetizer that retained its delicious flavor, although if you're not into eating shrimps with the shells on them, you might not go for this dish.  However, the taste is indisputable.Ambitiously we tried all 3 noodle offerings on our mind.  The pho, the bun bo hue and the laksa.Pho = the best of the three.  While this doesn't come close to the amazing stuff you get in places like Pho 75 in Philly or DC, this is also way better than the atrocious (and since closed) Pho 66 that opened nearby.  The soup was fine and the beef was fine.  It wasn't amazing but it's probably the best bowl of pho you'll get in the neighborhood.Bun Bo Hue = this dish missed the mark slightly since the soup base felt too masked by spices and lacked some of the genuine heartiness that defines this dish.  The meat and ribs were simmered very well and were very tender but I just didn't feel the broth too much.Laksa = this was the biggest disappointment since it was clearly not authentic.  Granted the broth was actually decent and the condiments were fresh.  However, the noodles they used was soba - which is a huge no no.  It needs to be glass noodles to retain the proper texture (or even rice pho noodles if you had no choice I suppose) - therefore I wasn't particularly happy with this choice.However, overall I still like the friendly staff, pleasant ambiance (A/C is too cold though) and the general experience of dining here.  I'd definitely come back, though perhaps it would be to try some other dishes beyond the noodle offerings.",2,1,2,Kevin W.,"Manhattan, NY",1288,747,1078

4.0,8/27/2013,"I came here for an after-work dinner with a friend on a Monday night. The first thing to note with particular distinction is the quality service that the staff at Obao provides. Waiting on my friend at the entrance, the hostess was quick to offer up a glass of water. This personalized attention to the diner would be carried throughout the course of our meal whether it was asking for food recommendations or reservoir worthy refills of water. The interior of Obao is something to behold; one feels transfixed at the sensation that you are within a wooden shack somewhere deep within a Thai jungle, replete with a sea of beautiful metal orange lamps illuminating the ground below and a few meditative buddhas watching as you consume another bite of your appetizer. To state it simply, the inside is exotic and inviting. For our wine, we went with a Pinot Grigio from Sicily (the name escapes me); for a person who usually detests white wine, I will admit that this was a delicious choice. We chose the crispy pork belly, spare ribs, and sambal spiced calamari for our appetizers. The pork belly was unremarkable, devoid of any distinctive flavor, and the calamari, while tasty, was dripping in oil. The spare ribs on sugar cane skewers, however, were quite interesting with the blend of the well-marinated meat dancing smoothly along with the rush of saccharine from the bite of the ""skewer."" The only trouble with the dish was the small amount of meat on the actual sugar cane and the fact that someone like me, who admittedly was not raised with sugar cane all his life, was not well-versed at one point to stop consuming the cane (this led to unseemly mouth to napkin scenarios). Entree wise, my friend ordered the ""nam prik ong"" vegetable wrap (which was quite spicy) while I decided to go with the Singapore laksa. On its own, the laksa was a bit bland, but once I added in all the additional fix-ins (cilantro, jalapeno peppers, and a substantial helping of chili paste) it turned out to be a flavorful and savory choice. The real winner of the night, to my surprise (as I am quite the opposite of a ""sweet tooth"") was the dessert: crispy banana lumpia with coconut ice cream. Holy heaven: imagine a perfectly fried banana drizzled with a delicate honey and mixed with an incredibly creamy coconut. Suffice it to say that the infamous sandwich scene from ""When Harry Met Sally"" was capable of being repeated by a performance from my friend...",1,0,2,Jonathan L.,"New York, NY",166,118,95

I am used to having the best food in, well, shitholes, or at any rate, places that obviously don't put their emphasis on decor.Here's what we had- Bo Luc Lac Shaking Beef- Fish Claypot- LaksaLaksa had a super good broth but lacked fried tofu and the inclusion of soba noodles instead of thick, chewy egg noodles was a massive curveball for me, and too much of a diversion IMHO. It was tasty, I suppose, but my parents and ancestors were yelling at me.Shaking Beef was good with rice. It was not as good as what I have had recently in SoCal, but a good value overall.The fish claypot was the surprise star of the night. We were not expecting much from it and really ordered it only for vegetable and non-red-meat content. The fish was super fresh and cooked just so in the claypot so it was not flakey but just right.note that many entrees come with rice. We erroneously ordered extra rice assuming it did not come inclusive. Check first, then order; if you need more rice, the sausage sticky rice is excellent. It's another dish based on Malaysian chinese cuisine; my dad calls it ""One Pot Rice"". :)It seems like you are expected to come for the ambiance/drinks and stay for the food.

I am actually pretty surprised the wide range of quality and how pad thai is prepared in NYC...really hit or miss but this place is definitely a hit for me. You can really tell that they sautee everything in a woke and the sunny side up egg on top is a very nice touch.

As for the reason I came to this place, the Pho was very good, there was a very good broth to noodle ratio, but if I had to nitpick, I would say they don't have a big selection of meats, it was not sliced as thinly and was overdone for our taste.

Gone are the chocolate spare ribs, but in their place is a successful menu borrowed from their two other locations. The interior has new lights and a new Pho bar, but looks mostly the same. The new menu includes the Michelin-recommended ""Spare Ribs on Sugar Cane Skewer,"" which I ordered.Both dishes arrived promptly. The ribs featured meat wrapped around a piece of sugar cane, then grilled on a gas flame. The resulting softness, flavor and nice char impressed me. Delectable. My only complaint: the chef could have bulked up the skewers with a little more meat. The ribs came with swiped dollop peanut sauce. Though a particularly good peanut sauce (this coming from someone who doesn't like peanut sauce), the ribs needed no embellishment.I also had the Michelin-recommended Pho-Bo. The flavor of the broth was fantastic--rich and savory. Though the meat (2 kinds?) in the Pho was a little chewy for my taste, I loved the noodles. I enjoyed the freshness of the ingredients and seasoning. I don't know that I've had a Pho, and I know it's the latest thing. I'm a convert, and now the bar is set high. (Let me know of whatever Pho places you'd recommend.)Luke, Yung, and Jen were all great (thanks, guys!). Congratulations to Chace. Ember Room is dead. Long live OBAO!",5,0,3,James W.,"Manhattan, NY",115,30,87
