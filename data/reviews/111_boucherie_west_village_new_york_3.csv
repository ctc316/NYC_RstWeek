5.0,4/30/2019,"This place is fantastic! Joel served us at the bar and did a fantastic job breaking down the menu and recommending what to order. I don't normally eat red meat, but had a bite of my kind-of friend's steak and it was phenominal. My now-ex girlfriend Sarah (I won't get into it) made me eat a bite (she's so beautiful but personality ugh, she's a fire sign so whatever). I had the chicken, which was also good. Strong drinks. I totally recommend if you're with the right person. 5 stars.",1,0,0,Dejen T.,"New York, NY",12,6,1

3.0,4/30/2019,"I feel like I missed out on the amazing experiences that the yelp reviews refer to. I made a reservation for two and was seated upstairs on time, which is much quieter. I was a bit overwhelmed by the noise and how crowded downstairs was and I'm certain my experience would've been worse if I ate downstairs. I came to Boucherie for one thing only: to try their wagyu burger with a friend. We ordered the Caesar salad to start off which arrived at the same time as the complimentary bread basket. The bread basket was really good and I like that it came with olives, sun dried tomatoes and sweet onions. The Caesar salad was just ok, the subtle anchovy hint differentiated it from regular Caesar salads. Immediately after we finished the salad we got the wagyu burger with the truffle on the side and some fries. The wagyu burger was incredibly disappointing. When we ordered we were advised to get it medium ( which in France is more medium rare) but this was true medium. The burger lacked sweetness and the meat did not taste like wagyu. The truffle chip shavings on the side tasted like candle wax which made me question the whole meal. It had no taste of truffle whatsoever. The burger itself was $44 which was not worth it at all. I did notice most of the diners were French or Italian tourists for whatever that's worth.",2,0,1,Achiaa P.,"New York, NY",227,171,664
5.0,4/30/2019,"Went here for a very special dinner on a Saturday night and it was wonderful! We started with some tasty cocktails and escargot - A MUST especially if you love garlic and butter (but who doesn't?!) and you can dip the warm bread they give you on the side. I ordered the steak frites, medium rare - on the side is a peppercorn cream sauce for you to pour on top of it - delicious! He ordered the beef bourguignon which was also delicious, I kept dipping my steak in his sauce haha. For dessert we had the profiteroles - definitely get those!This is such a romantic place or even a great hangout spot with friends for brunch. I recommend sitting outside of the weather is nice! Plants everywhere the air smells fresher haha. We came here relatively early around 5:3 as we were going to a broadway show after. Wonderful experience.",0,0,0,Sheena K.,"New York, NY",331,106,133

5.0,4/28/2019,"We stumbled upon this gem on our recent trip to NYC and we enjoyed our lunch so much that we went back the following evening for dinner. Wonderful atmosphere, delightful staff, and both the food and cocktail menus were impressive. The classic French fare was all perfectly prepared with rich and bold flavors that left us wishing we could have gone 10 more times and tried everything on the menu. The cocktail menu provided a unique twist on classic favorites that added subtle notes to their complexity rather than destroying their natural appeal which is so often the case when bars veer from the tried and true recipes.

5.0,4/25/2019,"We were lucky to score a last-minute reservation at Boucherie during the holidays! It's a fancy spot in the West Village that looked truly magical with the lights. Even though it was packed, we were lucky again to get a seat right by the Christmas tree - such a great experience. Ambiance 10/5: I really felt the holiday spirit. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful, and I would probably even have enjoyed it if the food sucked. Except it didn't, which makes the place even more amazing.Service 4/5: Quite fast and attentive, nothing too special.Food 5/5: Maybe I was very hungry, but I found everything to be very yummy! It was a particularly freezing day (at least for someone living in California), so I was creating something on the heartier (and carbier side). I got the linguini, and my friends got a risotto and a salmon. I've had a lot of fantastic pasta in my life, and theirs was definitely on par. Dessert 5/5: We shares creme brûlée and profiteroles. The former is one of my to-go desserts, so I found it to be pretty good but not mind-blowing. The profiteroles, however, were quite new to me, and I LOVED the abundance of cream.",2,0,3,Margarita F.,"Berkeley, CA",333,91,481

We made a reservation for 1pm a few weeks in advance, and the place was pretty packed so highly recommend. Even on regular days, whenever I walk by this place is always buzzing.It's actually a lot bigger than I expected with multiple floors, which added to the already cute ambience. The side of the restaurant was also opened up which is great for a warm sunny day. We were seated promptly and the waitress was very attentive. We had some lattes which were good to start. The bread basket was OK - the butter was a little cold and when we asked for more, we never got any, but whatever it's just bread and butter.For our entrees, my friend went with the eggs benedict, and I splurged on the famous truffle burger. The burger was DELICIOUS. So juicy and flavorful. And a large entree really - I had to take some of it home because I didn't want to waste my money or the truffle. There were so many things on the menu that looked delicious, so I really would love to come back for dinner.Overall, very satisfied with the food and menu options.

3.0,4/22/2019,Was packed per usual on a Friday. The food was good. I enjoyed the quick seating and the decor. However the waitress was rushing us! She kept asking if we needed anything having plates removed once close to done. It wouldn't have been so annoying if the table right next to us hadn't been taking their sweet time with their drinks way after their meals. I hate to suggest what it felt like but yea the waitress could have been more accommodating.

1.0,4/17/2019,"I typically don't write reviews but my experiences with this place have just been awful. I first came here on Valentine's Day. While our appetizer (escargot) and dessert (creme brûlée) were great, my steak frites was extremely disappointing (and inedible). The meat was tough and nearly impossible to eat. Even the fries were a bit soggy. Despite this, I decided to give this place another chance. However, this time my experience was even worse. When I called to make the reservation, the hostess on the phone was extremely aloof and rude. They proceeded to ask me to hang up and call back in an hour when it was more convenient for them. Needless to say, I never made the reservation. Really wanted to give this place another try but this service left a terrible taste in my mouth. What a shame.",0,0,0,Alex G.,"New York, NY",0,1,0

4.0,4/9/2019,"Yum!!! While the name is French for butchery, there is plenty to enjoy here that is not red meat. My new goal now every time I go to a French restaurant is to take advantage of a tasty scallop dish, the kind that feels like buttery pillows melting in your mouth. If you are looking for some comfort food instead of shellfish, I recommend this one chicken dish - which I forgot the proper name of - with the creamiest mashed potatoes that will make you feel ready for a nap. You will not regret it.But what makes this particular spot so special? The space - large on the inside. Wanna sit outdoors? The bistro-style seating is placed at a good distance away from the street. The open store front also helps create that effect of a big space as well. I recommend Boucherie when the weather is nice and you can comfortably sit outside for a meal without a winter coat. Let's not forget desserts! I encourage you to try profiteroles - scoops of vanilla ice cream beautifully set between two chocolate-covered choux pastry. My only word of caution is expect to spend more here than you might bargain for. Treat Boucherie like a treat.",0,0,0,Patricia T.,"Queens, NY",1,11,2

5.0,4/5/2019,"I was invited back to try Boucherie again compliments to the Manager. This time our experience was very lovely. Shout out to our super attentive and helpful waitress, Zeina! She help us decide on our entree and gave us the best service ever.When we arrived we were seated on the second level of the restaurant, the best seat in the restaurant in my opinion. This was a lot more spacious than the ground level and we had a good view of the whole restaurant. We started off with wine and bread. For appetizer we ordered the escargot ($25) and mushroom raviolis ($33). I'm glad we had the bread to dip the delicious garlic and truffle oil. The escargot comes out bubbling so be careful not to burn yourself! For the main entree recommended by our waitress, we ordered the Chateaubriand Pour Deux ($120), which is the filet mignon with bone marrow and veggies for two people. We did not anticipate it to be such a large portion, but it was a very memorable steak! If you like bone marrow and a leaner cut of  meat I recommend getting this.Lastly for dessert we shared the Creme Brulee. It was the perfect ending to our delicious dinner. We really enjoyed our experience the second time and want to thank Boucherie for the hospitality and for inviting me back. It did not disappoint!",0,0,0,Siyun Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",306,156,326
4.0,4/2/2019,"I was invited back after my previous review of Boucherie with an apology and invitation for a complimentary meal after the lackluster experience I had with my family. I was a bit hesitant to return but I'm glad I did as the service was impeccable!This time around, my party was seated at a different part of the restaurant on the second floor which had more space for our food. I would definitely recommend these seats if you are particular about space. We ordered the steak tartare, chamberlain steak for two, the gratin and the chocolate mousse. The steak tartare (small) was a good size for two - we ended up devouring the entire plate. The chamberlain steak was a generous portion size and came with bone marrow and a side of vegetables. The gratin was very decadent and a good pairing with the steak. I was very happy with the chocolate mousse - it had a good amount of salt and I had to keep myself from eating the entire thing by myself. This is something I would definitely have no problem eating several servings of.At the end of our meal, the manager greeted us presented us with the restaurant's book which was a nice gesture and topped our night off well.All in all, we had a lovely experience and paired with the service I found that Boucherie definitely redeemed itself from my previous visit.

4.0,4/1/2019,"This is an absolutely beautiful restaurant and well located. I love the ambiance and felt transported to Paris. The servers were superb and extremely attentive. The trick is come for LUNCH for actually affordable prices, otherwise you're paying like $26 for something as simple as a burger, which was delicious. At lunch, the price is 13.  My friend came across this place during brunch time and it was popping, but you will save a serious buck by coming for lunch, rather than brunch and dinner.  Make this your next business lunch, you'll impress with your swanky pick, and avoid crowds.",0,0,0,Jaclyn T.,"Barcelona, Spain",13,25,15
5.0,4/1/2019,"UPDATE: After my previous review, the general manager reached out to me and invited me to experience Boucherie again, free of charge. I have to say, they crushed it in every aspect. We were sat in the upstairs dining area, which feels a bit more intimate and away from the crowd below. The waiter never let our water run dry. The sommelier came and spoke to us personally to help us pick a Cabernet that would best match our palate preferences (Wenti Southern Hills 2016 Cabernet). We ordered the escargot and mussels as appetizers, split the Aloyau de Boeuf (dry-aged porterhouse steak), and fell in love with the creme brûlée and crepes Suzette. Everything was five stars.

4.0,3/24/2019,"We strolled into Boucherie pretty late on a Saturday night, so we were unsure if we would get a seat, fortunately there was counter-seating right in front of the ""Boucherie"" section of Boucherie West Village. On the one hand, we were able to watch the cooks make beautiful steaks from raw, tender cuts of beef down to a perfectly seared, juicy, and delicious steaks for service. There was bone marrow, porterhouses, t-bones, sirloins, filet mignons. Incredible.On the other hand, we couldn't resist ordering a Porterhouse for 2 for around $130, even though we were expecting a $30 dinner. The dish was delicious (rare center) with a an almost crispy outside perfectly seasoned and finished with chunks of sea-salt and a piece of thyme laid across the bone. The chef recommended that we also add some sort of vegetable to the porterhouse, so he threw in a complimentary serving of fries which were thick, crispy-fried, and tossed in a seasoned flour.Incredible dinner.",1,0,0,Willy X.,"New York, NY",873,222,74

The tables were quite close together though (commonplace in NYC so nothing too crazy) but unfortunately, there was someone seated next to us that was literally screaming instead of talking in a normal tone.  So, it was quite loud initially but much nicer after that table left and there were fewer people in general. It must be very loud during peak dinner time (we dined at 8:30 pm). The food was great but for some reason, they brought out everything we ordered at once.  Salads and entrees both arrived at the same time.  Not only is this obviously not desirable but there wasn't even enough space on the table for all of the plates to fit. We opted to eat our dinners while they were hot (beef bourgeon was absolutely delicious).Overall I would give this another shot in the Summer when I could sit outside but there are so many options in this area it certainly won't be a regular spot for me personally.",1,0,0,Jessica L.,"New York, NY",7,9,1

I ordered the grilled octopus and my companion ordered the steak tartare. When the food arrived it deliciously fresh and the portions were perfect! The octopus wasn't rubbery and the steak was hand-cut. The food was so good in fact, we ordered another portion of the grilled octopus. The service, food and environment were perfect.

4.0,3/17/2019,"This would have been a 3 star review but a star was added based on an experience after the fact. I'll explain.First I will say that the restaurant is aesthetically beautiful. Tall ceilings, tiled walls, beautiful lighting, and several levels which allow for a three- dimensional effect throughout the restaurant. You can eat along the wall/windows, in the center amongst a group of intimate tables, up a level on a small balcony, or way up top overlooking everything. The bar is huge and again, very beautifully done. I made a reservation a few weeks ago and indicated that it was a birthday dinner. I requested a window table which they honored. I asked for a recommendation between the Branzino or salmon and without hesitation, I was directed to the Branzino. It was good. Fresh, flaky and cooked well. This is not an inexpensive restaurant. For the price, I felt as though I should have been blown away, especially with the eager and quick direction to order this. With the ambiance and pace of the meal, I was prepared to rate with 4 stars. After the plates were cleared, a dessert menu was not offered yet but soon after a birthday creme brûlée was presented. It was large and very good. Again I felt pleased that they took note of that it was a birthday dinner. So what was upsetting? They charged for the dessert. I didn't order it, I wasn't given a choice of the dessert, and quite frankly, if I DID order a dessert and they presented it with a candle and charged us, that would have been fine. It was the fact that we didn't place the order. My husband posted a Yelp review soon after with what happened along with his same opinion that his food was good but too pricey. The restaurant contacted him and immediately righted the wrong. They not only refunded the cost of the dessert, but they also refunded his dinner. I appreciate a business that has excellent customer service. With so many options to choose from, this helps set restaurants apart from each other.",2,0,0,Christina S.,"Brightwaters, NY",21,92,204

3.0,3/12/2019,"The hostess was very pleasant and told us we had to wait for a table. We sat at the bar for about 15 minutes and a table opened up. The food was delicious, but the service was atrocious. We ordered wine and it took a half hour to arrive to the table. The waiter said ""I had to wait for them to bring it up."" He was the most impersonal waiter I've encountered. He took our order, never checked back at the table to see if we needed anything. We poured our own wine. No one bused the table. I piled up the plates, glasses, etc. and grabbed anyone walking by to take them. The tables are small, which is fine, but you don't drop the salad among empty glasses. The runner was struggling to find a spot to place the salad, instead of removing the used plates first. We had to ask for fresh black pepper. I asked for mustard and by the time it was delivered, food was cold. The waiter dropped the check, never said thank you, and walked away. I'd go back again but would request anyone else but that waiter.",0,0,0,Barbara B.,"Manhattan, NY",3,22,0

4.0,3/10/2019,"Our second visit to Boucherie was very delightful.Here's what we had: Avocado Asparagus Salad, Wagyu Truffle Burger, Boeuf Bourguignon, and Creme Brûlée for dessert. We also had two house cocktails: Papillon Blanc and L'Insolente (I think it is the one, don't quite remember though). Love them both! Refreshing, sweet, fruity, and on point. I'd definitely come here just for the drinks!The salad was average. My friend's Wagyu Burger was alright, according to her. I had a bite of it, the wagyu beef has a stronger meaty taste compared to regular beef. But all the cheese, meat, butter grilled buns, and fries came together, plus the unique aroma of the truffle, making it a bit greasy and too much for my friend. Although for foodies like me myself would not mind.That said, we both liked my Beef Bourguignon better. The wine-braised beef was tender and flavorful. You can't actually taste the wine, but it helped soften the meat. It also made the sauce richer, so that the meat was completely soaked in it, absorbing all the umami elements. It is a bit too salty, but was perfect for dipping some bread.For dessert, we were deciding between Creme Brûlée and the Pistachio Bombe Glachee (a very popular dessert here, which is pistachio ice cream covered by chocolate) and went with the former. It was very creamy and more of the firm texture style, yet smooth as well. The caramel crust is always the fun part, crunchy and has a subtle burnt bitterness. Cracking and mixing it with the cream can not but add yumminess.Our server and busser were attentive and refilled the water for us from time to time. We ate, drank, and chatted, really enjoying our time here and a hearty lunch. Same as last time, lovely ambience and the portion is very generous, so things like salad, appetizers, and desserts are definitely meant to be shared.

This place was packed, bustling with energy but despite how full it was, it didn't feel cramped. Our small little table, though so close to so many others, was still intimate and comfortable. The wait staff were so attentive and SO friendly - I was actually surprised and impressed by how friendly they were. Every time our waiter Manu came by, he was warm and conversational (never made us feel like he was rushing us) and he made us feel like friends not just customers. The food itself was delightful - everything you hope traditional French food to be. We got the mussels, hangar steak, ratatouille, and the duck leg (and Manu generously gifted us with an incredible creme brûlée with fresh strawberries that we inhaled in 5 minutes), and all of it was delicious! Portions are good - not too small but not oversized either; satisfying and leaves you just a tiny bit wanting more; effective for guaranteed returns. Not that everyone cares about this, but since I do, I will also mention that the bathroom was very clean and smelled nice :)Pricey a bit so not somewhere you can go every weekend (unless you are pretty wealthy) but it's worth the splurge especially for a nice date with a lover or friends.

Mussels were cooked perfectly and served in a generous portion by appetizer standards.

3.0,2/24/2019,"The best part of this place is the ambience (super cute, very charming, good acoustics for conversation) followed by the service (attentive and pleasant waitstaff, busses, hosts). The not so outstanding element is the food... four people had brunch for $150, which is definitely on the pricier side, and there were several things that should definitely have been better for that price point. My Croque Madame was good, with nice crusty bread, bechamel, and toasted gruyere; however, my green salad was so full of grit from inadequate washing that I couldn't eat it. I ordered a tea at the start of the meal and instead of serving it in a nice, prewarmed pot, I was given a cup of lukewarm water with a teabag. Minor detail, but again, the experience should match the setting. My partner ordered French toast and it was not great; again, maybe our expectations were too high, but with bread from Balthazar you'd expect more. The kicker, however, was the cheap, imitation maple, colored corn syrup that they served with it... it wasn't even good by imitation standards.

There were a surprisingly large amount of mussels for an appetizer and the white wine broth was absolutely delicious. We shamelessly asked for more bread to sop it all up. The mussels were very fresh.Plats Principaux - Steak Frites Au Poivre: The most ""worth"" main course on the restaurant week menu. The steak was decently sized and cooked perfectly medium rare. The peppercorn in the cream sauce was a little overpowering but added flavor to the steak. Pretty decent steak.Desserts - Tarte Tatin: My least favorite part of the meal. The tart was VERY appley and the base of the tart tasted uncooked and raw. The caramel and ice cream did little to sweeten the tanginess of the apple.

The restaurant itself was beautifully decorated. Elegant but simple. Very welcoming.Between my BF and I we had mussels, scallops and dry aged steak. I came for the foie mousse but they were out and I was def a little bummed about that, but it happens. The mussels were sweet and tender with a silky, delicious broth. The scallops were perfectly seasoned and seared and the steak...omg... mouthwateringly perfect. We also had a few absinthe cocktails. I had one infused with lavender which was too perfume-y tasting for me, but the rest were enjoyable and unique.I would've rated 5 stars but beyond the sweet hostess and the bartenders, the service was lacking. Not even timing wise as we got our food within a reasonable time. I fully understand that they were busy, but anytime our server interacted with us he was just so disinterested.

4.0,2/3/2019,"My wife just treated my to a birthday dinner here, and we had a good time. The place is beautiful, with an unusual layout, elegant lighting and classy ambiance. A great spot for a date. Boudin noir aux pommes (blood sausage with apples, calvados & potato purée): very good. The blood sausage was buttery and melted in my mouth. Not for everybody, but it was perfect for me. Grilled octopus: disappointing. Perfectly grilled, skillfully seasoned, beautifully accompanied by yummy mini sides... Yet, the octopus itself was tough. You could barely cut it with the knife. A costly mistake.Wagyu truffle burger (KOW Wagyu blend, truffle dijonnaise, caramelized onions, aged gruyere & shaved black truffles): good and bad. Bad, because I was told they were out of the truffles to add to the burger (the reason I ordered it) the very moment they served it to me (they could have mentioned it before bringing it). Good, because they offered not to charge us for it (I didn't even ask), which was very professional of them. Duck confit: the meat was tender and flavorful, with plenty of sides. Chocolate mousse: good. Overall, although we enjoyed our visit, there were mistakes here and there that prevent me for giving this place more that 4 stars (it's more a 3.75 stars). The food had highs and lows, and although portions are big, we thought prices were a bit high for the quality of the dishes we selected.In addition, we were constantly breathing smoke from the kitchen. We didn't mention it to our waiter (who was very patient and personable), but overheard that other customers were also bothered by it. At times we could not only smell it but also see it on us.

There wasn't even bread while we were waiting. Great wine selection but way overpriced. The soup du jour was probably the only thing I liked during Restaurant Week (cauliflower cream soup). I was excited for their steak frites, but the steak was incredibly bland with nothing superb about the fries. The peppercorn sauce on the side could have saved it, if the steak was a tad bit more flavorful. And then came dessert...which there's always room for, right? Wrong. The chocolate mousse was much too heavy for a dessert. The tarte was alright, but to be completely honest I probably just liked the ice cream. Hopefully they made that in-house.

2.0,1/30/2019,"I came here at prime time for dinner on a Friday night with my fiancé. We didn't make reservations for dinner and thought that since the restaurant is quite spacious and has lots of seating that this would be a good choice. Upon entering, we were seated at the Chef's counter as all tables were reserved. I was excited to enjoy a comforting meal.We started out with a glass of wine and then my boyfriend ordered the steak frites. I was contemplating the coq au vin or boeuf bourguignon so I had asked our waiter for advice. Our waiter advised that I should definitely order the beef since it is normally served 1 day a week but has been added to the daily dinner menu due to popular demand. Great. Done!Upon the dishes arrival to our counter, I thought my dish looked a bit off. At first glance it appeared like chicken but in the beef's sauce and dressing. I called the waiter over and said that I ordered the beef not the chicken and he said that I ordered the beef and it is in fact what I ordered and walked away. I thought maybe I'm wrong, I'll just give it a try. I see out of the corner of my eye, the waiter go over to the computer where he put in the order to double check that he did it correctly. After that, he didn't come near us. After I started cutting into the mystery meat, I see that the meat is very light and white like chicken and not only does it look like chicken but it also tastes like chicken. Whats this? Wings and bones of a chicken. As good as it tasted, I called the waiter back over and said I just want to know I'm not crazy but I really believe this is actually chicken. Instead of double checking with someone, he doubled down and said its the beef and that ""maybe you have never had it cooked like this before"". At this point, I was questioning my sanity and started to convince myself that in some alternative reality that this chicken could actually be beef. NO, no I'm not crazy. I insisted that these are chicken bones. He stared at the dish confused and I could see the runners, bus boys, and other waiters all eavesdropping and peering over my shoulder to see if it was in-fact chicken. I could tell by the look on all the staff's faces that I was correct.Our waiter disappeared and probably spoke to the chef. He came back and said that they are really sorry that it was chicken instead of the beef but that the order had went in correctly but the chef apologizes that they did not give me the beef bourguignon. I appreciated that he finally admitted that I was right but it felt strange that he blamed it on the chef. I realize it could of been multiple people's faults but he was so quick to tell me the first two times that I was eating beef without properly investigating or taking the dish back to the kitchen to check with the chef. He was the one who convinced me to order the beef in the first place!I know mistakes happen but its the principal of telling the truth and doing your due diligence. I thanked him for the apology and he offered a free dessert which we did not want. I think he should have comped our entire meal or at the very least my entree. I asked if he could comp our glass of wine instead which he said he would need to check on. Finally when he returned he comped our glass of wine and we paid the rest of our bill and still tipped him.I'm surprised at the service here and the cheap offer of complimentary dessert after such an embarrassing mix up and scene that it caused. Again, we're all human but for the price, I expect better customer service and a better way in dealing with mistakes. Unfortunately, I don't want to spend any money at this establishment again.",0,0,0,Alex R.,"New York, NY",123,14,0

The menu has a wide variety of options and the wine list is great. We decided to try the Cuisse De Canard Confite Pomme Lyonnaise (duck leg confit) and the Wagyu Truffle Burger ($44). They have a cheaper boucherie burger ($28), but I'm SO glad we splurged. The Wagyu Truffle burger was delicious, the meat was very juicy and the taste of truffle was decadent and indulgent. The duck leg confit was pretty good but couldn't compare. We had a very pleasant experience here.

5.0,1/15/2019,"We recently returned to the restaurant and gave it another chance. The bread this time had a good crunch on the outside and was still very soft within, perfect with the butter. We had the onion soup and foie gras pate to start. The onion soup was not too salty (can be enjoyed by itself!) and the cheese had a rich texture that blended well with rest of the dish. The foie gras taste rich and the caramelized onions blended well with the grilled buttered bread accompanying the dish. The main were whole duck leg and beef tenderloin (med-rare). The duck skin had a nice crunch and the juicy meat, however when getting to the leg part the meat dried out. Overheard the waiter explaining to another patron the duck leg ran dry, but I think a little less crunch on the skin to preserve the soft meat might be a good trade off. The beef tenderloin was cooked to perfection. An eighth of an inch from the outer part were semi crisp and cooked well, but the rest in the center were all med-rare, bravo. We finished the meal with a dessert, creme brûlée. From the look it was run of the mill, but once we dug in and found massive amounts of ground vanilla beans that gave the dish a good pop. The service this time around was attentive, not rushed, and fast. A complete 180 from the previous experience. The restaurant traffic was much lighter this time around, so the last experience may have been caused by overloaded server trying to partially manage too many tables at once. I would recommend this restaurant for a special occasions or a casual weekend dinner.",1,0,0,Jin W.,"Queens, NY",54,28,5

I substituted mashed potatoes for extra carrots (not an ideal choice, I know), which were very average. My friend got the New York strip steak which was average.

Absolutely love the decor - from the lighting, to the placement of tables and chairs, to the semi open kitchen, to the expansive dining area and everything on my table - it's so pretty and elegant. Service is ridiculously attentive - and I mean ridiculous, because I almost felt a bit self conscious about it (also, because we came right on opening time and there was only one other party aside from us) so I guess that was my only gripe: let me breathe a little more calmly! HahTHE FOOD IS AMAZING. Seriously. So delicious, presented really well, and I would eat it again and again. And AGAIN. Calamari ($19): one of the best calamari I've had, ever. Every time I eat calamari after this place, it gets compared to Boucherie. They are a little tinier than the average place, but every bite was juicy, crispy, and full of flavor. By the time I reached the end of the plate, maybe 15 minutes later, it was still hot and crispy! No sogginess detected, tyvm. At the moment, I also don't see it on their menu anymore so I'm pretty bummed about that . . .Confit duck ($39): first time having this and I was blown. It is a little on the greasy side because of the crispy skin, which is why the salad on the bottom/around the duck tries to offset it, but it was so deliciously tender and flavorful. I really wish it was polite to eat it chicken-wing style like I do at Popeyes though :( Steak frites ($49): THE BEST STEAK AND FRIES WITH THE MOST AMAZING SAUCE EVER. I seriously loved the steak - cooked perfectly, and so juicy, and so delicious when combined with the sauce. And the sauce! If only they gave me more! I could've easily had a whole cup of that!

I've been nursing the same glass of wine for an hour, and he hadn't once checked if my meal was good, my wine, I was comfortable. It's pretty terrible service. Also my soup was terribly cold, and the broth was awfully sweet and tasted like bbq sauce. Thank god I didn't get an entree.

So the nicecst person in the restaurant happened to be a hostess, he walked us to a nice table next to a Christmas tree, decorations are on point, tho, and teh tree was real.  We had 2 waiters during the evening and they both were underqualified with the position of the server in such a ""fancy""  place. They were super in rush, didn't bring plates for share, when the waiter dropped the knife, he forgot to get us the new one.  I ordered mushroom ravioli (33$). The plate aas big and old, my thick dough ravioli were floating in a soupy textured sause or oil...i still didn't get the point of it, but it was super heavy and oily. My friend (italian) ordered squid ink linguini. Overcooked,  not al-dente, fishy.  Frog legs...ugh..disgusting, but it was my choice, so can't blame noone, but still believe u can serve them much better. The bread (which i expected to be a warm, crusty french baguette)was cold and dry, the butter was frozen.  The dessert ( chocolate mousee) was nice. We both had 2 glasses of champagne (22$ each!!!) and 2 galsses of wine (24$ each!!) . The bill was 237 + tips. Feels rapped Can't recommend to go there to my friends, so... yeah.

5.0,12/10/2018,"Had a fantastic dinner here this past weekend.  We showed up 40 mins early for an 8pm reservation--table wasn't ready of course but they did have room at the chef's table and we were fine with sitting there.The atmosphere here is warm and inviting, with the Christmas decorations/lights up reminded me of an Alsatian bistro in winter.This is traditional french bistro food.  We got to meet Chef Dominick, who answered all of our questions, and who seemed to really enjoy what he does, and takes great pride in their ingredients.  Everything is house made (except the blood sausage), and their beef is prime (save the steak frites which uses a choice cut).  For those who appreciate good meat, their steaks will not disappoint.Had these things:*aged boulevardier cocktail--really nice, bitter, good before dinner drink.  *foie gras mousse--fantastic.  Served with spiced port onions, which were interesting but not necessary.  They detracted a bit from the mousse, and were a little sweet for me.  The mousse was decadent--one of my favorite lunches in Paris is stopping in Hediard for some pate de foie gras, and getting a loaf of bread and bottle of bordeaux...I enjoy it just spread onto fresh crusty bread with no accompaniments and some good wine.  This preparation was very authentic and well done.*Beet salad--this was fine, but this is something that isn't hard to mess up.  It was as good as expected.*Chateaubriand--astonishing.  As good as it gets.  Amazing to me they can turn out such a melt in your mouth, gigantic portion of meat in high volumes.  Said it was for two, but enough for 4.  Perfectly seasoned.  Served in the pan with a port wine reduction.  Also requested and received some béarnaise.  Again, this was phenomenal, and perfectly cooked.  Sauces were excellent.  As a special treat we got an accompaniment of foie gras--rich and buttery, and delicious spread atop the meat.  Truly an over the top, indulgent meal you can't eat every day.*crème brûlée--this was good, standard creme brûlée.  They are all the same to me, either good or bad, and this one was good.  *pistachio ice cream bombe--this was interesting, and delicious.  Dark chocolate sauce had a hint of bitterness which was a nice contrast to the very sweet ice cream.  The chocolate sauce would have benefited from a touch of liquor--maybe b&b or calvados.That's about it--will return.  Was very impressed.  Top notch service as well.  Very unpretentious.",0,0,0,Jared E.,"Columbus, OH",44,144,1033
1.0,12/10/2018,"Came here for dinner last night and was really excited based on the pictures and the reviews.When I got there, the ambiance was very nice, and people seemed to be enjoying themselves.I guess that's where it ends for me.  For appetizers we ordered foie gras which was very good.  This is where the one star comes in.  We also had escargot.  The escargot, was basically swimming in butter, which being this is a french place, was acceptable.  The taste however was not existent.  The was no flavor, no seasoning, nothing.  One star down.For the main course, we ordered the soup of the day, which was a meat based soup, with short ribs, bone marrow and oxtail.  The soup itself was good, nothing to write home about, but the meat was cooked perfectly.  We had to asked for some salt and pepper because, again the flavor was just not there. Half a star down.I had the steak and fries,  this is where it really goes down hill for me. I asked for the peppercorn sauce to be served on the side, and glad that I did.   The steak itself was cooked perfectly, no complaints there, and the fries were delicious.  My big issue was the sauce, when I tasted it, I felt like someone just put a salt shaker in my mouth and wouldn't stop churning.  Basically the sauce was inedible, it was so salty.  When I mentioned this to the waitress, she basically told me, to not use the sauce and just eat the steak and left.  I was floored. Major stars off.Overall for a french restaurant, that strives to be more then a tourist spot at this point it failed miserably.  French cuisine is looked upon as a high standard, not to mention the prices they charge, this was a complete fail.I really hope management reads this review, and installs an actual chef in the kitchen, who tastes the food that is actually going out of the kitchen.A first year culinary student would never serve a sauce that was served to me, and yet this somehow passed their supposedly high standards.But the staff was nice, and the fries were good.  So the one star stands, barely.",1,0,0,Dmitry R.,"Forest Hills, NY",22,139,54

The staff was friendly and attentive. STEAK TARTARE ($31) - One of the highlights of the meal. Highly recommend this as a starter, great flavor, tender and melt-in-your mouth steak balanced with the creaminess of the egg along with pops of pepper and caper. Definitely would order this dish again!ESCARGOT ($24) - Buttery escargot cooked on a hot skillet with more butter and herbs. This is definitely an indulgence, but it does not feel heavy or greasy. 40 OZ TOMAHAWK RIB-EYE ($155) - One of the other highlights of the meal. Highly recommend this as a entree if you have a big party or just want to impress your dinner date. This entree can feed three poeple. Steak was perfectly cooked (perfect medium rare) and tender with a flavorful crust. The dish also comes with roasted bone marrow, very decadent. POTATO GRATIN ($12) - Slices of potato cooked in cream and butter. Pillowy-soft and creamy potato layers with a crispy cheesy top layer. PISTACHIO BOMBE GLACEE ($12) - Perfect way to end date night. A brownie topped with pistachio ice cream covered in warm, decadent chocolate. Be sure to capture the moment when the waiter pours chocolate over the dome of creamy ice cream. This dessert is not overly sweet, but definitely a treat. I want to give Zeina a shoutout. Not only was she warm and friendly, she was also engaging and attentive. She definitely made our anniversary special.After my mediocre experience at Boucherie Park, Boucherie West Village definitely makes up for it from the amazing appetizers to the outstanding service.

5.0,12/4/2018,"I was invited here for a complimentary dinner, which turned out to be delicious. I had been to their Flatiron location before, and have to say I prefer this one more because of the cozier vibe (not to say that one isn't great, too!).The restaurant was buzzing on a weekday night, but my boyfriend and I were seated quickly on the second level. We ordered:- Escargot: generous portion size for an appetizer as it came with 12 pieces, not in the shell. Per usual, the dish was drenched in butter but was lacking the delicious garlic that usually accompanies it. Probably the most disappointing dish of the night, but we still polished it off, with the help of their fantastic bread.- Mussels: yet another giant portion for an appetizer. Classic dish prepared perfectly, with a heaping mound of mussels bathing in a delicious white wine broth. - Cassoulet maison: this is the Tuesday night special, and came with duck confit, pork belly, sausages, and beans. Super heavy, but so good and perfect for a cold autumn evening. - Steak frites: my fave! Cooked medium rare to my request, came with a side of peppercorn cream sauce. Better than what I had in Paris.- Tarte tatin: a light(ish) way to end a decadent meal. Again, while there was nothing groundbreaking about this dish, it was done very well. Came with a scoop of ice cream.Drinks were well mixed, and I definitely felt it after two Old Fashioneds.Bottom line is Boucherie is the quintessential classic French bistro that nails the preparation of a variety of dishes. Nothing here is going to rewrite the cookbook, but sometimes you need a meal where you don't have to spend 20 minutes figuring out what type of moss you've just been served.Also - shoutout to our wonderful server Zeina!",2,0,1,Yuting Z.,"Manhattan, NY",435,332,543

We started with a French onion soup. We would have been better off getting one from Panera bread. This one was lacking any depth of flavor. Next our main courses came which were steak frites and the hanger steak. The steaks were cooked as requested which was the only plus. The peppercorn sauce for the steak frites lacked serious flavor. The hanger steak was very charred and over powered the red wine onion sauce. The onion sauce it's self needed salt and pepper as well but the combination of the red wine onion sauce mixed with char was absolutely horrid. Next we ordered dessert, perifiertoles and a cappuccino. After 30 mins it never came so we cancelled it and asked for the check.

I highly recommend trying these dishes! After we finished the mussels, we dipped our bread in the white wine sauce, which was highly addicting. For our mains, we got the squid ink linguini and the steak frites au poivre. The linguini could have used a bit more flavor and seasoning, but it had a lot of seafood, so I can't complain. The steak was perfectly cooked medium, and the peppercorn sauce was delicious. The fries (omg, the FRIES) were so crispy and piping hot and yummy... For dessert, we had the pistachio bomb glacee, which is like decadent chocolatey heaven. I love the chocolate they pour on top--it's so rich and chocolatey, but it's not overbearingly sweet.

The portion is quite big but a lot of it I was picking off the fatty parts. There are veggies that come with this plate, but there isn't much.The ravioli is good, we had that as an app. It's a little confusing because the pastas are right next to the app portion of the menu, so I'm assuming those are app portions? The ravioli comes in 6 pieces. Bread is slightly stale, don't really recommend eating it to fill you up before your meal.We also tried the steak frites that came with this au poivre sauce I believe? The sauce was too floral in terms of taste. The fries were slightly soggy, I would've preferred for it to be more crispy. For dessert, we had the crepes. These crepes are doused in this sweet cream sauce. It was good, not amazing. Beautiful restaurant, with indoor and outdoor seating. Res was quite easy to make on a weekend night. It does get busy in there. There is bar seating as well. Huge space. The burger looks good. They have a green hour (their version of HH) where they have a burger for $12. Would come back to try that.

It felt like a completely different dining experience and I'm excited to have a French restaurant that serves delicious food close to where we live.We were greeted promptly by our delightful server who was attentive without being overbearing. The other people in the service staff were also wonderful, our water glasses were never empty and when we were finished eating the various courses our dirty dishes were promptly cleared.Our server recommended a few glasses of wine that were full bodied and complemented our dishes perfectly.For food, we decided to be adventurous and ordered the frog legs per the suggestion of our server, and wow they were delicious. The plate comes out sizzling hot and the frog legs themselves are perfectly seasoned and I tasted a touch of lemon that made me think of a calamari dish.I also had enjoyed the foie gras the first time I came so we decided to re order that, and it was just as good as I remembered - perfectly smooth with a delicious onion compote to complement the flavors.  Unfortunately they did not have gluten free bread for my fiancé but the brioche bread that comes with the foie gras that I was able to enjoy is great.For the main, our server suggested we share the porterhouse for 2.  The steak was prepared to a perfect medium rare throughout - only the very tips/ends were a little more medium.  There was a nice amount of flavoring without being overwhelming and barely any fat on either side.  I personally am more of a filet person so enjoyed that more than the strip, though both were delicious. The bearnaise sauce that comes on the side offers a nice extra flavor profile to complement the steak. We also ordered the potato gratin and cream spinach. The potatoes had a nice crispy outer layer  with a softer interior and the spinach was awesome, the seasoning and flavors were amazing and even though it probably was, it didn't feel unhealthy like most cream spinaches do.For dessert, the gluten free options were creme brûlée and chocolate mousse. We opted for the mousse and it was light but offered just the right amount of sweetness to finish off a great meal.Overall, boucherie exceeded my expectations the second time around and I will definitely be coming back!",3,1,1,Elyka A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",198,204,634

2.0,11/13/2018,"While the food at Boucherie is good, I would never recommend it for more that a small party.  We'd been working with their manager for almost two months for a party of 20, and when we arrived the table was set for less than 18.  Instead of making more room in the restaurant - which was almost empty outside of our party - they instead sat two of our family at a completely separate table.  When we asked to incorporate the two, the manager seemed far more interested in being right, insisting we had only said 18 despite the fact that we had an email confirmation for 20 people.  My mother - one of the sweetest people - almost got into a yelling match with the manager.This is the part where I should mention this late lunch was actually my wedding reception post-city hall.  It wasn't great to watch someone argue with my mom instead of adding two seats to the table.In the end they did make attempts to correct the situation, but watching the manager at a restaurant where the party planned to drop several thousand dollars yell at the customer instead of make VERY simple changes left a tarnish on my wedding day.Wait staff tried their best, and the food came out very quickly, but management needs some lessons in customer service.",0,0,0,Leeann K.,"Manhattan, NY",1,30,17
3.0,11/13/2018,"Excellent food, good service, questionable management. Wedding party of 20. After confirming reservation the day before, the table was set up for less than this. One couple ended up being seated separately and it took an act of Congress with the argumentative manager to get two more chairs at the table and given the place was only partially filled, this was ridiculous. Same couple was skipped when meals were ordered, but wait staff and excellent kitchen staff got right on it while manager aloofly texted.

5.0,11/8/2018,"Writing an update to my previous review.  To be completely honest, I made a huge mistake. The review that I left was actually for a different restaurant, and while I thought I was at Boucherie, I wasn't.  The entire story is a long one and I won't bore you with the details.  After my original review, Zorica (GM) reached out to me and said that the service that I was given was not at all typical and up to their standards and she wanted to make it right, by giving them a chance to make it up to me.  Zorica was amazing in offering me an great incentive to come back and try again, along with handling a special request that they don't normally do.I went their last night, and as soon as I was sat at my table (which was probably the best table in the place) I realized the mistake I made.  I reached out to the current manager and informed him of my mistake, apologized and I stated that I did not deserve all that Zorica was doing for me.  He said not to worry about it at all.  Now to the actual review.  Long story short, the entire experience was top shelf.  The wine and appetizers (Foie Gras, Mussles and Escargots) were incredible.  For the main course we split the Chateabriand, and it was probably the best steak experience I've had in NY.  Seasoned perfectly and the most tender piece of meat I've eaten in a while, and the peppercorn sauces were heavenly.  I still can't believe I made such a mistake in my original review and hopefully they can forgive me for that.  I will be sure to return with friends as often as I can.",0,0,0,Michael R.,"Naperville, IL",3,6,0
5.0,11/7/2018,"""Boucherie"" means ""butchery"" in French, so my biggest tip for this place is GET A STEAK. Any of them. My biggest regret was getting only one steak dish instead of two. Girlfriend and I split the filet mignon with truffle butter and the Pot A Feu (Sunday special, short ribs, oxtail with veggies and broth). The steak was phenomenal. I wanted to order medium-rare, but girlfriend wanted medium.  However you want your meat cooked, they will do it perfectly. Even though it was medium, it was the most tender, juicy steak I've ever had in my life. Damn perfect.The Pot A Feu was very nice. It was subtle and delicate, and I am glad I was able to try it. I probably wouldn't order it again, though. It was hard going from the truffle butter filet mignon, that curb stomped your taste buds, to a really light, subtly flavored broth. We still finished the hell out of the Pot A Feu until there was only bones left.Every appetizer on the menu sounded so good. We settled on the asparagus salad and the escargot. I loved every bite of the salad, which came with a poached although I wish it had just a little more asparagus. Another piece or 2 would have been perfect. I haven't had too many escargots before, but Boucherie's was easily the best I've had. We were so full at the end, but we still got a creme brulee. I loved it.I highly recommend the Boucherie Old Fashioned. It was one of the best cocktails I've ever had.

4.0,11/4/2018,"Ended up at Boucherie unexpectedly after a change in plans for dinner at another restaurant in the area and but had a solid dinner. I will say that when we arrived, with a reservation, as a party of four black people in a restaurant that was full of predominantly white patrons and escorted through the entire restaurant, up the stairs, and then seated at a table in the tiny wine room I was completely put off. While the restaurant was busy, there were tables open that could seat four downstairs on the main floor. One our host even awkwardly stopped at making us believe it was our table before she continued on through the restaurant up a set of stairs, to the end of that dining room and finally to our seat. Again off putting and I do think problematic. However, our waiter was wonderful and his service was attentive.The food was great, well portioned and nicely presented. All what I would expect from a solid four star restaurant in the West Village. Our waiter recommended for drinks that I try the Amelie. It was light and sweet, not too boozy. For my meal, I had the beet salad which was light, came with a good amount of beets and smear of goat cheese. Nice way to start. For my entree, I had the bronzino which came de-boned, etc as two fillets. This was topped with a chunky tomato and artichoke jus. Plenty of fish but not too much-- a good portion size. We finished with a creme brûlée that was tasty but not out of the ordinary. A restaurant for a solidly good meal, but nothing to extraordinary.

Typical French bistro fare.  Four of us in our party ordered the ""Butcher's Block"" which is a huge cutting board with four cuts of meat (ribeye, hanger steak, NY strip, and filet).  It was $205 which I think is a great deal.   It easily could have served five ppl.  Each steak was different in texture and taste and it was great to sample each cut.  Each of us preferred a different cut for a different reason though the filet was a standout.  Four different sauces accompanied it.  The front space did look a little tight with tables close together.   Beautiful bar.   Lots of cocktails made expertly.  An unusually long list of absinthe drinks.  Recommended.",0,0,0,Chris P.,"Massapequa, NY",18,13,3
5.0,11/2/2018,"An amazing experience at a casual French Restaurant . Sign me up for more. I went here for a guy's night two-weeks back. I haven't had to much experience with French cuisine in the past, but I must say Boucherie went above and beyond. One thing that has been so lacking for me of late, in my NYC dining experiences... has been good service. And the service at Boucherie was EXCELLENT. From the moment we met the hostess, being seated, and being checked on. Well done.Another big surprise was the quality of the cocktail drinks. The Old Fashioned was made like a champion, and all of my friends loved their mixed libations as well. Let's talk food, my favorite part:1) Steak Tartare- I've had this appetizer before and it was really tasty combined with the capers.2)Mousse de Foie Gras- The Goose liver was rich in flavor, although not my favorite thing to order in most places. 3) The Pan Seared Tuna Ahi- One of the better salad appetizer's I've trie in a while.4) Escargot- I'd never tried this before.. and ill be honest I didn't really like it, but my friend said it was on point.. to each their own ?5) Main Course- Rack of Lamb- This was spot on one of the best meals I've had in quite some time.. I ordered it Medium and it was juicy, succulent and cooked to perfection.  I highly highly recommend you order this when you visit.6) Dessert- Cream Brulet and Chocolate Mousse- We split this as a group, the chocolate was rich and this was a surprisingly good desert.The meal at Boucherie was full of surprises from start to finish. But overall, if someone was looking for a fancy meal, without the typical snobby attitude of a high-end place.. Look no further !

4.0,11/2/2018,"I had two friends visiting from out of town, and we wanted to do a special occasion group dinner. French cuisine was proposed...so we ended up at Boucherie, which impressed just as much as expected.The dinner atmosphere and decor was fantastic -- warm, intimate, classy, upscale, beautiful. The service was great for our table as well.Be prepared to splurge, since this place is definintely not cheap. Maybe save it for a special date or celebration. We ordered a round of champagne, which tasted perfect. Then we got the escargot to start, which was probably my favorite dish -- excellently done, and don't forget to dip the complimentary bread in the leftover butter/juice/sauce. Thinking about it now is making me salivate...Then, per our waiter's recommendation, we all ordered either a meat or fish dish: two brazinos, one lamb chop, one steak, and one duck confit. Everything was beautifully plated (especially the lamb) and, I think, well-liked around the table. I can only speak to the duck confit specifically, but it was delicious and solidly portioned. Of course, we then couldn't leave without getting some desserts to share. My favorite was definitely the profiteroles -- highly recommend. The other two (pistachio bombe glacee and mousse au chocolat) were good but forgettable.All in all, great dining experience.

4.0,11/1/2018,"We stumbled into this place after attempting to survive the stampede of the Halloween day parade. The manager and hostess were very friendly and accommodating. The prices are on a higher end, but you do get very well prepared food. For the appetizer we ordered escargot, mussels, and frog legs. The mussels were especially exceptional with mushrooms and thick bacon. I must say that the escargot was much larger in size and quantity than usual. For entrees we got the seafood squid ink linguini, duck confit, steak frites, and organic chicken dish. The steak was spiced very well, but it was tad bit overcooked. They gave us an extra escargot dish because we waited for a long time. We didn't ask for it or complained, but it was a nice touch. The drinks were interesting, but one of the drinks tasted like a perfume in an unpleasant way. The waiter was friendly, but he was rushed due to the quantity of people and what appeared to be short staffing. He was also slightly ill informed about the detailed of the food. He didn't know the amount of frog legs in the apetizer and told us it's two frog legs in a dish, and we ordered two sets. He was concerned egnouth to find out that 6 legs come in the dish, and we canceled one order. The dessert was out of this world. We had some sort of pistachio icecream that gets dark chocolate poured over it tableside. Profiteroles with icecream were amazing as well. So my only complaints were flagging the waiter and hunting him down due to short staffing, and long wait for food. I felt like considering the large size of the restaurant they can expect a large amount of people at any given time, and that should be reflected in the amount of people in the kitchen and amount of waiters. However, the food was excellent and I highly recomend it if your in the area. Price wise, it's the city so nothing to complain about.",3,0,1,Donna P.,"Brooklyn, NY",40,226,577

You can enjoy a nice meal with friends or with a significant other without feeling rushed or being too close to a neighboring table. The staff is also really attentive and comes by ever so often to check up on you so it's a great place for a date with minimal interruption.Franco Mexican War -  a neat drink that had a bit of a smokey kick to it. Perfect for someone looking for something light but not sweet/fruity.Steak Tartare - Even if you're not a fan of raw meat, you should give this dish a try. It's one of their signature dishes and it's packed full of flavor! The quail egg was a nice touch as you can drop the egg into the dish before mixing it in! Salade Nicoise - This app was big enough for two people to share and is a good alternative for the healthy eaters out there. I didn't get a chance to try it in Nice, France and was delighted to see it on the menu.Faux-Filet Bercy - This dish was better than the Tomahawk in my opinion. The steak was cooked perfectly. The outside had a bit of a crisp while the inside maintained a juicy yet tender medium rare center. No need for any sauce as it was good on its own!Profiteroles - The best part of the meal! It's a fun dessert to share due to its construction/texture. The chocolate covered cream puffs were soft. The ice cream along with the chocolate syrup was slightly melted so you could dig right in!

5.0,10/25/2018,"You know I can say that I have never eaten at a french restaurant before.My impressions were that it was all duck entrees or funky euro-salads. And of course that ""snail"" dish. But after eating here all I can say is:Donnez-moi plus s'il vous plaît! (thank you google translate).I came in for an early dinner with my brother and two friends. The large and beautiful architecture inside made a casual dining space seem more elegant.Right off the bat the waiters were pouring us water and giving us drink menus to peruse. Call me old-fashioned, but I went with the Boucherie Old Fashioned (my puns rock!) and was not disappointed. Lets get onto the good stuff - the food. Here's where the Boucherie immediately won me over. Our group ordered four different appetizers all that were delicious.The Steak Tartare was mixed very well and put together with the shallots and capers was a table favorite. The Mousse de Foie Gras was a very rich liver of goose that really surprised me with its taste. The large piece we got was quickly scooped off the plate by my fellow table-mates.Who can forget the Salad! The Salade Nicoise had we seasoned and served pan seared tuna ahi tuna on the top that fulfilled the sea-food quota for the night.Onto the Escargots.. I admit I actually wanted to pass on this. But my friend Gennady (ever the adventurous eater) insisted on it. I'll admit the way they served it made it look pretty enticing. The  12-pieces of Snails were baked without the shell and cooked inside Garlic and Shallots. While I don't think I would be a regular consumer of Escargots, it wasn't as bad as I thought. I'd describe it as a bit rubbery with a nice garlicky butter taste.Hey, when your in a French spot, why not?For my main course after some big-time pondering over the steaks, i went with the Cotelettes D'Ageanu Romarin (damn I wish I could pronounce these words!) aka the Rack of Lamb. And man did they NAIL it. I went with it cooked Medium, and even though it may have came a little more on the medium-rare side each juicy bite was a taste of something special. The side of roasted new potatoes and heirloom carrots provided a healthy and photogenic spread of veggies to indulge in. This was the best roast of lamb I've eaten all year, if ever.Lets not forget about Dessert. Our table split two deserts of Chocolate Mousse and the Creme Brullet. Both were generously covered in whipped cream and strawberries. They could do no wrong this evening, as both were rich in flavor and taste. It hit the spot :).The service the entire night was on point. When I needed a drink the waiter was close-by, and despite getting busier closer to 7 pm the food all came out in a more than reasonable period.Look: it's not a cheap place by any means. But when you get great food , service, and decor all one spot it's worth every penny.Bien joué Boucherie. Bien joué.",4,1,3,Alan B.,"Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY",302,453,12

5.0,10/23/2018,"I came here on invitation from the manager as a follow up to their sister restaurant Olio e Piú.  It is a much larger restaurant than the former and the inside architecture is beautiful.We were treated graciously by the staff to two appetizers, two drinks, two entrees , and we opted to only go with 1 desert at the end.  I enjoyed the Boucherie Sazerac as a sweet liquorish like absinthe cocktail.  My girlfriend opted for the Gewurztraminer as a lightly sweet white wine.For starters we opted for the mussels and steak tartare.  The mussels were fresh and the sauce was a sweet white wine that went well with the crispy baguette slices.The steak tartare was delicious and well balanced with spices and fresh onion.  Our main dishes were the rack of lamb and the filet mignon with truffle butter. At first glance the rack of lamb is beautifully presented and the colors balanced well with the spinach greens and tomato.  My suggestion is to get the filet medium rare or even rare anything more well done will tend to dry up the meat as I could feel the ends starting to dry.  As with any large cut of meat that is going to pan seared.For desert we went for the pistachio bombe glacee, it was very rich and and creamy with chocolate all over. Overall our experience was great. Our server had left my girlfriend with a gift from the restaurant that depicts more of the work Boucherie does.Will definitely be coming back.If I were to suggest anything the restaurant had to improve to take it to the next level.  Our primary server was fantastic, it did seem like there were other people trying to take our orders as well which may make things unorganized.  At some of the other high luxury restaurants I've been to I've enjoyed the personal interaction with your server as your host.

5.0,10/18/2018,"I cannot recommend this place enough! I had a wonderful Sunday night dinner with my boyfriend and every detail of our night was perfect -- the ambiance, the service, the food. Every single dish was a standout.My boyfriend had the Spearmint cocktail and I had a glass of Sancerre to start. Both were great and went well with the appetizers: Raviolis aux Champignons. So good! The pasta tasted so fresh, the mushrooms were flavorful and juicy, and the truffle sauce with the ricotta stuffing was so creamy and paired so well together. Mousse de foie gras: I love foie gras and I understand people who don't like the taste but if you're going to try a foie gras try this one. It's creamy and smooth, perfect with the sweet caramelized red onions and the vinegary/lemony petit salad. The fresh grilled bread drizzled with olive oil was the perfect complement, giving the smooth foie gras the perfect crunchy base.For our main, we shared the Aloyau de boeuf pour deux. A 36oz dry-aged porterhouse that came with a mild and buttery bearnaise sauce. The steak was amazing, tender and medium rare on the inside and it looks like it was finished in the oven for a nice char on the outside. We prefer a bordelaise sauce and our server kindly gave it to us. We also ordered their fries on the side -- hands down best fries!!! The crunchiness and saltiness is awesome with the steak. Don't miss the fries. I repeat: DO NOT MISS THE FRIES. Along with the steak, I had a glass of Syrah, as recommended by our waiter. Outstanding. Bold and smooth, but not difficult to finish as it often happens when a glass of wine is too heavy and I am too full. Get this!Saving the best for last, the profiteroles. They changed my life. I can't tell you the amount of joy this dessert brings me. No dessert has made such an impression on me. The chocolate sauce is divine, the vanilla ice cream refreshing and sandwiched between warm and crunchy pastry puff. I would have licked the plate if it were socially acceptable to do so.

5.0,9/27/2018,"Had a fantastic meal at Boucherie with a small group recently and could not be more impressed.  From the moment we stepped into the door until we rose from our seats at the end of the night, the service and attention to detail were impeccable through and through.We started off our evening with some of the cocktails they had on offer.  The boys opted for some variation of the Old Fashioned, and I, a summery watermelon based cocktail with absinthe.  I can't say much for the former, but my drink was refreshing yet assertive, a great precursor to the feast to come.  We sipped the cocktails slowly before moving onto wine later in the evening. For my appetizer I had the seared scallops over a tomato compote which was light and delicious.  The acidity of the tomatoes was a nice complement to the savory, umami flavor of the scallops. The portion was also large enough to be a main and I could have easily walked away from the meal and been completely satisfied.  Unfortunately I don't have that much self restraint so obviously I stayed for the next course, and the one after that...I ordered the seafood bouillabaisse (a Provençal fish stew) for my entree which was abundant with jumbo scallops, fish, clams, and shrimp. It was quite hearty and could be shared for those with smaller appetites.  The crusty bread and garlic aioli on the side were nice traditional touches.Dessert course was phenomenal.  Order the pistachio bombe and profiteroles...and I'll just leave it at that.Highly recommend for a great French meal with pleasant atmosphere and exceedingly good service.",2,1,1,Virginia T.,"New York, NY",234,305,17

2.0,9/25/2018,"A friend and I have been meaning to try this place for dinner, but this particular Sunday afternoon we had already made plans in the area and thought we'd just at least check out the bar. We sit, and after a little longer then it should have taken to be noticed in an empty bar, we get approached for drinks, along with food/drink menus. I order a Martini, my friend orders a cocktail on the menu. We get them, his drink is amazing and mine is great too, as we expected. Then we ask for the bill when we were done, and see there was a $3 charge under my drink for 'martini'. We were very curious as to what this was, and called over the bartender. He basically said that it's added there because it being a cocktail and all, it has to be shaken, mixed, etc. His voice very low and soft, as if almost embarrassed himself to have to say it. Sort of cautious and a bit inaudible even.  I think we were in shock or too buzzed to even grasp this. I pay, and we leave. It comes up on our walk, because it just left an unsettling feeling in both of us. To be clear, it wasn't the $3. It just seemed so ridiculously bizarre for a 'tax' to be added to something that is part of the whole deal. They were both COCKTAILS!! They both had to be mixed and/or shaken!! That's a cocktail!! LOL!! WTF?! $3 more because its a martini??? Give me a break and bye bye Boucheri! (If I'm pronouncing that right, it rhymes with something that makes more sense now.)We will never try this place now, for fears we might be charged for a napkin or a replaced fork if one so happens to fall on the floor, or the floor to walk in on for that matter, or the fact the food needs to be served on plates, etc etc! Good luck with all that....",0,0,0,Vincent P.,"Staten Island, NY",3,6,0
2.0,9/24/2018,"I came here with a girlfriend on a Thursday night and decided to sit outside since the weather was still nice out. We were greeted quickly by the waitress and presented with the drinks and food menu. We both ordered a cocktail to start with and took a few minutes to decide on what to eat.We ordered the foie gras to start with, and then the bouillabaisse (mixed seafood in a saffron broth) and the 40 oz tomahawk rib-eye to share. (yes we were going all out since we were celebrating our reunion after not seeing each other for a while)They brought out our cocktails and a basket of bread first and unfortunately we had to immediately send back the bread. At first we weren't sure if we were seeing it correctly, but there was MOLD on the french bread that was brought out to us. Honestly this was the first time I've ever seen this at a restaurant (to my knowledge). I forgot to take a picture of it because I think we were both in such shock and quickly waved someone down to take it back and they were very apologetic and i'm sure also very embarrassed by this and brought out new bread for us. But this already kind of set a negative mood before the rest of our food came out. When our foie gras came out (with the same bread) we inspected every single piece very carefully because it's not super super obvious unless you happen to see the small specs.  The foie gras was very good, rich as it normally is so I wasn't able to eat too much of it. The seafood soup was also very flavorful, I would definitely recommend trying this. Finally, the 40oz tomahawk rib-eye. First of all, it was HUGE. I think with the amount of food we already ordered, it could have fed three of us ladies or just order one less app or entree next time if you want this steak. The steak was good, cooked medium rare like we asked for but there was a few pieces that were pretty fatty and we had to cut around for the meat. All in all, in terms of service and the rest of the entrees besides the moldy bread, it was a pleasant experience (I would have probably given them 4 stars if it wasn't for the mold) But because we found mold in the house bread, I'm not sure if I would come back to this location and I can't give them a higher rating. They need to have a better process of inspecting their food more accurately. It's not just stale bread, there was MOLD on it and it could have very well gotten people sick. And if we were served moldy bread, i'm sure there were other customers served moldy bread that night too.",3,0,0,Sarah C.,"Seattle, WA",232,132,1148

3.0,9/22/2018,"Nice interior design but dinner was rushed by a extremely pushy waiter. It was less than 5 mins that we received the menu and he was already asking if we were ready to order. We said we needed more time . At that point he aggressively tried selling the most expense dish. Money is not an issue but I knew I didn't like ribeye so we opted for the filet migon for two which he recommend was just 'enough' to share. We also ordered the $26.00 escargot appetizer, while it was good it's was no better than my go to place that sells it for $8. We didn't even finish our appetizer and he was already trying to clear the plate, stating our food was on the way. When the food arrived it was a cow for a family of 6! This is great if you are hungry or dinning with a group but it was just too much for the two of us. As an experienced waiter he should have advised that this plate is a heapingfull for a group of 4 or more. Instead when we inquired, he said the 'menu' states it's for two, and it's an ""american' sized plate, acting as if he didn't know what was considered too much for two. I would not return to this restaurant because it serves platters of cows and pushes you thru like a cattle.

4.0,9/14/2018,"The only reason I gave four stars was that this otherwise beautiful date night was ruined by a third party. About the time after we finished our appetizers and were waiting for the main course, I heard a faint squeaking noise near the table. As I said we were outside, and at first I thought nothing of it; there were fans outside, might have been one of them. A little while later my girlfriend noticed it as well, as it had gotten a little louder. Then, one of the branches of a potted plant that was right next to/under our table started moving. Not too long after we saw two mice run from the potted plant, along the side of the building and off around the corner. We immediately informed the manager. I could understand if we had seen these mice come from off the street but they came from a plant that was touching me as I ate. I just think that there could have been some preventative actions that could have been taken.Other than that Boucherie was an amazing experience. I've previously been to their other locations, but this was the first time I visited their main location. We got to sit outside on a beautiful day, and it almost set the perfect ambiance, but I'll get to that in a little. The service started off a little slow, but once our waiter came he apologized and the rest of the evenening was wonderful. The food, again, delicious. I started off with the veal sweetbread and my girlfriend had the steak tartare and we shared. It was a great way to start the meal, flavorful and savory, and not too filling. For our main course I had the Steak Frites and she had the Filet Mignon. Both cooked, and seasoned, to perfection. And I don't know how they make the fries, or where they get them from, but you cannot stop eating those things. Unfortunately this time we were not offered the herb or truffle oil toppings for them, but tasty none the less. Finally, to end the night we just had to get the crepes again.

After our drinks we moved to our table up on the 2nd level overlooking the restaurant and the kitchen... I recommend sitting here if you can!  Not the top level, but the terraced middle level.  Our server recommended the mussels as a starter and he did not steer us wrong; they were delicious! The plate was cleared and sauce soaked-up with the delicious bread!  We ate so much bread with the mussels I was worried about saving room for the main course!  But it was sooooo worth it! Get the mussels!For mains my friend had the NY strip and I had the rack of lamb.  The NY Strip was the way to go!  Perfectly cooked with the right amount of charring!  The lamb was good, but if I was to come here again I would definitely go with a steak. The table next to us was a business party of about 6. They had the ""butcher block"" which is essentially a board with an assortment of steak!! It was impressive, and I'm not going to lie, I was a bit jealous with food envy!  As for dessert I was so full at that point I could barely eat, but we tried the profiteroles.  They were light an airy which was good given how full we were!  Next time I want to try the chocolate mousse- my friend vetoed my choice!  Overall the atmosphere and service are excellent.   As for the food, get the mussels and steak!!!

2.0,8/16/2018,"I've had brunch here a few times.  Food is okay, nothing spectacular - at least for brunch menu.  The location and outside seating is desirable though.  It has a large outdoor seating area and for us New Yorkers,  it can be desirable for an evening of drinks, or ... HOWEVER, my friend and I recently stopped by at 6:30 pm on a Wednesday evening and asked for a table outside for drinks and possibly snacks.  Only 3 tables were occupied.  About 10 - 15 tables available.  The hostess asked if we would eat dinner, we said we are not sure.  So she tried to seat us at a high bar table, where a family of four including 2 kids were seated.  I asked why I couldn't have one of the regular tables as there were SO MANY.  She said they are reserved.  I said if I were eating dinner, would they all of the sudden become 'Un-reserved', she said 'yes.'  So we left.  There you have it folks.  You can sit there only if you guarantee them that you will eat dinner, even appetizers don't get you a table.

The manager was kind enough to stop by to personally welcome us (she stopped by later again to check that everything was perfect). We shared the foie gras as a starter and it was delicious: soft, tasty and with the perfect amount of salt. For our main, we shared the porterhouse (medium rare) which was outstanding.

5.0,8/14/2018,"FOODGASM. My person and I had an opportunity to dine in this beautiful restaurant, compliments by the establishment. The restaurant is our unicorn of dining experiences thus far, from the Parisian decor, attentive staff and the piece of resistance, the French cuisine. For appetizers my person ordered the foie gras, with sweet onion jam compote and French bread. The combination of sweet jam and buttery foie gras were perfection. I had the mushroom ravioli with the black truffle fondue and burgundy truffles, decadent. We paired our starters with their impressive wine collection: his Cote du Rhone and mine, Sauvignon Blanc, both refreshing whites. Our main course was the show stopper of our dining experience. We shared the 40z tomahawk rib eye, roasted bone marrow, made in medium rare goodness. The meat was as expected: soft, juicy and packed with flavor. The umami of the bone marrow was the crux for me; I simply could not get enough. Our side dish Gratin de pommes was crispy, buttery and loaded with cheese, and complimented our main dish amazingly. The suggestion from the waiter to pair our meal with a glass of Bordeaux pulled all the palatable flavors together and was an excellent choice. The 40z is plenty for 3 people, so fortunately we were able to take some home and indulge for days. A must try! As for our dessert, we shared the pistachio bombe glacee, a brownie topped with pistachio ice cream. The pistachio nuts were subtle, keeping the ice cream soft, creamy, and refined. For presentation, chocolate syrup was poured onto the dessert by the waiter. I was a bit skeptical that the added syrup would make the dessert too sweet, but it was just the right amount of sweetness. The combination of flavors was like a party in my mouth, delicious!

Most, but not all, of the mussels, had opened. I was disappointed they were not all perfectly prepared. The Strip Steak I found fairly underwhelming. The steak had a delicious char. But the texture (I ordered M.Rare) was a but too tough, dry, and lacked any fat or savor. The fries were super crisp, just oily enough, and had the perfectly broken starch interior which may have saved the 4th star for Boucherie. The dessert of mousse was good but very standard.

We thought ok so we will have dessert. Who would put crepes suzette on the menu if they can't do  it well?

I came here the other night with a friend for dinner around 7 pm with a reservation, and the place was bustling. There are tables available both indoors and outdoors. We were greeted by our server Zeina, who was friendly and patient as we really took our time in deciding what to order. We ended up going with many of her recommendations. The restaurant was noisy - but not too noisy - just the right amount you'd want on a weekday evening at sunset for a meal with a friend, date, or casual drinks. I ordered the Lillet Spritz (great summer cocktail) and the Franco Mexican War (smoky mezcal - yum) - both which I highly recommend, and my friend ordered the Wildflower (not a huge fan of absinthe so thought it was only OK) and the Coccinella (refreshing summer drink!). The appetizers we ordered were also must-trys - mussels and truffle ravioli. But I honestly can't say enough about the steak. I ordered the Faux-Filet Bercy and it was extremely tender and flavorful.

1.0,8/5/2018,"Worst experience I ever had. Came in as a restaurant week promotion, but upon arrival stuff refused to honor that special. The reason is Saturdays and as they said sale is on Monday thru Friday only. And later waiter added Sunday to the list too, but Saturday for some reasons doesn't work for them. Weird. Even though I confirmed before coming in that it's a special we are using. We stayed anyway, because we wanted to try the place out.The worst part is when I asked the waiter about the reason why we were bumped with restaurant week special, she said she's gonna let the manager know. However nobody ever got back to us.I wouldn't right this review if the place was ok, but overall experience is terrible. Two of my friends ordered mussels and they both had half of mussels undercooked. Onion soup we had was extra salty and tasteless.  Salmon and Bronzino we had was literally soaked in butter.

5.0,8/5/2018,"Absolutely delicious. If you're looking for French cuisine, this is the complete spot. Boucherie is the ultimate spot to come for an anniversary or birthday. The ambiance and wall decor is perfect for a classic French bistro. With two floors, this place is huge. Don't forget to make reservations though because the place fills up within minutes. Boucherie is known for its steaks and absinthe cocktails, so go for those for the real experience. We started with the mussels in white wine vinaigrette and seared scallops with fennel. Both starters were perfectly light and their sauces packed lots of flavor. I generally don't like the taste of fennel but could barely taste it in the scallops. The scallops were seared only on one side and created a perfect combination of soft and hard. The sauce in the mussels was perfect to dip bread in or even just to drink. Although their absinthe cocktails are strong, we went for the boucherie old fashioned and spearmint house cocktails. I love whiskey, so the old fashioned was perfect for me. Props for the  presentation of the old fashioned in large cubes of ice. If you're not a heavy alcohol drinker, go for the Spearmint; it was a bit light in alcohol for me. Another favorite of mine, the Yamazaki 12 year old Japanese whiskey was strong and warms up your body as it runs through your esophagus; it is an ideal choice in the winter.Now the entrées. The pork was tasty and presented well with each pistachio placed meticulously on the filet, but the star of the show, no surprise to me, was the filet mignon. That thick steak just melted in my mouth. I thought the thick serving of truffle herb butter was going to be too much, but by the end of the meal, there was no trace of butter left on my plate. Their red wines pair well with the steaks. And to finish, we followed our server's advice and were thankful in getting the profiteroles. The 3 cream puffs were filled with vanilla ice cream and covered in chocolate sauce. It was a great way to finish a memorable dinner.",2,0,1,Beril E.,"New York, NY",167,110,550

4.0,8/4/2018,"Came here for restaurant week and it was fantastic! I feel like we've had a lot of lackluster service in other places and it was so refreshing to come to Boucherie and be so well taken care of. My water was always full, and wine constantly kept full as well, and we were always checked on but not in a way that was bothersome. Really great! We had the mussels, steak frites, and mousse and tarte for dessert and everything was delicious. We never felt rushed and had such a lovely evening and great table. Two three course dinners and a great bottle of wine brought our bill to $160 before tip which we thought was perfectly reasonable for our experience. My only reason for knocking one star is I would question how I would rate the food if it was the full price menu (mussels are $23 steak frites are a whopping $42) and the bill would have more than double the price which I would have found excessive for this. I thought the portion sizes and pricing of restaurant week menu were perfect and wish they offered a prix fixe like that all year because we'd be back all the time!

5.0,8/2/2018,"Hey hey!! Happy hour is sign right outside. Universal language for welcome and come on in. Sadly weather was so humid and sitting outside was off the table. We were seated at their balcony area inside. The manager Milos was so nice and offered to change our table before I told the waiter there were dripping from their ventilation pipe. 100% professional and great service. The menu is huge comparing to the table. I was a bit overwhelmed and I felt they used 100% of available space on the paper even added one more page for their butcher's menu. You sure will find something you like. Starting with cocktails, price range is similar to 99% of all places and i rate it above average. As their wine menu, the list is long. I saw many wine picked from Napa valley and couple French wine. Appetizer is a bit much.Instead of my usual order, I wanted their foie gra and tartare for our appetizer. Foie gra served with toasted bread and preserved beet is prefect. Please do smell it before eating and you won't regret. Tartare looks awesome and prefect for that Instagram picture. Normally not a fan of raw meat thou. Free bread is a bit hard to eat for me but I think it might be the weather drying but my friend said it's toasted. who knows. Fun part is the entree. Dover sole is sooo delicious. i still remember the lemony taste in my mouth after a day. I would go back for more but I don't want to be in financial trouble of course. Well seasoned and proper herbs, it's a perfect dish to be envy by your dining partner. So much so, she had to switch for my plate of fish. Ending with a plate of cut of the week isn't that bad. Asked for medium rare and it's prefect to my wish. I love how they served with veggie underneath instead of fries. Topped with a few delicious shrimp, I was in heaven. Dessert: I usually skip this part. We had their creme brulee and pistachio ice cream with champagne. That is how you end an anniversary dinner. Creme brulee served with raspberry and pieces of strawberry isn't that sweet which I enjoy a lot.

5.0,7/30/2018,"Before visiting Boucherie I have heard of the restaurant's Yelp event near last Christmas, which catered many traditional French dishes under the well lit Christmas tree. Glad that we were finally able to visit the restaurant this Sunday. We came around 8pm and was immediately glad that we made a reservation with the general manager Zorica ahead of time because it was fairly full. We chose to sit outside because the weather was nice, and were able to watch the sky color change through the course of our dinner. For appetizers, we had foie gras and steak tartare, both of which were delicious. Foie gras here was made as terrine (instead of seared). On the side were thin layered bread that went with the foie gras while not overbearing the taste. Steak tartare, much to my surprise, was savory despite being nearly raw. Daintily seared on the outside, the mix of red and brown made the dish looked appetizing. Raw quail egg on top also helped balance the could-have-been bare meat. Both appetizers were five stars here.Main course was good as well. We had the rack of lambs and 16 oz NY steak. Unlike American lamb which are cut to individual rack then seared on both sides with sauce, the rack of lamb here were cooked as a whole then cut to individuals. While the taste was more blend than what I am used to, it provided a different type of experience. NY steak came medium rare, exactly as requested. The meat was tender and easy to cut along the texture. Taste had a tint of sweetness at first followed immediately by a warming mix of salt-seared richness. Main course was good, but perhaps because the restaurant was occupied, the dish and the plate itself were slightly cold by the time they arrived. This perhaps would be the one suggestion I would give if any. Finally the dessert was impeccable. We asked for raspberry sorbet because the Yelp photos of multi-colored pink sorbet looked marvelous. Not shocking, the sorbet was fresh, light, and easily melted upon eating. I can't describe the blissful taste well so recommending that anyone who's interested to try it yourself! The dessert was perhaps our favorite part of the meal.Before ending the note, I also want to add that the service was good. The assistant general manager had checked on us before leaving to ask if everything went well, which I can appreciate. Dinner was overall a great experience and I certainly look forward to coming back.",0,0,1,Sabrina Y.,"Manhattan, NY",811,79,166

The strip steak was cooked perfectly to my request (medium rare), well-seasoned, and juicy (wasn't pre-cut). The peppercorn sauce was delightful and complimented the steak very well. Cocktails, although on the pricey side even for NYC ($16), were fantastic. I would highly recommend the Wildflower for gin and absinthe lovers.Service, however, was mediocre. We were not offered any bread and our wait staff checked up on us infrequently (e.g. water was not refilled more than once, and it took quite a long time to get anyone's attention for the check), despite our table being located right next to the registers and staff area. Sunday night wasn't particularly crowded, so there's no excuse. I'm surprised that service was this slow and inattentive--you would think they would be extra well-staffed in preparation of Restaurant Week.All in all, definitely come for the food (they can cook a mean steak) and cocktails, but be mindful that the service is nothing to rave about.",1,1,1,Dalton B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,9,19

Here is what we ordered:Wine: they have a very good selection of wine and we ordered two rounds of wines.The white wine was light and tasty, goes well with the appetizers and bread. When we are considering pairings for our meat, they allowed us to try two samples of red wines when we cannot decide on which ones to take. My friend and I ended up picking different red wines after tasting the samples. It seems like I like the lighter ones and she prefers the rich ones. We both love them a lot!Bread: good as usual. No complains.Mousse De Foie Gras：A very special combination of the savory and rich foie gras and the sweet and refreshing thing. It almost feels like it were two dishes when you try them with the bread, and the combination of both is just fantastic.Mussels: A good bland of flavors. It is lightly seasoned so you can taste the freshness of the ingredients.Medium Hanger steak: the sauce makes the steak juicer and my friend loves it! The sauce was not salty at all, but just rich. It really gave a nice touch to my steak.Medium rare Filet Deboef: I personally love this more than the hanger steak. The medium rare filet is still juicy, and when you combine it with the vegetables they supply it becomes less heavy, making me want to eat more and more nonstop. I rarely find the combining the green vegetables with the steaks and I do believe this is a very good pair. Highly recommended!Services: very attentive and efficient.

From the food to the service, my friend and I had a great time!Our server Zeina went above and beyond with her service and it wasn't just for my party. I saw her floating around taking care of all her tables and she was giving them all the same level of attention which was incredible. We took a lot of her recommendations throughout the evening and all were just as she described. Not only was she super attentive but the manager of the restaurant also kept coming to check in with us and he would do the same to all the other parties. They really make sure everyone is comfortable and happy with their meal. The food was just as I predicted: amazing. At this point I've had most of the menu and I've haven't had a bad thing yet! The steaks are all cooked perfectly, the rack of lamb is delicious, and the desserts are epic. I usually skip dessert but I force myself when here. If you're a fan of French food, I highly recommend Boucherie West Village. A perfect meal in an amazing part of Manhattan.",0,0,0,Jesse N.,"Brooklyn, NY",432,95,23

5.0,7/24/2018,"Boucherie is located on the bustling 7th Ave. As you approach, you'll see tons of outdoor seating to enjoy in the nice weather. Inside, you'll be greeted by a host and find an array of tables located in a beautifully decorated dining area. Something unique you'll also find is their skylight in the center of the ceiling. Coming into Boucherie on a lively Monday evening made it feel like it was already Thursday. After we were seated, we were presented with a cocktail/wine menu as well as some bread, butter and roasted red peppers. I opted to start with the Wildflower, which just has a hint of licorice (absinthe) taste. It was a nice balance. My boyfriend got the Bastille Sour and enjoyed it as well (we love drinks with egg white!). For appetizers we opted to try the Niçoise salad and the mussels. The mussels came in a white wine broth and were good, but a couple of the mussels weren't fully open. The salad encompassed seared tuna and a perfectly dressed arugula salad. I would definitely recommend this if you want something on the lighter end. We had a difficult time choosing our entrees since most of the steaks sounded fantastic. The waiter was able to assist with that. We ended ordering the Steak Frites (one of their most popular steak dishes) and the Filet de Boeuf. The Steak Frites is a bit of a heavier dish - it has an amazing peppercorn sauce and comes with fries. It was cooked well and was filling so we couldn't end up finishing it all (couldn't let it go to waste so we got it to go). The Filet de Boeuf is the one thing you DO NOT want to miss out on. It was one of the most tender filets I've ever had and it was topped with truffle butter nonetheless. If I came back for just one dish, it would be the Filet. We couldn't leave without dessert and our indecisiveness led us to order two - the Tartin and the Pistachio Bombe. These desserts are complete opposites. The Tartin is basically an apple tart which is extremely flaky accompanied by vanilla ice cream. The pistachio ball is essentially pistachio ice cream on top of a brownie, topped with dark chocolate syrup. If you want something decadent I would go with that. If you're looking for something on the lighter side, an apple tart is the way to go. Overall I had a great meal and amazing service. I'm still thinking about that Filet..",0,0,1,Christina B.,"New York, NY",318,324,1064

5.0,7/22/2018,"The best way I can describe dinner at Boucherie is an out-of-body experience and even that, I'm confident, doesn't do it justice. First, if you're looking for a break from the traditional American influenced fine dining, that is typical of New York City, I'd say give this place a try. You won't be disappointed. It's not just another gimmicky restaurant that sports a French attitude, in name only, but it indeed serves up classic French cuisine with a modern take. We began with the mushroom ravioli and mussels as our hors-d'oeuvres. Transitioned to steak and salmon for the entrees and finished it off with creme brûlée for dessert. Everything was delicious, as we had hoped for and expected, but what made the experience even better is the customer service. From the time we were greeted by the maitre d' until the time we left the restaurant, there was a feeling of warmth we experienced the entire time. Our waiter, Sidy, was phenomenal. Funny, charming and knowledgeable about the entire menu, even offering suggestions we took and were not disappointed with. Other waiters and servers also checked on us, as they passed. There was not once ever a time we needed anything. One of the few restaurants in New York in which I've experienced great urgency from a restaurant's staff. We were also greeted by the manager-on-duty, Emil, who also wanted to make sure we were satisfied with the food. The food is more pricey than your average restaurant, but it won't break the bank, and the quality is unmatched, and experience is unparalleled. I think I found the restaurant I will take my parents to when they come to visit in the fall.",0,0,0,Brandon G.,"Brooklyn, NY",79,243,164
4.0,7/21/2018,"French haven in the middle of NYC! The atmosphere and service of Boucherie was on point. Now, let's talk about the phenomenal food...we started off with their Escargot, which was prepared very well. It was plump and full of flavor, especially with its buttery herb sauce.For our main dishes, we ordered Pâtes aux fruits de mer (squid ink linguini), Faux-filet bercy (16oz dry-aged NY strip), and Magret de canard aux pêches et aux épices (duck breast in an orange & balsamic reduction). This was all so delicious and well prepared. The portion size was average, but the quality of ingredients made up for it.My favorite dish was definitely the faux-filet bercy which was prepared medium and had the perfect texture.We finished off dinner with crème brûlée and pistachio bombe glacee. It was so creamy and delicious!! I will definitely visit again!!",0,0,0,Chris K.,"New York, NY",231,55,82
5.0,7/20/2018,"As is the motto of Boucherie, the joie de vivre (joy of life) is best cultivated around a table with great friends and delicious food. Inside this modern yet classic French establishment is an upscale dining experience that provided me this kind of joy - one that I believe will prove quite memorable even as the hair grows grayer on my head and parts of my body become dysfunctionally limp. For the appetizer, I ordered the mousse de foie gras. It came with perfectly toasted pieces of french bread and a sweet onion jam compote. Simple. Heaven. The foie gras was a buttery, creamy delight that I spread luxuriously over the bread like a meaty cream cheese before devouring. I was already in my happy place.Next up, the entree - a filet de boeuf - a true star of the show. Each bite was a powerfully seductive romantic experience. It was as if I had never truly had a real steak ever before in my life. Juicy. So Juicy. Tender. So Tender. The meat had such a melt in your mouth quality to it that even my friend who primarily enjoys chicken above all meats, took a bite and found it delicious.Just when I thought I had experienced the best food of the evening, a trio of exquisitely prepared desserts - Profiteroles, Pistachio Bomb Glacee and Creme Brulee - sauntered onto the table and into my mouth. The pistachio bomb was a beautiful construction with soft pistachio ice cream perched atop a crispy brownie bottom. Then, with glitz and glam, chocolate syrup is poured on top table-side. The profiteroles were also phenomenal - light & airy puffs of deliciousness.  Shoutout to Sidy for his exceptional service throughout the night. This was a wonderful, unforgettable evening.",1,1,2,Neel A.,"Frankfurt, Germany",181,254,492
4.0,7/19/2018,"Appetizers:Foie Gras - Buttery, creamy perfection. Hands down one of my favorite appetizers at either Boucherie location.Escargot - Served steaming hot and stays hot for a long while! The butter is herby and the escargot is plump and more plentiful than you'd first expect. Downside is that due to the plumpness of the escargot, the herbed butter flavor isn't as well incorporated.Entree:Tomahawk Steak with Bone Marrow - 40 oz that we split between 2 people. We can eat, so we pretty much polished this off on our own, but I can see this feeding 3 maybe 4 people depending on their appetites and what else they order. Some pieces were mostly fat or more well done than we'd prefer, but those are closer to the edge and definitely in the minority. The sauce was too salty for our tastes, so we used it sparingly. Instead, we recommend pairing your bites of steak with some of the bone marrow, which is incredibly buttery and melts in your mouth. Beware of letting this sit too long though, or it'll start to coagulate.Desserts:Pistachio Bombe Glacee - Great way to end the meal. You basically get to have warm cake and cool ice cream all in one. And you get to have chocolate and pistachio and vanilla flavors all in one. For some reason, we liked this dessert more at the Flatiron location, but it may have just been luck of the draw. The chocolate poured over the dessert there seemed to have been thicker and hardened better over the little dessert dome.Chocolate Mousse - Pretty standard and classic. Can't really go wrong.Drinks:Lillet Spritz - Bubbly and refreshing. Kind of how I wish frosé would make me feel, but always falls short of.Yamazaki 12-Year-Old Japanese Whisky - This is potent and an amazing drink to sip at throughout your meal. Every sip is a deep warmth you can feel all the way from your lips to the center of your chest.Some hiccups in service:When we first arrived, we stood around for quite awhile before anybody noticed we were there and came to seat us.We had ordered a ginger ale and had to speak to 3 different people before it was brought over.Otherwise, service was attentive and checked in on how we were doing.",1,0,1,Vanessa W.,"New York, NY",472,142,337
5.0,7/18/2018,"This place is easy to love the ambience, decor and space with a traditional classic brasserie style and open kitchens. There is also an extended outdoor seating with an awning, great for people watching or enjoying the sun. The jazz music in the background is a nice touch, not too noisy and can still have conversations. To start, the table gets bread and butter. The butter is really really good. I want to keep eating it. The bread is good also. Could be crispier, but that butter, just keep spreading it. Don't get stuffed on the bread as the entrees are surprisingly huge, especially considering it's French, which is usually much smaller.For the appetizer, we had the Escargots de Bourgogne. Mmm..delicious. It's soaked in a hot buttery sauce with garlic. Very hot when it first comes out. Super tasty. So good I dipped the bread in the remaining sauce.For the entrees, we had the Faux-Filet Bercy (NY strip) and the Filet de Porc Roti (pork tenderloin). The steak was quite tasty. It comes in pre-cut thick slices and with the bone along with some salad that goes well with the steak. The pork tenderloin comes in big chunks with some vegetables on the side - carrots, spinach and shallots. We had it cooked to medium, like a steak. The portions are quite big. Great for sharing and trying different dishes. We also got a side of ratatouille. This is really good. Goes well with the steaks.For dessert, we shared the Profiteroles. It is 3 separate cream puffs with ice cream between it and chocolate sauce. A must have. The ice cream is so good, especially on a hot day.Can't miss drinks with the meal. They have a booklet of wines/cocktails/beers to choose from. We had the Chardonnay 2016 Napa Valley and the Spritz cocktail (nicely presented).Thanks to the manager Zorica for having us dine here.

5.0,7/18/2018,"Came for dinner on a Tuesday night with a reservation for 6:30 pm. As soon as we entered the restaurant we were seated immediately and even given the options on whether we wanted to sit outside, booth or regular table. The staff was overall friendly and very attentive. They were patient when we were ordering out food and took the time to recommend things of the menu as well as explain what the dishes were. To start my friend and I got cocktails-- I got the Franco Mexican war which was refreshing with the perfect amount of mezcal. We shared the escargots de bourgogne, this was a light appetizer and the buttery lemon sauce was great for dipping our freshly baked bread. We shared the côte de boeuf pour deux-- tomawk ribeye, this was delicious!!! The presentation of the food was great, you can see that it was cooked to order (medium rare). The meat was tender and had the right amount of seasoning that  did not overshadow the taste of the meat. This meal was perfect for two meat lovers. The creamed spinach was great too!  After such a great entree I did not know if I could fit dessert but my friend really wanted to try the crepes suzette. We shared the dessert and it was not too sweet which was perfect with the ice cream scoop. Overall, this is a great spot for a dinner date, to celebrate a special occasion or to treat yourself!

Soon after, the was bread and an olive, onion, stuffed tomato plate. I was concerned about the olives contaminating the tomatoes, but they were great. Sidy the server was gracious and pleasant. He gave us suggestions as I'm not a foie gras fan. I saw mussels and missed the ravioli. We ordered both and they did not disappoint. The mussels arrive in a large bowl, they could have been my meal. The broth was flavorful and creamy. I had to stop myself. The ravioli was also really good. The mushrooms on top added a layer of texture that delights the palate. My dining buddy ordered the salmon which looked great. It sat in a bed of asparagus and I think a hollandaise sauce. I have been on a steak streak, so I ordered the steak frites au Louvre. It was very tender and the pepper sauce was just right. The French fries were not the best, but the crunch and soft inside made them palatable. Now I'm stuffed. However I haven't popped, so I ordered the lime sorbet. It was just what I needed. Three scoops of cool tart perfection. I could barely stand when I left. I think I'm gonna have a party there.

5.0,7/12/2018,"My girlfriend and I had a wonderful dinner at Boucherie on Wednesday night. The restaurant was quite busy at 7:30pm, but with a reservation we were seated immediately. We sat on the lower balcony level overlooking the restaurant, allowing us to take in the ambience and decor, both of which were quite nice. Soaring floor to ceiling glass doors adorn the front wall of Boucherie, letting in plenty of light and a pleasant summer breeze. The bar is very impressive, with huge stained glass mirrors. We particularly liked the large mirror behind us with the engraved daily specials - it gave the menu a sense of tradition. Overall, the space is classy, well decorated, and romantic. It is quite loud however, good for a fun date but not quiet conversation. We started with a red wine and the Bastille Sour cocktail - surprisingly light with lemon but creamy from the egg white. Highly recommend this whiskey sour. For appetizers, we ordered the Escargots de Bourgogne and Raviolis aux Champignons. The escargot came nearly instantly, with the butter still sizzling. Really good, buttery and garlic flavor that we couldn't resist dipping our bread into after the escargot was done. Unfortunately, our other appetizer was neglected and arrived at the same time as our two entrees. The waiter came later to apologize for the mistake, which we appreciated. The mushroom ravioli was probably my favorite of the meal. It had a very rich truffle flavor with a creamy sauce and delicious mushrooms bits. For entrees, we had the Wednesday special: Sole a la Grenoblaise and the Faux-Filet Bercy (essentially NY strip steak). The sole was one of the best fish entrees I've had - buttery tenderness that paired nicely with the tangy acidity from the capers and the crunchy texture of the toasted bread pieces. The steak was perfectly cooked at medium rare, seared well with good seasoning, although the salad paired with it was a bit bland. Finally, we had the creme brûlée for dessert. It was actually quite a large portion so perfect to share. Good vanilla flavor and caramelization with strawberries and raspberries on top. Overall, we had a great experience at Boucherie. Service was very attentive, and they took accountability for any small mistakes. The food was fantastic - some of the best French food I've had in the city. The restaurant itself is beautiful, romantic, and lively. We really enjoyed our time here.",0,0,0,Kevin T.,"New York, NY",284,72,177
5.0,7/11/2018,"Boucherie is like being transported to summers in France. I've been to the Boucherie on Park by Union Square as well, but this West Village location really holds my heart. The decor, open doors, patio seating, and all the natural light that comes from the clear doors and skylight above - all lend to levity, laughter, and happiness. And the Rosé they stock is perfect - dry, crisp, and served very cold.The food is a honestly a bonus. Some of my favorites:- Saint Jacques a la Provencal: perfectly seared scallops.- Mousse de foie gras: one of the best mousses I've had. Tasted even better when spread on the warm, buttery, airy toast points.- Steak Frites: you can really taste the quality of the meat, paired with a lovely pepper sauce. The fries are also crisp and very airy.We also had the Pistachio Bombe Glacee for dessert, which although it was hard to taste the pistachio flavor and was more textural, just tasted like an amazing ice cream sundae.The prices are definitely higher than what I'd normally spend on a weeknight dinner but you can taste the quality and Boucherie is a great choice for a special occasion or just a time to treat yo self.",3,0,3,Carl C.,"New York, NY",252,248,26

5.0,6/21/2018,"A + Z = Amazing!This was my first time at Boucherie. I was immediately struck by the A. You ask what the A is? It's the ambience. From the interiors to the exteriors, you felt like you had been immediately transported to a magical night on the Champs Elysees. The restaurant is also located in a super sexy area of the West Village so you have some great walking choices for an after dinner drink. But wait there's more. The thing that stood out more than anything was the Z. You ask what the Z is? Well that's Zeina our amazing server! In a city that can oftentimes be impersonal she delivered a world class customer service experience that was second to none. With her engaging smile, charisma, and charm she helped us navigate the menu and we didn't leave disappointed. Specifically, she recommended the hanger steak and tarte tatin. Wow wow wow! My advice to management is you have a rising star in Zeina and she definitely is being underutilized in her current capacity.  My advice to any customers is to request Zeina because she just understands how to deliver a world class customer service experience. So to sum it up the A(mbience) + Z(eina) = Amazing!",0,0,0,John K.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,9,0

4.0,6/19/2018,"Upon my recent return, It lives up to it's name as all the steaks are  cooked to perfection. We had the Tomahawk Chop for two and it tastes as amazing as it looks. Presented with bone marrow to further extend your dining experience.  A decadent savory treat.  The restaurant has a special menu for steaks and display French technique in preparing meats, and a separate menu that offers enough diversity for every palate.  The food presented beautifully with a warm welcome from the hosts.  The restaurant is an open concept with a direct view of the kitchen. Our dining experience starts and ends on a high note. The foie gras mousse came with perfect accouterments of a citric frisee salad, charred bread, and sweet caramelized onions.  The mussels in wine sauce had a wonderful leek aromatic.  The cheese plate had French options and we ordered the  duck breast from the charcuterie board.  For dessert, we had crème brulee with a wonderful light creamy consistency.  In addition, the bomb has a dark chocolate sauce that I want to take home!The menu has the classics.  My cousin enjoyed her roasted chicken with perfectly crispy skin.  The Sole Meuniere was cooked properly but over seasoned.  Salty and too many capers for my palette.  You must order the ratatouille as I would have enjoyed it as my main course.This spot is great for groups.  It did get noisy toward the end of the evening with a full house.  Reservations would be a good idea.  There were numerous friendly staff and the meal was well paced between courses.  Small but good selection of French wines with a select craft cocktails.

4.0,6/17/2018,"The service here is phenomenal- dishes are timed perfectly, seating is immediate, great ambiance. The servers and waiters are extremely aware of table seating, who ordered what, when to check in their tables, etc.The food was good. We had quite a few people, so we got to order a lot of dishes to try, but the menu is really diverse and extensive. I'm definitely going back to try the others. The plating technique here is so beautiful too.1. Escargots- This dish is a must-get. The escargots are piping hot when they come out, so be careful. But these little guys packed a punch of flavor.2. Mussels- I don't eat mussels regularly, I hate them. But I had a few from this dish. They were tender, but the star of this dish was that white wine sauce. It was good, I had to dip bread bread in there.3. Steak tartare- There were so many strong flavors on this dish, but they all melded together beautifully. The quail egg was a pretty touch. This dish is also one I'd get again.4. Branzino- By far the prettiest dish of that dinner, it was sprinkled with different edible flower petals (definitely Instagram-worthy). My friend, who was a chef, said it was a unique-looking dish, the fish was good.5. Rack of lamb- The friend who ordered this one inhaled the plate. It was very filling, and the meat was perfectly cooked, tender and juicy.6. Duck leg confit- We had high hopes for this dish, as it's something I've had at other restaurants and it had great reviews as well. Unfortunately, it missed the mark. It was a little too dry, such that it was a little hard to swallow. The flavors were good, and the frisee it came with balanced the dryness out a bit. The dish, though, didn't impress.7. Faux-filet bercy- I ordered this NY strip medium-rare, but one end seemed overcooked. One end was rare and the other was medium. It wasn't evenly cooked, but the meat was still tender and juicy and flavorful. The dish came with just a small frisee and no sauce. I ate the steak fine without sauce, but I wish potatoes and sauce were an addition to the dish. Overall, it was just okay.The appetizers we ordered were unique and so good that I'd come back just for them. The entrees, with the exception of the branzino and the rack of lamb, were a little lackluster. None of the entrees were especially memorable taste-wise. Perhaps the kitchen was busy, and it was just not great timing. I wish the duck leg confit was as delicious as everyone else claimed it to be. We wouldn't come back specifically to order any of the entrees we ordered this is time, but I'll be back for apps and hopefully, the entrees are better next time!Just a tip- avoid sitting on the outer edge of the outside dining area. People were constantly taking smoke breaks over our food (surprised that the no-smoking rule isn't more enforced). The parent of two children in a table next to us also seems bothered by it. People were also coming straight up to the tables and panhandling. This wasn't the restaurant's fault, so it didn't affect the review.",0,0,0,Katy C.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,19,39

With the whole front opened out onto the sidewalk, it's the perfect summer dinner spot.Our waiter was really polite and kind, I realize it's his job, but he seemed so genuinely happy we were there and enjoying everything.For our meals, my boyfriend had the steak frites and I had the mussels and caesar salad. He loved the steak frites - I tried the fries and they were perfection. My caesar salad was probably the best one I've ever had. The mussels were good, but I've had fresher and better for half the price - I'm from Boston though, so maybe that's why.We also had the creme brulee for dessert, which was delicious.Total came to over $100, but it was a great meal, so I found it a fair price.Even though I only get to NYC about once/year and there are so many other restaurants I want to try, I would definitely come back here!",0,0,0,Kate J.,"Beverly, MA",0,58,0

4.0,6/11/2018,"Yummy food! Tons of space and outdoor seating--you won't feel like you're on top of the table next to you. Service:Hostess was great and so was our waiter. Although I do have to say, at first, we came around 10:50 and the first woman standing at the front told us we had to wait to be seated. She didn't even bother to make eye contact with us as she told us, but I'm sure she was busy prepping. Although, I get that we were there early and had to wait ten minutes for the restaurant to open--no problem. The part I didn't appreciate? She immediately let a different couple sit down and started servicing them. Not cool. I'd give her 1 Star if it was based on her alone. Food:We each ordered a hefty croque madames. Very yummy and buttery! Lots of veggies too. Just make sure to come with a very empty stomach. I ordered a (very tiny) coffee cup for $4 served in a little tea cup. Tasted pretty watered down though. Thumbs up for the croque madames, thumbs down for the coffee. I'd go again. It was good food, but nothing outstanding. Cute place to bring your parents or people out of town, though.

4.0,6/8/2018,"Had a fantastic time here last night -  we sat outside as the weather was still warm enough to manage. Alison was our server and was extremely attentive throughout the entire meal. She gave us her opinions between choices we gave her, but also offered suggestions of her own which we appreciated. From the cocktails menu we got an aperol spritz and then a Coccinella. I got the Coccinella, which was a little thicker than I had expected, but it was likely due to the strawberry juice. It tasted great though. To start, we split the fig and prosciutto salad. The presentation of the salad was stunning, but taste wise was a little lacking - the figs might not have been ripe enough to give it enough flavor. The portion was a good size, especially for an app - it didn't ruin our appetite but was substantial enough to align with the price. We then split the frisee salad. Now this was amazing. A little hard to eat, as frisee tends to be (definitely don't order it on a date!), but so worth it. The bacon was delicious and perfectly cooked. It was fantastic and the shallots added the perfect amount of flavor!We then got the larger steak tartare as one of our mains. This was definitely a portion on the smaller side, but hard to tell because it was served kind of flattened on the plate. The presentation looked nice, but had we not been splitting so many things, I don't think it would have been big enough as a main course. Not their fault - just suggesting people don't count on doing the same! The second main course we split was the hanger steak - this was AMAZING. Such good quality meat and the sauce was really tasty. Alison kindly offered to bring us some bread for the sauce which we gladly took her up on. I do wish it had come with a side of fries or something along those lines, but had we read the menu more carefully we would have noted that it did. It was served completely on it's own. The portion itself was extremely reasonable - I'm not sure if it said how many ounces on the menu, but it was more than enough. I am still thinking about how flavorful it was!For dessert my friend got the chocolate mousse. It was served in a cup with whipped cream and strawberries. Super rich yet light which was great! Overall everything about dinner was great - we will definitely be back again! This is THE pace to go for steak and meats in the west village!",0,0,1,Monica F.,"New York, NY",163,193,140

4.0,6/7/2018,"Had this place reserved for Memorial Day Brunch because the beautiful and quaint ambiance of the store was an instant sell for me. Ordered the eggs benedict (not a proper brunch without it), omelette au choix, and confit de canard pommes salardaises. Eggs benedict and omelette au choix were both quite solid; the Confit duck leg, however, I've had better -- the pairing was not the best as the combination of both chips and confit duck leg made the dish quite greasy (try Ace Hotel Whitfield for an amazing combo -- grapefruit marmalade + escarole = perfection!!) Coffee here is also very strong if you dig that. Overall, a pleasant, and nice (But PRICEY$) experience!

For our main dishes, I had the salmon which was paired with a delicious, buttery sauce and asparagus, cooked to perfection. My boyfriend opted for the filet de boeuf (I believe), which he asked to be cooked very rare. He enjoyed this as well. For dessert, we shared the profiteroles.

The filet was melt in my mouth, with the truffle butter. The Star was the truffle ravioli with mushrooms and the upside down apple crumble.... wow. Great atmosphere and service was very attentive.

4.0,5/29/2018,"I was invited back to Boucherie to give the restaurant another go as my first visit was disappointing. I Yelp allowed half stars so I could bump it to a 4.5, b/c this visit really shined.  From the beginning to the end of the meal, the experience was like night and day.  The server was attentive and made awesome recommendations.  He steered us to the fig salad, which I would have never noticed on the menu.  He said it was a light appetizer that was flavorful and a good start to the meal.  He was right.  The figs and prosciutto were flavorful and fresh and there were sprigs of greens and tomato present.He also helped us navigate the wine list and allowed us to sample the wines before deciding on the bottle.  It's a good thing, b/c I did not love the Chateauneuf du Pape I sampled.  It wasn't bad, but not my cup of tea.  My guest and I settled on a lovely bottle of Bordeaux.  For the main portion of the meal, we split the porterhouse cooked rare.  We also ordered sauteed spinach, but unfortunately that was delivered toward the end of our dinner after having asked for it twice.  The meat was cooked to order and had good flavor.  The steak was tender and it was great being able to share two different cuts.  The server was apologetic about the spinach and it was delivered along with some more wine as we had finished our bottle.  The spinach was delish and is a great side to accompany the steak.For dessert we ordered the pistachio dessert which was incredible.  I don't generally love pstachio anything, but this thing was damn good.  My guest also ordered an espresso.  He had to take a call before dessert and the server was nice enough to replace his espresso with a fresh one as it had been setting out and had turned cold.All in all, service was lovely, friendly and attentive.  The server helped us navigate the menu and made great recommendations.  All of the food we ate was delicious and had great presentation.  This experience is what I expected my first go around and I'm happy I was able to give it another shot.  The ambiance was great and we were able to dine al fresco and enjoy the West Village views.  Thank you to the Boucherie team for making my second visit memorable.

The staff is amazing. Everyone is friendly and goes above and beyond to make sure you have the best dining experience possible. During one of my visits the bartender felt that it took too long for our group to get our drinks. To make up for it, he ordered us an appetizer on the house. They truly want to make sure you have the best dining experience possible and the second they feel it's less than perfect they pull out all the stops to improve it. Be sure to order a Boucherie old fashioned. It's made with tequila and is super smooth. Once you try one you will be hooked. The sazerac is also delicious.

Perfectly dimmed and a great date spot if you want to treat your s/o for the holidays. There was also a giant tree in the middle which I was a huge fan of  For drinks my table got two bastille sours and a pocketsquare--both were amazing but my favorite was the pocketsquare! Sweet and fruitbut with a strong kick.Appetizers: We got the foie gras and escargot and BOTH WERE OUT OF THIS WORLD. The foie gras had a soft, pate texture that was served with toasted bread and a side of greens. But what put this dish over the top for me was the caramelized onions!! It complemented the foie gras and greens perfectly. I can't wait to take my mom here because she loves foie gras and I finally have a good place for her try it!The escargot came out piping hot with butter that was so good I was literally about to drink it--it took all I had in me not to lift the plate and do it. It was also the first time I've ever had snails and I'm so glad I tried it! There were 6 and one of the people I was eating with took the last one and I swear a part of my heart actually broke.For our mains we got the filet minon and veal--I personally don't like tough meat so the veal wasn't my favorite, however the jus and sweetbreads were very delicious. The plating was also beautiful.The filet minon with truffle butter is something you HAVE to get if you're ordering a cut of meat. It was sooooo tender and juicy and cut like a hot knife through butter. We got it medium rare which I definitely think is the way to go. The truffle butter was also so decadent--we lapped it up like a thirsty dog.We capped off the night with their crème brulee which was so creamy and delicious but by this time of the night we were stuffed (I was actually about to unbutton my pants but decided against it since this was a very classy place).Overall this restaurant is remarkable. The whole layout of the place was very unique as was the food, company, and décor. Our waiter Chris was also so friendly and attentive (as was the rest of the wait staff).

When we first arrived, we were greeted warmly by the staff and they made sure to always check up on us and was always prompt in bringing what we needed. We ordered the scallops which were seared perfectly and paired with crushed tomatoes, roasted garlic and fennel seed. The scallops were really meaty and the tomato based sauce was the perfect acidity to flavor the dish. Additionally, we had the squid ink linguini with shrimp and sepia in a tomato based sauce - it was perfectly seasoned and well-balanced. As someone who doesn't really like tomato based sauces, I was very impressed with how these two dishes were executed and thoroughly enjoyed both.For the entree, we ordered the 40 oz tomahawk ribeye with roasted bone marrow and borderlaise to share. It was a beautiful sight to behold. Steak was perfectly medium rare and had a nice char without being burned. Also, perfectly seasoned too - most places are heavy on the salt but I really appreciated tasting the actual meat. Additionally, I highly recommend the fries at Boucherie - they're so addictive that we had two orders. I don't know how they do it but it's the perfect potato to crunch ratio!Lastly, for dessert, we had the profiteroles which was such a nice end to the meal - highly recommend.

3.0,5/18/2018,"My first few times, right after they opened up, were great. I loved the food, warm atmosphere and attentive service. Perfect place for dinner or late night cocktails, loved it. Last time I went and we ordered steak frites and a burger, both were heavily overcooked, the quality of meat went down, it's not organic or grass-fed which I would expect in a restaurant of this caliber and specializing in meat preparations they should not be messing up the temp, we had to send both dishes back, when they brought them back, the temp was wrong again, we ate bc at that point everyone was super hungry. I think I will keep  this place for late night cocktails only, for now, and dine elsewhere.",0,0,0,Lana F.,"Manhattan, NY",9,38,0

Ventured to the West Village location, in the rain, and I would do it again and again. The staff were so welcoming and friendly. My date and I shared an awesome Reisling and I had the Arugula salad for appetizer and the salmon for my entree. It was made very well and as requested. I was full but not unpleasantly stuffed.The venue is nice but you can be casual. The staff is very professional and knowledgeable about the menu and offerings. I would absolutely come back.

5.0,5/15/2018,"This is the perfect place for any occasion, casual dinner, romantic night out with a significant other or a professional business.  I love the ambience of this place with the big open windows, especially on a nice spring day, and the breeze was amazing.  The outdoor seating is perfect for the nice weather.  They definitely got the looks down, but to the foodies let's talk about their food now. So I tried: Appetizers: Moules Mariniere - mussels and the Escargots de BourgogneEntree: Filet de Boeuf - center cut filet mignon and the Steak Frites au Poivre - New York stripDessert: pistachio bombe glacee Fancy French name dishes that I did not know how to pronounce, but I do know the meal was delicious!  Everything was wonderful, the escargot was buttery, the mussels were plumped and the white wine sauce it was cooked in was great, don't waste it dipping your bread in it! The French fries that came with the New York strip were moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside just the way I like them.  My favorite and hands down the best part of the meal was the filet mignon.  It was cooked perfectly medium rare and every bite just melts in your mouth.  Flavoring was amazing, it's so simple no sauce needed just some herbed butter. I highly recommend this place if you're looking to have a good time and great food!  The drinks are really good, try their old fashioned!",0,0,0,Eileen Z.,"New York, NY",232,123,326

Service was great and all the dishes we had were executed perfectly with the right amount of seasoning, acid and balance of all the flavors. I recommend all three highly. The steak tartar was buttery with great seasoning and acid component. The pate mousse was creamy and rich. The steak was cooked at a perfect medium rare and had a nice salt crust. I loved the frites since they were perfect size and double fried.",0,0,0,G P.,"Alexandria, VA",204,87,349
5.0,5/8/2018,"I've tried the other Boucherie location, but I decided to make reservations for the West Village location for 2 for a Sunday dinner at 5:30. When I arrived, we were immediately seated and had the option of sitting on the floor level, bar, outdoor, by the kitchen, mezz, and upper level. We picked the mezzanine level and was extremely satisfied with the view of the entire restaurant. There was great lighting and a slight breeze from the open windows.I started of with a glass of pinot noir which was perfectly paired with the steak frites I planned to order. To start, my friend and I shared escargot and it came in a hot plate already deshelled immersed in a buttery, garlic sauce. I dipped some bread in the sauce and it was delicious. I ordered the steak frites medium rare. The steak was cooked to perfection and my mouth watered before every bite. The fries were super crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It was impeccable. Every day of the week, Boucherie has a special and different dish. I went on a Sunday and the special was Lapin Chasseur (or braised rabbit with spinach). My friend enjoyed the dish very much. To finish off the dinner, we ordered the Pistachio Bombe Glacee to share per the Assistant Manager's recommendation, and it was nothing I've tasted before. It has a thin to moderate layer of chocolate cake/brownie base with pistachio ice cream topped with hot fudge which congeals a bit. Each bite was to die for! I will definitely go back just dessert! Words cannot describe it.. I had an amazing dinner with an attentive waiter. I would give it 10 stars if I could! I recommend everyone to definitely try Boucherie if you haven't done so yet.",12,6,10,Christina L.,"New York, NY",331,189,290
4.0,5/7/2018,"I was excited to come back to Boucherie after a fantastic Yelp event. Not only was the food delicious and decor beautiful, but the service was outstanding. I sat in the mid-level area overlooking the ground floor and was very happy to get Sidy again. He is helpful, friendly with a warm smile. A very big THANK YOU to Zorica for arranging the evening and having us as guests. It was incredibly generous.As I waited for my friend to arrive I started with a signature absinthe inspired cocktail - sazerac. Sweet with some bitterness and punch. All the cocktails here are VERY good. I also got to try the Manhattan which was delicious as well. I appreciated Emile dropping in to make sure I had a drink in hand. As for the food, everything was delicious but the stand outs were the mushroom ravioli and escargot. The ravioli was cheesy and mushroomy with a nice springiness and chew. The snails were buttery and could be enjoyed alone or with some bread. For our main dishes we had the duck which was crispy and seasoned nicely but could use some sauce on the side. When I see monk fish I have to order it. The fish was good but the sauce was dynamite. I even dipped my fries in it because I couldn't get enough. I also want to mention how crispy and tasty the fries were. The crispiness almost reminds me of Burger King fries.Although we didn't have any room left for dessert, we ordered the Crêpes Suzette and somehow made room. It was soft, sweet (without being overly sweet), with some cold refreshing ice cream on the side. On a side note, this used to be the old garage which I really like for live music but it was a little grimy. Boucherie is much prettier with an upscale French bistro style. It is very inviting. If you're looking for delicious drinks, food and even better service, I recommend this place checking out.",1,0,0,Masumi T.,"New York, NY",106,412,131
5.0,5/7/2018,"The short: a beautiful restaurant with top notch service, beautiful open air/outdoor seating, and fresh/delicious food and drinks. The longer: I came with my boyfriend tonight as a guest of Zorica and they totally spoiled us. We had perfect seats by the piano and opened windows (just far enough away from gross car exhaust and still able to enjoy the perfect day!). I started with the brut rosè bubbly-- which I highly recommend! They bring complimentary crusty bread with olives, stuffed peppers & eggplant. We started off with the mussels, eggplant arugula salad & a soft French cheese. All of these apps were perfect. The mussels were plump & the white wine broth was amazing. The cheese was accompanied with green apples, honey & candied nuts. For dinner we shared the porterhouse for 2 (it has some fancy French name that starts with an A ;-)). They brought us some creamed spinach and French fries. The French fries were absolute crunchy perfection. The steak was perfectly medium rare. It was a TON of food. We were so full, we didn't even have room for dessert... This is the perfect spot for a nicer dinner if you're looking to throw down the $$ for the experience-- and they have a crazy good happy hour deal at the bar!

4.0,5/6/2018,"If you're looking for the perfect location to impress on a first date, Boucherie is the place you want. The ambiance reminds me of a Parisian brasserie along the Seine, with the perfect amount of lighting for a dinner date. Candle lit, soft, and with a good soundtrack that's not too invasive but creates a lovely mood.From the appetizers to the desserts, you'll have plenty of choices, but there's a few items I'd recommend you to get - cause they're absolutely delicious. As an entree do not miss out on the French onion soup, it's such a staple and you'll love the cheesy top, the sweet and flavorful onion soup, and you'll end up dipping more bread into it as not to waste a single drop. The steak tartare is another one of my favorite: sometimes it can be a hit or a miss depending on who's seasoning it, but it will still be worth ordering. As per my last visit, my Tartare needed a bit more acidity and a tiny pinch of salt, but I'm literally nit picking here.For the entree: if you're on a splurge kind of night do not hesitate and get the tomahawk steak. It's a 40oz rib-eye, with roasted bone marrow and a delicious bordelaise. Accompany it with a side of fries and creamed spinach and you're golden! If you're more on of a first-date-not-sure-where-this-is-going-yet kinda night, maybe just go for the classic steak frites. Let's go to desserts - cause you can't go to a French restaurant and not have dessert. One of my absolute favorite is the creme brûlée: creamy, velvety, with a perfectly crunchy caramelized top. If you're into something a bit more indulgent do not miss out on the chocolate mousse or try the classic profiteroles (that come with a side of chocolate to drizzle on top). All in all, this is definitely a place I'd recommend to anyone, granted they're willing to spend a bit more than your usual restaurant. But the quality is excellent and everyone working there, from chef Jerome Dihui to everyone else, is absolutely amazing. Always polite, helpful, and very knowledgeable when it comes to the menu. So whether you're on a first date, or you're on you 100th one, Boucherie will most certainly not disappoint.",3,2,1,Sacha D.,"New York, NY",106,103,589

5.0,5/2/2018,"Wow. It's taken me awhile to think of how to describe this place and do it justice. My first visit to Boucherie was the union square location. That experience was phenomenal, but this one somehow goes even further in stunning me with impeccable food, ambiance, and service.Service: Sidy was our waiter, and he is a gem! He really goes above and beyond to ensure you're having an amazing meal. Ambiance: very French inspired and very cute. I like that this location is on the cozier side without feeling at all cramped. The decor features old French posters and trinkets. Food & drink: WOW. See below.- Wildflower cocktail: if you like fruity with a hint of absinthe, then this is for you. - Truffle mushroom ravioli. Just get it. This is a MUST-Eat.- Mussels: the sauce was delicious and I could eat it all day, but I wish the mussels were bigger. - Tomahawk ribeye for two: Out of this world! Beautifully presented and utterly delicious. Cooked to the perfect temp. This was my first time trying bone marrow and I really enjoyed it. - Pistachio ice cream with chocolate brownie: Yum. They pour some kind of heavenly chocolate sauce over the ice cream and brownie and it really completes the dish. - Creme brûlée: every restaurant these days seems to think they can do creme brûlée, but rarely have I tasted really good ones in the US. This one was very good, with a crunchy top and a light custard beneath, and I especially liked the fresh fruit on top.Overall, I couldn't recommend this place more!

2.0,5/2/2018,"OK, look, I'm French, from Paris, but I've lived in the US for a solid ten years. I'm not a particularly fussy eater nor snobby about French food. The atmosphere at Boucherie was nice, though the music didn't really match the decor. The food, on the other hand, was frankly mediocre. I had the duck confit as my main: A dry hunk of meat from an apparently malnourished animal. Duck confit is duck cooked in its own fat. The last thing it should be is dry. The potatoes that came with it were equally bad. Pommes de terre sarladaises should be scalloped and fried in duck fat, with a light crisp on the outside and soft in the middle. These were shaved so thin that, once fried, they literally turned into potato chips. How would you like a side of Lay's with your duck? The best part of the dish was the frisee lettuce, which says a lot, especially for a $35 dish. We also had a side of fries, which we didn't finish because, well, they weren't good either.For dessert, I had the creme brulee. The taste was good, but that's the easy part (anything with sugar and vanilla tastes good). The texture and the crust, on the other hand, were off. Creme brulee should be, well, creamy and smooth. The texture here was more crumbly, like that of a flan. If you get air bubbles in your creme brulee, something's gone wrong somewhere.  And the crust was too soft.In addition to the food being bad, both food and drinks are overpriced. $15 for a skimpy pour of bottom shelf French wine? Yeah, no, I don't think so.There are many, many French restaurants in the Village. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.",0,1,0,Alexandre M.,"New York, NY",0,6,0

With a well curated consistent menu of French classics, daily specials, butcher section of finely cooked meats, and a few rotating fresh seasonal dishes, there is something for everyone.Meat is definitely Boucherie's focus (hence the name), so any cut of beef you get will be high standard. However, they can do fish and vegetarian dishes equally well. Focus is on ingredients over salt or heavy seasoning, as well exemplified but the mushroom ravioli. Each mushrooms' different flavor comes through, enhanced by a truffle tinged sauce and al dente pasta cover. The bouillabaisse is one of their specialties and will please the seafood lovers! It's a tinge spicy and has a delicious base that covers huge chunks of lobster, jumbo shrimps, and lots more. The salade niçoise is fresh and a great compliment to heavier entrees or could make a great meal for one. Apparently their pistachio bombe glaçée is amazing because it was gone by the time we tried to order! However, the profiteroles are lovely and will please anyone as long as they don't hate chocolate.

I came here on a 7pm Wednesday and the crowd was not too crowded, not too empty. Our server, Sayed, was so attentive and amazing, I have nothing but kind words to say about him and made the evening go very smoothly. My date and I decided to go all out with apps, entree, dessert, and of course drinks! For drinks, we got Matterhorn, sezarac, Franco Mexican war, and coccinella. Drinks were not that strong, but definitely a good addition to the dinner. Everything was very flavorful and different. I highly recommend the Sezarac. I would honestly come back to the bar just for that. So. Good. For appetizers, we got salade nicoise and salade d'auvergne which were outstanding. I'm not kidding. I'm not even a huge salad person and these apps were so fresh and vibrant! Their vinaigrette is FIRE. Highly recommend. For entrees, my date and I don't eat red meat, but we still had quite a few options for fish and vegetarian dishes. We got Loup de mer (with branzine) and mushroom ravioli. Umm where to start?? I've never had branzine fish before but this dish changed my whole perspective. So fresh along with the veggies and fennel. Ravioli was bomb too. Portion size was perfect as well.We were stuffed at this point but the desserts were just too tempting! We got the creme brûlée and pistachio bombe glacee. Literally incredible.

Both because it is one of my favorites, and because it is not easy to come by in the city where I live, I tend to jump on it wherever it is on the menu.)

If you are looking for a delicious dinner, in a fun part of the city, in a beautiful setting with attentive service then this is the place for you. We spent almost two hours sitting at a table outside and enjoyed every minute of it.Here is a list all of the drinks and menu items we had:DrinksFranco Mexican War - this was one of my favorites because I love smoky cocktails. It was smoky, a little bit sour and refreshing. Overall a nice mix of flavors as long as you like Mezcal.Bastille Sour - this drink was good and refreshing. I am a fan of Pisco sour and after spending time in Peru but I think I like the Bastille Sour a little bit better.Birds of Paradise - this was very sour. I wanted to stay on the sour track but if you prefer something sweet, I would choose something else.The Manhattan - this was my boyfriend's favorite as he always orders a Manhattan at every restaurant. The Manhattan at Boucherie was much larger than most other restaurants (always a plus) and it was not overly sweet like Manhattans elsewhere (also a plus). AppetizerRigatoni Bolognese - YUM. The rigatoni portion is enough for two to share. When we asked for recommendations, this was not one of them but we wanted it anyway. It should definitely be on the Rec list, it's delicious. The meat sauce was great and it was not overly salty. I would come back for this.Pomme frites - I love French fries. These were good and very crunchy. Nice to accompany the steak.MainsPorterhouse for 2 - wow this steak was amazing. It is on par with a Smith and Wollensky, Peter Luger and Delmonico type of quality steak. The marbling was perfect and it was cooked to perfection. It comes displayed nicely and the peppercorn sauce to accompany it is delicious as well as the creamed spinach. We were so happy we chose the porterhouse. Our server, Dragomir had suggested it and man was he right. DessertCrepe - it comes in an orange sauce with vanilla ice cream. I am a huge chocolate fan so I wish it was chocolate or Nutella with strawberries. HOWEVER, it was still delicious and slightly refreshing with the orange taste. Profiteroles - I got my chocolate fix here. It comes as a pastry with ice cream in the middle and chocolate all around as well as in top. The pastry was soft and the ice cream was delicious.Last but not least, the service. Our server was Dragomir and he was great. He was attentive and made sure we were comfortable and had what we need but he was not overly, annoyingly attentive. He was perfect and made excellent recommendations on drinks, the main course and dessert. We only hope he adds the bolognese to the list of recs.

4.0,4/26/2018,"Boucherie is a French brasserie in West Village, whose menu centers heavily around meat, as well as traditional French dishes like escargot and foie gras. I had stopped by this chic restaurant last year for a Yelp event, and had such a fantastic time that I decided to give them a try on a regular night.My friend and I arrived a few minutes after our reservation time. The seating hostess greeted us warmly and sat us down immediately. Our waiter walked over shortly and welcomed us to the restaurant. He kindly explained the menu and recommended some of the popular menu items. My friend and I tried the escargot as the appetizer. Drenched in a garlic-parsley butter, these delicacies were absolutely delicious and perfect to get us started for the feast to come. After that, we shared the 36 oz dry-aged tomahawk rib-eye. The steak was cooked perfectly and the portion was very generous. I loved the roasted bone marrow that came with the steak. The waitstaff made sure that we had plenty of bread to soak up this fatty goodness at all times. I really appreciate the restaurants that pay attention to small details like this, and it really made my dining experience special.The dining area is intimate, making it an ideal place for a romantic date night. In addition, the restaurant is quite spacious (a rare find in New York City) and therefore can easily accommodate large parties. I would absolutely recommend hosting your next holiday dinner party at this elegant yet trendy restaurant. From the impeccable service to delicious food, I would absolutely recommend Boucherie if you want to combine your love for steak with classic French dishes and wine.

4.0,4/26/2018,"I love Boucherie and had an amazing experience via Yelp recently at their other location near Union Square. The manager kindly reached out to some of us to have another sit down experience at the West Village location. The meal started off slow with gaining attention from the waiters but after about ten minutes of waiting things started to pick up. Cocktails here are always delicious. They have a decent happy hour called their 'green hour' which probably explains the crowd on a Monday. But a spread of their cocktails and wine are marked down to $10 until 7pm. I went with the Wildflower (St George Vert Absinthe, Hendrinks Gin, Watermelon Juice, Lavender Syrup, Lemon & Egg White) and my friend went with their Old Fashioned. My drink was so refreshing, delicious, and beautiful. Perfect for a sunny day with the windows open in the spring chilly air. Appetizers - We split the mussels and escargots. The mussels were great and the broth was delicious. They brought out complimentary bread to sop it all up with and marinated eggplant and sundried tomato to spread on. The escargot was a little too overdone. Nice and buttery and it comes out bubbling hot. By the time it was done simmering it just had this slightly too charred taste instead of melting away with the butter. Entrees - We both ordered two different kinds of steak. My friend has been here before so she guided me through the process. She went with the Steak Frites Au Poivre that comes with a delicious peppercorn gravy and I went with the filet de Boeuf that comes with wilted spinach. The quality of the meat is top notch. Unfortunately both of our steaks were really way over-cooked. We both ordered medium-rare but on the rarer side. My friend noted she wanted hers reddish-pink, definitely go more rare than medium. Both steaks came out on the grey-ish side. They still tasted phenomenal but if they were executed at the right temperature it would have been 5 stars good. The french fries were really delicious and crisp and we both loved that peppercorn cream sauce. Desert was a bit of a mishap with communications. They did bring out the desert menu too early before our steaks arrived but that's nitpicking away too much. We ordered the pistachio bomb glacee to split. Absolutely delicious. The ball of pistachio gelato is covered with a thick fudge layer of rich chocolate on top of a thin fudge brownie layer. The server pours this out onto the ball of ice cream. However, we asked if he could wait two seconds so my friend could adjust her camera settings and photograph him pouring it over slowly. He started to pour after she asked him to wait just a moment and then she asked him to stop and he started laughing and smiling at her while continuing to pour. It was a slightly weird moment. But I again enjoyed the ice cream even though an awesome photo opportunity went missed. All around there were pluses and minuses to the dining experience. I would definitely come back because I've had their meat cooked before at the right temperature and it's tasted divine; also their happy hour is really tempting in a beautiful environment.",6,4,7,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",843,1384,11457

For dessert we had ice cream with liquid chocolate on top.The salad was great, with strong dressing but suitable for the size of the salad.The mussels were good, my friend said one of the best mussels she's had.The porterhouse was the main piece. It was cooked well, seasoned but not overwhelming and made the meal.Atmosphere: 4/5Tables were a bit cramped. Ambiance was decent. Good for dinner/drinks with people you already know (ie: wouldn't recommend as a first date restaurant)Service: 5/5The general manager Zorica Vukovic was very responsive by email, including at random hours as well. That shows she cares about the establishment.The assistant general manager (Emil) dropped by to talk with our table as well. I noticed that we went around talking with other tables as well.

5.0,4/24/2018,"Ambiance- Such a classic space. The restaurant is great for a large gathering of friends to an intimate evening with your significant other and everything in between as you can have a casual dining experience to a romantic one... all under one roof and it just seems to work perfectly in the spacious split level layout. *want a more intimate experience- request to be seated on the top when making a reservation.The wood furnishings, white tiles, colorful artwork, and soft natural light coming through the windows and skylight mixed with perfectly dimmed lighting creates a cozy atmosphere day or night. The white linen table cloth provide a nice touch (my mum is appalled when some nice restaurants forgo this simple touch that adds elegance to a dining experience so I always notice such detail).Now that the weather is warming up the al fresco seating will be perfect for people watching around the village while enjoying a nice glass of wine and a meal. It's like you're transported right to Paris.Service-Friendly, attentive, and accommodating. The smiling hostess immediately greeted us upon entering. Once seated, the server was attentive throughout. Offered suggestions on the menu and was ever present yet also allowed us to dine in peace. We never felt rushed and the dishes came out in perfect time throughout.Food / Drink-Free bread. Let me rephrase- free DELICIOUS bread. Perfect soft yet crusty with salted butter. Also, complimentary olives and mushrooms. YumThe MOUSSE DE FOIE GRAIS- locally sourced and delicious. The creamy texture and light taste were a nice way to start. The LOUP DE MER- branzino is one of my favorite fish however often served bone still in which prevents me from ordering it. Luckily the branzino here was filleted. Perfectly seared and flavorful.The FILET DE PORC ROTI- usually I'm not one to crave pork tenderloin however this Iberico cut immediately stood out to my friend and I. I think it was even my favorite of all the dishes even though they were all delicious. A large generous portion of meat, perfectly cooked Medium. The seasoning really complimented the meat. We shared a side of RATATOUILLE which went well with our entree choices.For dessert (don't judge, it was my friend's birthday and also my last night in the city for a while) we had the PISTACHIO BOMBE GLACEE. The presentation was beautiful. While I enjoyed the dessert I didn't get much pistachio flavor, possibly overpowered by the rich chocolate. We stuck with wine for our meal but there is a full bar.

4.0,4/23/2018,"Boucherie was a nice French restaurant in the West Village. It is large and can accommodate bigger groups. They have a nice selection of wines and cocktails- the bar is huge. The restaurant is on the expensive side, which to me is an important factor. I like to spend money on quality food, and I would say Boucherie provides great French food. However, there are comparable, dare I say better French restaurants in New York that will cost you much less. That is where my rating is lower than most because, you can get this quality food at Augustine in the Beekman hotel in lower manhattan or Dominique Bistro nearby in the West Village. Below are some comments on the food!We tried to order the fish at 7pm and they were already sold out, which was slightly frustrating, seeing as it was still early and this was what we were truly craving.Steak Frites- good portion size, cooked well. Delicious- approximately $45- slightly more expensive in comparison to others, not the best I have ever had.Demi glace steak- best thing at the table, it was cooked perfectly and Demi glace is honestly something that my father spends an entire day making drinking wine at home- I know the effort that goes into this and so this is a dish worth ordering. FLAVOR IS AMAZING.Burger- not worth the price, dry and you can find better burgers in New York.Ratatouille- served in a beautiful little dish and full of flavor.French Onion Soup- classic and savory- worth an order.Overall- good food, save your money and go elsewhere unless you are ordering the Demi glace steak!",0,0,0,Katherine K.,"Brooklyn, NY",152,94,161

We split some crepes suzette and shared 4 drinks: provence martini, birds of paradise, coccinella, and the matterhorn. Can I tell you how amazing the food/drinks were or how kind the server was after coming back 100x to take our order? While they could do no wrong with their food, their drinks SOLD ME.

5.0,4/20/2018,"I was impressed with Boucherie from the moment I stepped in and saw all the gorgeous natural light from the skylight/large windows and the beautiful warm wood in the exposed beam ceiling. The elegant greenhouse aesthetic paired with the equally impressive service and food definitely make a perfect recipe for celebrating special occasions and on our way out, we even made a reservation for my father-in-law's upcoming birthday!For our dinner, my husband and I ordered:+ Saute de ris de veau aux morilles ($26) aka veal sweet breads and mushrooms galore - I'm not the most adventurous eater so I was hesitant to try sweet bread (thymus gland) but my husband wanted to try it and I'm obsessed with mushrooms. Honestly, I only had a little nibble of the sweet bread, which was actually very tame (no funny texture or taste), but I still mostly ate the mushrooms. However, we both decided this was our favorite dish of the night and we both loved the flavor and uniqueness of the dish!+ Moules mariniere ($23) aka mussels - We generally order mussels whenever and wherever it's offered as an appetizer. These were not particularly notable but still delicious. The broth was more flavorful than average but the mussel-plumpness was only average.+ Lotte rotie aux coques ($37) aka monkfish - I'd heard in the past that monkfish was a ""poor man's lobster"" and although I'd had it before, I never quite understood the comparison until Boucherie. This was truly a delicious dish--the broth was so flavorful (I found it surprisingly familiar and reminded me of Chinese cuisine a little) and the monkfish was akin to a very tender lobster!+ Filet de boeuf ($52) aka filet mignon with truffle butter - I ordered it per the chef's recommendation--medium--and it was cooked perfectly. + Creme brulee - Actually, this might've been my favorite dish of the night. It was literally the most perfect creme brulee I've ever had. The caramelized top was strong enough that when we tapped it gently it didn't break, but when we actually dug in, it was so delicate tasting--how did they do that? The inside was also perfection and chock fill of tiny vanilla bean dots (is there a technical term for the dots?) and the berries were the perfect complement.There are so many things on the menu that I can't wait to try and I'm sure I'll have many dishes to update this review with after we dine here for my father-in-law's birthday!",4,2,2,Debra L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",469,189,683

I told the gentleman i was looking for some greens that weren't as heavy and he had the chef whip up some spinach which at the time wasn't on the menu. We order this steak platter.

The 40 oz steak with bone marrow--- Holy cow(pun attended) this is amazing. I've never had such an elaborate steak which included the bone marrow and a huge t-Rex like bone.  The meat was flavorful and juicy and was accompanied by an array of delicious sauces.

The big glamorous Xmas tree in the center of the restaurant was a plus. Food and service were wonderful. My second experience at Boucherie was the Yelp Elite event hosted at the Park location. It was also a wonderful experience.  We were able to try all kinds of dishes that night and unlimited wine. I received an email from the manager and was invited to a complementary dinner of two at the West Village location. If the place was not great to start with, I wouldn't want to waste time on it even its complementary. I brought my mom here for an early Wed dinner. This time I had the chance to see the restaurant with plenty of light.We were seated on the second floor where the space is more private and overseeing the restaurant. There's a cute sunroof on top of the restaurant. I love the ambience here. It's cozy and glamorous at the same time. We ordered escargot and scallops as appetizers. Both were prepared perfectly. The scallops were so tender. Escargots were fresh and seasoned nicely.  My mom and I both got rack of lambs in medium rare. They were definitely the right decisions. Not everyone likes lambs but they did it well. We finished the meals with creme brûlée. Perfect ending. Overall all the 3 experiences at Boucherie were amazing. Highly recommended.

In my experience, if you've tried one great french restaurant, you've tried them all. This honestly goes for Boucherie as well, however, that doesnt make it any less delicious. The charcuterie (not pictured as we inhaled it) was fresh and so tasty, and they kept the bread refills coming - important!! I was prepping for a half marathon the next day and told our server to not stop with the bread and he more than listened LOL.My steak sandwich was also yummy, cooked perfectly and the hollandaise sauce wasnt overwhelming. The creme brulee was the star of the show. Shareable for all 4 people in my party and left all of us too stuffed to enjoy Big Gay right across the street ;( but as a creme brulee lover, i'm glad I know I can come here and depend on my favorite dessert.We sat outside on a gorgeous day which made our experience even better.

5.0,4/16/2018,"My friend and I went to Boucherie with reservations for a Sunday at 6:30pm and were seated immediately with no wait. We started our feast off with a cocktail (forget the name but it was amazing and had egg whites and hints of orange). Our waiter was very attentive and had excellent recommendations (we pretty much just had him order). For starters we had the Caesar salad and the mussels. The salad was very fresh and was a great lighth start to the meal and the mussels brought me back to when I visited Bruges. I don't think I left one drop of that buttery sauce un-absorbed by bread, I would definitely recommend the mussels and maybe next time I'll ask for the sauce to go. For the entree we decided to go big or go home so we got the 36 oz Pat LaFrieda to share and I think I saw God in each bite--by far the best steak we've eaten. We ended the night with creme brûlée, one of my favorite desserts. I had high expectations because I just recently got back from Paris and had this at almost every dinner and wow Boucherie did not disappoint. It was creamy, rich, and had the perfect sugar crust. Overall, the service was top notch, we always felt like we were being taken care of and our waiters suggestions were spot on. The ambience is a nice balance of high end and comfortable.

Started with some appetizerssteak tartare - it's a unique take on the normal tartare. Not in the shape of a brick, but spread out rather very thinly. mussels - omg, there were so many mussles in this appetizer alone. The sauce was flavorful and absolutely delectable. This dish is amazing price to value ratio and I'd highly recommend it. Main course scallop - oh so soft, but sadly only comes with 3 pieces. Perfectly cooked so the outside and inside have even consistency. Perfectly flavored, the taste of scallop was very apparent and not masked by the sauce.  center-cut filet mignon for 2 - absolutely massive portion size and comes with a sizeable amount of bone marrow as well. It originally came out room temp and didn't taste quite as good as I thought it could have. We sent it back and it returned much hotter so much tastier. I didn't really enjoy the charred pieces on the end so skipped that but the middle pieces were a perfect medium rare, not too chewy and still bloody. Bone marrow was very rich and difficult to finish. Might have been good to mix the meat with the bone marrow. Dessertpistachio bombe glacee - unique presentation. Chocolate easily overpowers the pistachio so eat the pistachio ice cream alone if you want that flavor. I actually preferred eating each part separately.Service was fantastic. Extremely attentive, constantly refilled our waters, and cleared all the dirty plates.

They closed the doors and got us drinks from their extensive bar as we waited for the 5:30pm dinner bell. While we waited for our meals they served fresh made bread and salted butter (with orange?) which was excellent. I had the fillet while my wife enjoyed the salmon with sides of cream of spinach and mushrooms. Everything on our table was excellent. My fillet was a healthy sized cut of meat that was perfectly seasoned and cooked with a slice of truffled butter on top. My wife's salmon came with lentils that were a nice touch to bring out the medium cooked fish. The mushrooms and spinach worth the price of admission. Also of note, they have an Absinth drip that I will explore on a future visit. This is not an inexpensive restaurant but I felt that the experience and quality of food was worth the price.

Unfortunately, they just changed their menu, so some of what I wanted was no longer available. Fortunately, everything was still really good.My husband started with the onion soup, which had a great, rich flavor, though, of course, he burned his tongue on it.  I had the sweetbreads and mushrooms. First, I was a little disappointed, because it was two small pieces of sweetbread drowned in a plate of mushrooms, then I actually tasted the dish, and it was fantastic.  I love mushrooms.  I would have ordered this dish without the sweetbreads.  I used my bread to mop up every last drop of the sauce.For entrees, my husband had the faux-filet, which is a dry-aged bone-in New York strip.  It came out a perfect medium rare. I always choose flavor over tenderness, and this steak hit my sweet spot.  It was full of flavor with just a little bit of chew. I have to say, all the steak dishes I've had here are really great.  I ordered the monkfish, and it was also delicious and flavorful.We had the chocolate mousse for dessert.  I loved it!  It was a dark, rich, chocolatey mousse that was definitely big enough for us to share.All in all, a wonderful dinner!",1,1,1,Heather H.,"New York, NY",276,649,23

1.0,3/28/2018,"The service was incredibly terrible. Our waiter, don't recall his name bc he never introduced himself, gave us the stereotypical French experience - extremely rude / go eff yourself experience. Long story short, very unwelcoming, hurrying and forceful. He asked us to order our entire meal (appetizer , entree and dessert) at the same time and when I asked why, he just responded - ""I can bring the chef out here to talk you?"". Finally - on a tab of $155 for just two below average steaks (no drinks or apps) and I left a $25 tip due to average food and bad service he literally asked me, ""You look like an American! Why did you not read our suggestions and give me an 18% suggested tip?"" I gave him 17% even though I did not like the food and his service, and he never filled our water the second time... I told him about my experience and he just walked away without saying anything.Even the service and experience aside, the decor was very cool and chic.

5.0,3/26/2018,"UPDATE:I first visited Le Boucherie with 7 other friends for a birthday dinner. While I had great food (we had ordered the duck, salmon and NY strip au poivre which were all very good) we had a misunderstanding with the server and I wrote a review explaining my concerns with service that evening. Within a day, Management were in touch with me and wrote a heartfelt apology. I decided to give it a second chance and am so glad I did - what a fantastic evening! Our previous server personally came over to apologize and the staff and Management couldn't have been more accommodating and truly welcoming. Le Boucherie just set the standard for all restaurants in New York, for how to respond to tough feedback. This time around my girlfriend and I enjoyed starters of moulle mariniere (mussels in a white wine sauce with toasted baguette on the side) and a classic French onion soup which were both delicious. For entrée we shared the Aloyau de Boeuf Pour Deux (36 oz Pat LaFrieda dry-aged porterhouse) which is essentially a giant T bone with thick cuts of fillet on one side and rib-eye cuts on the other served with a béarnaise sauce on the side, cooked to perfection. The fillet was melt-in-your-mouth soft. We paired with a Bordeaux from their extensive wine list. For dessert we had a crème brûlée (very generous portion size!) and a pistachio ice cream on top of a ganache with chocolate sauce poured over (heaven on a plate). Both were delicious and the perfect end to a wonderful evening. Le Boucherie, thank you for showing us true hospitalité!

4.0,3/24/2018,"There are many positives about this restaurant, and I will be a return customer for sure. I went with two friends who really enjoyed the wine ;), so they barely paid attention to their food. I, on the other hand, tried their dishes so that I could give a fair review of everything we ordered. We started with the Soupe à l'Oignon and the Escargots; all of it was beautifully prepared and delicious. I was truly reminded of the little cafes I've been to in Paris, and that's saying a lot. For the main course we ordered the Saint Jacques a la Provençale (scallops), Poulet Grand Mere (chicken), and Salade de Fruits de Mer (seafood salad with a kick!). The scallops were seared perfectly; not chewy, felt like cutting through warm butter (as it should be). The chicken was delicious, but a tad dry with the yukons being overcooked as well -- this is why I gave the 4 stars and not 5; hopefully it was just a mistake that evening. The seafood salad with a kick was full of different flavor profiles, which I appreciated. The fennel and grapefruit are a nice touch to an otherwise typically bland salad.

5.0,3/21/2018,"I wanted to post an update to this review to be fair: Following my previous disappointing experience here, the manager reached out and was very apologetic. She listened to my concerns and extended an invitation to come back to try Boucherie again. I really appreciated it - that was already much better service than what I experienced the first time there.I came back recently with my sister after a long work week. This time, service definitely stood out as excellent. We were accommodated in the main dining room at a round marble top facing the bar. We got a nice view of the restaurant while not being stuck in amidst restaurant traffic. Foodwise, we started off with a pair of French onion soups and shared a fennel-citrus salad from their seasonal menu. Both items were on point. For some reason, a lot of restaurants seem to mess up French onion soup, but I can safely say that Boucherie is one of the restaurants that make it properly - with very flavorful broth, sliced artisan bread, topped with a nice cheesy crust. The fennel salad was lightly dressed, refreshing, and nicely portioned. For our main dishes, we got the filet mignon and steak-frites. The filet had a much better texture this time - it was perfectly cooked and I would definitely recommend it as a go-to option if you don't know what else to pick. I don't recall the cut for the steak-frites, but it was definitely well-sized and came with a peppercorn sauce on the side. (I'm actually glad that the sauce was included on the side, as the peppercorn flavor is pretty strong. I would also recommend to order this steak medium rare.) What I really liked about these dishes is that unlike other restaurants, nothing is overly salty, so I did not feel the need to drink tons of water. My sister and I ended the meal with a crème brûlée, which comes topped with fresh slices of strawberries. Although it was decently sized (and we were quite full), this crème brûlée was very light and not too sweet. It had a very nice texture, both in the custard and the sugar crust. I'm definitely glad we went with the crème brûlée. Overall, props to the restaurant for caring about customer concerns in a city where there is no shortage of other customers. The restaurant itself is beautiful and pretty easy to get to. I'm definitely keeping it on the docket for future dining experiences - brunch or dinner.",6,1,4,Nataly N.,"Brooklyn, NY",355,489,1340

4.0,3/20/2018,"I attended a Yelp event here last December and was invited back with a guest for a complimentary meal, which we took advantage of right after new year's. Both times we were treated very generously. I'm normally not a meat eater, but one of the chefs offered me scallops even after the event officially concluded in December, which totally made my night. When we returned in January for a proper sit-down dinner, we received excellent service, as expected. We were treated to a three-course meal with wine pairings. Although the food, presentation, and of course service were stellar, I didn't really love the wine recommendations. Understandably, I couldn't exactly hold the server to the standards of a sommelier. Besides that, my mom said her steak was a little burned and wasn't as good as what we'd had a few weeks prior.

It's large, specious, and beautifully decorated. My first visit to Boucherie was during the holidays, and they had an enormous, beautiful tree. It made the event really feel very festive.The drinks here are wonderful. I have been very into aperol lately, and they incorporate it into quite a few refreshing cocktails. I find their drinks to be perfectly balanced and not too sweet.Our waiter Sidy did a wonderful job at explaining the menu and helping us make decisions. Even Emil, the manager, came by to greet us. For dinner we started with the mussels and mushrooms in cream with brioche. Both delicious. The mushrooms were AMAZING. If you like mushrooms, cream, and bread... you'll love this. I've been dreaming of it since it left my mouth 7 days ago.For my entree, I chose the cod. It was recommended as a delicious staple and a healthy dish. I LOVED it. A perfectly cooked, beautiful piece of fish. They had diced vegetables on top that added a great texture. My friend had the veal ribeye special-- definitely a special piece of meat, really delicious (and huge!)The French fries need their own paragraph. The best French fries in the city? Yes.

1.0,3/18/2018,"Last night my friend and I were celebrating her birthday at the Boucherie located in the West Village. The decor was beautiful and the food was amazing, but the service was far from being amazing.   We felt rushed because everytime the appetizer, entree or dessert came out, immediately soon afterwards( several times) the server and the waiter would ask, "" Are you done?"" in a rude tone. When I was trying to whisper to the waiter without being obvious to my friend that it was her bday, the waiter just again rushed me and was rude about it.  I was not aware that there was any time limit to our dining experience. When the server came to us again with an attitude asking, "" Are you finished?"", we responded that we were still working on the dessert( the dessert was not even half done) and to our dismay, we were shocked to witness the server making a face about us to the waiter. How is this kind of treatment and behavior acceptable towards anyone?, especially on a day where it was supposed to be a celebration. This is not a good representation of Boucherie. I hope that no one else will experience a dining experience here like we did.  People need to be treated with respect no matter who they are, the minute they enter the restaurant. You can have the most amazing food, but if the service is not up to par, it definitely ruins the whole dining experience.

The onion compote in the red wine sauce really complimented the texture of the mousse. Scallops was insanely flavorful! For our main we had "" Cote de boeuf"" and it was amazing, so delicious! Perfectly cooked medium. The bone marrow on top was delight. The steak frites was delicious. The steak was tender and dense, as a result of the aging. The peppercorn sauce had good body but the flavor was a bit on the milder side  and the most amazing fries. Crispy on the outside, with little specks of crunchy fried goodness!

5.0,3/17/2018,"The last time I was here, I was here for the fabulous Yelp Elite event during Christmas (thank you for hosting Yelp & Boucherie!) and their Christmas tree was beautiful!Obviously, the Christmas tree is gone now but I have to say--though it's less festive looking, the restaurant still has a nice and warm glow that give you the feeling of warmth. Surely, that's due to the decor and ambiance, so huge kudos to you for that, Boucherie!So let's see.. this time I had the Birds of Paradise and Negroni cocktail (again, please get the Negroni, it's so goooood). The bartender who made my drinks is named Nenord (hope I didn't misspell his name whiach I feel like I did.. I'm sorry). But he makes super yummy cocktails and he gave me a really good and accurate description of Birds of Paradise. It's really earthy but yummy, so don't let the beets in it stop you!For dinner, I shared mussels with my friend and the mussels were delicious.. for one thing- I find it kind of hard to find a restaurant that really knows how to make both meat and seafood delicious. I find that usually well known steakhouses/steak focused restaurants don't usually make seafood great, not even decent; which I don't think it's a big deal because they're known of steak but wow kudos to you for making it happen, Boucherie! So there's that. Hands down I recommend the mussels.Instead of ordering steak, I went adventurous and pasta mood--so I went for their Ravioli aux Champignons which has truffles ahhh! If you follow me and my reviews, I think you know how I feel about truffles by now right? Like literally l o v e . The black truffle was used in a perfect amount where it wasn't overwhelming and you can still taste the mushrooms that are in it. Ugh. Hands down, one of the best raviolis I've had in my life.Finally for dessert--We had their Pistachio ice cream with chocolate poured over it.. They poured the chocolate onto the ice cream in front of you and it was such a fascinating experience. This just intensifies your craving for their dessert. Absolutely love that idea of how they do that.Overall, I must say--Boucherie does not disappoint. I was once again amazed by them. I had a great dining experience though it wasn't a Yelp event. They are absolutely a top restaurant in New York for me. I only wish that I live or work around the area so I can go all the time, that would make my life so much better. It's a great restaurant to go to after work for a drink, have a date, or even to dine with a friend like I did. I 100% highly recommend you to go there and try all their food. I would absolutely recommend you to try their steak if it's your first time. Especially their Tomahawk steak and bone marrow, like omg, it is a life changing experience and your mouth and stomach will appreciate you for doing that. Otherwise, I have nothing more to say until the next time I come here.Absolutely will be back here soon for drinks and food :)",3,1,3,Suki W.,"New York, NY",140,180,1395

Mrs.Zorica V. the manager, noticed my first review, then personally messaged me to apologize and invite me back for a complimentary dinner. I initially asked for a reservation on thursday, but something came up last minute so I had to cancel. Mrs.Zorica was more than happy to change my reservation to Friday night instead. When we arrived at the restaurant, we were greeted warmly and then seated right away.Our server was a friendly blonde lady with a nice, soft accent.

5.0,3/13/2018,"We're only a fourth of the way through the year, but I can honestly say that Boucherie is on the short list for the best meal I've had in 2018.Hell, it might be one of the best meals I've ever had in NYC!Boucherie was kind enough to invite us to their restaurant for a Yelp Holiday party in 2017 (yelp.com/biz/yelp-elite-…), so I knew the quality of food and service were going to be top notch, but they went above and beyond. Zorica (the manager) extended an invitation for us to return, and the timing was perfect (for full transparency, they covered everything except for our wine and gratuity).I had a friend in town who was hankering for a steak, and I was lucky enough to snag a weeknight table for dinner. Boucherie is really three different levels - there's the floor with a bar, a ton of half-booths, and a really long table for larger parties. Then there's the private second floor with the wine room. And in between is a split-level elevated area that makes you feel like royalty. Or at least, like you're one of those VIPs at a concert. Great for people watching.Before our waiter Andres came by to take our orders, we were pretty set on our starters. But then he confirmed that what we wanted were house favorites, so of course we had to get them. They were the escargots de Bourgogne and the foie gras stuffed quail. Yeah, let that sink in. Foie gras. Stuffed. Quail.We started out with the escargot, which were large and meaty, in a wonderful buttery parsley sauce served in a traditional escargot dish. Each one of the snail slots had 2-3 pieces in them, so it was actually quite a lot to share (but we finished them all... then dipped our bread in the butter sauce).Definitely started the meal out on a high, and then the stuffed quail arrived and blew all of our expectations out of the water. I'm not exaggerating when I say this is one of the BEST dishes I've ever had. It was a whole quail that our waiter cut in half in front of us. Inside was an insane amount of foie gras. And the bird was resting atop a bed of spinach in a balsamic glaze that was also evenly distributed on our plates. Everything about the quail was perfect. The skin was thin and crispy. The tiny little drumstick had just a little more exposure to heat on it, giving it a nice char. And of course, the Hudson Valley foie gras was great. Rich, but not overwhelming. A 5 star dish, for sure. And a steal at only $26!!For our main, we decided to go big with the Chateaubriand pour deux. I just have to say for the record that Boucherie is very liberal with their definition of ""for two"" because what we got could've fed a family of five.It was a center-cut filet mignon with a bone marrow bordelaise sauce and vegetables. The whole thing was served in an actual skillet with the marrow bone underneath the perfectly medium rare steak. The steak was amazing - touched with just the right amount of fire (one of the things I love most about Boucherie is they actually have a flame grill). Not going to lie - I forgot about most of the veggies, but I remember asparagus and perhaps some squash. Vegetables were the last thing on my mind as the two of us were determined to finish the meat.For dessert, we split the pistachio bombe glacee. It wasn't quite ice cream, but all the constituent parts worked together to give off the illusion that it was. The base was more or less a really cold brownie (which was somehow still chewy!), then a big ball of pistachio mousse. When it was brought to our table, a waiter poured chocolate all over the confection in order to give it its signature cannonball look. And holy crap, enough words cannot be said about how amazing it was (I sound like a broken record, I know). Every bite was perfect and it was decadent as heck. But the airy mousse made it not dense. Paired very well with a Gran Marnier as a digestif.I almost forgot to mention the drinks! They have a great bar program. I'd previously had their wonderful tequila old fashioned before, so opted for something a little different this time - the Matterhorn, an absinthe cocktail with passionfruit and apricot. Crisp and balanced. I love absinthe cocktails, but only when they're done right. And Boucherie does 'em right.We also ordered a bottle of wine, and the sommelier came over to review our choice with us, which was very much appreciated.If I could give a million stars to Andres and the rest of the staff for their hospitality, I would. The recommendations we received were spot-on. We had our cutlery replaced after ever course. Our water glasses were never more than half empty (or, depending on your outlook, half full). And at the end of our meal, Zorica personally made sure to find me and to thank us for coming in.

Our waiter recommended wines, appetizers, and steaks for us. We opted for three apps and a main since I do not eat as much as my boyfriend. We had the mussels, fois gras, scallops, and filet mignon. The mussels were very small but delicious. The fois gras was also great. The scallops were a little too salty for me but it only came with three so it wasn't overpowering. Lastly, the filet was great but I've had better. (My boyfriend loved it) I asked for it medium rare but I should've asked for it rare because most of the steak was medium and only the middle was medium rare. Not too bad. But again, the service was excellent and I had to give Boucherie 5 stars instead of 4. I would definitely come again!",0,0,0,Courtney T.,"Queens, NY",278,10,5

5.0,3/12/2018,"Amazing place. I went to Boucherie around Christmas time so it was extremely festive and decorative (gigantic Christmas tree too). In total, I had ordered a bottle of wine, pate, cote de boeuf and the creme brûlée. The wine itself was extremely smooth and the wine glass was as big as my face. The pate was smooth and spread well on the toasted bread. The star of the meal was the cote de boeuf with bone marrow. It was phenomenal. The beef literally melted in my mouth and the bone marrow made it even more luscious. It could be a bit decadent for some people - just pair it with some wine. The dish wasn't plated as well than some of the pictures I saw on Yelp. Finally, it was time for the creme brûlée and I was already stuffed! It was smooth, rich and creamy so I couldn't stop eating it. I would definitely come back to try all the other items on the menu.

4.0,3/9/2018,"Came here for a dinner on a Saturday night. Got a reservation for a prime time and came with a friend. In walking in, I loved the vibe. In some ways, it has a great ""French Bistro"" feel but at the same time it feels like a classic ""New York"" spot. Definitely good for a date or nice night out with friends. The menu is French, through-and-through. My friend got Steak Frites and it (seriously) changed his mood. He came to the restaurant in kind of a sour mood (tough week). But by the time he was done with his dinner, he couldn't stop saying how good his entree was. His custom Old Fashioned cocktail (recommended by our server) may have also contributed to that.  I went with classic Duck Confit (paired with a glass of red wine which they let me sample before I got a full glass). My dinner was delicious; the duck was crispy and the greens + potatoes were a great complement. To end the night, I ordered a mug of chocolate mousse and it was lovely. The reason I don't give this a full 5 stars is that there were some miscommunications between the servers. We ordered our drinks from our server and then, a few minutes later, somebody came by asking to take our drinks (which made us worried our original drink orders didn't get in). Furthermore, another one of the servers kept trying to grab my friend's cocktail glass even though he wasn't totally finished drinking it. But overall, I really enjoyed might night and plan on coming back again (perhaps for brunch).",0,0,0,Jeffrey H.,"New York, NY",37,33,0

I came in for dinner with a good friend and we had a spectacular meal. The head of staff Zorica is incredibly friendly. Our waiter Sidy was excellent. Extremely professional and made some nice recommendations. The escargot was buttery and garlic laden. Almost a full dozen snails to an order which is a huge portion. Loved this! It came out bubbling and was oozing with flavor. Our steak and lamb was purely exceptional. The meat cut like you put a knife through heavy cream...super smooth and nearly no effort.

5.0,3/8/2018,"My fiancé and I had dinner at Boucherie on Sunday evening and had easily one of the best dining experiences of our life. The restaurant is French cuisine that boasts cooking with the joie de vivre, which means an exuberant enjoyment of life. The entire restaurant is very open and modern looking with a very warm romantic feel--- almost feels like you're taken to a remote lush location in France. From the very beginning of our time there, we were met with incredible service from the staff who met us with a smile and made us feel like we were the only ones in the restaurant (although the place was full by the time we left!) We started our dinner with an order of mussels and scallops. The scallops were my favorite! Savory and cooked to perfection. My fiancé immediately devoured the mussels (huge mussels fan) and was beyond happy with the large plate. They do not skimp out on quantity or quality here. For our entrees, we both ordered steaks. I ordered the filet de boeuf and my fiancé ordered the faux filet de barcy. We were both in awe when our food came out so beautifully prepared and cooked to the perfect temperatures. I would highly recommend the filet de boeuf as the truffle butter that comes with the steak is the perfect accompaniment. The flavor leaked into the tender meat and provided one of the most unforgettable culinary experiences in my life. We ended dinner sharing the profiteroles for dessert. It was light and a unique blend of vanilla and chocolate that made our bellies a bit heavier and satisfied on our way out. I urge anyone in the area to check Boucherie out if you want an amazing dining experience that capsulates Joie de vivre. You won't regret it!",2,0,1,Bree C.,"Manhattan, NY",405,96,102
4.0,3/7/2018,"Such a fun atmosphere and the service was great.Food wise, it was good but I had higher hopes. All the dishes were tasty but they all felt like they could just use a tad of a tweak.We had the tartar. It was good but I wish it had a little less mustard. It was overpowering even though it was good mustard...def not frenchs yellow mustard. The French onion soup was good. The asparagus with cheese and proscuitte was the best and tastiest. However because of how it came, it was a little awkward to eat. I almost wish it had a vehicle so that I could put everything together in one bite...or perhaps cut differently. When I did manage to get it together, the dish was very tasty and well balanced. The pineapples were a nice surprise that really balanced out the flavours of the dish.The tomahawk was great. The cook was perfect on my order. I just wish there was a tad more of that sauce they serve it with and I wish it could have been served with a side of something to cut the meat. For the price, I think I'd rather go to Peter lugers when the L train is fixed.The fries were the biggest disappointment. French restaurants usually have great fresh fries. But I'm pretty sure boucherie's fries were pre-frozen. The outside was crispy thanks to a coating of potato starch, but the inside was mush. This usually happens to fries that are frozen because during the cooking process the ice crystals melt and boil the inside of the fries, almost turning it into a baked potato feel. the outside gets crispy from the hot oil, forming a skin. It didn't have the bite and crunch that non frozen fries have. They reminded me of burger king fries. Not great. It's weird since fresh fries aren't expensive to do...not that much more expensive than frozen but much better in texture and taste. It's weird that this was where the skimping happened.Overall, I'd come back if I was in the area and was in the mood for a fancier dinner...but I wouldn't make a special trip.",0,0,0,Tina X.,"Manhattan, NY",30,164,12

As good as it was (the waiter actually preferred this over the foie gras), there was nothing too spectacular about it. I also ordered the duck confit, which was quite good - crispy skin and moist meat. All in all, the food was delicious, but compared to other french restaurants i've been to, it's nothing I would write home about.

I didn't mean that in a bad way even though people will take it so. Nice, romantic vibes overall.FOOD:Ravioli was superb and rich. Strip steak was SMOKEY! Wow. It tasted like a peated whiskey in a steak. Pair it with their old-fashioned if you want a sweet peated cocktail alongside. The lamb was my favorite. The mustard provided a nice spicy tartness and the meat was oohhhh so tender. Crepes suzette with a port was a perfect end to the meal.

5.0,2/27/2018,"[OVERALL]Walking into the restaurant, you notice the well-planned décor and ambient dim lighting. The atmosphere gives off an upscale vibe, and the chatter of patrons fills the restaurant with liveliness. Our waiter was incredibly polite and was prompt throughout service (which lasted about 2 hours for a 3-course dinner) filling water and checking up on us. If you dine here, don't do so in a rush. The atmosphere is great for conversation with your partner, and you can enjoy the good food at a relaxed pace that is very French.[FOOD]Raviolis aux Champignons - Let's start with the sauce: amazingly creamy with a tasteful touch of truffle. The ravioli itself wasn't too heavy, and the mushrooms were both fragrant and flavorful. I would have loved another dimension of flavor (either from something sweet or herby). A very nice appetizer to share among 2-3 people.Faux-Filet Bercy - We ordered medium-rare, and the strip came out beautifully. The crust added a nice smokiness to the tender meat. The portion size is quite big; I suggest sharing a few pieces with your dining companion!Côtelettes d'Agneau Romarin - This is what I was immediately drawn to when reading the menu. The lamb came out cooked perfectly with that amazing lamb taste. The balsamic glaze paired with the mustard added an interesting dimension of flavor that really elevated the dish (if they added mustard seeds to the crust, this would be a dish that would be 12/10). The vegetables were cooked AMAZINGLY - full of flavor and complementing each other and the meat perfectly. The potatoes in particular were flavorful, with slight sweetness. Pommes Frites - Everyone craves fries. If you are, indulge yourself by ordering pommes frites on the side. They were crisp and seasoned very well. Crêpes Suzette - Basically the crêpe version of a Dreamsicle. Was so pleasant to eat and a great way to lightly end the meal. Not too sweet, but definitely delicious. [DISCLAIMER]I was invited by Zorica the manager to a complimentary meal; however, all statements made in this review are truthful and from my own personal experience. Zorica was incredibly hospitable and personally came over to greet me. I would definitely recommend coming to Boucherie for an upscale French meal!",0,0,0,Kenneth Y.,"New York, NY",444,97,172

There's a ground floor, balcony floor, and second floor. The very high ceilings make for a large and grand atmosphere but it still feels very cozy with the open kitchen and large bar and plant decor.The service was meh. I was a bit disappointed. I know my waiter said he was new but we didn't get our order taken until maybe about 15-20 minutes of waiting. Because of how our table was set up, waiters kept bumping into our table, shifting our tablecloth, and almost knocking over things on our table to get to another table. All in all a weird experience that made me wish that table overlooking the balcony just didn't exist. That being said, the service was very attentive once we started eating and always checked up on us.The food though is definitely 5 stars. I had the escargot for an appetizer and the duck confit for my entree. The escargot was great - you get a huge portion and it is flavorful. The duck confit with the endive was amaaaazing.

The medium rare were all just pink inside and the medium was basically thoroughly cooked. The portions were very worthwhile for the price but the overcooking really dropped the stars.

Take the fries served with the burger for example. I'd bet they're Sysco brand with the gluten added for that crispy crunch. They ain't hand cut that's for sure, let alone French.

I've now been at different times of the week and at different times in the evening. The first time I went was an early Tuesday evening when there weren't as many people, so I thought the service was exceptional because of that. This time, I went at a much busier time, and we had no fewer than five different people check on us to make sure we enjoyed our food and our dining experience. The tomahawk for two does not fail to amaze. It is a bit pricey, but you can tell the quality of the meat is great and the precision it takes to cook it perfectly is also evident each time. The creamed spinach is a must with any large portion of delicious meat, and theirs does not fail to meet expectations. Not too greasy or heavy and pairs so well with the meat. As for appetizers, I've only had the foie gras here, but it has a wonderful flavor and is a real treat each time I have it. As for the desserts, I've had the creme brûlée, which is perfectly crispy on top and so wonderfully decadent without being too heavy.

Great lighting and decor, and very open and spacious.The wait staff was also very attentive and helpful the entire time.  They provided water refills regularly and were readily available to answer questions about food, and made some nice recommendations.While we were thinking about what we'd order, they brought a bread basket, butter, and a small antipasto plate, which was unexpected.  And we were a bit speedy eating the bread, and they brought us another basket; also unexpected and nice.We started our meal with the Toast Aux Champignons, which is mushrooms in a creamy sauce with a couple pieces of toast.  The sauce was amazing. My fiance and I kept commenting on how good it was!For entrees, I had the Cabbilaud Roti, a seared cod dish.  The presentation was gorgeous, and the carrot puree was quite good.  The fish was cooked perfectly and was a nice piece of fish, but it didn't really blow my mind in the way the appetizer did.  It was pretty much what I expect from fish at a nice restaurant, which is good.My fiance's entree, on the other hand, was one of the best pasta dishes I've had.  She ordered the Pates aux Fruits de Mer, a squid ink pasta with seafood and tomatoes.  It had a little spicy flavor, just the right amount.

When we arrived, we were pleasantly welcomed by the Manager, Zorica. She once again apologized for our previous experience and made absolutely certain that we had a pleasant experience. We ordered the Caille Farcie (stuffed quail with foie gras) as our appetizer. The presentation was very exquisite; it had a nice wow factor when the server initially cut it open. The taste of the foie gras unfortunately wasn't too strong but it was smooth and paired exceptionally well with the quail. For entrees, I got the rack of lamb and my boyfriend got the 16oz dry-aged New York strip. They both came out medium rare and in good portions. The rack of lamb was tender, not gamy, and paired well with the dijon mustard. The steak was tender inside  and crispy outside. For dessert, we ordered the pistachio bombe glaciee and the profiteroles. Our server brought out a cup of chocolate and poured into the pistachio bombe glaciee in front of us; what a lovely presentation! :) However, the pistachio wasn't strong enough for my taste. During both of our visits, the servers were immensely polite, attentive and professional. We enjoyed our second visit significantly more than the first one. We are already planning a return visit to Boucherie; this time with friends. ____________________________I was disappointed by the way that they treat their customers. I made a reservation for 4 people for my boyfriend's birthday, and unfortunately 2 of my friends were late due to an accident. I ordered 2 cocktails and 2 appetizers while we waited. After an hour, the waiter came by and asked politely if our friends were still coming. He said that they will have to move us to another table if they were not coming; I then told him that our friends were on their way. Then another 15 mins passed by, the maitre d' stopped by and said the same thing. However, her attitude was pushy and her tone was demeaning; she told us that we could only have the table for another 45 mins. How were we supposed to order our entrees, dessert and finish it within 45mins? When I initially made the reservation, it did not mention the time limit, and it was not mentioned when we arrived at the restaurant and told them that we were waiting for our friends. Plus, when we looked around, there were tons of empty tables around us. It just made us felt rushed and not welcomed. Despite the fact that our friends were only a block away, we decided to get the check and leave after the maitre d' spoke to us. I expect a reception like this from a hole-in-the-wall, not from a $$$ French restaurant on my boyfriend's birthday (that they were aware of). The cocktails were far toosweet for our taste; especially their Old Fashioned. The food and service from our waiter was great, but the way that they allocate their tables and maitre'd's hospitality is horrific! Two appetizers and two cocktails ended up $80 + a bad birthday for my boyfriend.",0,1,1,Marygrace C.,"New York, NY",189,47,168
4.0,2/18/2018,"Came here for Valentines Day and overall had a really nice time. Service while sometimes a little slow (understandable though because the restaurant was packed) and very friendly. Food was excellent, except for the creme brulee which tasted delicious but was very runny. It clearly had not had enough time to set. The reason I'm taking a star off happened when we first arrived with a reservation mind you I had made weeks in advance. The hostess takes us upstairs and seats us at the worst table in the room. So small and cramped I couldn't even turn to look at my date. It was also right next to the staircase and water filling station which meant that we would have been constantly interrupted during the night if I had not complained and asked to move to a better table, which the hostess had no problem doing btw because the entire upstairs was EMPTY when we arrived. Seating guests at terrible tables when your restaurant ins't even full, especially those that have had reservations is by far my number one pet peeve from dinning experiences over the years and put a slight damper on the evenings mood at the beginning. Boucherie will give you a great meal, but I wouldn't go to them for a celebratory dinner because they might not deliver on the experience.",0,0,0,Sam M.,"New York, NY",103,202,0
1.0,2/18/2018,"Don't believe all of the out of towners' reviews - this place is not worth it, plain and simple. Came here for Valentine's Day and had one of the worst meals I've ever had in the city. It began with the hostess practically racing up to the table, not waiting for us to go up the two small sets of stairs. Here is a tip: If you get seated upstairs, ask to be seated downstairs. Upstairs, you feel every footstep of every person that walks on the rickety ""floor""... shaking everything on the table. The bread was inedible... we were served two end pieces and a middle slice... all dry and several days past ""baguette"" status. I ordered the Wednesday special and my girlfriend ordered the hanger steak. The special, Coq au Vin ($36), was a drum stick and two small bone-in chicken breasts in a red wine sauce. Very little meat and for $36 The hanger steak was just... bad. It was charred on the outside, bitter when you ate it, and inside was cooked just alright. We sent it back. It came back less charred, but extremely undercooked on the inside. No one checked on us. Meanwhile, we heard our waiter explaining to the table two tables over, who also sent back their steak (!) that this was due to them not using gas but a wood or direct heat to cook the steak. We didn't eat the steak, told the bus boy not to take it back when he took the chicken. He took the plate anyway. Waiter came, we said clearly we don't wait dessert, and didn't want to pay for the steak. He insisted on dessert on the house, over  our denials, until we gave in due to his pressure. The dessert, the creme brulee, was excellent. The check came and the steak was on the bill. Come on. This meal took ALL of the fun out of Valentines Day. The service was what put the icing on the cake; long delays for everything and no one checked in on our meals (we had to flag down the waiter to complain initially and no one checked on us after our new steak came). You can certainly do better in this part of town.",2,0,0,Brice P.,"Manhattan, NY",89,145,176
4.0,2/17/2018,"When you walk into Boucherie, you are instantly transported to a large bistro straight out of Paris, and welcomed in by the warm smells of melted butter and cheese. The space is bright and warm and lively. So lively in fact, a few tables down from us was Blake Lively... but I digress. While this place specializes in French style steaks, we opted for a few other dishes, both traditional French fare, and otherwise. We started with the escargots and the mushroom ravioli. If you've never had escargot, or are an escargot fan, this is the place to get them. A sizzling plate arrives with half a dozen plump snails, swimming in rich, melty butter. These are so creamy and tender I'd almost think these snails were fed nothing but butter and cream before showing up on the plate. The mushroom ravioli, six plump half moon pillows of deliciousness show up in a light, buttery, creamy, mushroomy, truffley sauce. It's a must for lovers of mushrooms. I'm a sucker for skate and if I see it in a menu, I'm ordering it. The skate wing here is totally decedent. You get a very large skate wing, perfectly sautéed and bathed in brown butter. The skate flakes apart and takes more like tender crab soaked in butter than fish. It's excellent. For no particular reason, a burger sounded really, really good here. Good call on our part. The burger here is truly a gourmet burger, and you can taste the quality of the Pat LaFrirda beef, and it pairs perfectly with the caramelized onions and melty gruyere. To finish up the meal, we had some profiteroles and tarte tatin. Both desserts were perfectly executed. Great meal here at Boucherie. For all you Francophiles out there, or lovers of butter, this place is for you. You'll not be disappointed.",2,0,2,Dave F.,"Hoboken, NJ",429,633,1392

2.0,2/15/2018,"2018 Feb. NYC Restaurant Week DinnerI cam here w/ my wife during 2018 Feb. NYC Restaurant week dinner. I have a mixed feeling about this place. Decor and ambient were not as good as it is seen on some of the pictures in Yelp. Also, overall waiting staffs were not well trained. However, food was great. Decor and ambientMy wife and I were lead to front of restaurant where there were many tables clustered together like you see in cafeteria. There was no privacy as the area was wide open and waiting staffs were standing very close to our table on the window side of restaurant. There were cozy and a little more private spots in the back and 2nd floor but we were seated in wide open area. The bar and open kitchen area looked good especially the oversize copper color hood in the kitchen. But seating area in front of restaurant was not great.ServiceApparently, there was a new waiting staff and they were training the new person so taking order was a bit challenge. We ordered sparkling water so the waiting staff poured the sparkling water and then they took the bottle to somewhere (why?) so other waiting staff couldn't see that we were drinking sparkling water. Because of this, other waiting staff kept coming by and tried to fill our water glass w/ regular water so we had to keep saying no to the waiting staff and explained that we were drinking sparkling water. This became so annoying and one of them actually succeed to pour still water to my half drunk sparkling water. It's no big deal but why taking bottle away and made this annoying situation. FoodFood was the highlight of this restaurant. I had roasted chicken & veggies w au jou. It had all part of chicken meat, wing, breast, thigh and leg.Chicken was tender and had right amount of salt and roast veggies were well roasted and au jus was wonderful! My wife has steak and fries which were wonderful as well. Appetizer and dessert were also great!OverallI don't know if I want to go back here because of the wide open cafeteria-ish seating area and untrained waiting staff. But food was great.

My favorite item thus far has been the steak tartare, which comes with a quail egg to mix if you so desire. They have one of the better old fashioned's I've ever had.

The manager reached out to me afterwards and invited me back for a complimentary dinner for two.To start, we ordered the mousse de foie gras and the stuffed quail. By far, the stuffed quail was the best thing we ate that night. The meat was juicy and tender on the inside, but the outside was crispy from the roasting. It came with a balsamic glaze which complimented the sweet and salty meat. The foie gras was also delicious. I just wish it came with more bread!For entrees, I ordered the Côte de Veau aux Champignons and my boyfriend ordered the New York Strip Steak. My veal was so tender and the right amount of chewiness. I am not usually a fan of sweetbreads, but the ones that came with my veal were great! Definitely order this dish if you like sweetbreads. I also really enjoyed the mushrooms that came with my veal. The flavors were just right with the sauce. My boyfriend's steak came cooked perfectly and it was good, but I preferred mine. We paired our steaks with the Hypothesis Cabernet, which is absolutely delicious.We ended the meal with the pistachio bombe glacée. This was spectacular! My boyfriend, that isn't a fan of desserts or chocolate in general loved this. The ganache was rich and it was a delight watching our waiter pour it over the ice cream. Even if I am not in the mood for dinner, I would come back just for this dessert.Emil was our server. He was very knowledgable about the menu and had a lot of suggestions for us.

5.0,2/11/2018,"Like many others, I first experienced Boucherie through a Yelp Elite event - the food was amazing. On my second go round, nothing had changed. For starters, we had the mussels, which were very flavorful and a seafood salad, which was refreshing and full of large shrimp and crab meat. For my main entree, I chose the NY strip -- it was cooked to perfection and boasting with fresh-off-the-grill flavor! It came with a small salad (which may have just been garnish lol) but I got a caesar salad as my side dish. Not the best, but it worked. My friend opted for the popular steak frites (almost every table there ordered this). The steak (although a different cut) had the same grill flavor and the fries were amazing - I think I ate most of them. For dessert, we got the creme brulee. I think it's kind of hard to go wrong with that, but it was the perfect finishing touch to our dinner.It gets very busy here, but all of the staff is very helpful and extremely polite.

The bus boy was very quick to clear glasses that had not been finished. Annoying, but fine by itself. The sommelier was really pushing an expensive Pomerol to follow up the Grand Cru Classe we had finished. Again, I get it. But the look I got when I ordered a lighter and less expensive wine was like I had personally insulted the waiters wife, and he sent the sommelier over to condescendingly confirm my decision, and of course suggest a more expensive version bc they were out of what I had ordered.

Unparalleled attentive service from everyone my coworker and I encountered during our visit - highly recommend for: 1) catching up with friends at a fancier place, 2) date night, 3) impressing your parents when they come visit. Drinks can be STRONG here (try absinthe if you're feeling adventurous).  I went with the Pocket Square (peach gin), which was well-balanced and slightly fruity. My coworker had the Provence (absinthe and lavender vodka), and seemed to enjoy it as well. If you're not in a cocktail mood, there are plenty of wines to choose from. Steak Tartare: Delectable and a generous portion for a starter (can easily share but you probably won't want to). Quail egg is a solid touch, and the seasonings complement perfectly. Filet de Boeuf: The most perfectly prepared piece of meat I've had in years (medium-rare).  Extremely tender, and loved the truffle butter. Side spinach/onions were perfectly prepared as well (I didn't think I'd ever be blown away by sauteed spinach but I stand corrected). Steak Frites au Poivre: (coworker ordered this but I sampled): excellently prepared steak with peppercorn sauce, crispy and delicious fries.

5.0,2/8/2018,"I absolutely love this restaurant. If someone were to ask me which restaurant is my all time favorite, Boucherie would be the one. The decor, the food, the service, and just about everything else was topnotch! I was lucky enough to come here 3 times in the span of 3 months. Zorica, the manager, and everyone else who works there were so welcoming and friendly. Unfortunately, I can't recall the names of the previous 2 servers but during my last visit on Monday, we had the lovely Martha as our server. She wasn't the hovering type and gave my +1 and I the right amount of space. Whenever our orders came out, she would explain everything and then let us happily enjoy our meal, occasionally checking up on us to see if we needed refills on water/wine. She was very knowledgable on the menu--her wine recommendations were impeccable! Sadly, I didn't catch the names of them. I've tried most of their appetizers and I have to say, their ""escargots de bourgogne"" was the most mouth watering and is something I REALLY recommend. When you dip bread in the oil, make sure to get the bits of garlic and lemon--it's like buttery goodness!  On my most recent visit, we ordered the ""filet de boeuf"" which was the filet mignon with truffle butter. The meat was SO tender and juicy. The truffle butter brought out such delicious aroma and flavor! I got the ""steak frites au poivre"" which was the NY strip and double fried french fries. OH. MY. GOD. You know a steak is good when you don't even want to dip it in the sauce it comes with. The cherry on top was the teeny charred parts...heaven.Their desserts explode in your mouth..definitely hits the spot for someone with a sugar-tooth.

5.0,2/7/2018,"Boucherie is the West Village's Mario Batali or Paul Bocuse (RIP :(): it seems all the more extravagant and hedonistic because of sheer size, an overwhelming presence in a neighborhood where restaurants are otherwise charming because they are minuscule. It's very Parisian, not just in decor and the easygoing elegance of the staff. There is something quintessentially French about Boucherie's lived-in ostentatiousness, like it is not just an expectation that you eat your weight in foie and crème brûlée, but that you enjoy it like you've never enjoyed anything as much as dining at Boucherie.Speaking of crème brûlée, let's start there and work our way back to the starters. In a phrase, it is the crème-de-la-crème of all crème brûlée: impossibly smooth, rich without being cloying, with just a hint of sweetness that you know is thanks to an overpriced vanilla pod (from a far-flung corner of the world!) they threw in there. The raspberries and strawberries that kiss the crunchy crust are more for decoration than added flavor, as the custard really speaks for itself. We also ordered the protiferoles, which did not ""wow"" nearly as much as the crème brûlée. It may have been because the CB was just that good, or because the protiferoles were almost too lavish; the choux sandwiching the ice cream was slightly dry.For entrées, we tried the rack of lamb and filet mignon. Nothing particularly noteworthy for these, other than they were done just right. The steak was smokey and sinful the way perfectly-charred meats get more delicious with each bite. The lamb was juicy and very gamey; like most everything on the steak menu at Boucherie, it is not for the faint of heart. Starters were, again, stellar: a deliciously-airy mousse de foie gras (there are very few places even in France, I think, that one could find a foie so lightweight yet so funky); buttery escargots (not too salty, merci!); expertly-seasoned steak tartare. Strangely, thinking back on those delectably-simple yet oh-so-enticing plates, I'm reminded of a poem of Neruda's: """"I shivered in those / solitudes / when I heard / the voice / of / the salt / in the desert."" What I loved most about Boucherie, aside from the beautiful space and welcoming service, was that salt was *not* the pervading overtone. Instead, it was coupled with all those other flavors and textures that would indeed make you shiver, with every next indulgent bite.",0,0,0,Cindy L.,"Manhattan, NY",370,3,0

I was very excited to try this place after seeing a 4.5 star rating on yelp.  Very rarely does my rating differ more than 2 stars from the yelp nation but on this one it was the case. My experience was no more than 2 stars and heres why:Sat the bar and although the bartender was extremely nice and helpful it was way too cramped. They really pack this place in and you are on top of each other with no elbow room. We started with the cheese plate which my wife loves and it was good. The caesar salad was good but lacked that punch of flavor in homemade caesar dressing that puts it over the top. The holy grail of caesar salad is at MASH in london but thats a different review...We then tried some steaks. My wife ordered the filet and I ordered the $65 steak I forget what type. My steak had a bitter charred/burnt taste on the outside which overwhelmed the whole steak. It was top 5 worst I have had. The filet was edible but it was overcooked based on our order (medium) and not the greatest.  For our sides we had the potato gratin which was bland. It needed salt and some flavor. The potatoes were cooked right but missed in the flavor department.We then had the creme brulee which had good flavor but the true test of a creme brulee is the top and it should be caramelized to the point that it makes a sound if you tap on it with a spoon. This lacked that type of caramelization and so the textures melted together. Not the best.Overall, for the price and the high yelp reviews this place missed the mark BIG TIME.

One friend ordered a fish dish and asked for French fries instead of the fingerling potatoes that came with. Of course no one thought anything of it. But several minutes later, the waiter returned to inform him that the CHEF would not make the substitution. But he was welcome to order a side of fries...Excuse me? Not appropriate for chef to decide against customer's simple request! Pretty tacky too that the waiter suggested ordering the fries separately. I mean what is this really about, the extra $10 they thought he'd shell out? Ridiculous. I kind of wish we'd left at that point but my friend is so polite and asked for just no potatoes then.I should mention that another friend and I had both ordered burgers which came with fries. So it was pretty absurd that the chef refused to just throw a few more in the fryer....I mean since his job is to cook the food not call the shots, right?...And not be a controlling snob about the food he's supposed to cook?Burgers and fries were decent but nothing to write home about.

The service was great, our server was well informed and kept us amused with his knowledge of the menu and cracking a few jokes here and there.

From 6pm and thereafter, people start coming in, plus Friday and the weekend as expected.)This restaurant has no happy hour, but they do have a full bar that extends the wall of the restaurant. The inner shape of this place seems to be a triangle...Which is quite intriguing to me.Table settings... Lovely.. makes you feel like you entered ettitque school...With all the forks laid out on the table..lolGot seated with three slices of bread and butter to smear, which they refill when it's finished.The atmosphere is great, I loved the ambiance and the service mostly. My water was always refilled soon as it reached mid cup. And they are very good at clearing your plates and utensils, and will ask before taking away your almost finished food. I was very happy about that, as it doesn't always happen at restaurants. Food:I ordered mussels for appetizer, I loved the platting of it, beautiful presentation. The sauce was a wine reduction and it was nice. This dish was served with fresh black mussels and only one of them showed up empty. They topped it off with some slices pepper and mini pepperoni pieces.The chef was heavy handed on the salt and pepper, so I drank a lot of water with every bite. And my server probably didn't hear me tell him how salty it was...And it wasn't quality for a 6oz steak that was served pre-cut. However the fries with it was supber! It was just right in every way. I wasn't a fan with the wine gravy it came with.The favorite of tonight was the chocolate mouse dessert ! OMG..Is it delicious...Served in a cute little tea cup setting...Topped off with whipped cream, slices of strawberries and shaved chocolate. Hands down, would order this one repeatedly...Side note:The cocktails may be $16-18 but you get a full kick of the alcohol in every sip.

4.0,1/30/2018,"We dined here for New York City Restaurant Week dinner on Sunday night, and had a pleasant time. The interior is cozy with an open bar and semi-open kitchen, and we were seated by a booth in the middle of the restaurant. The waiter was a bit rude (true French-style, I must add?) and made somewhat of an inappropriate cultural comment and didn't check up on us about our meal, but he got our orders correct and even made some recommendations when asked. For the meal itself, we got the salad, moules basquaise, steak frites and chocolate mousse and tarte tartin between the three of us, and we were so full by the end of the meal! The steak frites had a more tart pepper sauce which I didn't like as much (I prefer the rich green sauce), but the fries were so crisp that I would recommend the dish overall. Boucherie is a good place for some classic French dishes, and a great place for value if you go during Restaurant Week.",0,0,0,Lizzy K.,"New York, NY",5,18,6
4.0,1/30/2018,"Very cute and home-y feel. It was January, yet they still had a tree right in the middle of the restaurant. The decor is nice and very Parisian.The food was pretty good, we ordered the foie gras, truffle ravioli, duck confit, and the steak frites. The foie gras was good and smooth. I didn't get to try the truffle ravioli. The duck confit was a little dry. The steak frites was yummy and seasoned well. For dessert we ordered the creme brûlée and the pistachio bombe glacee.One problem though, we ordered a the steak frites again, but when it came out, they had pre-poured the sauce over the steak. We didn't like the sauce, and didn't realize they would pour the sauce. They took it back though and brought us a new steak.We went for a Saturday late lunch, and apparently all the bottle wines were half off. Service is pretty good, they were good at refilling water and cleaning up the table quickly.",1,0,1,Tiffany C.,"New York, NY",203,314,441

5.0,1/28/2018,"This was my second time at Boucherie, and given that my first trip was a solid one (4 stars), I had little expectation for that to be topped. But boy was I wrong, and here I am rectifying my first review, to one of 5 stars.First up, the atmosphere in this place won't fail to amaze. The interior is beautiful and there's a hustle and bustle, and attractive busy-ness to the place. You can hear the low buzz of chatter, waiters explaining dishes to other guests, as well as also being able to nose a look at what other delightful dishes your neighbouring tables are ordering. The place is fancy, but not overwhelmingly so - it's definitely a place to take someone when you're trying to impress, but is also perfectly fine for a casual catch up with friends & family as well.As soon as we sat down, we were plied with ice cold water, and drinks menus, as well as quick follow ups, followed by even quicker drinks service - the cocktails were really really great. Boozy and fruity, without being sweet and sickly.Now onto the good bit WHICH WAS THE FOOOOOD. Before even ordering, you get a mini platter of olives, peppers, bread and butter which was a really nice touch.For starters we got the French Onion Soup and the Escargot.The french onion soup was literally perfect. Salty and sweet oniony broth topped with gooey charred cheese. Plunging through the cheese and seeing it swirl with the broth below was a thing of beauty.The Escargot were grilled to perfection, leaving little pools of garlic, buttery goodness in the little divots of the plate it was served in - perfect for dunking that bread in! The snails themselves also had a great texture. So many times when I've had snails before they've just been tough and chewy, but these little suckers almost melted in your mouth.On to the mains, and lined up we have the Rack of Lamb and the Bone-in New York strip with a side of ratatouille.First up, I have to give another shout out to the fries (see first review)...these truly are some of the best fries I've ever had. They're so crispy, but fluffy on the inside - perfect vehicle for a good dunk of tomato sauce, or of steak juice.The Lamb was perfectly cooked and also a generous portion - 4 chops on the rack, with a crispy little rib of fat that just melted along side the meat. It's also served with some crushed potatoes as well as some tomatoes and greens.The bone-in New York Strip was also just as good as the lamb. Cooked exactly as it should be (medium rare) with a light crust on the outside that complimented the succulence of the meat like no other. You can also dig a nice little bit of bone marrow out of the bone if you're into that sort of thing.Ratatouille was also great. Zesty and fresh and was a great cut-through vs the fattier side of the meal.Last up, we have the dessert - now I'm not really a dessert person. I'll always go savoury given the choice, and I was stuffed at this point...but my girlfriend had clocked a dessert the girl on the table next to us was having, and as such, also had to have it.The Pistachio Bombe Glacee is every bit as good as it sounds. It has the spectacle of the molten chocolate being poured over it. It has the cold and creamy interior of the pistachio ice cream...and the nutty/chocolatey shell that holds it all together gives a nice little crunch - really is one of the best desserts I've ever had.SO folks, all of the above is basically a long summary of why you should go to Boucherie. However, if you can't be bothered to read all of that, then simply know this:GREAT ATMOSPHERE, FOOD COOKED TO PERFECTION, ATTENTIVE STAFF AND BRILLIANT COCKTAILS - all at an incredibly fair price.GO HERE",1,0,0,Peter C.,"Brooklyn, NY",44,111,110
3.0,1/28/2018,"We dined at Boucherie on a busy Saturday night. Boucherie is a bustling, two-floor French bistro with  a menu heavy on French classics and dry-aged Pat LaFrieda steak. Our four-top was sat in quite possibly the only relatively quiet corner of the restaurant in the upper level wine cellar. For appetizers, we started with an order of foie gras and an order of escargot. It was my first time trying foie gras and while it was good when paired with the pickled beets and greens on a crostini, it was not something I'd likely try again. While I did not try the escargot (which got rave reviews from those who did eat them) I did dip a piece of bread in the remaining garlic butter and HOLY MOLY that butter is life changing. For mains, the table shared the butcher block, ordered medium rare, as well as sides of creamed spinach and sautéed mushrooms. The butcher block was beautifully presented on a large cutting board with four different sauces. It included filet mignon, strip steak, hanger steak, and bone marrow. All meats were cooked properly and lacked basic seasoning. The strip was a bit more fatty than I like and the hanger was a bit too tough, but the filet was complete perfection. It was my first time trying bone marrow. It was melted in your mouth, but the texture was not something I particularly cared for. The sautéed mushrooms were well prepared, but the creamed spinach left much to be desired. The sautéed spinach was separated from the cream in an off-putting way. The cocktail menu is heavy on an Americanized version of absinthe. I tried the lavender martini, and while it was a very unique flavor, it wasn't a drink I could have more than one of. I then enjoyed a dry rose with my dinner. My fiancé and his father ordered Tito's on the rocks, which were brought to them neat. Vodka is not typically ordered or served without ice, making this a strange mix-up.Put simply, the service was disappointing. For a meal of this price, our expectations for service were far from met. We waited ten minutes before being approached for our drink order. After the mix-up regarding the Tito's, it took yet another ten minutes before the proper cocktails were delivered. While we were tucked in a corner of the restaurant, we rarely could find our server; we seemed to be his only table in this section of the restaurant. After ordering espressos and cappuccinos, they were delivered with some confusion. One espresso was ordered decaf, and the server seemed to think the espresso was caffeinated. While we sent the hot beverages back and wanted them taken off the bill, the Tito's on the rocks on her tray was also (mistakenly) taken away. We had to track down our server yet again to get the Tito's delivered. After finishing our meal and drinks, we had to finally ask another server for our bill because our server was nowhere to be found.",4,3,4,Aly R.,"West Orange, NJ",234,237,249

Instead I ordered the  40 oz tomahawk ribeye, roasted bone marrow and bordelaise ""Cote De Boeuf Pour Deux"", mussels and onion soup. An amazing meal at such a beautifully decorated restaurant. The ribeye was MASSIVE and so savory, can feed at least 3 people. Bone marrow was huge and had a softer texture that was rich in flavor. Mussels were solid and the onion soup was super tasty, the cheese on it was really top notch. Boucherie is on the higher end of restaurants I usually dine at but I highly recommend coming here for a special occasion.

4.0,1/26/2018,"We decided to take an advantage of a restaurant week and get to have dinner here. The reservation was easy to make. The ambiance and decor is very French, old, rustic walls, very dimmed lights, marble small tables, etc. Two of us had mussels for the appetizer and the other friend had arugula salad. All were happy with the choices. Then we ordered steak for an entree. We all received them in the temperature we asked which is a really rare case in the steakhouses. Another bonus for Boucheria. The fries were perfect, PERFECT! I substituted my french fries to salad which also was good and had the lemony dressing that went very well with my steak, but kind of regretted not taking fries and stole a few from my friends' plates. The steak came with a rich creamy peppercorn sauce that was fantastic. It took away the boring meat taste and dryness from the steak. Dessert - the two of us had apple tatin and one chocolate mousse. Again, everyone was happy. I ate every bit of my dessert even though I wasn't planing to.  I also had latte and it was strong just the way I like.Now about the service. It was excellent, Im not even exaggerating. Our server whose name is Emil was so tentative, so nice, so accommodative and had a great sense of humor. I think he was French, amazing server. It's pricey on a regular day but on restaurant week we won by dining in Boucheria. I recommend",3,2,3,Elana S.,"New York, NY",335,99,422
3.0,1/25/2018,"I made some corrections to my original review below:The actual General Manager contacted me. It was the Assistant Manager that I had issues with (which were addressed). She was very sorry for my experience and wanted to make it up to me. However, I can't get past the way I was treated. Regardless of not knowing how to process an Open Table payment (which was straightforward and totally not their issue) , it was the lack of accountability and disappointing a customer. I am changing my review from 1 Star to 3 Stars but declining the offer to go back. Here's why:************The Assistant Manager would not take my Open Table dining rewards MasterCard. I repeatedly told her if she read the directions and typed it in like a credit card she can process my payment. Pretty straight-forward. I specifically chose / applied my Open Table points for this restaurant, so I would be losing $50 if she did not process it. She didn't care. She also refused to read my confirmation email with the instructions and shrugged me off, then said another patron came in the other night trying to use their rewards card and told them she couldn't use it either. Strange she would even bring it up. So it shows me she disappointed another because she was too lazy to figure it out. However, the wait staff was excellent, and they felt bad their Assistant Manager didn't take care of the situation but had to follow her guidelines. Guidelines? The right guidelines is to take care of your customers, not dismiss because you don't want to be solution -oriented operator and go through the proper channels - ie . Read the email and type the damn number into your POS system?!So now I'm out $50. Extremely disappointed and I will NOT be going back. How ironic I was there for NY restaurant week, which the intent is to acquire new customers, but instead they lost one. Well, actually now 2 because my friend I was with isn't going back either. Minetta Tavern is way better down the street. No need to stop by this uppity establishment. And in my opinion Minetta has way better steak frites. The mussels were super watering.

5.0,1/24/2018,"Incredible, Boucherie exceeded our expectations! Last week I came here for dinner with my parents and my boyfriend and we all loved it. The service is impeccable - never a dirty plate for more than a minute, never an empty beverage or water glass, crumbs cleaned - you get the picture. The cocktails were great, really can't go wrong there. And the food was to die for. We had ate a little bit before our dinner so we didn't want to get crazy with the apps. We ordered the french onion soup and the brussel sprout salad - both of which were great and the perfect amount of food to share before the main course. Not sure if I should be embarrassed or proud, but we all ordered the steak frites, medium rare. Our server told us about the Butcher Block, but we still came here for one thing and we all felt strongly about sticking to it. None of us regretted it, I can tell you that. The steak frites were perfect - down the perfectly crisped fries and the perfect amount of sauce (served on the side). I had checked off on Open Table that we were here for a birthday and to our surprise they brought out a complimentary dessert. This was of course awesome as well. It was a pricey dinner for four but worth every penny. I would highly, highly recommend adding Boucherie to your list.",1,1,1,Deana B.,"Union Square, Manhattan, NY",370,114,330
5.0,1/23/2018,"The first time I came to Boucherie was through a yelp event (It easily became among my favorite events that I've attended!) I was thrilled to have been invited back for dinner! Ambiance: I absolutely love the ambiance and the decor of Boucherie. The candlelit tables are intimate enough for dates, and the restaurant is spacious enough to comfortably host larger groups as well as events. I love the open kitchen, giving us a peak into how the plates are beautifully put together and presented. FOOD: I've been lucky to try a number of dishes from them and they have all been amazing! The escargot is so buttery and rich in flavor, that the remaining sauce definitely becomes the perfect dipping companion for the bread. It was my first time trying quail, and their stuffed quail surprisingly tasted like a very well seasoned meatball. The NY strip was perfectly cooked on the inside, and charred on the outside offering that crisp flavor. The veal porterhouse was tender, and the veal jus made it absolutely amazing! The sweet bread and mushrooms complimented the dish very well. What better way to end the meal, than creme brûlée! Their creme brûlée is delicious, topped with fresh berries. Their food portions overall are pretty generous. Service: The service here is absolutely phenomenal. Zorica (the manager) has been such a gracious host from the very beginning, and all the waiters really work together and make you feel like family. I had the pleasure of meeting Chef Jerom during my first visit, and he made it even more memorable the second time around saying hello and signing my book. My friend and I both had a wonderful experience, and we can't wait to come back to try additional items on their menu! If you haven't already, I'd definitely recommend paying them a visit.

4.0,1/23/2018,"I love French bistros and I thought Boucherie was a lot of fun, I really thought the service was great and I really enjoyed the layout of the restaurant. The restaurant is a great date spot, good for small groups or just a nice casual weekday meal since the environment was so relaxed. Overall, I thought the food was mostly good but I was really blown away by their apps, I thought their entrees were just good.The food:Mousse De Foie Gras- Hudson Valley foie gras, onion compote & red wine port sauce. I order this dish wherever I can and I think the version here might be the best I ever had. The flavor of the mousse was perfect and I loved the really smooth texture of the terrine. The flavor of the onion compote and red wine port complemented the mousse well and did a great job cutting through the richness of the foie gras but I did find it to be a tad too sweet. Regardless, this dish is a must be order. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Steak Tartare- Capers, shallots, parsley & quail egg. I really enjoyed the steak tartare, I thought all the flavors worked well with each other, the tartare tasted very light, clean and I really enjoyed the size of the chunks of beef since it wasn't too big or too fine. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Confit de Canard Pommes Salardaises- Confit duck leg, frisee & truffle potatoes. Duck confit is another dish I always order, the version here had really great flavor from the duck to the truffle potatoes but I did find the duck to be a tad dry. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Saumon a L'unilateral- North Atlantic salmon, asparagus, baby spinach, fennel & citrus. This dish was good, the salmon was cooked perfectly, we asked for medium rare and the outside of the fish was perfection with the inside keeping at a nice pink center.

5.0,1/21/2018,"I came to Boucherie for dinner last weekend with a friend. They still had their Christmas decorations up so it was very cozy and festive! It's a nice spot for an intimate dinner, although they have big enough space to fit large groups (they had a 12-person business dinner while I was there).I ordered:- Escargot - it was very filling for an appetizer, I think there were about 12 snails total.- Hanger steak- this was cooked perfectly and very saucy, and it was a LOT of meat. I didn't order any veggies on the side, but it would be a good idea so you don't fall into a meat coma.- Pistachio bombe glacee- my friend and I split this and it was my favorite dish of the meal. The server recommended it to us saying that this and the creme brulee were the most popular desserts. It was a scoop of pistachio ice cream on top of a brownie, served with chocolate syrup poured freshly on top as it arrived at our table. Highly recommend it.Service throughout our dinner was fantastic as well, our server was attentive and our water glasses were never left empty.

My fiance got the nicoise salad and our friends ordered the croque monsieur and mushroom ravioli. Fyi, the portions are big! I wasn't expecting that. I had so much smoked salmon on my plate that it wasnt appealing and I lost my appetite. The tuna on the nicoise salad tasted like it was cooked the night before and then served cold today.

I appreciate the restaurant caring enough about their patrons to invite us back. We had a much better experience this time. The restaurant wasn't as crazy or busy as it was on Christmas and the service was top notch. We were seated in a very comfortable albeit small table which overlooked the beautiful decor of the first floor. We had a different server who was very professional and kind and we had the same busboy we had on our last visit and he was fantastic both times. We enjoyed both our appetizers and entrees. We had the Caesar salad and the foie gras to start. The lobster special main course was excellent although it seems they ran out of it by 7pm as our server initially thought it was already 86'd for the night. The dry aged Strip was also fantastic. We tried the crème brûlée for dessert and it did not disappoint. The manager filling in for the manager who invited us was very kind and took great care of us.

5.0,1/17/2018,"I recently attended yelp event at this restaurant (which was the most highlighted event that I attended in 2017) and was invited back by the manager for a complimentary meal.My boyfriend and I arrived at the restaurant for 6pm Sunday night reservation and we were surprised that there were few diners. Half an hour later, practically every table was full!  We sat in the upper level and had a full view of the restaurant and the lovely Christmas tree. Our waiter Emil was lovely.  He made sure we were taken care of and we observed him being very jolly with guests, especially a young birthday boy! To start of the night we ordered cocktails. A Pocket Square for him and a Provence Martini for me.  He throughly enjoyed the Pocket Square as it had more of a lemony note while my Martini was definitely stronger with the unique lavender flavor.The appetizers were amazing.  I had had the steak tartare during the yelp event and was craving it for the longest time so naturally that was one of the appetizers we ordered.  You don't even notice that you're eating raw steak because it was flavored so well and had a sort of creamy texture. We also ordered the mousse de foie gras.  This was the dish that I was most interested in trying.  I have had foie gras before at a different restaurant in an underwhelming experience so the fact that Boucherie does a foie gras mousse was very intriguing. The foie gras by itself was bland, but when you combine it with salad and the onion compote it was like a colorful explosion in my mouth.  The sweet caramelize taste of the red wine port sauce on the compote really added a new dimension to the foie gras. The foie gras was my favorite dish of the night.For the main we ordered the Faux-Filet Bercy-16oz dry aged NY strip and the Cote de Veau Aux Champignons-16oz veal porterhouse.  To accompany our entrees we asked our waiter for red wine recommendations.  He suggested both a French and an American wine which went very well with our meal. Both entrees were cooked perfectly well to medium rare.  I did find the salted charred outside of the cuts to be a bit distracting, partly because I'm not a big fan of salt. The filet and the veal were both delicious, but I enjoyed the veal more as it was different and more tender than I expected.  It was my first time trying veal.  I didn't care too much for the sauce of the enochi mushroom, but the sweetbread was a surprise - extremely tender with a subtle flavor.After the heavy meal we were contemplating a lighter dessert yet we were unsure of what to choose.  Our waiter suggested the Pistachio Bombe Glacee since another table had ordered it and enjoyed it very much. It is pistachio ice cream on top of a brownie with a chocolate ganache glaze which is poured over the dessert at the table. The chocolate glaze and the brownie was the overpowering flavor of the dessert. We actually didn't taste any pistachio flavor in the ice cream when we ate it separately which was a slight disappointment.Overall it was a very enjoyable meal in which we spent 3hrs going through the courses.  No rush at all and as we sat on the upper level we observed many customers enjoying their meal and eating for pleasure.  Thank you Boucherie and Zorica for inviting us back.  There are definitely other dishes that we would come back to try!",3,0,1,Ping F.,"Manhattan, NY",112,240,1484
2.0,1/15/2018,"This used to be my favorite spot for steaks. However, upon our last visit, there was not much going well and I am disinclined to go back. We had dinner on Saturday for 5 people at 8 (with a reservation). We ordered at 8:15 some apps, a butcher block, another steak frites and some sides. Our apps arrived soon after but our steaks arrived at 9:45. We were starving! No one came to check on us or offer a bit more bread, another app or anything. We had to inquire several times, with no answers and a vague answer that ""we'll take care of you"". Well, the steaks arrived, some were good, some were burnt and dry. The mushroom side and the spinach side had no flavor. The fries were good.  The potato gratin was actually cold (seriously, they couldn't warm it in 1,5 hours?). The apps were underwhelming: a flavorless seafood salad, and a flavorless foie gras mousse (how is that even possible?). Oh, and ""taking care of us"" apparently meant desserts on the house.

5.0,1/11/2018,"First experienced this place from a Yelp Elite event and it has to have been one of the best ones I've attended. They offered unlimited cocktails and wine and the amount of food they served was a great sampling. We were served food to our table instead of the catering style. Zorica, the manager then invited us back for a complimentary dinner and the food and service was exceptional. Our waiter knew from the beginning that this was a free meal yet he was still very attentive and helpful with the menu items and the food came in a timely order (of course we left him a hefty tip for his tremendous service). We started with the foie gras and that was delicious. When we ran out of the bread that came with the dish, our waiter brought us a new basket of bread. The mussels are absolutely a must have, I love the sauce and love smothering my bread in it. Just so flavorful without completely taking away the mussel flavor. For the main I got the NY strip and it was 16 oz of pure joy. Cooked to the medium rare i requested, cut nicely, the meat quality is just superb. My boyfriend went with the filet mignon and again, the meat was just so tender. For the sides, I highly recommend the potatoes in a buttery cream sauce; this was served at the Yelp Event and I just had to have it again as it is just about a few things that is right with the world! I have been to this place three times and it was the last restaurant I visited in Manhattan before I moved.

The restaurant itself is architecturally stunning and in a great location at the crossroads of West Village and Greenwich Village. The entire space was decked out with lights and decorations for the holiday season, and as a high-scale French bistro turned winter wonderland (complete with a towering, glittery Christmas tree), it is the perfect place for a spendy, indulgent meal whether that be with family and friends or for a romantic night out. At the event, we got to meet all the staff, including the executive chef Jerom Dihui, and had a stunning meal consisting of filet mignon, steak frites, rib-eye, salmon, scallops, and more. Everything was done perfectly and the entire waitstaff was courteous and professional.At dinner a week later, my friend and I returned for a full meal and were absolutely blown away. True to its ""butcher"" name, the menu is heavy on its proteins and lean meats, but also contains an assortment of pastas, salads, and whatnot. But, if you're going to come here, it definitely should be for the meat. My friend and I started the night out with drinks, her with a glass of red wine and me with the Old Tom Sling. Our waiter brought over multiple bottles for her to sample and explained the background and origin of each; needless to say, we were both very impressed and she was ultimately very pleased with her choice. My cocktail was also a waiter recommendation; the hibiscus and plum flavors themselves paired well with one another though I'm not the biggest fan of gin, so next time I'd be sure to get something else.Then, appetizers. My friend ordered the mousse de foie gras and I got the escargots de bourgogne. The foie gras was glorious. The escargots made me cry tears of joy. Paired with the complimentary bread basket and antipasto, both were so stunningly perfect. The foie gras is rich, very rich, and topped with an onion compote and a red wine port sauce. We went through a good two baskets of ciabatta bread to finish off the pâté. The escargots were unbelievably tender, and soaked in this garlic butter sauce that was absolutely divine. We actually ended up finishing another full basket of bread to soak up its remainder.Three baskets of bread, two entire appetizers, and a couple of drinks in, we were full, but luckily there was time to breathe between courses. A good half hour later, our main entrees were ready. I originally had wanted the filet mignon, but our waiter heartily recommended the dry-aged bone-in strip steak. I'm so happy I went with that instead, because, my god was it good. The steak was perfectly medium rare, rubbed and crusted with ample salt and pepper. It was so tender and flavorful that it didn't even require any of the sauce that was brought out. My friend ordered the steak frites; she loved the pepper sauce that topped the steak and was absolutely blown away by the fries. We both were; in fact, I was nearly eating off her plate by the end of the night.We ended the meal with an order of the profiteroles, a generous plate of perfectly softened cream puffs and ice cream. By this time we were so full that we could hardly taste it, but regardless, it was the perfect way to close out such a rich, delicious meal.The whole dinner was a good 3-4 hour long ordeal. Our waiter was beyond attentive, refilling waters constantly and brushing off tablecloth crumbs and offering up personal recommendations. Zorica and her team were just as great, making the two of us feel welcomed and coming over to chat with us personally. Boucherie definitely offers a fantastic dining experience; extremely authentic to French cuisine and very much worth checking out. The entire restaurant reminded me of a more refined, higher-end Balthazar. If you're looking for a fancy yet delicious meal, perhaps for a special occasion or company dinner, this is the place to go.",3,0,1,Phoebe W.,"New York, NY",591,404,852
5.0,1/5/2018,"My husband and I decided that I would determine our Valentine's day dinner plans last year as he was completely swamped at work... being indecisive and with too many options, I made and cancelled about 10 different reservations, finally booking at about 5pm on Valentine's day afternoon a table at Boucherie.  I waited until he was out of the subway to tell him where to go and he managed to beat me to the restaurant.  They told him they didn't have our 8:00pm reservation (I accidentally made it for the following day) and were booked solid all night - luckily, they said that all they could offer us was the grill table. DONE!It was a cozy bar style table overlooking the grills where we could watch all of the steaks get done - perfect for two carnivore foodies on a cold winter night.  We ordered the Cote de boeuf pour deux (bone marrow and a huge Tomahawk steak which easily was our dinner the following night too), creamed spinach and potatoes au gratin.  Due to the long passage of time since this dinner, I can't recall whether we also ordered the escargot, but I do remember everything being excellent - food, classic Parisian ambiance, service.  It was a lucky and great find, and eleven months later I am still thinking of it because I would love to go back!",0,0,0,Elizabeth W.,"New York, NY",2,14,8
5.0,1/3/2018,"Came back here after Christmas with my BFF to do a christmas exchange and it was the perfect place for such a setting. This restaurant truly is beautiful with its high ceilings and wonderful decor. During the christmas season, this place was decked out in sparkling lights and a giant christmas tree. It definitely held the holiday spirit, great place for a date, friends catchup or even group parties as this place is quite spacious.I was excited to eat here again but I got more excited when I saw that they revamped their menu from when I last was here. We started off with some complimentary bread and antipasti. Then the really good stuff!Steak Tartare - I got this last time and I had to get it again. It is just so good, fresh, well seasoned and really well portioned. Caille Farcie - Stuffed quail with foi gras and a balsamic glaze. Amazing and can easily be split between two to three people. And I mean easy! The meat was so tender and soft. It came out looking like the bird but it was boneless for the most part and easy to cut. It was absolutely delicious. The flavor was spectacular, accented by the fattyness of the foi gras. Definitely a must get!Lamb Rack - Hefty in portions, perfectly cooked at medium rare. The meat was easy to cut, super moist with a nice little herb crust on the outside. I devoured it!Cassolet Maison - duck confit with pork belly, sausage and white beans. Also very large in portion! The beans were cooked down nicely and there was plenty of all three meats in this dish. Just as good as all the other dishes I had.In addition to the entrees, we also got a side of the fries and Gratin de pommes de terre. I love love love their fries. Came out pipping hot. Crisp on the outside, soft and potatoey on the inside. I got this last time and I just had to do it again. As full as I was, I had to make room for it. We ended the delicious meal with creme brulee and a chocolate souffle with pistachio ice cream. Both really good ends to a wonderful meal. The creme brulee had a nice custard like taste to it and the souffle was moist and soft. Overall, five thumbs up. So glad we came back here. I think it's going to have to be a Christmas tradition going forward!",9,1,9,Michelle L.,"New York, NY",888,585,2091
5.0,1/2/2018,"Initially went here for a yelp event then returned later for dinner, I found Boucherie to be a fantastic French brasserie with cuisine equivalent to those delectable brasseries I dined at the Latin Quarter in Paris.  Whereas most NYC french brasseries are small & intimate & possibly cramped--Boucherie is  capital L-Large as it is situated in a former theater ie the Circle Repertory Theater and now seats up to 320 people for brunch, lunch & dinner.  The brasserie's name Boucherie is French for ""butcher"" and appropriately so as in addition to a more traditional brasserie fare (onion soup, duck confit, coq au vin, bouillabaisse) there is a respectable steakhouse menu to be perused.  In fact many of the large format two person steaks are decadent enough and marbled enough to be worthy of Quality Meats, del Frisco's ilk.  The prices of steak certainly match those of standalone NYC steakhouses.  We ordered the mousse de foie gras & the saint jacques a la Provencale (sea scallops with crushed tomato, garlic fennel) as starters.  My husband was favorably impressed by portion sizes for both.  The scallops especially were cooked perfectly--succulent and not even a hint of overcooking.  The mousse de foie gras was balanced with the onion compote providing sweet notes & greens providing the acidic component.  We also had cocktails with dinner: Old Tom Sling, Vieiu Amie, provence martini & bastille sour.  Among these four the best was the Old Tom Sling(gin, amaro, grenadine, hibiscus & lemon lime) but all were decent & stiff drinks (so worthy of $15 pricetag).  Next we both had offerings from the meaty steakhouse half of the menu:  I had the faux filet bercy (or a 16 oz dry age bone in ny strip) and my husband chose the weekly rotating ""Cut of the week"" which this frosty first week of January was Cotes de Chevreuil (or a Huge herb crusted Mountain River rack of venison with vegetables & demi glaze).  Both cooked to order (rare/medium rare as all quality red meats should be!).  We loved both--the permanently available bone in ny strip had a perfectly seasoned crust & the special offer venison was so tender.  As it really is hard to find good venison in nyc restaurants--it was the highlight of our week to get to order this!  We had the gratinated potatoes as a side (very fatty & rich but expected nothing less as french cuisine & butter are pretty much synonymous).  Finally dessert offering are classic French bistro/brasserie fare: creme brûlée, profiteroles, chocolate mousse etc--we had the creme brûlée and it was large enough to share & most importantly the custard had the vanilla bean specks that I always search for in a properly pedigreed french brûlée.  Overall Boucherie is a vast improvement from the cramped average faceless french brasseries you find in nyc especially  on upper east side--Boucherie is both a respectable steakhouse & a French comfort food bistro rolled into one.  On a side note: although we visited without children tonight--we are always on lookout for good eats that we can bring our little ones along to so I inquired & Boucherie is very kid friendly with high chairs, booster seats & diaper change tables available.  We plan to try bringing kids for Brunch on weekends.",2,0,3,Grace F.,"Manhattan, NY",105,110,883
5.0,1/2/2018,"Wow, Boucherie, thanks for existing. Within one month, I went to Boucherie three times and it was three different settings - 1. Yelp tasting event, 2. one-on-one dinner with a friend, 3. group birthday dinner. First, let's talk about the interior. Boucherie is a scaled-up French inspired restaurant, and of course, the decor has to match. It's a very spacious two-floor restaurant, with dim lighting and beautiful decor - there was a huge Christmas tree during the holidays. It's perfect for a date night or even a group dinner! 1. During the Yelp tasting event, I was able to try a variety of their appetizers and different cuts of meat. I couldn't get enough! French cuisine has always been my favorite, and they definitely set the bar really high for all NYC restaurants. The main takeaway from this experience was that even though we were non-paying customers, the servers were still extremely attentive and made sure everything was perfect. This is why I would recommend people to go!2. I went back a week later to eat with a friend. I wanted to taste the other appetizers that I wasn't able to try during the tasting event. To start, my friend and I shared the steak tartare and scallops. The scallops were amazing - extremely juicy and flavored perfectly. The sauce was perfect; we literally scraped the plate clean with the bread. I've never had steak tartare and was hesitant to try. But I was surprised how much I liked it. They serve it with flavored toasted bread and it really enhanced the taste. As for our entrees, we both got the Filet de Boeuf. Again, it was flavored perfectly and the truffle butter was the cherry on top. For dessert, we tried the Crepes Suzette, warm crepes and ice cream? Yes, please!Our dining experience was fantastic, we got to sit on the second floor, which overlooked the first floor and their beautiful Christmas tree. Too bad, it wasn't a date, otherwise, it would've been very romantic. 3. I returned a week later (I'm addicted, can you tell?), with a group of 8 people for a birthday dinner. We made the reservation on OpenTable and noted that it was a birthday celebration. We were seated immediately and greeted by the Zorica, the Manager, with champagne. What a lovely surprise and kind gesture. We were then greeted by our awesome server, Andres. He took time out to explain the whole menu and suggested that we do family style. He recommended his favorites and we ordered it all! - Escargot de Bourgogne - buttery and perfectly seasoned - Scallops - again, I scraped the sauce off the plate- Moules Basquaise - I'm biased because I love mussels but the white wine sauce was amazing- Raviolis aux Champignons - mushroom ravioli, highly recommend!- Confit de Canard - Confit duck leg - too dry in my opinion- 40 oz ribeye - literally MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH. It also comes with the bone marrow, highly recommend!- 16 oz bone-in New York Strip- for sides, we ordered the pommes frites, ratatouille, gratin de pommes de terre, and creamed spinach - all were great!- for desserts, we were able to sample a few things - Crème Brulee, Crepes Suzette, Tarte Tatin, and Profiteroles - all amazing. Andres and Zorica were there the whole time making sure we had a perfect experience. I felt like they were dining with us too! Thanks for the amazing dining experience, I will be returning and I will recommend to all my friends!",2,0,3,Dana Y.,"New York, NY",354,254,738
5.0,12/31/2017,"This French inspired restaurant in the West Village specialises in meat - and lots of it. The restaurant is large, impeccably decorated and was pumping when we arrived around 7pm on a Friday. With the assistance of the sommelier, we picked out a glass of Chardonnay to pair with our appetiser - the escargots. These lovely, garlic butter infused morsels went down beautifully with the wine and left us primed for what was to come. On to the main event, we didn't mess around and went straight for the tomahawk ribeye steak for two. The meat came out, beautifully presented with the bone (marrow included) asking to be gnawed upon. The meat was perfectly cooked, medium rare and full of flavour. The marrow was rich and sweet, really rounding out the dish. We ordered a serve of fries to accompany this course which were great. A bottle of French red (can't remember the variety) was an excellent pairing with the red meat. One note, this dish is enormous and could comfortably feed three people, although we somehow managed to fight through and eat most of it. When it came time for dessert, we were already uncomfortably full. Luckily we made the decision to loosen our belts and squeeze in the créme brûlée. The crispy outer shell housed a magnificent vanilla custard which we worked out way through before rolling out the door and back home.",1,0,0,Tom B.,"Jersey City, NJ",84,45,78

We were sitting there waiting to order and then we see him in his jacket, walking out of the restaurant. I suppose we should have anticipated a bad experience when he started the meal by telling us how busy it was and that he would do his best to give us a ""decent"" meal.  Even with that low standard, it was a major fail.",0,1,0,Mike M.,"Chicago, IL",3,87,116

5.0,12/29/2017,"Absolutely wonderful meal in a beautiful setting. Boucherie is kind of a scaled-up French Bistro concept that has been slightly tweaked for American diners. True to its name, the menu leans meat and game-heavy, with an emphasis on steaks and other offerings from the land. In honor of the holiday season, the spacious dining room was gloriously decked out and even featured a towering tree with all kinds of lovely baubles and balls. This is an ideal location if you're looking for a spendy, romantic meal before Christmas or New Years. I started with the lavender gin cocktail which was delicious and refreshing and it took all my self-control not to drink it too fast. The steak tartare with quail egg is a MUST try. I'm usually very picky about my tartare but this one is really great and the egg makes it almost creamy. SO had the mushroom ravioli which was also delicious and to share, we had a huge medium rare porterhouse with scalloped potatoes and mushrooms. Everything was so decadent that we skipped dessert and took home leftovers.",0,0,1,Julie B.,"Manhattan, NY",289,450,264
5.0,12/29/2017,"I first got a tasting at Boucherie when I was invited by a friend as her +1. Prior to even knowing about that event I had already booked my birthday dinner here in advance just purely off the photos of the restaurant and some of the reviews I've read.Made a reservation for 8 via opentable and was seated promptly upon arrival. The décor/ambiance of the restaurant is absolutely beautiful and I expect it changes with the season; currently there is a large Christmas tree in the center the restaurant. Because we were there for a birthday dinner the restaurant gave all us girls a complimentary round of champagne to start off the evening; what a nice surprise! Upon being seated you are handed two menus: one menu features appetizers, entrees, and specials of the day, and the other menu is all steaks. For a party of 8 we decided to order everything family style and we got the Escargot de Bourgogne (very good and buttery), the Scallops (highly recommend), the Moules Basquaises (that white wine reduction sauce is the bomb), Raviolis aux Champaignons (this mushroom ravioli is so good and highly recommend), Confit duck leg (we ordered this based off other reviews we read but it was a bit disappointing to me as it was too dry), and to compliment the 40 oz ribeye (melt in your mouth delicious - highly recommend), and 16 oz bone-in New York Strip,  we got pommes frites, gratin de pommes de terre, ratatouille, and creamed spinach. For dessert we had the Crème Brulee (I don't like crème brulee but this one was absolutely delicious), Crepes Suzette (this was so good as it was a nice mix between the warm crepes and the vanilla ice cream), Tarte Tatin (also a nice play between warm and cold and perhaps my favorite dessert of the evening), and Profiteroles (cream puff turned into an ice cream sandwich).Needless to say Boucherie provided us one of the best dining/service experiences, courtesy of Andre (our waiter) and Zorica (the manager), exceeded all my expectations, and will be one of the birthdays I'll keep in my memories for years to come.

First, my brother brought me here to celebrate my new job, second for the yelp elite Christmas event, third for a follow up complimentary dinner for two people from Zorica. The executive chef Jerome Dihui fed us a stunning meal including Escargots de bourgogne as an appetizer, Cassoulet maison for an entree, and profiteroles for dessert with glasses of red wine. My boyfriend visited me from LA and I reserved us this dinner for the dinner after Christmas. Zorica, the manager, always remembered me, has always been particularly attentive that it continues to impress me how hospitable and effortless she makes running a restaurant seem, and the attentive customer service like them dusting off bread crumbs from my tablecloth, replacing my boyfriends dirty plate before he notices, impresses me. Escargots de bourgogne - snails with parsley, butter, lemon, garlic, and shallots- blew our mind. The sauce was so good I'd rather dip the complimentary bread into it than any other sauce.French onion soup- much better than the soups we had before throughout NYC.Duck confit w pork belly sausage and white beans- SO filling and so good.Thank you SO much Boucherie for making every meal and experience for me so memorable.

We took it, but I also checked my opentable app and saw reservations were readily available from 8pm on for a table for 4, why were we squished in the front? No one came over to us for at least 15 minutes and then it was just the water guy, then after much staring at the hostess, she eventually sent a waiter over after another 15 minutes. I was about to walk out but luckily our waiter was a really friendly guy and attempted to save the dinner. We ordered the Cote de bouef, steak tartare, French onion soup, cream of mushrooms, brussel sprouts. The cote de bouef came with bone marrow which was to me was the best part - cote de bouef at Minetta Tavern was better in my opinion. loved the cream of mushrooms and brussel sprouts were more like a salad, good, but not expected.

5.0,12/26/2017,"Been here twice in the last month and really enjoyed each meal. The first was a Yelp event where the restaurant hosted over 50 of us and served up light bites. My first impression was of all the holiday decorations which made it a great place to host a little holiday party. It had a warm and cozy feeling with the huge Christmas tree in the middle and the open kitchens bringing in a little fireplace warmth. For this event we ate family style sharing plates with small bites of steak tartare, gougeres, deviled eggs, scallops, salmon, steak, and seared tuna. My favorites were the gougeres and the salmon. The gougere was light with a nice cheesy (I think Gruyere) flavor that I found pretty addicting. I could have eaten a whole plate of these. While the steak was good, my favorite protein was the salmon just because I was so impressed by how they managed to keep the fish perfectly cooked when they were firing up so many of these for us. Considering that catering for large parties can often lead to mediocre, dry or overcooked food, Boucherie really delivered on serving our large party. My second time I came back for dinner and was even more impressed with the food. Escargot de Bourgogne - This was soooo good. If you like escargot, I would definitely recommend ordering it here. They do the typical garlic and butter but it was the taste of lemon that that added another layer of flavor. This item is also sharable since they put 2-3 escargot in each little well on the plate. Salade d'auvergne - My dining partner ordered this salad. I'm not a huge salad person but had a few bites. It was nicely dressed and had good textures. Salmon w Lentils - I had the salmon at the yelp event and liked it so much I just had to order it again. It was perfectly cooked and was delicious with the lentils on the side. Boucherie Burger - Although it was a little overdone, the meat was flavorful and juicy. The highlight though were the fries that had a really good crunch. Might just order a side of fries next time with whatever we get. Crepe Suzette - Super tasty. The crepes were nice and thin and there was an orange marmalade sauce. I love citrus and this did not disappoint.  Drink to get: Pocket Square - it's sweet and fruity and refreshingGreat food and service.

So, even before our first taste of food or drink, we were greeted with a feast for our eyes. The room, probably two or more stories high, is beautiful in its own right with huge mirrors, large bar, large white tiles, oversized lithographed posters, French cafe chairs and an open kitchen area with a dining countertop. If you're reading this review when I post it, go there now to take in the visual treat that awaits you. The meal itself was as close to perfect as any we've had in New York. That's true in terms of the service, hospitality, food and beverages. The basket of bread comes with a complementary amuse of sliced ham, olives and tuna stuffed little red peppers. I ordered the mussels, which had an abundance of roasted peppers and slices of sausage inserted inside some of the mussels. My wife's scallops were incredible. We kept tasting them to be sure that we agreed that they were the best scallops we've ever had. I won't go through the meal dish by dish, and I'll let our picture of our chocolate covered desert speak for itself. My cocktail was a party for my taste buds.

5.0,12/17/2017,"[Disclaimer: I was extended an invitation to have a complementary meal at  Boucherie by its management after dining at their sister restaurant, Olio e Piu. Below is completely honest and impartial review!]After a long work week, my boyfriend and I found ourselves at a table for two at Boucherie. To get down to it, our meal, as a whole, was a home run. The food was delicious, the atmosphere was cozy and the service was stellar.To start, we ordered *Escargots de Bourgogne*and *Saint Jacques a la Provencale* (seared scallops) for appetizers. We were then given suggestions on drinks: I ended up getting the aged Manhattan and my boyfriend got an old fashioned. When the appetizers rolled around, I was so excited. The escargots smelled amazing. This was our first time trying it and we were blown away. It was buttery, garlicky and ridiculously yummy. The scallops were seared perfectly and sat on top of crushed tomatoes which paired well together. For entrees, I got the *Faux Filet Bercy* and he got the *Veal Porterhouse.* Both great cuts and cooked to perfection. My steak was seasoned nicely - on the peppery side, however. The porterhouse came with mushrooms and a veal jus. The jus was served on the side, as opposed to on top of the veal, which gave you the power to add the sauce to your liking. For dessert, we REALLY enjoyed the *Crêpes Suzette.*The sauce was perfectly sweet (tangerine/orangey flavors), the crepe was the right amount of thickness and it was served with ice cream. I'm not a chocolate person but my boyfriend enjoyed the chocolate mousse!The service was a highlight for us. Everyone we encountered was so friendly and helpful - our server gave us space to breathe but came by often to ensure we were ok. We were invited for a complementary dinner so we were bound to encounter top notch service but I even looked around to observe the treatment of the parties around us and it seemed consistent across the board.

5.0,12/15/2017,"I visited Boucherie for an Elite event and I definitely plan on coming back. I don't eat much red meat these days, but wow the steak at Boucherie was delicious! Perfectly cooked, seasoned to perfection, great texture. You could taste the quality. I tried a small piece of salmon which was cooked very well and seasoned very simply, it would've been great with a squeeze of lemon. Their fries were probably the best thing that I had the chance to try, they were so crispy and so well seasoned, and the serving size was pretty generous. The service was great and the action behind the grill station was very impressive.Boucherie is definitely not cheap, but it is a beautiful restaurant to come to for a special night out, especially with a steak lover.",0,0,0,Hannah C.,"New York, NY",45,194,112
5.0,12/15/2017,"Boucherie is a great romantic date night spot, especially during the holidays. When I was here, they had a gorgeous Christmas tree in the middle of the restaurant and festive (but classy) decorations all around. We were lucky enough to try a taste of everything. We had bites of salmon, steak, deviled eggs, scallops, cheese puff-esque things, and more. It is clear that Boucherie knows meat well - specifically beef. Their seasoning was just-right and the meat was cooked at the perfect temperature. It would be improper to leave this review without mentioning their patience, helpful staff. Andres, among others, was a delight. He had great drink recommendations and was a pleasure to be around. ** Full disclosure: This review is based off of a Yelp Elite event hosted at Boucherie",2,0,0,Maia H.,"New York, NY",182,125,83
5.0,12/14/2017,This place is all decked for the holidays! I love the atmosphere it provides during xmas time. They have a nice tree in the middle of the restaurant that made our meal feel very festive. For drinks I got their Pocket Square because I am a sucker for gin. Super delicious and refreshing. Their scallops are gigantic and beef tartare is amazing! The shrimp skewers were probably my favorite because of how fresh they are. They also have these mini cheesy bread that is so soft and warm that I couldn't stop eating them!! All the ingredients they use are no doubt top notch ingredients. The waiters are all very friendly.

From entering, there was a great ambience, the staff were very attentive and the menu looked great.I opted for the scallops starter that were sat upon a crushed tomato and garlic base. They were perfectly cooked and they looked amazing. It was a good sized appetizer, accompanied with some crunchy bread.The Boucherie menu is made up with a number of different fish and meat options. I've had meat from Pat LaFrieda before but not for some time and so I went for the filet de boeuf for my main, with a side of fries. The meat is topped with a truffle butter which isn't too overpowering and just adds the perfect amount of truffle flavor to the meat. The fries here are also quite something! Very crisp but fluffy at the same time.All of the desserts looked great but I went for the tarte tatin. A delicious classic, which in my opinion which topped off a faultless meal. I would totally recommend Boucherie to anyone reading this review. Granted, it's on the more expensive side but you get what you pay for. It's more than just good food - the whole experience makes Boucherie the perfect spot for a special occasion dinner, if you're feeling a bit fancy or just want some great food.",2,1,2,Taylor A.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",106,134,141

4.0,12/11/2017,"Came here with my friend for lunch! We arrived at 1 on a Monday and there was no wait for a table. In fact, the restaurant was pretty empty so I don't think you really need a reservation for a weekday lunch. Decor is fancy and upscale but not pretentious. We had two waiters; the one who took our orders was pretty nice but the other one, not so much. He was attentive in refilling our waters though. We both ordered from the pre-fixe lunch menu, which I think is the best deal considering the prices of some of the entrees are already more the pre-fixe option itself but with the pre-fixe, you get an appetizer and an entree.Steak tartare- My first time trying raw beef...I really had no idea what to expect and after eating it, I can't really say I enjoyed it. It had some pretty nice flavors added to it, including capers and parsley but in the end, it still tasted like raw meat, which is something I'm just not used to eating. Comes with toast, a quail egg and a very tasty salad.Steak frites au poivre- Steak and fries yum!! The fries were spot on, super crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I've been so accustomed to fast food fries that I've forgotten what a legit French fry tastes like until now. As for the steak, cooked a perfect medium rare. It didn't quite have that melt in your mouth texture but it was definitely close. The sauce wasn't my favorite. This was a creamier butter sauce but I personally prefer a thinner and more sour sauce on my steaks.We ended up paying $50 each after tax and tip, which I think is reasonable for what we ordered. It is French food after all so you already know you're going to have to pay a little more $$$. I would say the food here is solid. Service could've been better for the type of dining environment we were in but it wasn't horrible. Overall, a nice French restaurant for a date.",1,1,1,Kevin E.,"Brooklyn, NY",84,612,973

They totally burned my steak, like completely charred! BUT they immediately took it back with no complaint, then brought me out an AMAZINGLY cooked steak.Would recommend: steak frites, brussel sprout salad, filet, and (dessert special) with pistachio ice cream.

5.0,12/9/2017,"Upon entering this restaurant you instantly notice a retro vibe that is very cool and transformative. While it is modern and chic it has an atmosphere reminiscent of a bygone era that I really enjoyed. I sat at the bar and didn't try the food, so I can't speak to taste, but it smelled divine in there. The wine was fantastic, though it's a bit more expensive the experience alone is worth the extra few dollars.I think it makes for a great place to catch up, have a date, or a birthday dinner. The staff is dressed impeccably and are very friendly. The music is comforting and smooth and plays at the perfect volume to carry on a conversation without shouting.will most certianly be back!Update with food: The wait service was exquisite, the wine still delightful. The bread basket was perfect with the plives. I started had the ravioli with mushrooms and truffles and it was downright divine and my dinner guest had the fois gras, which she said was delicious. The appetizers portions were bigger than expected so I would recommended sharing an app. For our main course we had the chicken/potatoes and a steak. Everything was perfectly cooked. Though I'm pretty sure my guest got the wrong  order, but she said it was the best steak she had ever had and didn't even mind, Hahaha. Everything was cooked and flavored to perfection and the service was impeccable. For the dessert we had profiterols and the were light and creamy, but the portions were so generous that we could barely finish it to our disappointment. I look forward to going back!P.S.

5.0,12/4/2017,"Went back recently and ordered a bunch of different items. For appetizers we had the Ravioli aux Champignon and Fruits de Mer. The ravioli was decadent. It had a mushroom filling and a black truffle butter sauce. There were also some burgundy truffles. This is probably one of the best ravioli dishes I've had. I would probably swim in that butter sauce and be content.The Fruits de Mer is a light and refreshing dish with lump crab, gulf shrimp, grapefruit, fennel and celery. It's sprinkled with a squirt of lemon which makes this like a French version of ceviche. Note: the crab and shrimp are not soaked in citrus, so it's technically NOT ceviche. This was a really great compliment to the rich ravioli since it was very light. For my main I had the filet mignon. It is was perfectly charred on the outside and ridiculous juicy on the inside. It was served with a two slices of truffle butter which took the steak to another level. Truffle butter and juicy filet mignon is an AMAZING combination.My wife had the rack of lamb and she thoroughly enjoyed it.For dessert we had the profiteroles which came highly recommended by our waiter. The profiteroles were drowning in a rich chocolate sauce. I enjoyed the ying-yang interplay between the pastry and the ice cream. The pastry ends were hot and crispy while the vanilla ice cream was very cold. The pastry chef must've put it together in a flash so that all the individual elements remained true. It was a great way to end our meal.Boucherie is a stellar French restaurant in West Village. Come by and check them out if you haven't already.",0,0,1,Kevin C.,"New York, NY",288,574,317

The bar has some sort of finished chrome that is like no other bar in the West village. The best part is the authentic Absinthe that's served drip drop. I don't know if any other place in the city that's like that. It was really good, but expect a different kind of taste (black jelly bean kinda)We had the mussels to start which were fantastic Im a huge Au Poivres fan and this was right up there with the best I've ever had.

1.0,12/3/2017,"Disappointing to say the least. After waiting 30 minutes to be sat for an 8:30 reservation we ordered a few starters, foie gras mousse the size of a golf ball, steak tartare which had absolutely no seasoning at all and a full board of cheese and charcuterie which we had to ask for bread for, not sure how they expected us to eat it. The sommelier automatically tried to sell us the very expensive bottles of wine, we settled on a Rioja for 85$ which was the nicest part of the meal. after such a disappointing start we decided not to have main causes, settled the bill and moved to another establishment.

5.0,11/29/2017,"I gladly accepted an invitation to dinner when I was invited to come back by the manager of this restaurant. I really enjoyed my dining experience the first time around. Last time I came, the weather was nice so we sat outside. Since it is too cold for outdoor seating now, we were given a great seat in the balcony overlooking the beauty of the restaurant. For our appetizers, we ordered the escargot and the foie gras. The escargot came out piping hot and stayed hot until our last bite. It was extremely flavorful and enjoyable. The foie gras mousse was very interesting. I never really liked foie gras to begin with but I thought it was made well here and came with perfectly toasted bread. The prize winning dish and highlight of our meal is the Cote De Boeuf Pour Deux (40 oz tomahawk rib-eye with roasted bone marrow). The steak was very juicy and cooked in an amazing sauce. The bone marrow could use a tad less salt but nonetheless, every bite was delicious. The portion is quite hefty for two people so we almost had trouble finishing it. Although we were stuffed, we wanted to try their desserts again and decided to share the Crepe Suzette. The crepe consisted of the perfect level of sweetness and went very well with the scoop of vanilla ice cream. As if the amazing food and atmosphere wasn't enough for the evening, my guest and I were both given a copy of their hardcover book, signed by the chef!

5.0,11/28/2017,"This is a good find in West Village. We've been here before and really enjoyed their cocktails and food, the atmosphere was wonderful as well. We decided to come back for dinner. They took away the outdoor seatings because it's freezing cold outside. When it's warm, the outdoor seating is one of the cutest things (almost like dining in the Square at Ravello). Though without the outdoor seatings, their decors inside felt welcoming and well lit. I had a reservation at 6:30, showed up a little late but was seated right away. Our waiter, Drago (sp) was wonderful and attentive. I spilled a little sauce on the table, he immediately came over and placed a new tablecloth on top to cover the stain. He helped us arrange our drinks so our food would fit (kudos) for paying attention to great details. I requested a fruity cocktail with little alcohol and hubby wanted a Moscow Mule, those aren't on the menu, but Drago made it happen for us!  that made me a happy camper for sure. Everything he did was SUPERB! The restaurant manager Milos was extremely nice and recommended us some great dishes to try. This was Sunday after Thanksgiving, so we still had huge appetite and hungry stomachs. I ordered Caille Farcie (stuffed quail) with foie gras-all I could say was yummmmyyyy! So much flavors and the quail was well cooked. Hubby got Moules Basquaises (Mussels) with pepper and (this was amazing and I couldn't stop reaching over for some mussels).We decided to share Cote de Doeuf Pour Deuz (I just love all the names of the dishes, they all sound so romantic  lol). This was basically a 40 oz, YES! 40 OZ! Tomahawk rib-eye with two bone marrow! I wasn't a fan of the bone marrow, but my hubby loved it! The meat was nicely cooked to medium, super tender and juicy! I couldn't get enough. We were literally too stuffed like stuffed quail after dinner, but I read their Creme Brûlée was good so there's always room for dessert. Def was a good choice because it satisfied all my cravings! This place is absolutely exceptional and a very romantic low key place for a date night.

I loved mine and it paired great with my entree. For the appetizer, we got the mousse foie gras *though the quail stuffed with foie gras was extremely tempting!! I love foie gras and this dish did not disappoint. They provided more toast to supplement than they did the first visit (almost like they knew doe). And I was a lot more pleased with the ratio of toast to foie gras spread! Great flavor. I'd recommend adding freshly ground pepper to the dish! ~$24 (We actually made some stains from the foie gras appetizer on the tablecloth and the waiter come by and laid another layer on top to cover it!)I got the special of the night on Monday which was the 2 lb lobster. I def underestimated the size of it. you get a whole lobster basically, including the 2 claws which they provide the tools for. Also comes with a side of french fries which were fried so great! def had the seafood flavor with it. Their specials differ every night of the week so I'd suggest looking ahead at the menu to see which day you wanna drop by! ~$48My boyfriend got the 16 oz veal. We were both so surprised how tender the medium rare was! So yummy. Served with enoki mushrooms in a dark brown sauce (the name is escaping me). But really great portion too. My boyfriend was stuffed after his dish! ~$54(?)Then we shared the creme brulee which was also surprisingly huge. I was expected a small circle to share but the dish was a bigger portion. Not too sweet which I appreciate! The manager even stopped by the table to check and see how we were doing. Ambience is romantic and dim w/ high ceilings and feels very spacious.

I really wanted to be greedy and eat the whole plate to myself.Escargots- Super buttery with a hint of garlic and lemon.French Onion Soup- The cheese was nice and gooey and the soup was perfect... not too salty like some places.Main Entree: when you come here you have to order one of their steaksButcher Block- dry-aged filet mignon, hanger steak, and New York strip served on two butchers block with a selection of house sauces. This is great for a large group because you get to try a variety of different cuts.Tomahawk Rib-eye (for two) This was my favorite steak. It has the right amount of fat which makes it super juicy and gives it that rich beefy taste. I would most definitely re-order this steak again.Rack of Lamb- Since we already order several beef steaks, we thought we would switch it up and order the lamb.

I was definitely a tad doubtful if I picked the right place for our special day but given our spur of the moment wedding and no time to find another place we went here. ...and Thank God we did. This is the perfect date-y place. Candles and everything!! Our server Mickey was awesome to say the least. We were seated on the Mezzanine overlooking the bar and kitchen and rest of this cute restaurant. Could not have asked for a better table. Their bar is famous for absinthe cocktails so we went for it. Both the cocktails were delicious and flavors complimented each other well. They were not sickeningly sweet which is a major bum at most places. They bring out complimentary baguette and some French bread along with charcuterie. For the appetizers, we took their escargot and stuffed quail (the quail mainly because I was curious). The snails come out sizzling hot in a garlic butter thing. It melts in your mouth (well, almost, you don't want your snails to be goo anyway). The quail was stuffed with meat (i think) and raisins etc. Overall it had a hint of sweetness and a burst of other flavors. Nicely roasted after that and on a bed of chutney. PERFECT! For the main course, I had the rack of lamb while my guy had the pork chop. I would not change anything about the lamb. Perfectly cooked till medium rare. The bed of vegetables was just cooked right. Scrumptious. If I could order again after going back in time (LOL) I would not order their pork chop. It was a little bland in the middle for me. The veggies and chutney were pretty tasty however. I asked for the crepe suzette as our dessert and again they hit bull's eye with it. I will definitely go back here to celebrate something else :)",1,0,0,Dolonchapa C.,"New York, NY",166,279,869

1.0,11/11/2017,I filed a complaint with the NY Department of Health about Boucherie. This place is covered in grease and it is not safe. The floors and stair steps are so slick. It's like you're ice skating. Grease everywhere. My steak was overcooked and tasted like bacon. Rest of the food greasy. Even salad was greasy. When you first walk in the floor is so slick. Let alone the stairs. It's a safety hazard. My poor wife slipped down the stairs and got hurtAsk any of the poor waiters there. They know how hazardous it isDo not go here. So many other good places in the West Village. Go to Balthazar or Minetta if that's the vibe you're looking for.  This place is trying hard but everything falls way short.They need to replace the flooring and deep clean every day to cut all the grease on the floor. Or else people will keep getting hurt,1,1,1,David B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0
5.0,11/10/2017,"Very beautiful and elegant French restaurant in Greenwich village. The decor is extremely well thought out from the copper pans lining the back wall to the circular light fixtures hanging from the ceiling. I also love the open kitchens so that you can watch the chefs prepare the meals. The restaurant is very spacious and has multiple floors that can accommodate large parties without feeling too tight or getting too loud. The food was exceptional as well. We got the stuffed quail appetizer, the duck leg, rack of lamb, and profiteroles. The stuffed quail might have been my favorite part of the meal- the balsamic glaze was amazing. The only callout that I have is that the duck could have been a little more flavorful. I was told that the lamb was perfect and I also highly recommend the profiteroles for dessert. The cocktails were also well crafted and beautifully presented.  Definitely recommend this place!",0,0,0,Audrey T.,"New York, NY",4,219,4

5.0,11/7/2017,"Brunch at Boucherie, it has a certain ring to it doesn't it? This French brasserie has perfect brunch ambience: soaring ceilings and windows, mostly calm with a little hustle and bustle, and classic brasserie decor.Although Boucherie may allude to meat/steaks, their brunch fare was excellent as well. Pain perdu is a familiar comforting french toast, the bread having soaked up just enough eggy richness, seared to a light crisp exterior, topped with plenty of fresh berries. The Croque Madame was amazing, with really great (huge) slices of bread and the perfect ratio of sauce/bread/ham/cheese. It's hearty and filling but not overly rich. The eggs norwegian is a classic of course, perfectly poached eggs with chewy english muffin and great lox. For anyone going carb-free, the eggs florentine are a great option; just so you know, this does not come with any bread but you could always enjoy with the free bread basket! The artichokes were a nice addition. Pommes frites are a must, fluffy pillowy interior and extra crisp exterior. Order some to share - they are so addictive! Don't miss out on dessert! The lovely manager Zorica sent us some creme brulee and mousse au chocolat, both very classic and both perfectly smooth and creamy, not too sweet. At this point we were all stuffed, but we cleaned the plates.  The service was excellent - much friendlier, attentive, and helpful. A smile goes a long way! Highly recommend. It's perfect for a date as well as a group meals, even with the parents as a a great mid-range price option.

The butcher block can probably feed up to 4 people or more. It was huge and offered a variety of meats. They were all absolutely amazing and tasted delicious!

5.0,11/4/2017,"Really cute restaurant and perfect for date night (dimmer lighting which makes photos harder ha but good ambience and quiet enough Sunday night for good conversation)! Food was great (see below for more detail) but highlight was definitely the service. From the restaurant manager down to the wait staff, everyone was really prompt/attentive and fun. In terms of the food- We ordered heavier entrees so went with salad for apps to balance it out in theory. Otherwise would normally had tried the foie gras or escargot. Expected the apps to be small but salads were actually really substantial! I got the salade d'auvergne which was really refreshing. Perfect amount of viniagrette so that it didn't feel too heavy. The little bit of sweetness from the apple and candied walnuts were welcome as well. I actually also enjoyed the Brussels sprouts salad my boyfriend ordered, but it's definitely heartier (warm, with a really well-executed slightly-runny egg on top). We are not big eaters so were already a little full going into the entrees...of which are also pretty substantial. The steak we got was amazing (they recommended it). It was the faux filet bercy (dry-aged bone-in ny strip) - medium rare. Was the highlight of our dinner! And we took some to go (what we couldn't finish); still good the next day. The other entree Pot eu Feu has a beautiful presentation and portions were generous. However, it was just a little too salty for my taste (will go with steak next time, but was worth a try given the colder weather that night). I at least have a second stomach for dessert, and we got some off menu (for now) item - think it was pistachio ice cream which they cover in a chocolate sauce/shell at your table.

5.0,11/3/2017,"I returned to Boucherie recently to celebrate a special occasion and the experience was nothing short of spectacular. Our waiter, Micky/Mickey/Miki/Micki???, had the best eyebrows in the gig and brought his A-game on when it came to remembering all our appetizers, add-ons, and entrees. As we delve into an area of great controversy, and you may whole-heartedly disagree, I still find the hidden star of this restaurant to be their 'Profiteroles'. The warm and crispy puff sandwiching a decadent and cold vanilla bean scoop, drizzled with dark chocolate...every bite a warm and fuzzy bliss.I didn't order steak at my pevious visit and considering it's what they're known for, we ordered the YOLO-est meal possible. The 'Butcher Block' with its three different cuts, was a 3-lb meat fest. I highly recommend this spread for larger parties because you get to enjoy the best bits of beef. If you prefer a lighter cut and something less smoky in flavor, the 'Côte de Bœf Pour Deux' comes highly recommended. All this protein glory was more than enough for our party of 5.All I have to say is, GET THE 'Pommes Frites' and 'Gratin de Pommes de Terre'; Boucherie knows how to cook their potatoes!The 'Anti Douleur' was a winner as a cocktail and slayed as a mocktail. The pineapple coconuttiness was a beautiful blend and my favorite kind of combo. Keep those mocktails coming.See you soon, Boucherie.

My party was 5ppl and we're all HUNGRY :P I came here once before and wanted to come back mainly for the Foie Gras Mousse which was so memorable, literally dreaming about how smooth and rich it taste!   So we order TWO foie gras mousse, a escargot, steak tartare and French onion soup. Everything was delicious, the flavor was on point but I just wish there was more cheese in the French onion soup. On to the entrees... this is where the feast began. We shared everything family style since we all wanted to taste a little bit of everything. Got the following:-       Butcher block-       Tomahawk Rib-eye w/bone marrow J-       Roasted rack of lamb-       Side dishes: fries, potato au gratin and ratatouille My fav was the Tomahawk Rib-eye, you can just taste the tenderness of the meat. Dessert we had profiteroles, crème brulee and the mousse au chocolat The best profiteroles I had and I love the taste of the vanilla bean ice cream. Crème brulee is a favorites of mine so I had to order it. As for the chocolate, this is one rich cup of chocolate.

The quality of the sourdough and baguette was on point, something often looked over. The chicken liver pâté was outstanding, very generous portion, and is made completely in house. Very smooth, delicate fat balance and nice seasoning. The steak tartare was a very generous portion as well. The cut of meat was clearly thoroughly trimmed and selected well, wonderful quail egg yolk on top. The roasted quail absolutely melted in the mouth.

From the inventive cocktails to the dessert, it was delightful in every way.   The drink menu is really special. They have a big selection of absinthe drinks. We opted for a ""Provence martini"" with lavender, vodka & absinthe, and the house Sazerac: whiskey, absinthe, and Peychaud's bitters.    There were lots of rich French appetizers; pate, escargots, etc., but we preferred a couple of nice green salads, one with arugula, the other brussels sprouts, each with a nice tangy dressing.    Our entrees were cod and steak au poivre, each cooked perfectly. I like it medium-rare, and there was lots of pink in the middle, so that's good. It came with delicious fries, but I couldn't finish them all.   We ended sharing a chocolate mousse, then got coffees. The coffees came in the French manner, after the dessert. The server was very busy, but still gave us a lot of attention.

We started with two drinks and the stuffed quail. I got the cocktail that had pineapple in it which was sweet and refreshing. It was strong but without the alcoholic taste. The stuffed quail was cooked very well, especially the bits around the bone that has caramelized.For my main, I got the veal porterhouse and my boyfriend got the filet mignon both cooked to medium rare. Of the two, I actually preferred the filet. It was so tender, juicy and flavorful. The veal porterhouse was good and I definitely loved the soaked sweetbread and mushrooms that came with it, but the steak was a little too dry.For dessert, we shared the creme brûlée which was the highlight of the meal.

3.0,10/29/2017,"My experience at Boucherie was a bit ""clunky"" to say the least. The staff was nice and the food was decent, but I wouldn't necessarily jump for the chance to come back. The main reason is because despite the staff being well-trained and friendly enough, they somehow lost our order. That said, I'm generally keen to forgive because brunch is busy and things happen. I just prefer people to be honest and not to tell me that the food will now be out in 5 minutes (after retaking my order) when it actually takes 15 minutes to make. In total this means, I waited about an hour and fifteen minutes for my meal. Anyways, I won't harp on this fact but it did effect the overall experience.

5.0,10/20/2017,"We came to Boucherie for dinner last weekend, and even though I've walked by this part of 7th Avenue many times while I have been living in Manhattan, it never occurred to me to stop by here for a meal. With a wide-open interior with a roof that harkens to something a bit more hipster you'd find over the East River, the old-school tiled floor and the close wooden table seating speaks to the Parisian influence that infuses Boucherie, and it's a nice touch between the Old World ambiance with a very muted New World sensibility. We were seated on the raised seating area above the main floor, giving us a nice view of the dining area, the open kitchen (where there is counter seating) and the retro-style bar. Service was quick but not too prompt, allowing us to soak in the setting and the ambiance between bites. The drink menu is alright - short on the beers (which is more of an American obsession anyways), but with an extensive wine list (I didn't sample) and delicious cocktails (I really enjoyed the citrus-infused drink over crushed ice that I had).The food, probably unsurprisingly, tilts towards classical French, but it's easy to say with a straight face that the food is absolutely divine here. The kitchen doesn't go out of its way to do anything too fancy, but the simplicity and the deliciousness of the execution would no doubt impress even those back in France. We started off sharing two appetizers - the foie gras and the steak tartare. The bread with the tartare was a bit too crunchy for my liking, but I enjoyed the moistness of the tartare (sometimes I have found European tartares to be more on the drier side) and the fulsome flavor of the meat. The foie came as a (nearly) cone-shaped terrine, and wow was it good - very creamy, particularly accentuated when paired with the warm, soft brioche slices it was served with. I really liked the sweetened / pickled onions it came with, as both the sweetness and bitterness came through, serving a dual purpose with only one additional food item. The mains, arguably, were even better. You can order off the regular menu or the specials; I kept it simple: center-cut filet done medium, with a thin, circular slice of truffle butter that melted all over the top. What a steak - the truffle melted into the meat makes for a divinely delicious bite each time, and the perfect crisp on the steak gave it a nice texture that belied just how succulent and juicy each bite was. My wife's rack of lamb was also quite good - not the best preparation I have had, and at medium-rare, it seemed a little undercooked IMO - but the flavor was still very good. We finished off our meal with the chocolate mousse, which was a bit of a heavy choice but was creamy and delicious, especially with the dense dollop of whipped cream on the top.Now that I know what Boucherie holds, I definitely plan on coming back again. The ambiance is really nice - especially when the windows are open (that season is coming to an end soon, unfortunately), and the food is fantastic, with the meats clearly done at a very high level.

The restaurant itself is beautiful, with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, very attentive and polite staff and delicious food/drinks.Before the appetizers even came out, we were given a bread basket with a side of olive oil, olives, peppers, prosciutto and onions (free of charge) - amazing! For appetizer, we started with the cauliflower soup which was very tasty. This was the special of the night but really should be on the menu to stay! For main we had an order of the steak frites and the truffle/mushroom ravioli. Both were phenomenal. The steak was extremely tasty, with an excellent sauce and fries on the side. The ravioli was covered in truffle shavings - enough said! Finally, for dessert we had the chocolate mousse. Must get. As for drinks, the wine and cocktail selection was very extensive with plenty of options for whatever you feel.Definitely a must try restaurant and when you're done here, try Olio e Piú.",0,0,0,Christopher S.,"New York, NY",13,127,72
5.0,10/15/2017,"So after my unfortunate experience, I was contacted by the manager who apologized profusely on behalf of the server. I get it; not everyone is cognizant of racial microagressions, so I guess I'm just glad he would know better for the future, when another group of vaguely asian girls come into the restaurant.I came back for dinner, and it's still just as pretty as it is for brunch. We were seated on the upper level, and the space really is beautiful and perfect for a date night. We had a couple of cocktails; I can't recall the names, but I had an absinthe-based one that I loved. Strongly recommend.For food, we ordered the escargot and scallops as starters, and they were both delicious. The escargot was buttery, garlicky, and decadent. My friend and I couldn't help but dip our bread into the sauce, it was so delicious. The scallops were fresh and cooked perfectly. Solid choices.We then had the steak tartare and their cut of the week. The steak tartar was by far our favorite dish. It was different from other kinds that I had; not as oily and rich, but light and refreshing. The meat melted in our mouths; we ordered the full serving, which was a very smart decision. The cut of the week was a little undercooked (ordered it medium rare, but came out a tiny bit rarer than preferred), but still good. I would opt for the porterhouse or tomahawk with bone marrow (if you're in a bigger group) next time, which are regularly on their menu. We had the creme brulee for dessert, and it tasted exactly like how a creme brulee should taste. Nothing crazy innovative, but sometimes, that's not what you need. I had a much better experience this time around, and would recommend this place for a night out. Wonderful ambiance and stellar french food.",1,0,0,Evangeline I.,"New York, NY",257,122,211
5.0,10/15/2017,"UPDATE- October 14,2017. We were invited back by the manager and decided to go for our anniversary. This was a very different experience. They seem like a well oiled machine now.  The food was always outstanding and last night they did not disappoint. We were asked where we would like to sit and we chose outside (it was beautiful out and most people were outside). Our waiter Martin was very attentive, as was the busboy. He was also well versed in the food and the pairings of side dishes and wines. His suggestions were perfect. The filet mignon and New York strip were ridiculously good. We gave them another chance and we are so glad we did. Thank you Boucherie - we will most certainly be back!!",0,0,0,Sharon B.,"Town of Hempstead, Long Island, NY",0,13,0
4.0,10/13/2017,"This place is beautiful, classy and romantic, but a bit loud inside. I love the decor. The waiters were great- always refilling; food took a little while to make. Pouple Provencal ($21)- 3.5/5 This was good but not as good as Peach Shrimp & Crab restaurant. I think the preparation is quite similar. However, this is one of the biggest ""baby"" octopus I've had by far. I usually don't like baby octopus only big ones. Cabillaud Roti ($35)- 4/5 This was the seared cod. Overall the cod was a bit flavorless but with the sauce and everything it was much better. The tomatoes were alright, I don't think they're organic though and I only like organic tomatoes. The zucchini and yellow squash was actually delicious, and I'm usually not a big fan of these two veggies. Saumon a L'unilateral ($31)- 3.5/5 We asked for well done and of course they bring it back raw. So we sent it back and it was much better the second time. The salmon was okay, nothing mind blowing. It was a really simple dish. Pommes Frites ($10)- 4/5 Great fries that they serve with ketchup. Portion is decent but the price is sorta ridiculous, $10 for fries.",15,7,11,Jessica D.,"Brooklyn, NY",512,436,1192

5.0,10/12/2017,"I've always passed by this restaurant, so I was excited to try it with my friends. The place was clean and sleek. You could tell they had nice ambience as you entered. The inside has a huge mirror which makes the place look very large, not crowded (probably because slightly higher end), and very clean while maintaining the classy, authentic French resto look.My friends and I ended up choosing Butcher's Block which includes three steaks and bone marrow. We ordered some sides and a bottle of wine. They service was very professional and attentive. After serving, they kept the wine to keep the temperature. We appetizers were very good. We got Cesar salad, beet salad, and escargot -- all very fresh and tasty. The steak platter was exquisite. The presentation was very mouthwatering and exciting! It was three types of rare-medium steaks sliced, two very thick bone marrow, and two delicious sides (mushroom medley and pomme gratis/potatoes). We got another bottle of wine.We were so full and happy with the food and service and good company, and then to make it even better, they came over and surprised us with two desserts, creme brulee, and chocolate mouse. It seemed freshly made and very tasty! I'm definitely a fan!",1,0,0,Esther J.,"Brooklyn, NY",233,400,490
4.0,10/11/2017,"The decor of this place is gorgeous! It is a perfect setting for an intimate dinner date. My friend and took our other friend, the Birthday Girl out for a treat here. Excellent service started upon arrival! Our hostess, Cynthia :) was very welcoming and friendly! Complimentary bread and butter with olives, eggplant, artichoke in olive oil and topped with cured meat. The butter was sooo good! For appetizers, we started with the Mousse De Foie Gras and the Steak Tartare. Mousse De Foie Gras had foie gras, onions, and red wine reduction sauce to go with it. This dish is no small deal, it was really good! I loved the flavors of the red wine reduction. I really enjoyed the flavors coming together as I spread it on top of the bread. Steak Tartare came with a quail egg yolk to mix it in. The meat was mixed with parsley, shallots, and capers. It was flavorful. Between these two, I liked the Mousse De Foie Gras a bit better. We got the Saumon a L'unilateral which is a grilled salmon dish with asparagus and baby spinach. This was my favorite entree. I loved how perfectly seasoned the salmon was and it was cooked to perfection in medium rare as we requested. Salmon was really tender as well. Next, we had the Duck Confit with truffle potatoes. I liked the crispy pieces of duck skin along with the field greens that it came with. We also got the Steak & Frites. This was a sirloin piece with peppercorn sauce with a side of frites which were crispy on the outside and tasted a bit like mashed potatoes on the inside. In my opinion, I think the pomme frites resembles Burger King fries and I mean it in a positive way! Creme Brulee was awesome! It is one of my favorite desserts and I am a harsh critic. The version here is almost perfect in texture. The custard was so soft but a bit liquid-y and it is not overly sweet. Caramelized sugar top was perfect, not too hard and not too soft neither. This is probably my second favorite in NYC. As I mentioned above, service is excellent here! The staff members are there to refill our water and bread basket almost immediately. They were prompt in serving all dishes in a timely manner. Reservation process was simple and easy online via Yelp or OpenTable. Definitely will be back for the outdoor seating before it gets cold!",12,4,7,Cynthia D.,"Queens, NY",498,888,6834
5.0,10/8/2017,"As the French would say, everything was parfait!Came here to celebrate our anniversary on a Saturday evening. I'd recommend making a reservation ahead of time, just to be safe and definitely if you have a large group. There's seating both inside and outside, extremely spacious and clean. Moreover, decor is tastefully done with wooden tables, high ceiling and just the right amount of plants scattered around. We sat on the booth, right by the walk-through windows where some diners were seated outside. It was the perfect spot to watch the sunset while enjoying our meal. They also have a very extensive and impressive bar, drinks beautifully laid out against their large mirror on the wall that are lined with white tiles. There's a romantic vibe to the restaurant, especially during the evening with their hanging lights, vintage French posters, candles and music softly playing in the background.First up, drinks. I asked our server to surprise us with virgin beverages. To my surprise, he showed up with refreshing, fruity drinks mixed with pineapples, coconut and oranges. Loved it. There's also complimentary bread, butter and a small plate of prosciutto, an olive, mushrooms and a tuna stuffed tomato. We munched on this while waiting for our appetizers, which included the escargot and steak tartare. Before I delve in any further with the apps, I want to give a shoutout to the tuna stuffed tomato. I think it deserves some recognition because it was bomb dot com. Just cut it up, put it on top of your bread and take a bite. You'll know exactly what I mean.Escargot ($21): Girrrrrl. Talk about tender, chewy, buttery goodness. It comes out sizzlin' hot with generous amount of snails in each pod, all swimming in butter. Take that complementary bread you just got earlier, dip it in that melted butter, scoop the seasoning from a pod and spread it on the bread. Now add a snail on top and voila! You'll find yourself with your eyes closed and a grin on your face. I just kept shaking my head left and right while chewing and yes, with my eyes closed just savoring each bite. Magnifique! Would order again, fasho.Steak Tartare ($21/$27): It was perfectly seasoned, diced and beautifully presented with a quail egg on top, three pieces of crunchy toast and leafy greens dressed in some sort of a vinaigrette that complemented perfectly with flavors of salty and sour. I'd recommend putting a layer of the leafy greens on the toast and spreading a generous amount of the tartare for that perfect bite.For the main dish, we got the cut of the week--a 16 oz 120 days dry-aged Pat LaFrieda bone in New York strip ($64). Why, isn't that a mouthful. Yes, your mouth will literally be full of of that smokiness and magic spice that they smothered on that steak. A perfect medium rare, this will put fireworks in your mouth. The other main dish, filet mignon (also in medium rare) with truffle butter ($48) was pure magic. Take a piece of the mignon and stab a slice of their onion bulb with a bit of spinach with your fork and you'll be on the verge of tears. Tears of joy, that is.We got two desserts, Semifredo ($12) and Creme Bruelee ($10). Our server told us that it was the first day they were having semifredo as their dessert special, just trying it out to see if they want to put it on their main dessert menu. I'd say yes please. The main flavors were crushed pistachio mixed with the semi-frozen whipped cream over a layer of brownie and hot fudge poured on top. I noticed there were six main desserts on the menu (creme bruelee, cream puff, tarte tatin, chocolate mousse, crepes suzette, ice cream/sorbet selection) and the only option for chocolate lovers would be the mousse. Well, I got good news for you. Get their semifredo and you won't be disappointed. The server will pour hot fudge over it as your mouth waters in anticipation. You'll be surprised that your mouth is even watering after all the apps and main dish you just inhaled. As for the creme bruelee, it's a classic. Presented beautifully with fresh raspberries and strawberries, it has the perfect layer of hard caramel on top--not too thick or thin. Both desserts were a sizable portion and I think we would've been fine with ordering just one, only because we were extremely stuffed at this point. Nonetheless, I'm so glad we tried both despite all the waddling that occurred thereafter.Not sure you can tell by now (if you read this far, gimme a pound) but I'm a fan. Their meats are on point. I'd get their escargot and filet mignon again in a heartbeat--pretty sure I'm going to dream about them. Service is exceptional. The manager checked in on us and we felt cared for throughout the entire course of our meal. Also, I can't remember the last time I spent over two hours at a restaurant. We literally walked in during daylight and saw the sunset until it was pitch dark outside.Overall, need I say more? This is one of the best French restaurants I've been to and you can bet that I'll be back.",7,6,7,Christine S.,"Queens, NY",201,181,1561
5.0,10/7/2017,"Several very amazing things happened here when my bf and I came to eat dinner last night:1) BF hates hates hates drinking. He stays trying tho. He tries one cocktail every time we go out, inevitably hates it halfway through, and enlists me to finish it (np love!). Last night he orders the Anti Doleour, takes two sips, and announces that he hates it -- he learned last night that he doesn't like rum or absinthe. I offer up my own drink as I normally do, which in this case is the Belle Epoque. I fully expect him to hate it and leave both drinks for me, like usual. (We obviously have a great relationship; I always have a designated driver and he always has a garbage dump of a gf to happily take all his leftovers.*) Imagine my surprise when his face lights up and says it's the best drink he's ever had. He tells me it tastes like lemonade but way better. Of course it's better! It has alcohol! And of course I know it's better! That was mine! Seriously considering giving this establishment 1 star for having such amazing drinks that my alcohol-hating boyfriend drank a whole entire cocktail on his own. Last night I was torn between celebrating because now I know where to take him if I want someone to drink with, and lamenting my lost Belle Epoque.2) BF is the pickiest eater in the world. Even at the best restaurants he always has something to say about the food. He tentatively agreed to try the escargot with me. When it arrived, he hesitated to try it. When he took a bite, he paused, looked at me, and just nodded his head. It was as if he suddenly understood all the secrets in the known universe, thanks to these snails.3) BF is the pickiest eater in the world. Even at the best steak restaurants he always has something to say about the steak. It's always too tough, too overcooked for his taste, too undercooked for his taste (is there such a thing?), unseasoned, too seasoned, too this, or too that. I was nervous when he picked the steak frites. I chose the restaurant and hyped the steak up so much that I worried it wouldn't be to his standards. But believe me when I say that in all the years I've known him I've never seen him as quiet as when he was eating that steak. It must've been good? I'm not sure, he couldn't even get a word out.4) BF is not a big dessert person. I, on the other hand, have a huge sweet tooth. For dessert, we ordered the profiteroles. We were told that it came with three of them to an order, so we placed 2 orders of profiteroles because three didn't sound like enough. We were horribly wrong. A single order would have been enough for two people to share. After we got our two plates each with three very healthy sized profiteroles, we stared at each other. What the heck were we going to do with all these profiteroles?? We won't even be able to finish them! we said. We wasted money on dessert we won't eat! but, jk we both wiped our plates clean. Even the Boy Who Hates Chocolate finished every last bite.5) We were the only people of color in the restaurant that night, as far as we could tell, at least for the 1.5hrs we were there. Normally this makes us uncomfortable and worry that we might be treated differently. It can and has happened, unfortunately, more times and more often than we'd like to admit. But we very quickly realized that Boucherie is not one of these places, and by the end of the meal the idea that it ever could be was very silly and ridiculous. The service the entire night was the best I've ever experienced in a restaurant before in my life. A little bit of condensation from my drink left the tiniest drop of water on the table and when we were being given our forks and steak knives, it was wiped away immediately. How did our server even see it was there? I don't know, I don't care, I love him and his meticulous attention to tiny water rings and bread crumbs.

4.0,10/5/2017,"After my prior review, which was less than stellar, the restaurant reached out and offered to host us for another dinner.  We accepted and was delighted by the results.  We picked the same week (Wed) night to make a fair comparison.  Unlike the previous visit, the restaurant was rather full, and the music was subdued.  We started with a Caesar Salad and the Onion Soup.....classic dishes which did not disappoint.  We both had the Poulet Roti, which again is classic and was juicy and crispy.  My husband substituted the mash potatoes for the French Fries, which again was crispy on the outside and smooth and creamy on the inside.  For dessert we shared a Profiterole....very good.  Also, the service was excellent.  Based on our second visit, our first visit was an off night, and I retract my former review and would recommend anyone visit this for an excellent French Bistro meal.",0,0,0,Kenneth Q.,"New York, NY",14,24,0

It was a great creamy texture and the onions were the perfect sweet touch to pair it with. For our entrees, we had the salmon and the steak frites. The salmon was cooked to perfection and was not too salty with a hint of lemon. The NY Strip was just the right temperature at medium, super juicy with the peppercorn sauce. Also, how can anyone pass up crunchy fries? Everyone seems to love the creme brulee here and I must agree. The top of the brulee had the perfect crunch. We also had the chocolate mousse which was decadent and rich. At the end of this meal I was super full! All of the servers were very attentive and made sure everything was good with us.

5.0,10/3/2017,"Came here with a friend for dinner last night. Overall, the food and service were all amazing. My only complaint is that I didn't really feel a French twist on the food, however, in no way does that take away from the quality. We ordereed a salade de choux de buxelles - basically a brussel sprout salad. Let me tell you, those were the best brussel sprouts I've ever had. It was mixed with some other greens, but it was just infused with such flavor, I would say that this is a must get. We also ordered the saint jacques a la provencale - or basically scallops. My complaint, is that there wasn't enough (although I was extremely full by the end of the meal, so maybe it was). It comes with four LARGE half pieces of scallops that were bursting with flavor. They were cooked to perfection and were extremely tender and just melted in your mouth. It also came with some kind of roasted tomato/pepper combo that was just to die for. For our actual entrees we got the steak frites. The steak was seared to perfection and was perfectly cooked. I loved the flavor on it. And man oh man, the fries! I could eat those all day! We also got the lamb chops. Personally, I liked the steak a lot more. The lamb chops were a bit balsamic for my taste, but my friend said that she loved the lamb more. Either way, both entrees were amazing. The service here was also great. Almost too great! At any time there was always someone at our table, refilling our water, wiping away crumbs etc. The servers are also extremely friendly and loved to make jokes with us, especially when my friend was taking pictures of the food. Overall, a great place to come. If you're trying to save money, a good recommendation I would have is maybe try to come and split a bunch of appetizers. Man those dishes were so good.

2.0,10/2/2017,"I first discovered Boucherie via their beautiful food photography on Instagram!  This past Saturday the stars aligned: I had a free night and was craving steak!  We were warmly greeted upon our admittedly very late arrival, and were quickly seated upstairs.  We placed our food order: brussels sprout salad and the 16 oz dry aged bone in strip with a side of au poivre sauce and fries.  The sommelier recommended a fantastic Bordeaux, and we were off to a great start!  At this point I requested a new table as my chair was over a loose floorboard and was really uncomfortable every time someone walked by. The manager kindly reseated us downstairs at a fantastic table.They brought over a small complimentary aperitivo along with the bread.  Unfortunately as I was eating an olive, I found a very long piece of hair.  I eat out often and understand that these things happen from time to time, so we decide to carry on.  The salad arrived overdressed and personally I found it uninspired.   The steak disappointingly arrived cold, and the au poivre sauce was so sweet I had to ask the waiter if this was indeed the correct sauce.  Upon finishing our steak, the waiter informed they were sending out some complimentary desserts (which was very nice of them). The creme brule was good, however the profiteroles were amazing! The service during our visit, while polite, was very disorganized.  Our initial waiter did not ask how we we wanted the steak prepared, and was confused when we asked.  We had to ask several times for extra plates as we were sharing, and upon being informed of desserts we weren't asked if we wanted coffee or anything else.  The sommelier told us the wine was ""Eighty-something,"" but was $90 on the check.  Individually I could probably look past everything except for the steak; there are just way too many great bistros/steakhouses in NYC where bad steak at this price point is just not acceptable. I really wanted to love Boucherie, unfortunately it just doesn't deliver.  The positives: great looking venue (take a moment to appreciate the mirrors with beautiful rounded edges), the wine was amazing as were the profiteroles!",0,0,0,Pazel M.,"New York, NY",1,45,8

5.0,10/1/2017,"Boucherie is an authentic French restaurant with beautiful interiors and high ceilings. Located in the heart of West Village with ample street parking and public transportation options. Even offers happy hour at the bar for cocktail and wine selections. Opened in December 2016, Boucherie is a great addition to the eclectic food scene in West Village. I've had French cuisine a few times, but never have been impressed. Often times, it is too salty or buttery. Boucherie is neither of those and leaves a positive, lasting impression. Recommend for date nights or even company dinners - ample seating space!APPS*Octopus: Cooked so well! Generous portions of octopus prepared amazingly in a marinara type sauce. Whole chunks of tomato well balances the octopus. The octopus melts in your mouth - so heavenly. *Scallop: more memorable than expected. Recommended by our server. Very juicy and tender scallops with delicious garlic sauce with a kick of spicyness to it. The tomato sauce balances the scallops wonderfully. Definitely recommend if you are looking for a seafood app. ENTREES*120days dry aged NY strip (cut of the week): ONE OF THE BEST STEAKS. Dinosaur is extremely picky with his steak and he LOVED this. Arguably the best NY strip we had. You know when steak has been properly aged when you put it in your mouth and that flavor of smokiness and spice just lingers in your mouth. This is exactly that. Very, very impressed. I wish the high end steak specialty restaurants would learn from Boucherie in how they age their steaks. Two thumbs up! *Veal porterhouse: another melt in my mouth cut. Cooked perfectly per my request 'medium' porterhouse comprised of half filet mignon and half NY strip. Comes with a generous portion, but not overwhelmingly huge. Seasoning was perfect and I appreciated that it was not salty! Comes with enokie demi glaze on the side, which adds bit of more flavor and makes this dish special in the 'Boucherie' way. DESSERT*Profiteroles: my goodness, what a perfect way to end our meal. For those are new to profiteroles, it is a creme-puff filled with various fillings. Boucherie fills it with vanilla ice cream and tops it off chocolate syrup. The pastry is very airy, not too dense. The ice cream and chocolate syrup is well balanced, not overly sweet. Just when I thought the night cannot get any better after that steak, Boucherie's profiteroles amazed us.Overall, fantastic experience from the Boucherie team. Very impressive range of food from seafood to meats with innovative cocktail selections. Service is also top notch as our waiter stopped by many times to make sure we are having a true Boucherie night.

Last time the food was delicious and this time around it was even better!  I still can't get over how beautiful the interior is! We started off with French onion soup - can't get any more classic than this. We also had the Poulpe Provencale (baby octopus with potatoes, tomatoes & olives). It's very flavorful & tender. For entree: Don't miss out on the Steak Frites Au Poivre (it's an amazing Pat LaFrieda NY strip with a delicious peppercorn cream sauce with French fries) for $45. We also tried the 16 oz 120 days dry aged Pat LaFrieda bone-in NY strip for $64.  Both meats were cooked medium rare to perfection!

We were seated further into the restaurant this time, up on a balcony, which was absolutely lovely as we were able to appreciate the bustle of the restaurant. Our waiter was so awesome and friendly, and was intent on making us feel welcomed.Escargot - Honestly will probably never come here and NOT order this. It was just as good as the first time - still sizzling when it came to our table and so flavorful. GET THIS!Cote de Bouf Pour Deux - BLOWN AWAY. Seriously, this was not only the most beautiful steak I've ever seen, but the most tender, phenomenal piece of meat I've ever eaten. We ordered medium rare and cutting through it was like slicing through butter. I cannot think of a different way to describe it. It's been a few weeks and I still think about it from time to time, to be honest. Came with a huge bone and two large pieces of bone marrow which was so creamy and indulgent. At a $155 price point, this dish probably isn't your average weekday order, but for an occasion, this is 100% worth!While I understand the attentiveness was a little more exaggerated than it would normally be, as the staff was probably aware that this visit was at the invitation of the manager, I would be  more than excited to come back again!!",4,1,3,Jane Q.,"Brooklyn, NY",166,58,136

I decided to take my girlfriend here on a date one night after healing from my stomach virus, I was craving a huge meal, preferably a huge steak!

4.0,9/25/2017,"Update: After my first review, I was contacted by the manager of the restaurant with an extremely generous invitation to return to try Boucherie again. It seems the photo shoot I witnessed was a one-time event that unfortunately got thrown off schedule and encroached upon the dinner rush--even the chef was upset by it.I returned to the restaurant this weekend and received attentive service and enjoyed a top-notch meal. I do think the restaurant is so busy and large that it's still working out service kinks: our drinks came after our appetizer BUT that was the only fault I could possibly find. Our server made useful recommendations and was on top of every other possible need for the remainder of the meal. (I'm a former server/bartender and occasionally mystery-shop hospitality providers so I can't help but take note of these things!) Most importantly, this time I ordered from the boucher menu and I have to say I think premium cuts of meat are the runaway strength of this restaurant. I am still thinking about the crust on my filet mignon. It was that good. And a better value than the city's top steakhouses. Color me impressed. My date had a similar opinion of his lamb chops. And our desserts were delicious and very well-sized (read: we should have ordered one and shared). The manager and staff really went above and beyond to make up for our previous experience, and I think this attentiveness is a boon to their business and a rare find in NYC.

With its barn like space and subway tiles, it's a bit like eating in the middle of a train station (but a nice one like Grand Central). The food was okay.

5.0,9/18/2017,"Wow.  What a turnaround. My experience at Boucherie tonight was exceptional.  A far cry from the initial experience I had when they first opened, I am happy to edit my review to accurately represent what Boucherie is all about.  It is clear I dined there on an off night where they must have been still trying to find their groove.  Well, they've certainly found it! The restaurant has a low-light charming feel with plenty of dark wood and wall sized mirrors that brasseries are known for.  On a warm fall evening the doors were wide open with outdoor seating extending the main dining room.  We sat inside, but faced outside in perfect Paris bistro fashion.  The service was personal and attentive, and our waiter listened to what we like and made recommendations that matched. Their Foie Gras appetizer was noting short of PERFECTION. Served with grilled toasts and a slowly simmered onion compote in red wine port sauce that tasted like slow cooked cherries. Brilliant. Next up was the tuna tartare that was served with a pairing of diced beets and avocado mousse that gave this common dish a unique personality.  The beets brightened the dish while the creamy avocado mousse brought it all together beautifully.  Our waiter made consistent tactful rounds to check on us and ensure our wine glasses never emptied. For the main course, we opted for the Côte de Boeuf for two, a 40-oz Tomahauk bone-in rib-eye that is making my mouth water as I write this.  Let me be clear; this is the reason you come here.  The quality and cut of the meat was superb.  Cooked to perfection, even to our very specific request to have it be on the rarer side of medium-rare. This piece de resistance was accompanied by two very generous pieces of marrow in its bone; topping our steak with this and the bone marrow bordelaise sauce felt like pure sin.  But we didn't care.  Each bite was rich, succulent and divine.  The juices on our plate were perfect for drowning our fries in.  To cleanse our palates with a hint of sweet we shared a perfect little Tarte Tatin à la mode with a port wine.  Wow.  Perfect end to a perfect evening.  As a frequent visitor of Pastis for years, I'm thrilled to have found its replacement.  For an approachable yet elegant, memorable dining experience, Boucherie should be on top of your list!",1,0,0,Dahlia B.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,6,6
3.0,9/17/2017,"Ever since my Europe trip a few months ago, I've been craving my French cuisine. We came here in a Sunday night 30mins earlier than the reservation and they were able to accommodate us right away. The ambience of the restaurant was very nice and reminded us very much of our French experiences. We order the Tomahawk Ribeye $155 with the bone marrow, however, they were out of the bone marrow so only served us the Ribeye. I was bummed out for sure especially because I know my boyfriend really enjoys bone marrow. Presentation was great however, the meat is no longer hot. By the time we tried the meat it was already cold because of the presentation they had to slice the meat up which drops the meat temperature rather fast. For some it doesn't matter but for our couple, we do not like our food cool/cold. Good quality meat but lacks flavor. One thing that helped the dish was the sauce at the bottom of the pan! We drizzle and drop our steak into the sauce  to add flavor. We also had a French Onion soup...it was okay. Not the best I've had. I wish it was a little more cheesy and a little less burnt flavor. I can only review the food based on what I had. Overall the restaurant itself was great but the food I ordered wasn't as great as I wished it would had been.",0,0,0,DD S.,"Huntsville, TX",3,54,98
5.0,9/17/2017,"We enjoyed a lovely dinner tonight at Boucherie. The outside seating is very pretty, with vines crawling up the front. We enjoyed warm and attentive service the entire night. Our waiter took excellent care of us, recommending cocktails and checking up on us throughout the evening.For appetizers, we had the escargot and the beet and goat cheese dish. My husband raved about the escargot and said it was one of the best preparations of it he has had, either here or in France. The beet dish with goat cheese was refreshing and pleasant and the pistachios that accompanied it took it to another level. The bread served with the meal was also very good.For entrees, we had the burger and the vegetarian mushroom ravioli. The burger was beautifully cooked and served with absolutely perfect fries. The mushroom ravioli had a lovely hint of truffle which was not overpowering and really enhanced the flavor of the dish. For dessert, we ordered the creme brûlée and, like rest of our meal, it did not disappoint. Overall, we had a wonderful evening here with great service and delicious food.

4.0,9/16/2017,"I had a very lovely time at Boucherie. It's a great place if you want to celebrate a birthday or anniversary, catch up with an old friend, or go on a date. The floor plan is really open and spacious, and they have a table that can accommodate a party of 16 if needed. I had a wonderful waiter who was friendly and attentive, but not overbearing. And despite how inappropriate this might sound, there are two waiters who are just down right HOT. My boyfriend pointed one of them out to me and noted how handsome he was. Moments later, I see a second gentleman stand next to (they sorta have the same look), and I go ""OMG, there's two of them!"" But onto why you're really here - the food.We ordered the foie gras, escargot, and veal. The two of us could barely finish it all. We honestly could have stopped at our appetizers and been happy. The food is really rich and so we were thankful we had some sense to share our entree. If there is foie gras and escargot on the menu, I can't help but order it every single time. My gold standard for foie gras is the nigiri foie gras from Au Pied de Cochon in Montreal. I have yet to experience anything as good in the US, and this time proved to be the same. The foie gras is good, but certainly not my favorite and not something I would order again and again. I was really impressed with their escargot. It is served HOT and already out of its shell. I thought they were very generous in the amount they give, making this dish really worth the $20-ish you're paying for it. The reason why I am giving Boucherie 4 stars is because of the veal. Know that I am that person in the group who orders her steak MEDIUM WELL. I have only recently started to order my steaks medium, but even then, I'm pretty hesitant to do so. I just always grew up eating steak well-done and didn't know any better until I got in my late 20's when I could afford a steak dinner on my own. Since my boyfriend and I were sharing, I wanted him to be able to eat what he liked, and so we ordered the veal (which wouldn't have been my first choice) and we got it medium rare. And it was no joke delicious. I do recommend that you share this entree cause the portion size is so huge. My two regrets are:1. Not being able to order the bone marrow. I saw a bunch of pictures on Yelp of the bone marrow and wanted to try it so badly. But it only comes as part of an entree that is $150. Yeah... no thanks. It's not my birthday so I'm gonna have to pass.2. Not having enough room for dessert. We were so incredibly stuffed that even I, the girl with the 2nd stomach for desserts, had no room left over for creme brûlée. Womp womp.Overall, Boucherie is a really great place to go to if you want something fancy or are want to splurge. It's price tag is a bit a bit too high for me to go there on any sort of regular basis. But the food is great and you won't be disappointed.",2,1,1,Lisa L.,"Brookline, MA",171,121,297

5.0,9/14/2017,"I had a great time at Boucherie. Everything was superb, from food to service to ambiance. I went with my boyfriend for dinner on a Saturday night. The weather was great and we decided to seat outdoors. It was not that crowded around 7pmish.Our server was spectacular in explaining the menu in detail. We decided to go with the polpe provencale and steak tartare for the apps. The polpe was good but not the best I had. However, the steak tartare was delicious. The portion size was ginormous as well. I normally don't like steak tartare but I could not stop eating it this time. The fact that it was not salty earned a few more bonus points for me. The entree menu was unexpectedly extensive and has a good variety. Pasta and seafood selections were pretty good. But we jumped straight to the steak section and ordered Steak frites au poivre and & Filet de boeuf. YOU MUST get the Filet de bouef. The truffle butter simmered with steak will literally melt in your mouth! I never had anything like this! Again the portion size for both steaks were huge and I had a hard time finishing my steak, but I almost did b/c it was too good! I was very satisfied with the french fries that came with Steak frites as well. The thick cut fries were perfectly cripsy and well fried. My bf and I agreed that we would come back just for the File de bouef. The apple tarte dessert gave a perfect finish to our palate. It was neither too fruity nor too sweet. We had such a good time at Boucherie the two of us stayed were there for about 3hours. They were not trying to kick us out or anything either so we really had a great meal and time.

2.0,9/14/2017,"First impressions are the most important and attention to detail is everything.A tornado of waiters milling around a somewhat poorly attended restaurant does not make for a buzz. It lends itself more to an air of desperation.What was the old Jazz Garage is now a French cliche. Waiting five minutes, having to ask for a glass of water, then having to call someone over to order a drink. What were all the waiters for? My absinthe martini was watered down unfortunately.An amuse bouche was plonked on the table with no description of what it was.. we had to call our waiter over to ask. Unfortunately we had to send the $20 Fois Gras (mousse) back because it tasted as if it had almost turned. Our waiter suggested there might have been a seasoning in that we weren't familiar with. We were offered cheese which we accepted, however the 'traditional french brie' had just come out of the fridge and didn't have much flavour. We were up sold on a special new cut of steak - which our waiter proudly backed up by showing us a NY Times advertisement of the restaurant and the restaurants quality meat !? The steak was good, but after dining in NYC establishments such as Strip House, Knickerbocker Grill, Peter Luger, it was just good, not as good as the price point would have suggested.The manager/maître d, told us that the chef had offered us a desert or a drink on the house which we nice but we declined.

The bar was crowded, but I managed to find one seat in the corner where I ordered a Lillet Rose Spritz. I enjoyed my drink and some good people watching from the bar. My dining companions finally arrived 40 minutes late and we were promptly seated. By 8pm the restaurant had cleared out slightly and we were able to pick a table towards the middle of the restaurant. The tables are close together and small, so many of the tables around the perimeter are less than ideal. The waiter was new and did not know the menu well, so it was my fault for taking his white wine suggestion of the Pinot Gris. Clearly, we do not have the same wine palate. For my main course, I ordered the Steak Frites Au Poivre. The steak, sauce, and french fries were delicious, although expensive at $45. However, it was a very filling meal leaving me no room for dessert. Overall, I enjoyed the ambiance of Boucherie.

5.0,9/10/2017,"The bf and I visited France back in June and I missed foie gras and the chill French bistro vibe back there. Unfortunately he's away so I decided to try to get that atmosphere back at a nice French restaurant.The weather was nice and there are tables outside or inside (a little bit warmer), and even tables on the second floor! It's quite a big restaurant and gives that distinctly French feeling. This is the only restaurant where we got bread and butter, but also cured meat, artichokes, and other veggies to go with our bread complimentary. It's like a free appetizer :). We ordered foie gras for our appetizer this time as my friend had octopus the time prior. The mousse is light on the bread with the same savory flavor. Get it! It's so uniquely french! For drinks, we both had the Cabernet Sauvignon. Our order was taken quickly and the friendly waiter came by just to explain all the food and his favorites. He seemed full of ""joie de vivre"", as they so say! For our main we contemplated the duck confit, coq a vin, or steak for two as the pictures on yelp looked delicious. Ultimately we had steak and it was amazing, so delicious! Perfectly cooked medium rare with extra au jus and veggies. The baby onions were my favorite. The bone marrow on top was a delight (collagen is both good for you and delicious!). My favorite food ever is tonkotsu, which is essentially a bowl of bone marrow, so to combine steak and bone marrow is the stuff of my foodie dreams! We wiped the pan clean with our bread as the au jus was just too tasty (don't do this is France though, it's bad manners!). On to dessert for profiteroles. 3 cream puff-esque creations with chocolate and ice cream in between. Sweet, crispy, perfect for the sweet tooth. At this point we're stuffed and need to go home and nap from our food coma but it's 9pm, so...All in all, amazing service, incredible and authentic French food, and perfect ambience.

3.0,9/5/2017,"I had come here once before this past summer for a drink. I was seated at a high top table with a massive tree behind me with really no space to move. It was a little odd because there were many other tables available - but in the end it didn't matter too much because the waiter never took our order and we ended up leaving to go elsewhere.  It was time to give it another go and give Boucherie a second chance.  It was a cool day, so we opted to sit inside though on a warm summer day the outdoor seating seems like prime dining real estate but never the less we were very happy with where we were seated. The restaurant is large enough that you have room to breath and move around while feeling as though you and your co-diners are the only ones there. The service was prompt, and waiters initially very attentive bringing over water and menus right away. We started with two cocktails, the old fashion and the belle epoque, which were both delicious and served with house bread.  For starters we shared the french onion soup - which can never go wrong (well, actually it can) but it was delicious and cheesy and I would definitely get it again. It was now time for the mains. We shared the sirloin steak - which was medium rare and delicious. We also shared the salmon, which is always my go to, but unfortunately it was not as enjoyable. Though I explicitly asked for the salmon cooked through, it came practically rare which is an honest mistake that can happen anywhere, but the cherry on top was the presentation - it looked like everything was just thrown onto the plate. To make matters worse I think they drizzled the left over sauce (from the raw fish) onto the bed of spinach and asparagus leaving it soggy with a ""raw and fishy"" taste which really wasn't edible. When time for desert, the waiter brought over the lunch/snack menu, which arguably looked the same as the desert menu, but it took a very long time for him to come back to check on us. Good thing i pre stalk all menus so i knew exactly what I wanted - the creme brulee and it did not disappoint. Overall I think these might have been unique and isolated experiences. The photos I've seen on the yelp page look great and definitely impress me, though my food (more specifically my salmon) was not picture worthy or anything to rave about.  I encourage you to check it out and see what it has to offer you, because you might be very impressed",0,0,0,Elise P.,"New York, NY",229,112,63

I have to start out by saying that I was BLOWN AWAY by my experience here. From the atmosphere, to the service, and of course the delicious food, Boucherie has topped any other French restaurant in NYC. Especially since my mom is the harshest food critic, I was happy that I chose this place for our mother/daughter date night. We were greeted by the lovely staff as soon as we walked in and were seated by the gorgeous windows in the front. There is definitely something special about the atmosphere of Boucherie. It is cozy, yet elegant and chic. You truly feel like you are sitting at a French bistro in Paris. Our waiter was extremely helpful and told us his favorites on the menu. We ordered the octopus, rillets de canard, steak tartare, betteraves, and moules a la normande...all INCREDIBLE. This menu is extremely authentic and for someone who doesn't speak French, it can be a little intimidating(but exciting!). I just started exploring French food recently, so many of these dishes were new to my taste buds, which made the whole experience much more memorable. The octopus and the rillets de canard definitely stood out in my mind, although everything we had was top notch. What makes Boucherie so special isn't just the incredible quality of the food and wine, but the staff is so friendly, helpful, and genuine, truly great people. The manager, Milos, came to our table a few times to check on how things were, and then chatted with us at the end of our meal. We cannot thank Milos and the staff of Boucherie enough for making this experience so special. New York was in need of a truly amazing French restaurant, and we finally got it!

5.0,8/29/2017,"I chose Boucherie for a reunion dinner with a friend because of a wonderful experience I had at another restaurant owned by the same restaurant group (Dominique Bistro, down the street). Boucherie means ""butcher shop"" in French. It's an upscale French bistro. The space is a large, with walk-thru windows opening onto the sidewalk along Seventh Avenue, just south of Stonewall. There were absurd delays on the L train on Saturday evening, so I was fifteen minutes late to our seven o'clock reservation. I found my friend seated at a high table in the outdoor sidewalk section. Characteristically, she had already ordered two glasses of red and made friends with the owner, Zorica, a friendly blonde woman from Serbia dressed in a black suit.The menu is largely made up of meat dishes, as one would suspect from a place called ""Boucherie."" We shared a starter of tender escargots in melted butter and garlic, and then each ordered the Saturday special, a boeuf Bourguignon. I apologize for the single food photo from this entire experience, but I thought my friend had taken some and it turns out she was taking Snapchats, as opposed to permanent pictures. We lingered over dinner. The sun set while we talked. We weren't quite done lounging yet by the ""end"" of the meal (neither of us made it even halfway through the large beef entrée), so we decided to have some iced coffees and split the crème brûlée. After ordering dessert, I got up from the table to take a stroll around the indoor restaurant space. The atmosphere felt vital in the way high-capacity restaurants do when they are anticipating a busy night. But the space was not full yet, so I could walk slowly toward the back of the house, cutting a path through the dark wood of two- and four-tops crowding the intricate tiled floor, and catching the owner's eye once again in the large bronze mirror behind the silver bar top. All of the surfaces in the place are bright white, silver or bronze, belying the vintage French posters hanging against tile walls.I forgot my phone in the restroom, which I am mentioning here because the episode is representative of the high level of service guests can expect at Boucherie. I had picked my way through the chair forest and through the window to our table, realized the loss, and then picked my way back to the washrooms. The door was locked and so I loitered for a few seconds before noticing a patron angling to catch my eye from his seat. Eye caught, I walked over to introduce myself and he directed me toward the hostess table. My phone had been turned in more or less immediately. The owner was still leaning on the silver bar, speaking with the bartender. ""Silly girl, did you lose your phone?"" Her eyes twinkled. ""Do you want it back?"" We strode over to the hostess table, where the phone had been deposited in a locked drawer. ""Here is your phone, and I see your coffee has come."" ""Wonderful.""Our crème brûlée was brought moments later. I felt completely and thoroughly cared for.So, if you are looking for a modern brasserie, I can recommend Boucherie.",3,0,0,Becca B.,"New York, NY",531,101,37

These are the equivalent to coveted court side seats.The Boucherie musts:- the juicy filet mignon with truffle butter, spinach and these explosively delicious grilled onion bulbs- a glass of champagne and a seat outside on the edge of the sidewalk for that true people-watching Parisian-style experience - the profiteroles, which absolutely live up to the adoration on Yelp - airy, creamy, fudgyLocal tip: stop by around Christmas, when Boucherie has a huge ceiling-high Christmas tree, filled with intricate ornaments. The whole atmosphere is dramatically stunning, like a scene from The Nutcracker. 5 stars!!!!!!!",4,0,0,Bonnie G.,"New York, NY",171,592,1029

5.0,8/24/2017,"Boucherie is an amazing brasserie in West Village. A little taste of Paris, right here in the city!We came here on a Wednesday for dinner and they were quite packed (looks like this is a pretty popular spot!). The ambiance is charming and very Parisian, from the outdoor plants to the decor inside. We came with a reservation and had a table inside set up for us, but the weather was so nice and the restaurant was so charming from the outside that we had to ask for a table on their patio. And they were more than happy to comply with our request.The service was super attentive and always on hand! We never felt neglected but in his over-eagerness the server seemed to forget to give us our space, which we would have actually preferred. He did give us some great recommendations for drinks though- we got a vodka based cocktail, which was excellent, and the Sazerac, which was well made and strong.The food here is really good overall! Quite a good example of what french cooking is about. We got:- Escargots: This was sadly one of the low points for me. They came out sizzling hot and swimming in butter, but seemed to lack flavor. I could only taste the butter and not any of the garlic or pesto-type flavor they usually come with. Portion size was generous though.- Scallops: These were delicately seasoned and nicely seared, quite tasty but came out a bit cold for some reason. - Veal porterhouse: This was amazing! It was perfectly cooked, full of flavor and came with a wonderful sauce. The accompanying sweetbreads were a decadent treat to go along with it. A must try here for sure!- Hanger steak: This was another recommendation from our server, and I'm glad I took his word and went with it. Perfectly cooked, juicy and comes with an excellent red wine sauce. It was completely delicious, and highly recommended if you like a good steak.- Profiteroles: This delicious dessert was another server recommendation, and the perfect way to end the meal. The buttery-soft biscuit base complements the ice cream perfectly and it left us really happy and satisfied!This is a great place to impress a date or go to for a special occasion. Highly recommended to get your fix of French cuisine!P.S. Many thanks to Zorica for organizing the meal for us, and making sure everything was perfect.

First, our waitress Alex came over to introduce herself. She was very attentive and helpful. She helped us pick out a beautiful bottle of red wine within our price range. For our first course we had the Foie Gras, it was so smooth and delicious. We absolutely loved it. For our mean we each had the filet, and it was perfectly cooked. Finally, for desert we had the dessert pancakes (I had pulled her aside and asked her to put a candle on the dessert), they went above and beyond and wrote happy birthday on the plate.Alex was such a great server and the foods awesome.

5.0,8/23/2017,"I came to Boucherie for Sunday dinner and loved it! I had a fantastic dinner from beginning to end. The ambiance at Boucherie is beautiful. It is very spacious and airy which made me feel very relaxed. What is  also nice about Boucherie is that they have a  bar area which has a very nice quint look to it, so if you'd like to relax and sit at the bar instead of a table you can do so. Boucherie also has outdoor seating in the warmer months which of course us New Yorkers love. Overall Boucherie is very aesthetically pleasing. For our meal we ordered the following...Starters:Ceasar Salad: The salad was delicious, fresh and crisp.Entrees:Steak Frites Au Poivre: This dish was fantastic! The steak was delicious and the peppercorn sauce was to die for! We loved the sauce so much we just had to ask for more! The fries were well seasoned and crispy. Faux Filet Bercy: Wow was this a piece of steak! It was big, juicy and extremely flavorful. (Side)Gratin de Pommes de Terre: In translation this was potato gratin. This was absolutely  wonderful!!!! the potato was creamy and well flavored. I very much enjoyed this side with my steak.Drinks:We had mojitos which were delicious! I also had a glass of red wine with my steak. Unfortunately I can't remember what wine it was as it was a recommendation of our waiter but it was superb.Dessert:Creme Brûlée and Ice cream: Anyone that knows me knows that I am a HUGE fan of creme brûlée, in fact it is probably my favorite dessert. The creme brûlée was delectable, I loved it. The ice cream was delicious as well I suspect that it was house made.Overall I had a fantastic time at Boucherie.

4.0,8/22/2017,"Service: 5Decor: 5Food: 3.5 - 4Drinks: 4.5Boucherie is located on the corner of 7th Ave. and Grove St. I promise you will NOT miss this place. A friend and I came on a beautiful Monday summer night after work. The outside of the restaurant was beautiful. I also loved how the ""wall"" was open so you could sit inside while feeling like you are sitting outside, but not getting destroyed by NYC humidity. For drinks, my friend had ordered a absinthe cocktail and I had ordered their version of a margarita (super light and refreshing, with a tangy kick - but just enough for me to like it). I loved how extensive their drink menu was. There is something for everyone, so bringing a large diverse group here is not an issue at all. (Tell me another French place that has a Japanese whiskey list...)The service was amazing. Waiters came by at the right time to ask if things were okay, our water was always filled and they were attentive to our needs. I also loved the uniformity so I knew who was part of the staff there. For appetizers, we ordered the beef tartare and escargot - both to share. The escargot was good, but lacked flavor. It tasted like garlic and oil. I guess I am biased and was looking for the pesto that escargot usually comes in. The steak tartare also was not flavorful. I wish I asked for more pepper and I think they could've made the pieces a bit bigger and chunkier. Also maybe explaining that we should pour the quail egg into the tartare helps (I don't even know if we were supposed to do that, to be honest). However, moving into the entrees, the lamb is A MUST. I love eating lamb and usually order it whenever I get the chance. Cooked medium rare, it is absolute perfection. It just melts in our mouth. I cannot get over it. My friend had ordered the duck which was also done very well. Just wished there was more sauce that came on the dish. It seemed like the duck was getting drowned out with the frisée. The dish kind of looked like someone who forgot to mow their lawn. What I do want to come back and try is their BEEF MENU. Yes, I said that correctly - beef menu. The filet mignon with bone marrow looks like a must try.",0,1,0,Wendy H.,"New York, NY",356,54,26

We asked the steak to be medium rare but it came pretty medium, and friends sent it back since we were paying $42 for it. When the dish returned, it was better and the fries that came with it were perfect. The duck was a bit ordinary and the foie gras was not memorable, odd tasting compared to what I had tried in Paris before.

5.0,8/17/2017,"Seriously such a beautiful restaurant! I've always wanted to come here and now that I have, I can say it met my (somewhat high) expectations. We ordered the poulpe provencale (octopus) and the mousse de foie gras with onion compote and red wine port sauce as our appetizers. Both were beautifully presented. The octopus was the perfect amount of chewiness, and the onion compote was a fantastic accompaniment to the foie gras, adding a slight sweetness to the toasted bread that we spread it on. For our enteee we got the Faux Filet Bercy (16 oz Pat La Frieda dry-aged bone-in New York strip) and the special of the day which was the Bouillabaisse (shrimp, fish, scallops, mussels, and clams in a saffron broth with potatoes and leeks). I'll be honest I don't usually care too much for steak but this NY strip was incredibly tender and flavorful! I enjoyed my Bouillabaisse as well. For drinks we got the Anti Douleur also known as ""the Painkilller."" Talk about a scary name for a drink. Ironically this drink is actually really cute and picturesque. We ended the meal with their creme brûlée topped with fresh raspberries and strawberries. I was so full by this point that I barely touched it, but the few bites I did have were delicious.

When the bill came, they were $2 more each than listed on the menu. We loved our waiter too much to say anything, but it did give us a weird feeling as we left.

My entree I had to get the steak and frites. Perfectly cooked steak exactly how you want it and smothered in a creamy peppercorn sauce.

They did not disappoint. The food is one of the reasons this place is always packed. The chef puts together a simple menu that is quality all around.  Couple that with great service and you have a restaurant that will live up to expectations.  A few items you should try...* Butternut Squash Soup - rich soup full of flavor, great cream base. * Escargot - cooked perfectly in a garlic lemon butter. Really good with some bread to soak up the flavor.  They give you a lot so don't worry them skimping. * Hanger Steak - wow...  My wife kept stealing pieces from my plate its so good. The demi glaze is something special. * NY Strip  16oz (dry aged) - medium rare cooked to perfection. This place uses Pat LaFrieda meats which is second to none in flavor and quality.   * Crème Brulee - you need to try this. That's all I'll say.

5.0,8/11/2017,"I came here with my boyfriend for dinner after wanting to try French food for the longest time! Boucherie has been on my bookmarks for a while and I'm glad I was finally able to make it out here.We came on a Thursday night for dinner around 6, and lucky for us, we missed the dinner rush hour by a couple minutes. As soon as we were seated and drinking our beer and cocktail, tables started to fill up. Inside, the restaurant is beautiful and even if I'd never been to France, its exactly how I picture it to be. There is outdoor seating as well as indoor and wherever you sit, the sunlight bounces off on you for a beautiful lighting. My date had the Nitro Milk Stout and I forgot the name of the cocktail I had but it was the one with rose, mint, and lemon. The Nitro Milk Stout was really good and a light beer. The cocktail was great and it was my first time trying rose! For the appetizers:I had the Poulpe Provencale, which is with baby octopus, with baby potatoes, tomatoes, and olives and peppers. The baby octopus was so tender, that a fork was able to slice through it. It was delicious and me and my date finished it in seconds! My bf had the Saint Jacques a la provencale which is seared scallops with crushed tomatoes and garlic. mmmmm the scallops were just as tender as the octopus and it melted in my mouth. The flavoring was perfect together and with the complimentary Italian bread they give, the scallops with the sauce blended in well together.For the entree:I had the special of the day Bouillabaisse. I love seafood and this was a collection of all the best. There were scallops, mussels, clams, shrimps, fish all in a saffron broth. The scallops were perfectly cooked, as were all the other seafood in the pot. There were so much I had trouble finishing it! For the seafood lovers, this is a must-try!!!The other entree ordered was the famous Steak Frites au Poivre. My man loves steak and he got his medium (so I can try some :p ) and it was PERFECT. It was tender, flavorful, mm my mouth waters thinking about this steak. The French fries served with this was probably the best fries I've ever had. It was fried SO WELL and so crunchy. I could eat this alllll day.The dessert:We shared Profiteroles and GET THEM. They are creme puffs with ice-cream and chocolate drizzle and IT IS A PERFECT DESSERT.

5.0,8/8/2017,"Boucherie transported me back to the time I was in Paris years ago with my cousin. With a classically French interior, it reminded me very much of being in a French bistro and it was a wonderful dining experience. For appetizers, we chose the French onion soup and steak tartare. The French onion soup oozed with the gooey melted cheese and going down into the bowl, you get the sweet caramelized onions which was unexpectedly light on the stomach.The steak tartare is as classic as it gets and I had been on steak tartare streak and Boucherie's version with capers, shallots, and parsley provides a quail egg to mix in for added yolk creaminess. On to the entrees, my friend chose the duck confit while I went for the filet mignon. The duck confit had frisee and crispy truffle potatoes. The duck had a nice crispy exterior and paired with the frisee and potatoes, each ingredient worked together. As for the filet mignon, it was cooked and seasoned to perfection especially because it was a Pat LaFrieda center cut. It was juicy and with the truffle butter was a beautiful bite worth savoring slowly. We ended the meal with two French desserts, a tart tatin and crepes suzette. Both were a great cap to a great meal. The warm fresh apples from the tart contrasted to the cool vanilla ice cream and the same thing can be said to the delicately prepared crepes with mandarins.  When the rain drops were falling as I was waiting for my friend, I looked out and that night at Boucherie really reminded me of Paris. There is French art adorned throughout and the dining room is expansive yet intimate at the same time with the golden brown woods and soft lighting. Our service was top notch too as our waiters were friendly and attentive throughout the meal.If ever you're looking for an authentic French dining experience in New York City, Boucherie, is a must.Happy eating and remember: Don't deny, satisfy!",2,1,1,Raymart D.,"Flushing, NY",478,233,419

5.0,8/6/2017,"When you feel like traveling to France, but dread the 7 hour plus flight from JFK, then a visit Boucherie may provide a great little getaway from the hustle and bustle of NYC.  Although no place can supplement for a real trip to Paris, Boucherie offers a satisfying taste of the Parisian life.   In full disclosure, Bouchereie's Management was kind enough to invite me and my wife to a complimentary meal.  I would like to thank the restaurant and the staff that made it a wonderful visit.  As with all my other reviews, this review and all its contents are of my true and honest opinions.  I hope you're hungry because I'll be dishing out the good, the bad and all else in-between on my trip to the little Paris of the West Village. -The entree-Boucherie, French for butcher shop, holds true to their name as they serve up an array of delectable meats. Ranging from your poultry, both duck and chicken, to succulent cuts of red meats, like lamb, veal and venison.  On this occasion my wife and I wanted to taste the recommendations from the staff and so we decided to try their Confit de Canard (duck confit) and their Steak Frites Au Poivre as our main entrees. The Confit de Canard, served with frisée and truffle potatoes, was simply delicious. The duck meat was tender and fall off the bone while retaining the shape and crispy skin.  The savory juices of the dark duck meat held the mineral essence but contained no gamy aftertaste.  The heavy oils and flavors in the skin was balanced out when you take a bite of the frisée, which is a lite but bitter vegetable.  The truffle potatoes were nice like hot potato chips but didn't add to the duck's flavors.  By itself, I could probably finish an entire tray of these delectable truffle potatoes, but it didn't blend well with the Confit as the frying oils of the potatoes overpowered the duck's natural flavors.The Steak Frites Au Poivre, cooked medium rare and came out beautifully. The steak was pink and soft but no trace of runny blood, a sign of a skilled hand in the kitchen. The fries served with the steak was so aromatic that I could smell it before it reached our table. They were crunchy on the outside and steamy on the inside. Even after the fries sat for a while and cooled off, they still retained the same texture with none becoming soggy. I wish I could make these addictive fries at home because I would want it every night. The steak was so good, and as the meat was sourced from Pat LaFrieda, you know that you're biting into quality beef.  This standard of meat makes the dishes served at Boucherie top notch and a heavy contender to some of my favorite steakhouses in the city. Sadly, there was one downside to my steak; the menu says that the steak is served with a four peppercorn cream sauce, which doesn't sound bad at all, in fact the sauce was very well put together.  However, it was lathered over my entire steak. I enjoy steaks and I enjoy steak sauces, but I would've liked to have the option to put the sauce on the side and I choose to add it on the steak. Just my two-cents, but ask if they could put the sauce on the side and your dish will be complete. -The appetizers-It's almost a given for me, but whenever I step foot into a French restaurant I must try the two staples of the nation. First being the Escargot and second being the Foie Gras.  Here at Boucherie, neither one disappoints and one actually excels beyond expectations.  The Foie Gras was smooth and creamy without any overly powerful livery flavors. The Escargot was huge, maybe even the largest and most abundant tray of snails I've ever had the pleasure to eat.  Each section had what amounted to two snails worth of meat and they were large pieces of soft, warm and buttery meat.  Each morsel was more mouth watering than the last. I highly recommend if you're a fan of snails then this is a cannot miss sort of appetizer. -The drinks- One notable drink they have is called Provence Martini, brings the scents and flavors of the lavender fields in Provence, France through lavender infused Grey Goose. It's unique flavor mix with the use of lavender is one I have never tried before elsewhere. -The space-The space is large and open with high ceilings and even a skylight in the middle of the room. The visible and exposed kitchen space makes for a wonderful display of culinary preparation. A cozy and romantic space for dining with your significant other, but it's also a place where during my visit, three birthdays were celebrated.  The staff does sing to the birthday person but not in French, which makes me wonder if there's a French birthday song...  The taste of their food, the atmosphere of the restaurant and the friendliness of the staff makes Boucherie a small French haven.  After such a filling meal, I can only say au revoir, and I'll be anxiously awaiting the next visit to try that roasted bone marrow steak on the menu.",8,0,3,Louis N.,"New York, NY",375,218,459

5.0,8/1/2017,"Amazing.Key recommendations - Bouillabaisse for dinner, Profiteroles for dessert, and COCKTAILSSummary -My date and I picked this restaurant out because we were in the mood for some escargot and steak, and I heard great reviews about the meat here. And......of course as soon as I walk in, I bump into some friends already sitting at another table.Decor : Cute and chic. Come here either with a date or with a small group of friends when you feeling fancy/boujee and want to eat good dinner over some yummy cocktails. They have an open kitchen-style feel, so it's cool to see the chefs go at it with the food.Drinks : Tasty. They have an extensive bar, so I ASAP was like Sign. Me. Up.Service : The waiters were extremely attentive. After seating me down and noticing that there was another seat available with more room, they kindly asked if I wanted to switch. I really liked how they already knew that I would want the seat by the patio area, and made the suggestion without me having to ask for it.Food :Soup of the Day: Gazpacho. It was my first time trying this dish out, but I'm so glad that I did. At first, I was skeptical of the idea of cold soup...My date insisted that I try it out, and when I did, I reluctantly admitted that I was wrong......It had a refreshing salsa taste to it with some..bread crunch underneath the guac (to be honest, I tried my best to sound as sophisticated as possible, but that was literally what my reaction was). French Onion Soup - SolidEscargot - If you're a fan of escargot in general, it's a solid dish. They give you plenty of snails to eat..The dish comes out all sizzly and hot. Sizzle sizzle.Chateaubriand Pour Deux - Pour Deux is right. This dish is pretty massive, so definitely make sure to only get this dish if you are trying to share with another person. The meat was very tender, and I liked the vegetables that came with. Bouillabaisse - The waiter told me that this dish sells out pretty quickly, and I can see why. The seafood was fresh af. Apparently, the restaurant gets the seafood the day of (I think...I was too engrossed to eating the food and that probably clogged my memory), and you can taste the freshness in the shrimp and scallops. My date even said it was probably one of the best shrimps he has ever had. I'm normally not a huge fan of shrimp, but I definitely agreed with him on that one.Dessert - GET THE PROFITEROLES. YOU WILL NOT REGRET. They are the most popular item on the dessert menu, and I totally can see why. They're like cream puffs with vanilla ice cream. Sounds simple, but.......WOW. I don't know what it was about this dish..if it was the contrasting texture between the actual puff and the ice cream..or the chocolate drizzle..but PLS GET THIS.",5,3,5,Ellie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",442,142,532

Actually, any spot would've been nice, but it was too humid that day or we would've opted for an outdoor seat.Our waiter and the staff members were extremely attentive and friendly!To start, my friend and I both ordered drinks- I had the Boucherie old fashioned and my friend had the Nikka Malt Whiskey, and both drinks were good. We are both fans of whiskey and they had quite a large selection, which was perfect for us. To start, we had the braised octopus and steak tartar. I preferred the octopus to the steak tartar, I felt that the steak tartare could've used more seasoning and maybe a touch of citrus to add another dimension of flavoring. For the entrees, we had the duck confit and rack of lamb with a side of fries.The duck was cooked well and complimented perfectly by a bed of frisée. The fries were also deliciously battered and crispy.As for the lamb, it was a bit under-seasoned to our liking. I had expected it to be cooked with more herbs to cover the taste of lamb. Lastly, for dessert we shared the creme brûlée. It was delicious and quickly devoured. It was also a sizable portion!

4.0,7/31/2017,"I've always passed by this place and wanted to check it out. It's a very pleasant restaurant to eat in the summer as they have outside tables. The food I would say was good but nothing exceptional. We got the escargot that we thought had too much of a lemon taste (I've lived in France before so we were picky about the food). For main course, I got the steak frites which I thought was good and would recommend you to get it. For dessert, we got my favorite dessert, profiteroles but the chocolate was more of a milk chocolate instead of dark chocolate. So it was good but again, nothing amazing.Maybe I just had really high expectations of this place so take it all with a grain of salt. I would go to this place and would recommend you to go, but there are French restaurants in the city with better tasting food.",2,1,1,Secil A.,"Manhattan, NY",665,190,270
5.0,7/31/2017,"UPDATE: Came back to boucherie a second time. This time a much pleasant experience. our waiter andres was phenomenal. very attentive but not over bearing, he was very personable and helpful in deciding what we wanted to eat. We had the escargot again, i cannot express how amazing that is, as well as the baby octopus which was amazing as well. For a main course we had the Veal and potato gratin. Excellent recommendation from andres. It was nicely done and full of flavor. the meat was very tender and not gamey as veal tends to be. The main course was paired with an easy drinking malbec. We topped off the wonderful with the crepe, creme brulee and some capuccino.Overall a wonderful second experience. Will definitely be coming back to try their massive tomahawk steak and what else their menu has to offer.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Came here last friday. Originally had a reservation time at 8 pm, we arrived about 5 minutes earlier but still ended up waiting over half an hour to be seated. The restaurant has a lot of capacity and staff but for some reason service seemed slow, and some of the waiters on staff seemed to have an attitude and weren't very friendly.We ordered the escargot, foie gras, french onion soup, tomato soup. The escargot was amazing, so was the foie gras, highly recommend that, but the french onion soup was too burnt, and the tomato soup was cold and lacked much flavor.It happened to be restaurant week so a few of us ordered from their restaurant week menu (most of us ordered the steak frites au piovre), as well as the Faux-filet bercy (A dry aged, bone in 16 oz, new strip). Both orders were good but nothing amazing. Also ordered a few cocktails which were quite fantastic, even though they were a bit pricey.

My husband dreams about this particular steak tartare often!For my entree, I opted to skip steak and had the duck confit which was unbelievable. The skin was super crispy, but the inside was unbelievably moist. It was served with frisee salad topped with truffle chips that you could smell from a mile away.

5.0,7/30/2017,"Boucherie is a hidden gem in West Village area by 7th Ave South & Grove st.  They have 2 spacious levels and a mid balcony for a causal yet elegance atmosphere. (see my photos)My family of 3 tried for an early 6pm Sunday dinner and hostess greeted us very warmly asking any particular area I wanted to sit.  I picked the mid balcony area. All the appetizers was amazing.  I would rate the Steak Tartar and the French Onion soup as the best.  The presentation of steak Tartar with a quail egg was appealing and tasted as good as it look.  The french onion soup had right proportion of cheese & onion and very flavorful.  The escargots was as good any other french restaurants. The Faux-Filet Bercy (dry-aged bone in NY strip steak ) was so delicious and exceptional that I was pleasantly surprise to find such a quality piece of meat in a french restaurant and not in a steak house.  I ordered it to be medium and it was perfectly cook.  It had areally smooth firm surface but give towards the middle with good amount of pink.  I love cuttingthe meat still attached to the bone and was delicious.  My wife & Son also tried my steak and they loved the taste and texture of it too.The Confit de Canard (Confit Duck leg) was okay, need to play more attention to the amount (reduce) of truffle oil & truffle potatoes chip around the duck leg.It was an okay dish but no comparison to the amazing steak. I was really full but had to try he creme brulee and was able to finish it all up. ( Satisfying dessert) Overall, Boucherie is a warm restaurant providing a spacious elegant environment, white glove service and divine meals.  I would definitely be back and recommend to friends and family to try it.P.S.  Hey it restaurant week till 8/18 and I saw they had an startlingly impressive $42 restaurant week dinner 3 course meal & $29 lunch as well.  See their Menu on their site.

4.0,7/30/2017,"Weekday lunchSoupe a L'oignon Gratinee ($15) and Salade Niçoise, that ended up free. I know, I know, why it was free? It came with lightly seared sliced raw tuna but the quality of it was a questionable -- it was not fresh -- being Japanese we know about fresh fish. But I knew we won't get sick from it  The first bite was fine but leaving an unpleasant after taste of fishiness was appetizing. I casually mentioned to our charming waiter when she came around to ask us how we were doing? Later, I noticed the salad was not charged on the bill. I truly appreciated the sincere gesture of the establishment -- I will definitely come back to support the business, but the Niçoise itself was okay. I had better and am particular about this Nice style salad. I like the authentic Niçoise, a must to have anchovies -- that overly salty fish brings depth of Umami flavor, and some black olives would completed my satisfaction.Onion soup was also another my favorite when I was a poor student in Paris -- one of the cheapest and filling dish that you can get at late night cafe. Stringy melted gruyere cheese with rich beefy flavor with sweetness from caramelized onion broth had been my choice. Boucherie's onion soup was, just, okay. The broth was too watery for how I liked it and I wish there were more nutty taste from the gruyere -- I am picky because the restaurant is authentic French. a 3.8 star (because of the surprise) We sat by the window. Inside the room with a high ceiling and surrounding by beautiful French decor and the fully opened windows letting fresh air coming in and out the restaurant were French, as even sitting outside -- a waiter with a long white apron taking orders and looking out the Avenue watching people passing by and sunlight glowing the facade of the restaurant was a reminiscence of summer in France.",10,6,8,Taiyo O.,"New York, NY",912,589,1081

The fries were amazing. Perfectly crispy. They also have truffle butter with onion and bread with prosciutto. I ordered the filet minon with truffle butter and the meat was very high quality and well flavored. The veal was amazing. It came with enoki mushroom and the sauce was delectable.

5.0,7/27/2017,"I'll be honest, I've always had my hesitations around French food. Don't get me wrong, I love fine dining, but I've always been more likely to splurge on a nice Italian dinner than a French restaurant. After trying Boucherie I realized I've clearly been missing out. My entire dining experience at Boucherie was fantastic, in the most ""Treat Yo Self"" way. The sidewalk tables in West Village always remind me of Europe, and the inside ambiance of the restaurant feels very much like Paris. For West Village standards this restaurant is huge, but in no way was the service compromised. The manager Milos took such great care of us, even moving us to an inside table at the first sign of rain. Below were some food standouts:- Scallops: Insanely flavorful!- Steak Frites Au Poivre: The steak with peppercorn sauce was great and the fries were a surprising standout. - Faux-Filet Bercy: This 16oz dry aged (yes, I just ate an entire pound of meat) New York strip was insanely juicy. I asked for the Truffle Butter on the side and it paired very well.- Creme Brulee: The fresh fruit on top paired very well with this classic dessertI'll definitely be back!",1,0,1,Ashwin S.,"New York, NY",127,109,192

5.0,7/25/2017,"Fantastic meal, fantastic service. Boucherie is a perfect spot to enjoy classic French bistro cuisine in a lovely Parisian setting. Here's my review of the food from top to bottom:Lillet Spritz (cocktail): balanced and especially refreshing if you're seated outside on a hot day. Delicious floral and citrus aromas, just enough sweetness, and a bit of carbonation I believe. Make sure to stir well to avoid hitting pockets of lillet versus pockets of soda.Boucherie Old Fashion (cocktail): Surprised to find el Jimador anejo tequila in an old-fashioned, I picked up on the tequila notes right away. I think the tequila might actually lighten up the drink a bit overall, which I appreciated. The brandied cherry may have been made in house? Steak Tartare (hors d'oeurves): Execution was perfect. Fresh beef, nicely diced. Each little cube of beef keeps its structure and texture, well-seasoned with capers for balance. The beef tasted very clean and the knifework was apparent. The toasts were a bit on the crunchy and crumbly side, but definitely provided nice textural contrast to the beef. You can't go wrong with the tartare here.Duck Rillettes (plats de saison): This is my #1 recommendation out of everything at Boucherie. It was the epitome of what rillettes should be: rich, deeply savory, a hint of smoke, and the texture was that perfect balance between creaminess with just a hint of meaty chew. The toast points were nicely charred while remaining chewy in the center. Honestly, this was the ideal appetizer and I cannot recommend it enough. I would come back just for these. The pickled pearl onion, carrot, and whole grain mustard were also nice. If you let the duck rillettes warm up a bit to room temp, they spread perfectly.Steak Frites aux Poivre (pieces du boucher): Solid fries with an extra crisp exterior, not over salted, with a creamy potato flavor in the center. The steak was tender and dense, as a result of the aging. The peppercorn sauce had good body and the perfect texture but the peppercorn flavor was a bit on the milder side. In the sauce, I tasted cream, perhaps a hint of cognac, and a depth of savoriness from either the fond from searing the steak - this sauce helped me realize that a good cream-based, steak pan sauce tastes a bit like demiglace.Faux-Filet Bercy (pieces du boucher): Beautiful aged NY strip from Pat La Frieda. The beef was perfectly dense and tender, with a concentrated beefy sweetness. A little underseasoned - a bit more salt would have helped bring out the mineral character of the beef but that's nothing a salt shaker at the table can't fix. The age of the beef was reflected in a supremely supple tenderness and a slight nutty sweetness.Malbec, Chateau de Haute-Serre 2014 (wine): light-medium acidity, not quite dry but the residual sugar isn't high either. When paired with a steak, the red and dark fruit and sweetness come forward. The fruit ripeness is not quite a peak of the season ripeness, but is more like cherry blackberry with restraint. Really a fantastic pairing with steak. Solid tannin structure without astringency; full body, not rich. Bordeaux, Chateaux Brillete Medoc, 2011 (wine): Similar to the Malbec but a bit less fruit character, fruit's a bit less ripe, a bit more dark fruit, cassis, full round mouthfeel, round tannins, with perhaps a hint of smoke or leather.Crepes Suzette (dessert): Best rendition of this dessert I've had in a while. The crepes have the perfect texture, a bit of eggy richness but not too eggy or tough in texture- quite tender. Perfectly sweetened and there's a serious dose of orange rind for those oils without any of the bitter pith. Did not perceive any alcohol, but there was abundant citrus aroma so I presumed the alcohol had been fully driven off. Butter helps round out the sauce, preventing it from becoming cloyingly sweet. The vanilla ice cream was truly superb, the most concentrated dose of vanilla I've had in a long time. Our server, Zach, recommended this dessert and it was a fantastic choice.Overall, a superb dining experience, an example of what every French bistro in NYC should aspire to. Great service from the manager Milos (thanks for the perfect wine pairings), and our server Zach (thanks for all the recommendations), and great service from the staff overall.",2,0,1,Nick H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",358,320,790

From drinks to apps to entrée and desserts, the staff here were on point. This time, hubster and I decided to come back four months later to have a casual dinner. First and foremost I love the space here. High ceilings and raw details exposed with a quaint bistro feel. The layout is great too with seating outdoors, banquette and table seating indoors and seating for larger parties on the mezzanine level. Staff is friendly and seem to have their stuff together. Very knowledgeable and friendly staff who can make excellent recommendations on wine and cocktails as well as be able to tell you what's in a sauce for a particular entrée. We got two glasses of the cremant rosè to start. For apps, steak tartare and a salad were great. Their steak tartare comes with a small quail egg that you can mix with the tartare to give it an amazing texture and depth. The salad was nice and refreshing with some candied walnuts. I got the two pound lobster homard and hubs had the rack of lamb. My lobster was huge and came broiled with charred lemon and frites. It was delicious. Broiled to perfection and not even a bit overcooked. The frites were nice and crunchy (perhaps double fried). Hubs rack of lamb was juicy and tasty! For dessert we shared the crepes suzette. Nomz!

First time I ever have a waiter not give me back all my change and then admit to it.. and tell me its a few dollars short..It started out in the beginning they didn't seem to hear me.. but I overlooked it.. maybe I wasn't loud enough.. My date and I were still finishing a drink and not done yet and the waiter seemed to be annoyed we didn't order another one.. but we still had wine left to go.. we were sitting at a two-person table on the left side directly inside the restaurant.. all the other tables on the side were empty.. I gave a one dollar tip for two glasses of win.. because he padded me on the shoulder and told me he wasn't giving me two dollars back basically.. I probably shouldn't have left that dollar.. I think he was so afraid I wasn't going to leave anything he keep the 2 dollars.. Actually despite how bad he was.. he was I was still going to leave about two dollars a drink..I felt bad for this older guy who seemed to be out of it.. I would not recommend this place.. I would never go here again.. and this place.. like many places in this area will probably close down in a year or two.. nice atmosphere though.. but poorly managed..

5.0,7/20/2017,"Came in for dinner on a Thursday night. The place was fairly crowded and had a very good vibe. The décor is very pretty and very Parisian. They start you off with some delicious warm bread, butter and olives and a few pickled vegetables. Meat eaters also get a piece of prosciutto. The server picked up on the fact that I'm a vegetarian and offered us a meatless plate :-) Appetizers - I had the Brussel sprouts salad. It tasted surprisingly good for Brussel sprouts and had the right ratio of greens to sprouts to tomatoes to dressing. The wife got the escargots and she says the sauce is fantastic and escargots are good too but she isn't a huge fan of escargots texture. The portion size was pretty big. Entrée - Got the mushroom ravioli. It was soaked in the butter based sauce and had a good amount of truffle shavings. It was very good but the butter made it quite rich so I couldn't finish the serving. The wife got the rainbow trout. It comes with some handsome looking potatoes. She says the trout was very well cooked, had a nice sear and tasted good too. Portion size was again generous. Desserts - we initially just got the profiteroles. It. Was. Delish. The wife loved it (she doesn't have too much of a sweet tooth so this was unusual). The manager saw us destroying the profiteroles and offered us some crème brulee. It was also wonderful and the cream was just perfect. Served with some strawberries which was the perfect contrast to the sweet cream. Service was pretty good and the manager was very sweet too.

I was, however, pleasantly surprised on all accounts and plan on coming back for dinner.There is a ton of outdoor seating which was relatively empty by 10:30pm.

The profiteroles were beautifully-assembled, rich, and decadent, not to mention delicious.The kitchen was shutting down just as we ordered, though they accommodated us. It's a bustling area with all sorts of interesting characters bopping around and I think as good of a place as any to guess what's going on in the lives of passersby.It's a tad on the expensive side which is my only hesitation for coming back during the week and I think there are probably better places to spend this kind of money, but when you look at the whole experience, it's a compelling option.",2,0,0,Rachael F.,"Manhattan, NY",93,236,46
5.0,7/17/2017,I'm visiting from San Francisco and I just walked in with some friends and sat at the bar. The restaurant is beautiful!

5.0,7/17/2017,"An incredible new addition to the West Village.Boucherie is the perfectly executed union between a traditional French menu and contemporary flare. Everything exceeded our expectations: the food, the service, the atmosphere, and everything in between. French cuisine is often not my first choice - but Boucherie has me reconsidering this position given what they have been able to accomplish here.  Would highly recommend for an intimate night out, a small group gathering, or even cocktails and snacks at the bar. Some menu highlights: Foie Gras, Salade de Choux de Bruxelles Rotis, Duck Confit, Rack of Lamb",1,0,1,Seth W.,"New York, NY",6,204,171
5.0,7/17/2017,"Boucherie is a restaurant that recently opened in West Village, and it's pretty amazing. The design of the restaurant is just adorable, with tons of foliage and flowers welcoming you in from the outside, and then a sweetly designed interior featuring tile walls and a French feel. My boyfriend and I sat outside which made for great people watching in addition to a wonderful meal. The service of the entire meal was great, with waiters refilling water and cleaning tables between each course, and our waiter being very knowledgeable about both the drink list and the menu. The meal started with a bread course (hot, yeasty and crusty) featuring a plate full of marinated vegetables and aged ham. Delicious! We ordered the escargot and mussels to start, and they were both fantastic. The escargot was piping hot, buttery, lemony, garlicy, wow! The mussels held their own in a mushroom cream sauce with bits of thick cut bacon floating around. Both I would highly recommend. Next up we had entrees. I ordered the hanger steaks with white wine shallot Demi glaze, and my boyfriend had the salmon. Both were perfectly cooked and as full as we were from the first course, we could not stop eating. Perfectly savory meat and flakey salmon were the perfect combo. Finally, for dessert we ordered the crepes which were exquisite. Forget the sugar heavy nutella filled monsters you get other places, these crepes held their own with only an orange sauce for support, and a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side. Throughout our meal we sipped cocktails and beers, which were carefully selected and prepared, to a great result. I definitely recommend Boucherie for their amazing food, wonderful atmosphere, and great service.",0,0,0,Alexa P.,"New York, NY",498,102,144
5.0,7/14/2017,"So impressed with Boucherie! They really know what they're doing with their food - perfection!The steak frites was delicious - tender and flavorful meat with a peppercorn sauce drizzled on top and the most amazing fries I've ever had. Crispy on the outside, with little specks of crunchy fried goodness - I don't know how you make fries like that, there must be a special technique. You'll never want to eat any other kind of fries.  Octopus appetizer was also tasty and well prepared in a divine tomato sauce. The ice cream was amazing and you could tell it was homemade in house. The vanilla bean and chocolate were my favorite flavors. Not only is their wine high-quality (I had a very good glass of cab), but so are their cocktails -creative and delicious. I had the ""Anti Douleur"" (Rhum Clement VSOP, La Muse Verte, pineapple, coconut & orange) - amazing! Transports you to a tropical island - you must order it.Convenient location on 7th Ave and charming exterior that fits in well in the West Village. Great outdoor seating section and the interior of the restaurant is very spacious and large by NY standards. High ceilings and French country decor with elegant little details. Even their menu font and design is cute. Attentive and friendly service. Great for a date or group of friends.Best French restaurant I've been to in the city - and there are lots in NY. So many more things on their menu I wanted to try like the onion soup and bone marrow. Will be back many more times.",4,1,2,Mahsa T.,"New York, NY",992,902,770

5.0,7/12/2017,"This newish restaurant opened about seven months ago. I was really happy to have an early dinner to enjoy this location.Boucherie is a very large restaurant space. We sat inside and we were near by the outdoor seating space. After some exploring throughout the meal, the location is deceptively small. It can seat over 200 people which is not common for a lot of Greenwich Village locations.The overall décor is very open plan and welcoming. I really like the different seating spaces within the larger area. Next time, I would also like to try the outdoor seating.We really were hungry and ready to try a few different items from this new location. The staff started us off with some complimentary bread with olives with a grape tomato and prosciutto.Since it was before 7pm, we were luckily there during happy hour. The wine list looked very interesting but we looked at some craft cocktails with happy hour pricing of $10 each. We ordered the Marguerite for $10 with happy hour pricing and La Douce Framboise for $15. The Marguerite is made with Barbancourt Rhum Blanc, Green Chartreuse, lime and mint with blueberries instead of raspberries because they were out of raspberries.  La Douce Framboise is made with Barbancourt Rhum Blanc, Dolin Blanc, lemon, raspberries, and hibiscus bitter.For appetizers, we were going to try two appetizers. Our server told us that the portions were quite large so we would be able to share one comfortably. It was a good suggestion.  We ordered  the Pâtes aux Fruits de Mer  for $29. This item was very well flavored. I really liked the squid ink linguine. The seafood portion was very generous and delicious.For our entrees, we shared  Confit de Canard Pommes Salardaises for $32 with confit duck leg, frisée and truffle potatoes.  This duck was very succulent and delicious balance with the potatoes. I highly recommend it .We had a second round of cocktails to with Anti Douleur for $10 with happy hour pricing and Bouchierie Sazerac for $10 with happy hour pricing. The Anti Douleur is made with Rhum Clement CSOP, La Muse Verte, pineapple, coconut and orange. Bouchierie Sazerac is made with Ritterhouse Rye, Pierre Ferrand 1840, Vieux Pontlier, Peychaud's Bitters, madagascar vanilla and lemon.Our second entrée was the Côte de Bœuf Pour Deux for $145. This dish comes with 40 oz tomahawk rib-eye, roasted bone marrow & bordelaise. Yes, it is 40 oz. The bone marrow was fantastic with this dish. I have never had bone marrow with a meal. It was extremely tasty. The price tag is high but it was really worth it.Finally, we had one dessert to share which was the Profiteroles $10 with puff pastry was flaky, cuddled by chocolate drizzle and vanilla ice cream.",8,3,2,Paul S.,"New York, NY",136,94,1767
5.0,7/11/2017,Had a delicious dinner yesterday with my friend and I highly recommend this resto! It is definitely a little fancier and pricier but it's worth it! I loved the service and constantly great hospitality provided from everyone we encountered.Appetizers: we shared Maine lobster with burrata and orange slices and it was delicious! Entrees: I had steak frites which were delicious! Loved the crispy fries and the steak which is a large enough portion to share. It's a great place to share apps and entrees as everything is delicious and filling. My friend had an aged burger and she loved it. Her only con was that her fries were larger than mine and she prefers thin fries. Highly recommend that you let them know your preference as one of the employees said you can request.Desserts: Everything on the menu looked delicious but we chose sorbets. I would try profiteroles next time! Overall it's definitely a great date night/ impress your friends type of venue and I think you'll agree that it's totally worth it. The venue is super pretty and especially now in the warmer temperate it's great because you can dine al fresco!,2,0,0,Pamela A.,"New York, NY",169,320,699

4.0,7/11/2017,"Full disclosure, we were invited here by the management because we really enjoyed their sister restaurant, Olio e Piú. So my dinner companion and I ventured out on a weekday and had dinner at this new spot...First, absolutely beautiful restaurant in THE BEST location for serious people watching. I'm not kidding, this is a serious competitor in terms of relaxing in the Village. We did wish we had worn a few more clothes because, though it was warm outside, inside the restaurant it was quite chilly.Service was quite good, and I think the drinks we ordered were decent (I have to remember to not to order from NYC cocktail menus because invariably you'll get something that's sweeter than you desired). We had three courses but we were in-and-out in under an hour and a half (which is great for us because we don't like being out late on weekdays).But of course you want to hear about the food... So I absolutely loved my veal porterhouse and my friend enjoyed his venison. Great options for a casual night on the town. We also had the foie gras and blood sausage apps which were about par for the course. We finished the meal with a very nice tarte tartin which is one of my favorite desserts anyways so you know I loved it.All-in-all, I'd say that if you want very traditional French cuisine in a very nice and updated restaurant (and you don't mind paying a premium for the privilege), this is your new happy place.",1,0,0,Art C.,"Brooklyn, NY",179,1167,91
5.0,7/10/2017,"Enchanting, cozy yet lively spot that proves to be a great addition to the area. I was here on a beautiful summer day so the ambiance was especially inviting. Their huge front French doors were open, welcoming a warm breeze, while the city street and sounds served as the perfect juxtaposition for the intimate European flare of this casually elequant space.  I had the oysters, profiteroles, and their signature Boucherie Sazerac. All amazing (especially the profiteroles and Sazerac!). The staff, particularly Ricardo and Yoni, were incredibly accommodating, professional, and pleasant. Perfect for friends, a date, or even solo.

5.0,7/10/2017,"Yum! I wanted to try this place on the west side after hearing it is the sister restaurant of Oliu e Piu, which is one of my favorites. My sister and I made a reservation on a Thursday evening, but you likely don't need a reservation at least on a weekday as the restaurant is surprisingly spacious with both indoor and outdoor seating. We started with appetizers of the foie gras mousse and mussels. SO GOOD. The mussels are great portion size, and both dishes were very fresh. Bread is deliciously toasted, and they do not gripe if you ask for more. For our entrees, we ordered the truffle ravioli ($34), and seasonal dish of lobster and burrata. The truffle pasta was my FAVORITE with pungent truffle smell, I could not resist! Good portion size as well as was the lobster. We were surprised that it came with a whole giant ball of burrata surrounded by two full lobster tails. At around $23, this was a good deal for us. They also serve fresh bread, butter, and prosciutto/olives to start, which was yummy and very French. For dessert, we got the creme brûlée, which was also tasty and large. Only comment is that it would've been even better if the top was slightly crispier and maybe had been toasted in front of us at the table. I ordered two cocktails- the first absinthe drink, which was strong and they are known for. The second was the strawberry martini. My sister had wine. Overall, really tasty and fresh food. Menu offerings are extensive and very delicious-sounding. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. Other service was constantly taking away our plates that were done and replacing our bowls for mussels shells, which was appreciated. Definitely a must try for authentic and yummy French food in the cute neighborhood of west village!",2,0,0,Dana H.,"Manhattan, NY",766,296,1380

1.0,7/8/2017,"First impression: lovely hosts who seated us right away. And then it gets awful from here. The waiter literally fell into the back of my seat, catapulting me forward into the table. Ouch. We ordered 5 plates, one of which was mussels. We requested that the mussels arrive first, and the rest of the plates arrive once the mussels were finished- the table was very small and could not have accommodated everything at once (which is not an issue). We finish the mussels and wait, and wait, and wait. The rest of the plates arrive a little over a half hour later. No apology. Tuna tartare was flavorless, French fries tasted like burned gristle. I never send back food, and I've definitely never sent back French fries. But I guess there's a first and last time for everything. Beet salad and lobster burata salad were spot on, though. I understand mistakes happen, but own up to it. I will never go back here and would encourage other diners to not waste their time. What a disappointment.",0,0,0,Diana B.,"New York, NY",0,9,0
5.0,7/8/2017,"Wow. Service, atmosphere, and food were all amazing! Let me start with Apo, our waiter - he was not only friendly and attentive, but also really funny. I was especially impressed when he immediately noticed I was a leftie and set up the forks & knives accordingly for the main course. Also, every time I left the table, either Apo or other waiters made sure to fold the napkin neatly and put it on the table before I came back. The atmosphere was beautiful. I was happy and not surprised to find out that its partner restaurant is Dominque Bistro because the decor of both places is absolutely great! Around 6:30pm, the place opened up its red awning & seriously, I cannot explain in words how amazing that moment was - the whole place got 10 times brighter, which made our already great experience that much better. I advise everyone to sit by the doors - it was really awesome looking out at West Village while eating the amazing food!For food, my friend got Cabillaud Rôti (cod) and I got Boeuf bourguignon and both were super delicious! Honestly though, I liked the cod more than the beef but I can't complain since the beef fit so perfectly with the red wine I had (recommendation by Apo). I also tried my friend's raspberry cocktail, and for sweet lovers like me, I loved it!!! Overall amazing & highly recommend!",2,0,1,Diane C.,"Great Neck, NY",45,162,905
5.0,7/8/2017,"Boucherie transports you out of The City to a bistro in the French countryside. Beautiful large skylight, a large palm in the center of the room. It was so spacious inside and picturesque with the perfectly set dining tables amongst two open kitchens. And the food! Many dishes were French perfection! The average Yelp reviews were not wrong! My only regret is that I must have walked by this restaurant dozens of times within the last eight years and never went in! K and I went for French restaurant week during the weekday. We came for French restaurant week but opted for their versatile prix fixe. The lunch prix fixe offered so many more options! 2 courses for $30 and 3 courses for $35. I choose Poulpe provencal (baby octopus) with tomatoes and potatoes, seared scallops and creme brulee. K ordered steak tartare and Maine lobster with burrata basil oil and orange. The only dish that I didn't love was the baby octopus. The flavors of tomato and potatoes didn't blend well and the octopus was a little tough. However, seared scallops were perfectly seared and the tomato-garlic-butter sauce was so flavorful! This was one of the best seared scallops that I've ever had. The steak tartare was divine. The appetizer was very generous, filling half the plate. It was made of prime tenderloin, capers and parsley, and topped with a quail egg. Spread on the toasted baguette, this was an umami experience. I was very jealous of K's dish but thankfully he shared.K's lobster was perfectly blanched, placed in an ice bath and Oh-so-tender. The burrata was mozzarella butter in my mouth. The lobster tail dish was perfect mixture of acidity from the Mandarin oranges, bitterness from the basil olive oil and salinity from the lobster.There was a perfect crunch to the creme brulee as my spoon broke through. And the creme brulee was creamy custardy vanilla flavor; it was a classic and well executed. I could see the vanilla beans at the bottom of the dish. The caveats were that the staff was a little green: forgetting pieces of the menu, missing forks, telling me that they were going to leave out the creme brulee unless I request it after my app and entree. It would have been more informative to advise me that the app and entree are generously portioned and give me a false choice instead. These are very easily remedied problems.All in all, the lunch at Boucherie is an excellent experience. I can't wait to go back!",11,3,9,Doreen L.,"Queens, NY",1214,1020,7030
4.0,7/8/2017,"From the management of the impeccable Dominique Bistro and Olio e Piu comes their latest establishment, the open and spacious Boucherie! The space is huge for the West Village, nestled comfortably in the 7th st intersection with ample space for outdoor seating as well as plenty of room inside. I sat outside with my boyfriend amidst the pretty floral arrangements and enjoyed the perfect summer weather.We started with a glass of brunello di montalcino, which was excellent and smooth. Paired with the complimentary bread, olives and sampling of meat as well as our appetizer of foie gras, we appreciated the Italian red immensely. I also ordered the octopus salad, which was plated beautifully with tomatoes, potatoes and peppers, but I felt that some of the octopus was a bit tough and could have been cooked less.As for the mains, my boyfriend's lamp chop was extremely tasty. Although it had been cooked more medium well than the medium rare he requested, we both thought it was seasoned well and had a perfect crunch. The squid ink linguini I had came with a very generous helping of jumbo shrimp and squid, but I have to agree with another reviewer here that it arrived quite lukewarm. Some of the dish was hot but it had not been evenly dispersed.We took our waiter's recommendation for the tarte tatin dessert, and I thought it was delicious! I enjoyed the addition of granola to the dish as I have not encountered that before. I finished the meal with a glass of cote du rhone, which was spicier than the first but equally to my taste. The meal ended with a sudden downpour of rain, and we quickly moved inside to finish the last of the wine. The service throughout was prompt and attentive, and they also were quick in getting any outside diners settled in this situation.

5.0,7/7/2017,"Wow... during my visit to NYC this was hands down the best dining experience I had in a trip full of amazing dining experiences.  I had previously eaten at Dominique Bistro, Boucherie's sister restaurant, so when one of the managers here (Zorica) informed me that Boucherie had recently opened up, I was more than happy to drop in for dinner to check it out!Firstly - big props to the staff for being so flexible with my dining arrangements.  Due to a hectic work schedule I had to change my initial reservation several times, and we actually showed up about an hour late for dinner.  The hosts were totally understanding and seated me and my 2 coworkers promptly on their beautiful outdoor seating area.Between the three of us, we sampled a TON of food, all of which was superb (rarely do I find a restaurant where I enjoy pretty much everything on the menu!)  My thoughts on each:- Escargot (4/5): Lovely, buttery, and HUGE snails - and 12 to a plate!  Very generous portions.  Amazing appetizer to share with your dining companions.- Roasted Brussels Sprouts salad (5/5): I loved this.  Light, healthy, with some nice acidity added from the vinaigrette which complemented the roasted sprouts nicely.- Steak Tartare (3.5/5): Still quite good but it had a bit of a ""gamier"" texture than other steak tartare I've tried.  The quail egg was a nice touch (the yolk adds a lot of depth to the meat!)- Cote de Veau Aux Champignons (5/5): YES - this was definitely the star of the meal. I would give this a 6/5 actually - this 16 oz veal porterhouse was absolutely phenomenal.  One of the best dishes I've ever had.  Perfectly cooked medium rare, tender and juicy with great depth of flavor.  The sauce and enoki mushrooms were a lovely complement to the meat.  Highly, highly recommended - just as good as the best beef steak I've ever eaten!- Crème Brulee (4/5): One of my favorite desserts, and Boucherie knocked it out of the park.  Nice crispy brulee layer on top, lovely and deep vanilla flavor in the custard - wonderful in every respect.I didn't try my coworkers' main dishes (Trout with almonds, and 16 oz dry aged bone-in NY strip) but they both looked superb, and my coworkers couldn't stop raving about each, so I'm guessing they loved their food as much as I enjoyed mine.The ambience here is great (modern French, very chic) and in a great area - grab the outside seating if possible so you can people-watch as you eat!  Cocktails here are on point as well.  The only minor issue we had with our meal is that our server, although very friendly and knowledgeable, tended to disappear for long periods of time.  Towards the end of the dinner, we pretty much waited an extra hour just to get dessert and the bill because he came by so rarely to check on us.  Not enough to detract from an otherwise perfect dining experience, but just a point to improve upon for the restaurant.OVERALL: 5/5.  Absolutely amazing food - that veal porterhouse dish is still ingrained in my mind as one of the best things I've eaten all year.  Lovely restaurant - huge thanks and compliments to Zorica & team for arranging such a fantastic dinner!  It was one of the highlights of my trip in a week of eating some of the best food that NYC has to offer.",4,0,0,Eric C.,"Katy, TX",305,498,2499
2.0,7/4/2017,"This place looks cute and inviting with its outdoor seating and all but I wasn't prepared to spend 2 hours here waiting for food. Maybe it was just is because the people around us got food, ate, and left before we got our order (an omelet and a burger). If the food was amazing I'd give more than two stars but it wasn't. It's a shame because the place is really cute. Service not cute.",0,0,0,Joey C.,"Brooklyn, NY",132,28,0
5.0,7/4/2017,"I was invited to dine at Boucherie after dining at sister restaurant, Dominique Bistro.  I love the aesthetic of both places.  Somehow Boucherie was able to mimic the tranquility of Dominique despite being on a major street, instead of a quiet corner.  The space is beautiful.  We loved the high ceilings, the subway tiles, the French posters and oversized mirrors.  It all feels very light and airy.  Great spot for a date night in the Village.We ordered dirty gin martinis.  They were excellent.  I am pretty obsessed with the martinis I get at another spot I frequent, but these may actually be giving those a run for their money.  They also have a pretty good wine list.  I work in wine so I'm always interested in the palette of the restaurant, especially when it's French.  Our meal: steak tartare, octopus, scallops, trout and profiteroles. I liked the steak tartare.  Despite being loaded with capers, it wasn't salty but actually quite subtlely flavored.  My absolute favorite dish of the night was the octopus with stewed tomato.  The things they do to a tomato are otherworldly.  Seriously, I'm jealous.  Quite literally.  The octopus was also cooked perfectly with the right amount of char and the perfect texture.  And again, those damn tomatoes.  Are you kidding?  So good!I ordered the rainbow trout, which was very good but incredibly rich.  A few of the bites had bits of fresh lemon but it was mostly a brown butter fiesta, which is great if you haven't already snacked down on appetizers.  I could only eat one piece and gave the rest to my girlfriend.  She ordered the scallops.  Yummm!  She only gave me one bite, so my opinion is based on getting only one bite of the scallops and her refusing to give me any more bites of the scallops.Despite my full tummy, I found a way to squeeze in the profiteroles.  Our waiter, who was amazing by the way, suggested them when we were leaning towards the chocolate mousse.  So glad we changed our minds.  The warm, semi-sweet chocolate sauce and the little puff pastries were soooooo tasty.  There may or may not have been a little battle of the spoons for the last one (you get three).As I just mentioned, in addition to the great food, it's really the service that makes Boucherie stand out.  Everyone is very attentive, charming and professional.  I watched as one of our servers cut up a young girl's steak so that she could eat it and allow her mom to enjoy her food as well.  It's little things like that which really make a place stand out.  I'll definitely be going back and bringing my friends with me.",4,1,2,Rian A.,"Brooklyn, NY",237,107,118

5.0,6/30/2017,"I discovered this new-ish French restaurant in West Village. I had dined at this location a few years ago, but it was a completely different restaurant. They told us that they have been oped for about 7 months ago. It had beautiful exterior, lots of greenery, red awning, and red brick building with very nice outdoor seating. I say they are bringing out the French atmosphere pretty nicely! The inside was really large and spacious with lots of seating. It was quite beautiful with lots and lots of natural light, simple and clean white tile floor, and many French-inspired artworks on the walls. They had one large plant in the middle of the room, which really makes you notice the high ceiling. The interior had lots of wood, from furniture, bar, and ceiling. It was very welcoming and warm.Once we settled in and got our orders in, they brought out some complimentary bread and antipasti. It had olives, a grape tomato, and prosciutto. I am not a big fan of olives, so my hubby got to have them all. He really enjoyed them. The prosciutto was very fresh and super tasty.We had some cocktails, Marguerite, La Douce Framboise, Anti Douleur, and Bouchierie Sazerac. As for La Douce Framboise, they are out of raspberry...but then they told me that they could make the drink with blueberries instead. So I tried that, and it was amazing!!! All the cocktails were great high quality and very tasty. For food, we had Pâtes aux Fruits de Mer for appetizer, and Confit de Canard Pommes Salardaises, and Côte de Bœuf Pour Deux as main. They were all generous portions, the appetizer could be a main dish. They were all super delicious, they were created with care, we loved them all! We ended with Profiteroles and cappuccino, a perfect ending to a perfect dinner.  The manager came to greet us towards the end, he was very nice, polite and courteous. Our waitress was very nice at the beginning, but it felt like she got kind of cold towards us soon after... She was still polite, just not very friendly. Everyone else was really friendly through, all the staff took care of us, including their Sommelier (yes they have great French and other wine selections). Our table got cleaned after each dish, we got clean plates with each dish, and our water filled at all time. We had a really nice dinner here, I would love to go back for more amazing dishes in a near future! If you are looking for a nice French restaurant or amazing cocktails, you know where to go.

5.0,6/30/2017,"Had a fantastic dinner at Boucherie. It's the perfect location right off 6th Ave in West Village. The inside is spacious with great lighting and decor. It felt like we were in an elegant Parisian cafe. As the name hints at, it is much more focused on meat dishes, but even as a vegetarian I found options. You get free bread, olives, and a piece of prosciutto. We ordered the Caesar salad and endive salad to start. Both were fresh and much larger than expected. I could have eaten the salad alone as an entree. For the main course I had the mushroom truffle ravioli. The sauce was amazing and rich, and it was a good size for ravioli. My boyfriend had the strip steak and thought it was cooked perfectly. To finish we had the profiteroles, a pastry stuffed with ice cream and covered in chocolate sauce. I wish we had tried the creme brûlée instead, since the chocolate sauce was a little too rich for me. If you like chocolate, you should try it.It is a pricier place, but similar to other restaurants in west village on price. Overall, I highly recommend for a date night or dinner with guests in town!",3,0,0,Megan P.,"New York, NY",265,133,143
5.0,6/30/2017,"Excellent upscale French bistro food with one of the best NYC terrace in the middle of the West Village. I dined al fresco with two girlfriends earlier this week and we had a great time. We shared the frisée aux lardons (with delicious crunchy and juicy lardons) and the foie gras mousse (served with very good grilled bread and a red onion compote) to start. I then had the ongle the boeuf, served bistro style with a stunning wine sauce, and perfectly medium rare. The flavor was intense, the meat moist and perfectly seasoned. My friends had the roasted chicken served over grilled vegetables and the atlantic salmon with mashed potatoes. We also shared the ratatouille and the side of grilled mushrooms. We all shared the apple tarte tatin to finish (served a la mode with ice cream and caramel sauce). Super good too, the apples where so nicely caramelized and sweet, it was a real treat. Portions are very generous, and invite conviviality (aka tasting everyone's dishes!). Adding to this a couple cocktails and some rosé, made for a perfect girlfriend's night out. It's an indulgent experience, but the atmosphere is both great for a celebration (of food and friends!) or a more casual night out (saw lots of date nights, groups of friends, etc). Highly recommended.",4,0,2,Jessica S.,"Manhattan, NY",205,458,332
5.0,6/30/2017,"We came here on a Thursday night at 7pm. We had a reservation for 2 and we were seated at the indoor area. The restaurant is spacious with a classy interior and huge mirrors. There were outdoor seatings as well. Now the food:- escargot: delicious and the garlic oil was perfect with the bread. My only comment is that there was too much oil on the top, which didn't result in the best presentation. - duck confit: the skin on the leg was so crispy. The meat was good but could be a bit fatter or moist. The salad and chips blended well with the rest of the dish.- veal porterhouse: this was recommended by our server and it's the best dish we had for the night. The veal was thick, juicy and tender.",2,0,0,Patrick N.,"New York, NY",321,252,846
5.0,6/29/2017,"If you're looking for upscale, quality French dining, look no further. Love the atmosphere and the fact that they have a huge space with ample seating.The food was just top notch. To start, my friend and I got the escargot and the mussels. The escargot is good in the butter sauce, but the mussels really stole the show. It comes in a white wine shallot sauce that is TO DIE FOR. I swear I could drink it like soup. The mussels also come with mushrooms and cuts of pork I believe.For entrees, we shared the duck confit and hanger steak. Both really good in their respective ways. The duck confit had perfectly crispy skin and juicy meat along with the thin slices of potato chips. The hanger steak was melt in your mouth though. Despite it being served atop a bunch of sauce, the sauce wasn't overpowering. The meat was so tender and just perfect.The sommelier Paul that was serving us was just great and I loved the Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Gris I had with my meal.Profiteroles were a great dessert to top everything off with. Basically like an upscale, open cream puff! Great meal and great service. Was so full and happy that I even forgot to take my leftovers lol",4,0,1,Laura S.,"Manhattan, NY",226,419,778
5.0,6/29/2017,"My first thought when I arrived at Boucherie: what a beauuuuutiful place!  The ambiance definitely gives the French vibe perfectly with greens here and there, an open kitchen, a butcher counter, and lots of seating both indoor and outdoor. I had already loved the sister restaurant, Olio E Piu, which also has a relaxed yet classy vibe. I couldn't wait to try Boucherie. This place is perfect for large groups or even just on a nice date.  That night: a nice date it was!My husband and I came here about an hour before sunset. The lighting was perfect and we sat next to the floor to ceiling windows that were opened. As we sat down, we were greeted by the manager, Zorica, and our server, Mickey (my apologies for misspelling your name if I have!)  Even throughout the dinner, we noticed every single staff member was attentive and friendly. With similar outstanding service at the other restaurant, I really wish I could have met the owner just to let him know that I can tell that not only does quality of the food matter in his restaurants, but so do service and proper etiquette.  If only every creator of a restaurant had that same philosophy and strong passion, there would never be a B or a C in those NYC restaurant grades! We started with a glass of wine each. I am sad to say that I did not write down the name of my wine. I like having servers choose my wine sometimes, just so I can branch out of my usual sauvignon blancs and roses. Though the prices of the wine list may seem really high at first, I'd say it is comparable to other nice restaurants as this is a higher class French restaurant with again, top notch service. They served complimentary bread and a plate of pickled foods, which I found amazing. Having never really eaten the breads that usually come for free, I thoroughly enjoyed this plate of bites - according to one of the workers, it was pickled and olive oil soaked artichokes, olives, ham, and a tuna-stuffed red pepper. As our appetizer, we ordered the escargots (cooked snail). It came out bubbling hot! A generous portion of 12 snails, 2 in each dip of the dish, they were soaked in garlic, lemon, butter and parsley and cooked perfectly. I loved the flavors, and although it may have been a bit on the heavier side, I loved every bite of it.  If you have leftover bread, dip it in the sauce and you will feel like you're in heaven!  So so good... The feature dish of the night was indeed the Tomahawk steak and roasted bone marrow with bordelaise. My husband and I decided to share the dish because we both love bone marrow but never tried the Tomahawk before. Little did we know that the portion was going to be incredibly large (we found out afterwards that it usually feeds 3-4 people!)  I felt a bit embarrassed afterwards not knowing how large the dish was but also really glad to have tried such an incredible combination.  The steak was superb - tender, cooked perfectly medium as asked, and soaked with sauce on the bottom of the pan (yes pan, not a plate). It literally melts in your mouth and each bite leaves you longing for more.  However, just to warn you as I learned my lesson, it is a very large portion, so decide wisely, my friends.  Either way, it'll change...your... life.Lastly, we ended the night with creme brulee.  It's a French restaurant after all, and since wedidn't get the French onion soup or the steak tartare, we had to get something classic from France!  The torched layer of hard caramel on top with the rich custard base was perfect all around. As you scoop down, you get that creamy texture with a bite of the crispy caramel. It wasn't too sweet at all, which I find to be one of the more difficult criteria in creating this dessert.  Overall, Boucherie is the place to go for an authentic French restaurant. It's a taste of Paris for sure!  Thank you so much Zorica for your kind service and checking in frequently. I will be back soon!",8,5,4,Lilian N.,"Queens, NY",397,215,397
4.0,6/29/2017,"service: 5/5ambiance & interior: 5/5 food: 4.5/5 As soon as I sat down, I felt like in europe. The interior is really sophisticated and well designed. Not too much - just right amount of french atmosphere. We had Foie gras & steak tartar for appetizers. Both were amazing and portion was quite big. The foie gras came with toasts which were sweet and good. Especially the caramelized onion on the foie gras dish was very special. The manager explained to us how they were cooked but.. can't recall exactly but sounded good. For the main dish, we had lamb steak and veal steak. Both were very good. I wished the veal had less spices but my friend like the way it was. I preferred lamb dish which was very soft. The couscous on the dish was very delish as well. Both portions were huge. We had ice cream for dessert - espresso, pistachio, and vanilla bean. They all tasted authentic gelato. My fav was vanilla and espresso but liked them all really.After all, the service was amazing and the foods were quite impressive! I would definitely like to come back with a big group of friend.",2,0,1,Solah H.,"New York, NY",39,89,288
5.0,6/29/2017,"I just returned home from dinner at Boucherie, and knew that I had to write about this lovely restaurant right away - not that I'll be forgetting about this experience anytime soon. Starting with the service, the hostess and servers were all extremely attentive and so friendly. My fiancé and I were never left with an empty glass or dirty plate throughout our meal. Boucherie has great beers on tap, though we also really enjoyed the cocktails (I, the Lillete spritz, and he, the usual old fashioned) which did not skimp on the alcohol! The quality of the food and the portion sizes easily justify the menu prices. We started with an appetizer each - he went with the classic French onion soup and I went with the fried calamari and rock shrimp. To my surprise, the fried appetizer was HUGE and plenty to share between the both of us (although I really didn't want to share...) Despite being fried, the seafood was not greasy at all and the breading was perfectly seasoned and paired with a tasty spicy mayo. My fiancé claims that the French onion soup was one of the best he's had and devoured every last spoonful. For our entrees, he went with the seared cod while I tested out the filet mignon with truffle butter. The entrees took a bit more time to prepare but was worth every second of waiting. I don't think I've had a better steak in the city that was cooked to perfection at medium rare. I was already feeling a bit full from the hearty appetizers but managed to clean my plate. The steak had an indescribably delicious smoky flavor and paired well with the truffle butter, which was savory but not overwhelming. I didn't get to try my fiancé's seared cod because he, too, had cleared his plate before I had the chance!At the recommendation of our charming waiter, we saved room for dessert and ordered the profiteroles. Nothing could have hit the spot better than the rich vanilla ice cream and warm profiterole pastry shells. Again, I was fighting with my fiancé to eat more than him! The atmosphere at Boucherie is also really wonderful. Coincidentally, my fiancé and I are about to leave to a trip to Paris, and this makes us so excited for the bistro setting. It's a perfect place to 'people watch' in the city, to catch up with friends, or to have an intimate date. Overall, it was such a beautiful meal and I would highly recommend Boucherie.

The braised lamb shank was practically falling off the bone, and each bite was so rich. The veal porterhouse was juicy, tender, flavorful, and had just the right amount of fat. The escargot was chewy and swimming in fragrant garlic butter. Profiteroles dessert was absolutely amazing; the pastry was firm, the ice cream was sweet, and the chocolate sauce was very very good. The complimentary bread came with prosciutto, artichoke, and sweet peppers. Cocktail was strong and refreshing all in one.

Small round tables, a mosaic floor, a large bar and waiters everywhere. There was outside seating as well. I had eggs that morning for breakfast so I did not want to eat off the brunch menu so I got the Boucherie burger and a cup of coffee, I ordered it medium well-it arrived medium rare but it was still delicious!

5.0,6/26/2017,"For food lovers in search of your next great meal- Boucherie is a French bistro worth adding to the list. This place gets a 5 star in my book, here's why.Food: First and foremost, the food was delectable. While the price may veer on the expensive side, for the quality and portion size, it's worth the value. The meal started off with complimentary French bread and a plate of Olive oil, figs, sweet pepper slices, olives, and Prosciutto. While it seemed like an odd combination, the blend was surprisingly right on. The flavors and textures all went well together. I knew from the complimentary bread course that I was in for a good night.Appetizers: We shared the Escargot and Blood Sausage. Appetizers were generous- these alone could be enough for dinner. The escargot was baked in a flavorful garlic butter sauce (I loved dipping my bread in it) and the blood sausage was accompanied by impeccable potato puree and caramelized apples.Entrees: For entrees, we had the Duck Confit Leg and Veal Porterhouse. Presentation was spot on. The duck was very well prepared, but what really stands out was the Veal. I'm not usually a fan of Veal, but this took Veal to another level. The veal was seared and prepared like a steak. I ordered it Medium instead of the recommended Medium rare, and it was PERFECT- I mean PERFECT. The meat was tender, flavorful, and melted in my mouth. Dessert- For dessert, we split the Crepe Suzette. Even the vanilla ice cream was a step above what you're normally served.Atmosphere and Service:I was surprised by the size of the restaurant, very unusual for the Village. There was beautiful natural lightening and a lovely sky window. The Pride Parade was right outside and the restaurant was bustling and energetic with fun music. Since the restaurant was so spacious, I was still able to enjoy a quiet spot on the second floor and have a nice dinner date. Service was exceptional: I made a reservation ahead of time and was greeted with welcoming and positive energy.  Throughout the meal, service was attentive and friendly. We always had what we needed.Overall: The overall experience here was great. We dined for over 2 hours and indulged in a lovely 3 course dinner. Restaurants like these remind you how lucky you are to live in the food capital of the world. I'd love to come back to this bistro again with a group of friends.

5.0,6/23/2017,"Boucherie is such a beautiful spot in West Village. Walking up to it, I felt like I was being transported into a romantic European setting. Especially on a nice summer night, the spacious outdoor seating area is a treat.I came here with one of my girl friends to catch up over dinner. We were seated inside but next to the wide-open French doors, getting the best of both indoor and outdoor seating. We had a full three course meal that did not disappoint! We had a very hard time deciding on what to get because everything looked so good. After ordering, I spied many dishes going to other tables that I'd love to try next time I dine here.Firstly, the cocktails were good and quite strong. The menu also had a few dedicated absinthe drinks. Secondly, appetizers. mushroom ravioli is a must-order. The fois gras was also quite delicious! The portion sizes at Boucherie are also very generous. I feel either of these could've filled me for a light lunch!Thirdly, main course. This was a highlight for sure. We ordered the 40 oz rib eye, cooked medium, and it was amazing. Lastly, dessert. We shared a creme brulee because after the apps and steak, neither of us could handle a dessert each! The brulee was nicely done and topped with strawberries, which is a nice touch. All in all, had an amazing experience here. Wait staff took great care of us, recommended a wine pairing for the steak, and even replaced a knife I accidentally dropped into my ravioli without me having to ask! We enjoyed the meal so much we hardly noticed 3 hours go by.I will certainly be back, and highly recommend Boucherie- for dates, impressing parents, business clients, birthdays, or just a nice meal out with friends.",2,0,3,Jane S.,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",55,96,180
5.0,6/22/2017,"I've passed by this spacious, gorgeous restaurant a bunch of times as I walked by the West Village, and I finally tried this place out with a friend. We actually went to Paris together a year ago, and hadn't had traditional French fare since then. And Boucherie didn't disappoint. It was pretty empty when we arrived around 6:30PM, but it became pretty crowded by 8 or so.We had the steak tartare and escargot for appetizers. They are both SO good - I highly recommend both. The steak tartare is tender with larger chunks (not minced). I would describe the main flavor profile is mustard with hint of capers. I love both those things, so that was great.I loved the escargot even more. It's garlicky, oily, and rich - how can someone not love that right? And they're already taken out of the shell so it's effortless. Also, you can't tell from the pics, but theres like about 3 or so morsels in every hole in the plate. So you're getting like almost 20 pieces of escargot (not only 6 as the plate would make it seem). Another tip, use the complimentary bread they give you to sop up the garlicky oil. So good.For mains, my friend had the steak frites au poivre (steak & fries) & I had the cote de veau aux champignons (veal porterhouse). We shared both, and I was pleased to find that they were very different in flavor. I preferred the veal, but the fries were so perfectly crispy. In terms of drinks, we tried various wines (which were all wonderful) and my friend had one cocktail: the provence martini. It said lavender infused grey goose, and my friend is a sucker for lavender flavored alcohol. However, we're both warning you - it's VERY strong. For dessert, we went with the profiteroles, which are like 3 mini ice cream sandwiches with cream puffs for the bread part. It's then covered in chocolate sauce. Yum!So the food & the drinks were great - BUT the thing that really put this place over the top was the service. All of the staff were so kind and attentive. I feel awful because I can't remember our server's name, but he was just the most charming, funny man. I feel like I'm doing the world a disservice by not telling you all his name.

A total NYC scene.We started with the salad before digging into the steak au poivre. I gotta say the fries were crisp and delicious, and the steak was heavenly.

For dessert, try the Crepe Suzette made with Grand Marnier & coupled with vanilla ice cream.For drinks, try the pain killer or the delicious sauvignon blanc.

4.0,6/9/2017,"Definitely agree with a lot of these reviews on Yelp - the restaurant space is beautiful, definitely feels like you're transported to Paris for a day :) Since it's summer and the restaurant is completely opened up, love how the sunlight hit our table even though we were sitting inside!They have a pretty extensive menu so take your time looking through it, but here is what we tried:Before the meal, they serve up some complimentary bread + meats/olives/peppers :)Anti Douleur $10While we were waiting for our food, I decided to get a cocktail - tip: from 4-7pm, it's what they call their ""green hour"" - all cocktails and absinthe are $10!The Anti Douleur was one of their absinthe cocktails, pretty good! Tasted like a pina colada, and don't worry, they only add a spritz of absinthe ;).Steak Tartare $21 (the smaller size)Man am I glad we got the smaller size (they sell a larger portion for $27), it came with plenty of steak tartare. On top of the tartare, they give you a quail egg yolk that you can mix in on your own. Flavor was good, loved how it had a strong spicy mustardy kick to it. The tartare chunks are a bit larger here than other tartares that I've had from other places.Mousse de Foie Gras $22YUMMMMM. Comes with a pretty big chunk of foie gras mousse! The bread that comes with it is toasted, which is really nice. The onion compote in the red wine sauce really complimented the creamy texture of the mousse. If it gets too heavy, take a bite of the frisee salad that comes with it! Must get!Cote de Veau Aux Champignons $54Was super tempted to get one of those steaks for 2, but unfortunately neither of us were THAT hungry that day. So we decided on this 16oz milk-fed veal porterhouse - at first, the color looks quite weird (aka i was expecting more of a beef steak color as i have seen in other restaurants), but I think it's a much lighter color due to the fact that it's milk-fed. Anyways, it's pretty delicious and moist and cooked perfectly at a medium rare. I have to say the sweetbreads might have been a little overcooked, but all in all a good dish.Confit de Canard $32Maybe i'm just not a superfan of duck leg, but i thought this dish was a little dry. Perhaps it was just a tad bit overcooked, but the meat still slid off the bone really easily! Skin was also nice a crispy. It came with some yummy potato chips and a frisee salad.Creme Brulee $10Pretty good! Your first bite might be overly sweet, but it gets much better once you really start digging into it. Pair each bite with some of the strawberries and raspberries that come on top. This is a rather large portion so good dish to share!Service was A+, very attentive and helpful! Would love to come back here to try the onion soup, and probably one of the steak dishes!

1.0,6/3/2017,"Terrible , terrible. I am from New York, I have never NOT left a tip at any restaurant in this city.We ordered food. Every french bistro brings bread before appetizers come - not here. We had to ask for it, they brought two nasty pieces of a cheap, dry bread. But hey, I thought - whatever. Food comes, no proper silverware - we had steaks. It took 5 minutes to find a waiter willing to give me a steak knife (this restaurant has a lot of staff, by the way). Waiters kept interrupting us while eating asking whether we want our glasses refilled - should be automatic.We finished our steaks, took the waiter 10 mins to notice we were done because he was schmoozing. I had to ask another waiter to run my credit card, who then gave my credit card to another waiter who instead of letting me pay held my credit card and continued talking to people. When we called to speak with a manager to tell her what was going on, she looked at us , smiled and said "" ok, ok, thank you"" , turned around and left. Basically, a big fuck you. We have been customers of Cherche Midi and Balthazar for years. Before that Pastis as well. This place tries to be that in terms of the decor, menu, and prices but cannot compete.

5.0,5/24/2017,"Boucherie is a truly beautiful and upscale french restaurant in the west village. Walk in and you feel transported out of a noisy, bustling city, to a whole different world - a romantic, chic, and modern french experience. To say that the decor is well thought out is an understatement. Dining here is not just about the fantastic cuisine, but the experience varies from being able to sit right in the main dining area (where you will literally feel like you're part of movie set in paris), second floor mezzanine dining, outdoors, by their butcher counter, or even by the long gorgeous bar located right upon entrance (FYI they have a HH menu consisting of absinthe and absinthe cocktails 4-7pm $10!). Every section looked enchanting and inviting, promising of adventures for whatever flavorful journey you'd be feeling on any particular night.We had a table for two for an early-ish dinner and left happily stuffed and very satisfied. We sat in the main dining area right next to the lovely piano. The service was incredible, staff was friendly and started us off with drinks. I had a great recommendation from our server for a pinot gris and also tried the Boucherie old fashioned. Both were wonderful selections and went fine with the food we ordered. For dinner, we tried the escargot de bourgogne,  salade d'auverne and the cote de boeuf pour deux. Everything was so delicious and filling, we didn't even have enough room for dessert!Salade D'Auvergne: This was a very light and delicious salad with baby arugula, endives, candied walnuts, semi hard french bleu cheese, and apples with a walnut vinaigrette. It was a great opener and was good for sharing too! I loved the candied walnuts, it added a nice contrast in texture and all the ingredients combined well together. Escargot de Bourgogne: This came out super hot, but so delectable! We could have just kept eating this dish! Flavored with lemon, garlic, shallot, butter, and parsley the escargot was just fabulous. I may have burned my tongue a bit in my haste to continue neatly devouring this, but it was totally worth it! Cote de Boeuf Pour Deux: I literally just had a conversation with a friend earlier in the day who said that steak pretty much tastes the same regardless of where you go. That friend obviously has never tried the steak here. This 40oz tomahawk ribeye with roasted bone marrow and bordelaise is - legit life changing. I can't even tell you how wonderfully cooked it was - because I may be too busy drooling from reminiscing this steak. Seriously - this was some tasty, tender, melt in your mouth deliciousness. Cooked and presented beautifully!  I don't give 5 stars often at all, but service was impeccable, ambiance and decor was just lovely, the food made us smile in delight, and I think once you visit Boucherie, you'd want to go back just to try all the other things they have on the menu! I'd love to revisit for some absinthe cocktails and dessert...and of course some more steak and escargot! (so in actuality...pretty much everything!) Thanks so much Boucherie!",7,2,3,Deanna S.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",160,149,1264
5.0,5/23/2017,Boucherie is a beautiful space with beautiful food. Their escargot is one of the best I've had in the city.

5.0,5/21/2017,"For those looking for the quintessential Parisian bistro experience, look no further than one of the latest newcomers to Manhattan's West Village: Boucherie. The restaurant opened at the end of 2016 to no small amount of acclaim, thanks to the fact that Chef Jerom Dihui (former chef of McNally's now shuttered Pastis) is behind the kitchens. The venue has a sprawling dining room and bar area that gets plenty of sunlight during the earlier hours, as well as a balcony on the second floor - for those looking to impress. Everything about the decor, from the sizeable mirror hung behind the bar, to the marble-patterned tables and tiled floors, is true to form.On a breezy Saturday evening, the restaurant was happily buzzing and unsurprisingly occupied - reservations in advance, especially on busy days, are recommended. We had our pick of seats (I recommend taking a table near the windowed doors or on the patio) and were soon greeted by our server and Paul, the sommelier. When I asked him for a wine recommendation (a white or sparkling, not too dry) he pointed out an effervescent and slightly sweet Brut Rose, which he asked me to taste first to make sure it was to my liking. Pinning down choices from the food menu, however, wasn't quite as easy... So we ending up ordering almost all the dishes that had caught our eyes.For our starters, we had gone with the Escargot and the Foie Gras Mousse. The former were served piping hot and generously drenched in an addictive garlic, butter, and parsley sauce; they were pleasantly toothsome and had none of the aftertaste I've sometimes encountered in dishes that weren't executed to par. Ask for an extra side of bread to soak up the remaining sauce - it's that good. My personal favorite, however, had to be the Foie Gras Mousse. It's beautifully presented with a side of red wine onion compote, frisee, and toasted bread; there are few things more perfectly balanced than a spread of the rich foie gras against the sweet-tartness of the onion compote supported by the firm, slightly crunchy bread. It may appear to be simple, but there's a reason why this dish has stood the test of time.When it came to the entrees, I immediately gravitated to towards the Duck Confit, which is served with a portion of confited duck leg, frisee salad, and a generous serving of black truffle chips. The duck had a delightful crisp skin that yielded to a flavorful dark meat, which paired well with the lighter salad that had the protein interspersed throughout it. I was able to try the Veal Porterhouse as well, which came impressively presented with the bone still in. It was cooked to the requested medium rare and each portion of meat was juicy and tender, pairing well with the red wine-infused veal jus that it was served with. We rounded out our meal with a side of Fries (crispy, hot, and perfectly seasoned) as well as a rustic Ratatouille, made with roasted tomatoes, zucchini, onions, and mushrooms.What makes Boucherie excel, however, is the caliber of service. Our plates were always promptly cleared and our server was always nearby to check on us; when I dropped my knife off the table, she was immediately at my side with a new one. And while I may not be a wine expert, those who do appreciate it will easily get lost in conversation with their Sommelier, Paul; he took a great deal of time to speak with us about his previous experiences (including Le Bernardin) and answered every question we had, from the wines available at Boucherie to the levels of certification as indicated by his Sommerlier pin.I very much look forward to returning now that the weather will allow for dining al fresco - and for those looking for a leisurely and welcoming meal in the city, Boucherie will certainly exceed your expectations.",54,25,38,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

5.0,5/18/2017,Beyond amazing. That's all I can say. The pictures speak for themselves. The rich flavors of the food did not over power each other but rather complimented each other. The steak tartare was the best I have ever had. The steak melted in my mouth and the quail egg was so delicate and mild and really complimented the dish. The bartender Stefan is an excellent mixologist and that always makes the experience that much better.  The employees are a very nice and diverse group of people and that is always nice to see. Dominick Pepe the executive chef is warm and friendly and he really seems to take pride in his work.    I was here for lunch and I can't wait to follow up after I go to dinner here.

5.0,5/17/2017,"I've been to Boucherie more times than I can count before writing this review but I can attest that its attention to quality sets it apart from all the rest when it comes to French Brasseries. 5.0/5.0They do a lot of things right and steaks are among the top.  I've had the steak for two, and steak au pouvre. They're cooked to exact spec and always a reliable choice when faced with uncertainty. The squid ink pasta is also noteworthy bc it's to-die for. Starters include almost everyone's favorite, French Onion Soup because it's the thing to do. Escargot, steak tartare are also must-haves alongside a charcuterie playe that you must order a la carte.They also have a host of desserts, namely chocolate variety, but also pick creme brulee, it's always a solic choice.Service is bar none, the best I've experienced anywhere.

That hint of bacon and aged gruyère made every bite wonderful. I then ordered the hangar steak (Onglet de bœuf à la lyonnaise). That's 14 oz of juicy goodness. It was tender, flavorful and delightful.  That white wine shallot demi-glaze is great. My best friend ordered the Pates aux Fruits de Mer, which is a squid ink linguine with sepia and rock shrimp.

1.0,4/25/2017,"I had really high hopes for this restaurant. With mostly good reviews and outdoor seating, it seemed like the perfect Sunday lunch to enjoy the nice weather...not the case. To set the scene, I walked in at 2:15pm with 2 friends on a Sunday afternoon and we were seated immediately. We were not in a rush and our initial impression of the restaurant and staff was pleasant. It took a while for our waiter to come over to take our order and we noticed the table next to us getting frustrated because their food had not yet arrived, so as soon as the waiter came over to us we placed our drink and food order. The waiter did not write anything down, which is never a good sign. After some time our drinks finally came. We finished them and were still waiting for our food, so the waiter came by to apologize for the delay (which was very nice). We ordered another round of drinks because we were bored and hungry and still had no food. Side note: Does this restaurant offer bread? We did not receive any nor were we offered any. At this point it is 3:45pm and we are a little confused, but reasonably calm until a table that had shown up maybe 20 minutes before this RECEIVED THEIR FOOD. So when we sat down there were diners at this table. During the time we were sitting there waiting, we had watched a table next to us receive their food, people paid and got up, new diners arrived and then THEY received their food. Naturally the 3 tables surrounding them (all who also did not have their food) started getting very upset with the waiter. Now, I wish I could tell you about the food and turn this review around completely...but I did not get to try the food. After all of this our food came...and my food was wrong. I had to order something without the cheese due a dietary restriction, the waiter assured me it could be made without cheese, the manager basically made the excuse that my food was taking long because I ordered it without cheese...and then the food showed up with cheese. And to top it off the manager tried to tell me it wasn't cheese and that it was an artichoke. An artichoke?! It was clearly stringy, melted cheese. She said they would make me a new dish, but after over an hour and a half wait I was not interested in waiting another hour and a half for poached eggs and sauteed spinach. As soon as the food came we asked for our check and the waiter said they were already sending us out something and walked away. I guess it was a nice gesture, but honestly we would have preferred the round of drinks we had to order while waiting 2 hours for our food. The restaurant did give us 20% off our beverage consumption ($10 off), which didn't really make sense since the issue was with the food and terrible service. I came here for the food and I left after eating 2 little potatoes off of my friends plate. I was still hungry if you are curious.

5.0,4/24/2017,"The management reached out to me after my initial review, offering a complimentary meal. It was super sweet and the experience was nothing less than spectacular. We were started with their bread and some charcuterie (prosciutto/artichoke) then we ordered the walnuts & apple salad, steak tartar and foie gras for starters. They were all SO delicious, especially the foie gras. Both steak tartar and foie gras came with some greens so I think the salad wasn't really necessary. There was a good break between the appetizers and entrees, which I didn't mind at all because I was already stuffed. For entrees, we got chateaubriand pour deux (one of the recommendations) and spinach and some vegetable side. The steak was very good and it came with bone marrow and more grilled vegetables (Brussels sprouts). The meat was tender and the bone marrow was lovely. The vegetable side tasted like a better version of turkey stuffing and the spinach was SO good. I think spinach was my favorite part actually lol. For dessert, we got profiteroles and you can never go wrong with that. I can't speak for drinks since I had none (sober week) but my date enjoyed his whiskey sour cocktail on their menu. Our waiter was very humorous and made good recommendations throughout the night. Again, the decor is absolutely amazing.

4.0,4/19/2017,"Fastforward 3 months later, I was contacted by management to come in and try the restaurant again, as they apologized and have new management.Although still annoyed, I decided why not get a meal and see how the experience went. This is my honest experience:1) There is no doubt the food was great. It really was excellent - the steak, the appetizers, everything was on point. The kitchen knows what they are doing2) Our server ( i forgot his name, but he was a extremely nice Serbian, bald gentleman) was extremely professional and nice.3) You could see the restaurant is still a bit disoriented at times, but you can tell it is 10x better than round one at Boucherie.4) I specifically asked before arriving if there were any guidelines for our compt meal. They said ""not al all, you are welcome to come"".I asked this because our first time we came with no budget, and ordered a lot - so I wanted to see if it was worth our time this time. I didn't take the lead on ordering the wine, but the group decided on a more expensive wine. I thought this was appropriate since one of us didn't get a meal, and split it instead AND given the first time we came, we didn't hold back one bit on what we ordered (infant we ordered a larger # of cocktails, 1 additional plate, same # of appetizers). They advised us they were out of that bottle, and gave us a less expensive bottle. Understandable, but if there were guidelines I wish they had told us before --- either way they handled it pretty well5) We decided to get champagne before leaving. This is what we did the first time to celebrate the move of a couple at the table. My cousin had purchased the bottle.This time we decided to do it again. They didn't have the ""mid-priced bottle"" and instead gave a much cheaper option . We didn't like the way they handled this because they didn't ask us if we wanted another bottle, they just brought it to the table (later we checked online to compare prices & my cousin is french and very picky on what he likes and doesn't ).**note this was not the server who handled these conversations, it was the manager, so I didn't trust they were actually out of the bottle. How was this confirmed? We tested by going to the bar and asking if they had it before leaving.Takeaways:-All in all, I did enjoy round 2 MUCH better than the first-service was MUCH more professional-food was awesome",2,0,0,Ava A.,"New York, NY",279,51,3
5.0,4/18/2017,"Came here on a breezy abnormally warm Monday evening with a girl friend and I loved every minute of my dinner at Boucherie!I had noticed Boucherie a month or so earlier while walking through the area. I loved their open seating and bistro vibe of the joint and made a mental note to swing by on a warm night. We were greeted warmly by our servers, Jose and Niko - and ordered a bunch of things to try out. We had:Steak Tartare (small portion): omg, so good! And such a healthy size too. We finished it but totally doable to share among a group of 3-4! They use the ends of their tenderloin steaks so this is top notch quality meat!French Onion Soup: a last minute add on but man - such a good call. Delicious, just the right amount of salt, and the perf melty cheese. Duck Confit: the quintessential French dish so I just had to try it. The smell of the truffle potatoes were intoxicating. The greens were a little overly salted in some areas but I just made sure to mix well before eating. Hefty portion of duck as well! Ordered medium but I may go even below that next time as it was slightly tough. Lamb Shank: huuuuumongous portion. Couscous was perfectly cooked and for someone who isn't a fan of gamey meats, I thought it was quite good!We also had to order a side of fries after seeing the table next to us indulge in some. Best. Decision. Ever. I'd go back just for the fries (and some of that Tartare). We also ordered two Old Fashions which were okay - was expecting something more from their drinks. Perhaps I'd try some of the wines next time. And there will definitely be a next time. Between the great food, superb ambiance, amazing service (and open kitchen to boot!), I am a super fan.

4.0,4/17/2017,"Newly opened Boucherie is a large French restaurant serving traditional fare in the heart of West Village. The interior is bright and sunny, a striking change from the former Garage bar. It has probably the longest stretch of al fresco sidewalk dining in the neighborhood.  Most of their inside tables are 3-seat round bistro cafe tables and I was worried about them handling 7 of us; however, we were seated at a large table within 10 minutes of our Easter Brunch reservation time. One of my friends was a bit uncomfortable because another party sharing half the table was overflowing onto him. Our meal was paced in a Continental way, and surprisingly we were not rushed at all. Our waiter provided good service, always stopping by to see how we were doing, and refolding napkins when someone left his chair. Being next to the open kitchen we could hear plenty of chefs, waiters and food runners talking back and forth, like listening in on Hells Kitchen without Gordon Ramsay. My favorite was the full Charcuterie board. So French, it took me back to Paris. There were half a dozen cheeses, smoked duck, duck salami, Prosciutto di Parma, chicken liver mousse, cornichons, and surprising tasty for me, pheasant terrine. I'm not a big fan of pâté, so I was glad I didn't detect a strong liver taste in this terrine. The super spicy Dijon mustard must've had horseradish. It was so good I had to ask for more for my entree. We ended up with two bottles of French Chardonnay to compliment.My Hanger Steak Sandwich au Jus was very good. I asked for it not to well done, and at least see some red meat, and it was. The Jus was a bit salty of me so I didn't dip too much. The pomme frites were ok, but I'm not sure if they were fresh/frozen since many were clumped together.I hope to return for another brunch someday soon, but am really looking forward to trying their dinner service with their specialty, on-premises butchered and dry aged tomahawk rib-eyes and chateaubriand.",5,3,5,Jerry C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",515,538,1321

5.0,3/29/2017,"Boucherie is so french, so spacious, so well-presented, and delicious! I had such a great experience dining here with another friend for my belated birthday dinner. Both very interested and well-informed of French cuisine, we came in with high expectations for the food and ambiance. The restaurant is very nicely decorated with accents of red throughout. The posters on the walls and copper/iron skillets hung by the kitchen add a nice touch, as well. We both ordered a glass of Grenache-Syrah blend wine by the glass because we wanted to try the steak frites. Was a very full-bodied and fruity wine that very well complemented our meal. For appetizers we ordered the steak tartare (my first time trying!) and the endive salad. Both were amazing - the steak tartare was not smelly at all, very fresh and perfect amount of spiciness. The endive salad was also very fresh and the combination of candied walnuts, apples, and blue cheese was very nicely done. We then shared the steak frites which was so savory and delicious. The ends were a bit well done, but it wasn't impossible to eat and the fries were heavenly! So crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. For dessert we got the crepe Suzette which had the most perfect combination of orange and vanilla ice cream - highly recommend as a good way to end the meal!Overall, I loved dining here, the waiters were also very friendly (though so eager to clear our table) and attentive. It's quite spacious so you're not literally part of another person's conversation.

I spent a good half hour wandering around the East Village, looking for somewhere that was still open and serving steak frites. Yelp had led me on a wild-goose chase to at least three other restaurants, but this place showed (on their website!) that they were open until 1. A cold and rainy Sunday made a mockery of that, but when I dragged myself in at 11:20, in spite of the fact that they had closed at 11:00, the host (/manager?) went back to the kitchen, got them to fire things up, and I had a superb meal, done exactly the way I'd wanted.

The cocktails were delicious and their wine selection was also fantastic.Unfortunately, for us, the drinks and the service was the best experience at this restaurant- we started off with Escargot de Bourgogne and Salad D'auvergne. Escargot was way too bland and overcooked, it was like chewing a rubber. We sent it back. Salad portion was large and baby arugula was not fresh. We sent it back. My friend and I decided to just order one entree and share- we had Faux filet bercy (16 ounce dry-aged bone-in NY strip). We asked for medium well because I have to be on a neutropenic diet (everything has to be fully cooked). The steak was served medium rare. At this point we felt bad and hopeless sending back our dish so my friend just had the steak (I've been told the steak was not too bad).For dessert, we shared profiteroles, which was just okay.

4.0,2/18/2017,"Heard the buzz around this restaurant during its grand opening. They've only been opened for a few months now... but I ended up checking it out when I really wanted brunch on a Sunday but was extremely limited on time. Buvette & Jack's Wife Freda were both nearby and quoted an hour+ wait time so I called in Boucherie to find out there was no wait at all! Swung in and I noticed how many adequate seatings there are in this restaurant which would make it the best brunch during the weekends in the West Village with delicious food and with quick turnover time for tables!Special thanks to our waiter Jose who was so understandable about us being in an extreme rush. He reassured us that I'd be out in time and he surely kept his promise! I got seated about 1:15... ordered my food, food arrived instantly within couple minutes after and I literally had the check by 1:45! That was the fastest and most promising service I had ever receive! On top of that, he was able to already prepare us a complimentary dessert on the house at the end. You would think that we probably ordered something very ordinary, simple and small... or that our food was probably so rushed out for our demands that the food wouldn't be great... But oh, what another sweet surprise... food was great and better than expected! From the buttery warm scones and croissant, to our entree! My boyfriend got scrambled eggs with steak and a side of salad while I got the madame Freda. His steak was well seasoned, eggs were fluffy and delish! My madame Freda was huge compared to a lot of the brunch places I've been to that served this... but it wasn't the greatest madame Freda version I've had to be quite honest.Can't wait to come back to try them for dinner next time !!",3,0,3,Monica P.,"Brooklyn, NY",432,222,440
2.0,2/17/2017,"When Garage closed last year I was crushed. It was the perfect mix of late night jazz, sophisticated cocktails and food. But when I realized a traditional French restaurant had replaced Garage I was relieved and anxious for a taste.The taste only made me miss Garage more.On a positive note, the renovations are genius. The space has been beautifully optimized. Said renovations, however, create certain expectations for guests. Especially when you take a glance at the menu and realize you are paying for the new decor.When I saw favorites on the menu I initially had no issue with the mild sticker shock. Ooh la la, I mused.I couldn't resist ordering the mousse de foie gras for my appetizer. Indeed, it was the high point of my meal. The flavors were perfectly balanced with a slightly acidic but still savory green salad with caramelized onions. The bread that accompanied the duck liver was well seasoned and toasted. Even the extra bread my friend requested came with a beautiful side of assorted olives and a healthy side of prosciutto. It seemed, at first, that our money would be well spent on a fantastic dining experience.And then the entrées arrived. At first I believed I had just chosen wrong. I'd ordered the Cavatelli au lapin. Lapin is a favorite of mine, typically served either in a stew over rich mashed potatoes or as a shank alongside them with another sweet side (carrots, perhaps?) to offset the saltiness of the rabbit. This ricotta cavatelli appeared to be served in no more than a marinara sauce, topped with shredded rabbit and an odd sprinkling of almonds. Yet despite the unfavorable flavor combination, it somehow managed to be bland! The innate flavor of the rabbit was lost, buried in an unpleasantly tangy bowl of dull consistency. I found myself looking longingly over at my friend's saumon à l'unilateral, only to discover when he cut me a forkful that the salmon was equally bland. The cut was large and visually impeccable, but tasted more of water than it did fish. I found the flavor of the fingerling potatoes to be equally muted, redeemed only by the occasional brightness of the leek fondue.When dessert menus were offered we ordered the tarte tartin. I cannot comment on the taste of the tarte tartin. Not because I didn't have any, but because it was smothered in such a rich caramel sauce that to taste anything but was impossible. The sauce was reminiscent of an over-sweet, butterscotch candy - there's a reason those are made to be only but so big. Perhaps the flavorless poof of cream on the plate was meant to temper the overwhelming sweetness of the caramel. Unfortunately the plate was literally swimming in it, rendering even the smallest of bites inedible. As a result the small chocolate twig meant as a garnish, the only thing out of the sauce's reach, was the only palatable thing on the plate.I didn't feel that the service was terrible. It wasn't terrible. However, I can understand the displeasure as the decor sets high expectations. I'll give them this - the service is a unique kind of bad. A creative kind. It isn't that we weren't checked on and tended to. We were. And it isn't that the servers were so attentive that they were overbearing and we had to start clicking out private conversations with our silverware in Morse code. The flaws were not so obvious. It was the interactions themselves that seemed inexplicably brusque since the place wasn't packed. Our server nearly pushed my wine glass clean off the table and onto my white coat, for instance, when trying to make room for a plate. (Who pushes a wine glass?) The dessert menu was quickly snatched from in front of me once my friend ordered a dessert for us to share, which is a shame because I had every intention of ordering a nightcap. And then there's the annoying question of why she didn't ask? Because I was a woman? Because I didn't speak French? Because the owners spent too much money on the fancy white floor to train her properly? Because turning to someone and asking, ""and for you?"" or just a simple, ""anything else?"" is beyond basic. You get that at a Burger King drive through at 3am - is it really too much to ask as I order my overpriced food?And speaking of overpriced...The butcher bar. Not to say it is unheard of to spend these amounts on an exquisite cut of meat in a very good restaurant. But appearance alone does not make a restaurant exceptional and coming from the same kitchen that managed to mess up a salmon I fear an order of anything from the butcher bar would only yield further disappointment. Lastly, I do not have it out for this restaurant, but I do believe in fine cuisine and if you dress yourself up as the type of restaurant that can offer such an experience, you owe it.Which reminds me - presentation? Sloppy.I do hope that Boucherie manages to live up to its fancy renovations soon. The space is sentimental to me and I really want to like it there. With better food I just might.",1,1,1,B.

5.0,2/14/2017,Dear Lord from Heaven!Ok. I'm taking my breath! Tonight my husband took me out for dinner for Valentine's. Little did I know it would be so amazing. We came to the bar and had Fois Gras that was out of this world. Followed by the stakes and fantastic desert. Amazing selection of wines. I literally have no words. This is the best date I had for almost all my life. Food is from heaven and service was amazing. Our bartender made sure that we have the best Valentine's ever. He even made my husband a manhattan that he adored.

5.0,2/13/2017,"What a wonderful dining experience, this is a new favorite gem tucked in to the West Village.  Highly recommend the escargot (ask for extra bread so you can soak up all the delicious garlic butter), steak frites, as well as the mushroom ravioli which is decadent and light somehow at the same time.  The wine menu is equally fantastic with extensive options.  Make sure to ask for Jose, he is the man!!",3,0,2,Sam K.,"Dallas, TX",0,1,1
2.0,2/12/2017,"I was super excited to try this place out as the photos look amazing and it's located in the heart of the West Village.  Another plus, was that this place takes reservations.  My three girlfriends and I arrived and we were seated immediately.  Our server came by to greet us and then pretty much left for 15 minutes until we hunted him down.  We received no bread and butter, and for a french place, i found that to be quite odd.  We had ordered the foie gras pate and it was smooth and good, but literally came with two pieces of toasted bread.  I hate when places do that...why are you so cheap with the bread?!?  Who can eat a lump of liver pate with two pieces of bread?!?!  The mushroom ravioli was another appetizer we ordered and I liked its flavor.  It had a buttery sauce.  For main dishes we ordered the huge ribeye with bone marrow which was great for pictures, but thats about all.  The bone marrow was cold inside, so it was like eating cold fat...yum!  Of course, bread was missing so we needed more.  Both times when asking for more bread, they didn't give us the toasted bread, but rather a stale baguette.  This place takes no pride in their food!  The ribeye was okay, but it lacked flavor and nothing to brag home about.  We also ordered the tripe pork belly dish which also lacked flavor and it just seemed mushy.  It was like eating mushy mush.  The place looks beautiful but is non functional.  The venting system sucks!  Throughout dinner, my friends and I were not only cold from the draft, but our eyes were tearing because there was no ventilation!  I asked the waiter and he said ""everyone is ordering steaks tonight.""  I thought that was a joke, but it wasn't.  I don't care if everyone in the restaurant ordered a steak, it should not be so smoky in a huge restaurant where all the patrons' eyes were tearing up.  The waiter felt bad about the bone marrow and offered us three free desserts that were pretty good.  I think that was the best part of the meal.  However, i think staying the extra 30 minutes to enjoy them really was a bad idea in hindsight as my coat still to this day smells like I went to a BBQ cookout.  The fur on my coat smells like a BBQ Ribs place.  Not only was this meal pricey and not worth it, but then I had to pay for dry cleaning on top of that!  I will definitely not be coming back or recommending!",5,5,4,Jessica C.,"New York, NY",424,141,683

1.0,2/4/2017,Had dinner with friends and I'm sure at least one will write a similar review.  The service was lacking for most of the meal.  We ordered several dishes to share and never didn't receive sharing plates until the second course.  We started with the foie Gras Mousse which came with 2 small pieces of toasted bread so we had to ask for more bread ..twice. The foie Gras and mushroom Ravioli were good but nothing great.  We were all looking forward to the bone marrow but was extremely disappointed.  The bone marrow was cold and basically a lump of lard so we had to send it back to be heated but it didn't matter because it was lacking in flavor (and we had to ask for bread again).  The tripe with pork belly was bland and reminded me of a plain baked ziti from any random NYC pizza place.  The kitchen is open which is a huge mistake because their ventilation either barely works or the chef doesn't know how to sear the steaks and marrow.  The entire restaurant was smoked out and our eyes were burning.  They must've tried to air out the place because then we were freezing from a sudden draft.  The waiter tried to make it up to us and complimentary desserts were brought to us which actually were quite tasty however the smoke continued to overpower our senses.  We tipped the waiter purely due to his attempt at salvaging our meal but unfortunately we didn't tip as generously as we normally do.  We left to have coffee and tea elsewhere but we continued to smell smoke and realized it had permeated every fiber of our clothes and hair.  I came home smelling as if I'd spent a weekend camping.  My friends seriously considered going back to demand they pay for a cleaning bill as their coats have ornamental trim which make it more costly to clean.

2.0,1/11/2017,"For a new restaurant with ample real estate, seating was cramped. Bistro style is but patrons' comfort is not the priority here. Started off with the mousse de fois grois which was Hudson Valley fois grois well paired with onion compote & red wine port sauce. Then it was a steady decline from there. Main entree was the Cote De Veau Aux Champignons - 16oz grass fed veal porterhouse, enochi mushrooms, sweetbreads & veal jus. This was an extremely fatty dish... cut was 70% fat, 20% bone, 10% meat. Best part of dish was the sauce. One of the few establishments to serve a veal porterhouse and doing a very poor job at it.Also tried the Fletan Poele - seared halibut, roasted parsnips, haricot vert & carrot purée. The fish was seared and drenched in the puree which created a soggy texture. The parsnips were the best part of the dish as it was finally a solid bite of the evening.The legumes tagine was comforting. Slow-cooked vegetables with ras el hanout and couscous. The ras el hanout added very nice flavor to the dish although the dish was more brothy and soup-like than I had expected. I enjoyed the dish by combining the tagine with the couscous and and the sauce from the veal dish.For dessert, I prayed the Mousse Au Chocolat would blow me away. Alas it did not. Did they forget the sugar? It looks like mousse and it looks like chocolate, but it did not taste like chocolate mousse. I saved room for dessert and was not satisfied.Thank goodness the company I was with saved the evening. The staff in general was attentive in refilling water glasses although not in clearing the tiny tables when we were done with dishes (and waiting for additional dishes). I am surprised by the lack of experience, attention, and service in arranging the table appropriately for the number of people and dishes that were to be placed on the table. Additionally, because the space between parties is almost non-existent, the waitress, Diana S, placed a glass of wine on the edge of the table. She couldn't even walk to the table - she extended her arm from another table and served the wine from behind my friend who'd ordered it. Not only was that move a hazard as the glass could've dropped, but it demonstrated lack of care in providing service. We overlooked questions not getting answered (I don't think she understands the word 'special' 'favorite' and 'popular' when we had asked about the menu). We overlooked forgetful/delayed service when asking for lemon wedges, bread, and a 2nd glass of wine. But the neglect in trying to accommodate is a problem. I hope improvements are made to the space and service.",5,1,2,Rose I.,"Manhattan, NY",105,441,3759
4.0,1/8/2017,"New French bistro from The Group that also operates Akashi (which I highly recommend for sushi omakase), Dominique bistro, and Olio e Piú.Ambiance - Your typical French bistro: loud & tight spacing.Highlight dishes: Raviolis aux champignons (my fav. today; highly recommend), Le croque monsieur (very good & big portion), and salade d' asperges au saumon fumé (very good). But, I was a bit disappointed w/ the steak frites (fries were great, but the steak lacked seasoning, and the four peppercorn sauce was sparse and bland).Solid spot for French bistro type of food in the area, but at these prices, I recommend treking down futher downtown to Augustine.Service - excellentRecommend: 8 calendars",3,0,0,Go B.,"Westwood, CA",57,267,10365
5.0,1/7/2017,"Lovely new place near the 1 line stop Christopher Street. I made reservations because I was craving steak tartare. Once seated, the waitress didn't rush us and helped us with ordering our cheese selection for our appetizer. I had a glass of the blended red with Syrah, very nice and full-bodied. The best blend I've had in a while. My husband ordered the steak frites and it came with those fries that seemed to be triple fried and are delicious. Nothing worse than bad fries. I ordered the smaller portion of the steak tartare.... the presentation with a egg yolk in a quail eggshell was a nice touch. It was delicious and was a perfect size for me. We debated on ordering dessert, but who are we kidding?? We ordered the profiteroles that came with homemade ice cream and a homemade chocolate sauce. The order is large: 3 profiteroles with ice cream, but we managed to clean the plate.",1,1,1,Rachel D.,"Chicago, IL",2,32,0

5.0,1/6/2017,"We were 100% completely happy with the food and drink and atmosphere. And the smell of burning firewood. :)3 of us dined. A bottle of Sancerre rouge, mousse de foie gras to start (yum!), and then 1 person had the blood sausage (was very, very good...didn't taste very bloody, though), 1 person had steak frites (excellent, and very generous helping), and 1 had the filet with truffle butter. They were all excellent, and very robust and satisfying. Then we couldn't resist the tarte tatin, which was sublime...I basically licked the caramel off of the plate. It ended up being about $85 each, so not an every day meal, but excellent.In fact, I think I'll stop by for some foie and a glass of wine at the bar in the near future.Also the interior was beautiful and the service was solid.",8,2,4,Joetta G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",149,219,30

5.0,12/30/2016,"My husband and I have our few spots in the WV but happened upon this when there was a wait at our initial choice. Super glad we did! First off, this place is absolutely gorgeous- they need to keep the christmas decorations up all year. The floor is beautiful and the mirror over the bar is gorg. We liked that all the staff we dealt with were French and felt it was a genuine Parisian experience. Service was extremely attentive, my water glass was refilled constantly at 25% below full and table crumbs were removed between courses. It is a brand new spot so I did sense some tiny rookie mistakes- namely, one server stood directly behind and close to my chair while attentively keeping an eye on the guests. He was doing a great job, but probably better at a different position. Food was outstanding- onion soup was delicious and the salmon and chicken were extremely fresh and perfectly prepared. The only dish I did not like was the caesar salad- it was plain and missing the parmesan cheese (which is why I like caesar). Our server was extremely helpful and the manager came over asking if everything was ok- this restaurant is clearly putting in the effort.  I highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely be back soon.",5,0,0,Bee E.,"New York, NY",0,40,0

1.0,12/27/2016,"My family & I attempted Christmas dinner w/a 5:30p reservation. The bar was filled w/patrons drinking & ~3 tables seated in our area. After 15 minutes w/no waiter to take our drink order, another waiter nearby came & did so.  My mom & I ordered wine, calamari for the table, a frisee salad & the french onion soup. 10-15 mins later drinks arrived, another 10-15 our appetizers. The calamari was sub-par, room temp, under seasoned-- nothing special. At 6:20 finally cleared our app plates. 2 new tables have sat by this time, both ordering apps & drinks, received their dinner fairly quick. *I'd like to note, 2 dining behind us arrived at 6pm, the waiter forgot to put in one orders & had to rush to get that made, one had fish, the other beef. * Getting nervous we were going to miss our 7:30 show uptown. It's now been almost 1hr, since we placed orders--Salmon, rainbow trout & linguine.  Around 6:30 table runner came up & asked if there's anything he could do, we asked to check on our food. At this time we saw the family of four, who arrived & order b4 us were also waiting for their dinner. At 6:45, no one had info on the food we asked the manager for our check b/c we had to leave for our show & had not received any help. The manager never returned. At 6 :45 our 2nd waiter came w/a bill of $90 ( we shouldn't have been asked to pay for anything), no apology for the wait/explanation of delay. In fact, none of the wait staff said anything to us, they huddled, chatted & stared as we waited 45+ mins for food. After speaking to 4 different people we had to leave, the manager caught my mom & sister on the way out as I waited in the Uber, said he was tying to see if they could hurry our food, he gave them his business card & said to come back for a meal on the house.  No thank you!  I wouldn't recommend this restaurant  to anyone. There's no excuse for the lack of communication and ownership of forgetting to put in our orders. I'm unsure if the party of 4 ever received their food.",2,0,0,elle w.,"Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0

Rich salty, they are unique. The salmon was made divine by the sensational leeks and crispy fingerlings. The cooked food was 5 stars. Only issues were the amuse bouche- I didn't get it till the end when I saw it at another table. The littlle baguette and other toasted bread was alright.

4.0,12/10/2016,"Boucherie overall score: 87Flavor: 8My wife and I split the cote de boeuf for two.This massive tomahawk rib eye is 36oz and comes with some nice roasted marrow bones and a bordelaise sauce.The steak comes out pre-sliced and ready to rock, served in a beautiful pan, atop a bed of roasted veggies.The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare, it was well-rested before slicing, and it had a good crust on the outside.Okay I took a shitload of photos of this thing... My wife said she ate a few slices that had a grainy texture. I didn't notice it, so I pretty much enjoyed it immensely. Even the fat was really soft and edible. Like a beefy Jell-O. We also carved off the awesome crispy meat that sits along the rib, which was spectacular.Choice of Cuts & Quality Available: 8Most of the cuts here are dry-aged, but there is no indication on the menu about how long they are aged.It could be that they age them in house, continuously, as there seemed to be a good amount of space and massive stainless steel appliances.There are two types of strip, a filet mignon, a chateaubriand for two, a hanger steak and a cote de boeuf rib eye for two on the menu. They lack a proper porterhouse, but this is a fun menu because there are plenty of other meats to choose from as well.Portion Size & Plating: 10Portions here are massive. I suspect the sizes of some of these items may come down a bit after they get on track in the kitchen, but every dish we tried was large. As for plating, you can see how beautiful the pan of steak looked above.Price: 8I can't really complain. The menu prices are pretty normal, and given that the portion sizes are all generous, I had to conclude that you get a good value for your money here.Bar: 10The bar is a beautiful and impressive stretch along the side wall, adorned with absinthe drinking tools and proper glasses for enjoying the spirit. They offered just a pair of signature cocktails, which I imagine will change often since one was overly summer-themed, for some reason, and both were made with absinthe. But the bartenders definitely know what they're doing. They mix a mean old fashioned.Specials and Other Meats: 9The non-beef selection is pretty great here. Well, there's veal too, which is baby beef: veal porterhouse, if that's your thing. And there's tripe too; alterna-beef! There's also a rack of venison, which looked amazing. And finally, there's duck, chicken, and even some rabbit in a pasta dish. No lamb, though, and no pork.Apps, Sides & Desserts: 9We only tried apps and sides. Here's what we tried:Blood Sausage - not everyone's cup of tea, I acknowledge that. But this was one of the best versions I've had. There was no grainy, mealy texture to it, and no overly iron-flavored bites involved. A few spots contained some chew, but nothing repulsive.The serving size was massive, and it was plated with roasted apples and a potato puree. If you split a salad with your dinner-mate, this could easily be ordered as an entree.Steak Tartare - I love meat, so the idea was to try as many meat items as possible before ordering a meat entree. This tartare was great, and also a very big serving size. In fact, it was so big that it really could have used three quail eggs, if not a full chicken egg.The texture was smooth without being too fine, and it had a good pop of flavor from the capers and herbs within.Fries - Hands down the best French fries I've ever eaten. Unreal. I mean, crispy outside, and like mashed potatoes inside. Perfectly seasoned as well. They just needed a mayo or something for dipping.Creamed Spinach - Full, sauteed leaf spinach that's really just served with a cream sauce at the bottom, to be mixed up with the spinach. Not bad. I've had better, but this was certainly not a bad item.Seafood Selection: 8You are dining at a place where the name, in French, means Butcher. Why would you even consider seafood as a possibility? If, for some fucking retarded reason, you're considering eating something from the sea here as an entree, they offer halibut, trout and salmon. Since I didn't try any, I can't really comment.Service: 7I'll give this place a chance to officially open and sort itself out for a few weeks before I come back and give it an official score. For now I'll stick with a general 7/10 as a place holder.Oh yeah... the table bread comes with both meat and veggies; that's pretty amazing. A slice of country ham with artichoke heart, pickled eggplant and bread.Ambiance: 10What an amazing space. Wow. I mean, my photos didn't do it justice, so I passed on sharing them here. But the place is located at the old Garage Bar spot, where you have 20ft wood-beamed ceilings overhead and a skylight. Also, the decor they went with is astoundingly gorgeous.",7,3,2,JohnnyPrimeC.
