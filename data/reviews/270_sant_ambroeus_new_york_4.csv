4.0,4/24/2019,"Amazing food, amazing waiter (tall guy from Serbia) the wine was also amazing as was the location!! The reason I'm dropping a star is because the new waiter (the Serbian guy finished his shift) was rushing us and basically rude to us when we were finishing up. We spent over $200 plus tip!!!! It's not fair for the new waiters to run us like that!!!",0,0,0,Amanda M.,"Woodside, NY",50,9,0

1.0,3/23/2019,"Came here for brunch on a Saturday. Food is mediocre at best, price is outrageous, and service is not existent- asked for a fork to five different waitstaff and waited for 30mins.

4.0,1/30/2019,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants in all of NYC.  Food is always fresh and superb.Get's super crowded on weekends and scoring a table can be a challenge.Honestly, I'd rate them a 5* if the management finally relents after all of these years to sell me the large dining room.prine feom LaScala Opera House...lolHot spot and lot's of good looking people.  Definitely one of my top recommendations!",0,0,0,James G.,"Downtown Jersey City, Jersey City, NJ",0,11,0
5.0,1/28/2019,"This place is great. The wall decor of the place is unique. The food was pretty good. They offer a variety of bread with olive oil as a starter. I had the Tagliatelle Alla Bolognese (slow cooked veal ragu) and the fish of the day which was Branzino. Both dishes were well-cooked. Also, the side of spinach that I ordered there was the best spinach I have ever had. Dessert was the best part. I could not decide which one to go with so I ordered both the Nocciola and the fruit tart. Both were amazing. My only complaint is that I had reservations at 8:30PM, but they waited until 9:00PM to seat us.",3,2,1,Cherry J.,"New York, NY",359,34,91

5.0,1/21/2019,"By far my favorite restaurant in this city!!  The decor is gorgeous, staff is amazing, food is EXQUISITE! I always come here on my birthday and it never disappoints; whenever people ask for recommendations I always direct them to Sant Ambroeus. I cannot say enough how BEAUTIFUL the decorations are starting with the cups which are a salmon color and with an elegant font that writes ""Sant Ambroeus"", the bags, the wall paper, the chairs and silverware; all of these details add up to a delicate, trendy restaurant where you can sit with your closest friends and have a delightful meal.",0,0,0,Anna C.,"Manhattan, NY",170,19,19

If you've ever lived, or visited Italy - the food here will remind you of authentic Italy.  Hands down one of the best places for cappuccino & cornetto!Think causal yet elegant dining.  Outside seating in the summer is a MUST!P.s. the chocolate dome cake is a MUST - thank me later!",1,0,1,Scarlette O.,"Manhattan, NY",68,182,683
4.0,11/20/2018,Made reservation for two on a Saturday for brunch but still ended up waiting 5-10 mins because they were so packed. The service was great. Our waitress kept asking us if everything was ok. French toast was very yummy. A bit too crowded for me to want to come back here again. The table next to us was very close and customers going in and out between our tables was quite annoying.,0,0,0,Lee H.,"Great Neck, NY",0,8,1
1.0,10/29/2018,"Simply put, this place is nothing but pretentious. Food is mediocre at best, service is not existent and sub par, and frankly the overall experience is disappointing and, once the outrageous price is considered, outright insulting.

5.0,10/24/2018,"This was our first time eating at this establishment. Attentive service was spot on. We explored a bit and tried various items we would normally not order. I don't even remember what all we ate. It was a feast with several courses. Everything tasted very good. The restaurant had a cool vibe and everyone was very friendly. Since we were there for lunch, just about the only thing we didn't try was their drinks. Next time. Looking forward to also try some of their sister restaurants around Manhattan.",0,0,0,Nick T.,"Montrose, Houston, TX",74,5,0
2.0,10/15/2018,Oh goodness! Where do I start?! How about the positives... the food was actually really good. Not surprising. Probably the best scrambled egg I've ever had. The overall vibe of the restaurant is very chic.Moving on. Chic decor and good scrambled eggs are where it stopped for me. For as prestigious as a vibe as Sant Ambroeus puts off the attention to detail was just sad. Waiters seem to not have a sense of direction or who they should be helping. The hosts were neglectful and distracted. In contrast to the decor of the restaurant the waiters were also put together rather sloppy. Cute idea for a uniform but the lack of care put into appearance at ones place of business was crude. It was as if they rolled out of bed in their uniforms and cane to work. That being said I'd probably come here again and when I had enough time to waste being neglected by mediocre service.,0,0,0,Edward K.,"Greenpoint, Brooklyn, NY",159,12,0
1.0,10/9/2018,"Came on Sunday for a date brunch after hearing great things about Sant Ambroeus. However, in almost every aspect of the experience I was disappointed. To start our waiter was very neglectful and curt the entire meal. No one gave us bread for the table even though every other table received it, including in our waiters section. Unfortunately, I didn't notice this until the end of the meal.  To start off we each ordered coffee, assuming it would be fantastic, Italian blend coffee (as SA also has coffee bars)- it tasted exactly like the cup of Folgers I drank to get myself to brunch! I ordered the French Toast and my husband ordered the Norwegian Eggs Benedict. My French Toast had been soaked in egg so long it was completely mushy on the inside, the consistency of a cake before you bake it. It was to the point where I was concerned I might get sick from under cooked eggs. The coffee spreads that the French toast come with were very good, however they were separating with the liquid used to make them (clearly not recently made). Our waiter never checked on us to see if everything was satisfactory with our meal, otherwise I would have requested a fresh plate of food. Very disappointing meal for not only the reputation but the price! If bread dipped in egg and cooked costs $18.00 it should be the best I have ever had!!",0,0,0,Kaitlyn K.,"Yorkville, Manhattan, NY",45,94,99
4.0,10/9/2018,"This is a solid choice for just about any meal. Without a doubt, the best cappuccino in New York. The Brussels sprouts salad is divine. So is the tuna tartare.

3.0,10/8/2018,"Overpriced Italian pasta, wine, beer, coffee. Most of the servers are Serbian men. The library wine is most delicious, but it may be the stemware that is the best part. The burrata had gone sour, and the $12 beer was flat. If you want real Milanese hospitality, go to Cipriani or better yet Milan!",0,0,0,Sabrina C.,"New York, NY",6,31,29
2.0,8/16/2018,"So sadly a few things happened that took what could easily have been a five star meal down to two. The food was 5 stars but the service had misses. First, I didn't love the waiter's tone. He was one of the waiters who thinks a little snark is good comedy but even mildly teasing my wife about something she said will not get a good response from me. Jokes need to actually be funny. So I didn't like him despite his being an overall ok server (and the below miss was not his, it was a food prep / food runner fail). Second, much bigger service miss, I ordered a panini. A prep error and food runner error meant that my beloved pair of pants was ruined with an oil stain. So salad comes with the panini and a prep error left salad dressing seeping over the edge of the wooden plank the food was brought over on. The sloppy food server didn't notice so when he brought the food to the table, it was already dripping along the way. One large glop of oil-soaked dressing landed right on my pants. No amount of soaking or seltzer will ever fix it. No it wasn't worth raising it then, I get it was a mistake, but the damage was done in a moment and not ever able to be fixed. I wasn't going to waste anyone's time asking for dry cleaning, I've tried with those kinds of stains, my pants are ruined. I ate the meal in a weird headspace of enjoying the food but also feeling disappointed that coming to this restaurant meant I lost out on something I valued through no fault of my own. Sad cuz the bread was pillowy soft at this place really excellent, sandwich itself was tasty actually, the other dish we got was outstanding and we licked the bowl clean as I mourned my beloved pants. Dear beloved pants, you wore so well. You were perfectly thin material for the summer and tapered so tastefully with a full range of motion. You looked good and you felt great (like my buttcheeks you so graciously covered all those humid summer days). You will forever be relegated to knockaround status for the ugly large oil stain above the knee, but I want you to know, dear pair of pants, that I took several minutes of my precious limited life to write this account down for you, an inanimate object. For you, for me, for all the avoidable oil stains on all the great pairs of pants out there.",0,1,0,Argot B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,164,0
3.0,8/14/2018,The Saint Umbreous we went to ( 259 West 4th street 212-604-9254) was mediocre. Actually its an adorable restaurant but the food is not! Even for brunch! The presentation is absolutely beautiful however the food doesn't taste good. Even the mimosa was disappointing. Truly it has plenty of potential for improvement especially it's in a great neighborhood. Time to put more effort on the food and not the decore.,0,0,0,Bob F.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,75,290
4.0,8/11/2018,"The food is awesome! The veggie soup is so tasty and healthy at the same time and the chocolate flourless cake-  heavenly.  I wish there was a scope of ice cream to go with it.  The atmosphere is present.  I was sitting near the entrance and had the pleasure of enjoying the sun set.  The main dish,  healthy and yummy.  It is a safe bet with friends.  I have to say that their seats probably need some upholstery.",1,0,0,Julia C.,"New York, NY",40,47,24

A few lovely tables outside too.The food was made from really fresh, authentic, light ingredients and everything was excellent, except maybe the pasta which did not taste like fresh pasta (although it could have been).Service was friendly but not overly attentive - had to ask every time to fill up my water and asked twice where my pasta was.I'd give it another shot",0,0,0,James M.,"Sausalito, CA",0,37,9
2.0,7/18/2018,"My friend raves about this place all the time so I'd been dying to try it. I have to say I was underwhelmed. Seating is tight and uncomfortable for a higher end restaurant. The coffee was bland and my lemon ricotta pancakes were dry/left a lot to be desired. I even tried to add more and more syrup, but it didn't help. My colleague did not enjoy her avocado toast either. It wasn't at par with other restaurants in the same neighborhood who serve avocado toast with more fix ins and flavor.

We had one minor issue with the food, but the restaurant quickly fixed it without incident. Fantastic food and great customer service!",2,1,2,Yaa A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",218,137,506
1.0,6/6/2018,Absolutely worst SA in NYC. Would give 0 stars if it was an option. The head waiter is very elitist and turns his nose up at anyone who spends less than $100. Go if you enjoy being picked apart by people who you pay.,0,0,0,Sally G.,"Manhattan, NY",24,77,2
1.0,5/20/2018,"Overpriced and such mediocre food. I split an omelette and the lemon pancakes with a friend. Pancakes were dry and so  blah. the omelette was fine but nothing great, doesnt come with toast which is annoying and instead comes with a overdressed blah salad. our other friend ordered a different omelette and she said it was very average and not satisfying. They also charged $3.50 for a cup of hot water and a lemon wedge. Which is absolutely insane.We now realize why we could get in here on a sunday at 11:30 and everywhere else had a wait. Its so not worth it. So expensive, and not satisfying.Don't go! Pick any other spot in a 5 block radius for better brunch.",0,0,0,Mar R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,54,3

4.0,4/30/2018,"Very French, and very friendly. I really was feeling more of 3.5 stars, but the extremely accommodating waiter convinced me to round up to 4. The food was okay - nothing special.  In fact, the eggs benedicts came out rather cold, and when I told the waiter that I wish the eggs were heated up more - he took it off the bill. The pancakes were better than the omelette though, and overall, I was happy that everything tasted like what they should taste like. The omelette was definitely on the drier side, but the pancakes were fluffier than expected. Everything else besides the food: decor, plating, and ambiance, were all on point!Everyone in the restaurant seems to know how to speak French, and I did feel like I was in Paris. This place has so much potential to become one of the top French restaurants in the city, but they're first going to have to stop serving cold food (unless the food was meant to be served cold).",0,2,0,Lisa L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",385,62,678
5.0,4/19/2018,"I've been to Sant Ambroeus on the UES and I always loved it but I was really blown away by the service here. I brought my husband to Sant Ambroeus for the first time this week for dinner. Service was amazingly attentive and everyone was so nice and hospitable. We both had pappardelle bolognese which was excellent. Very fresh and flavorful. I was raving to my husband about how he has to try to dessert at Sant Ambroeus since it is incredible. The host asked him what he typically likes and they brought over Tiramisu and a chocolate mousse on the house. This was very unexpected but a wonderful touch to our evening. I noticed that regulars were walking in and they knew everyone by name. This is what you see a lot of in Italy, not America. We will definitely be back.",1,0,1,Jennifer F.,"Fairfield, CT",267,62,1
5.0,4/14/2018,"Arrived here for dinner after previous plans fell through. My dinner companion assured me that this is probably one of the best restaurants in town, so my expectations were pretty high, NYC-bred skepticism notwithstanding.Expectations met.  We had a very delectable meal.  The carbonara is one of the best I've ever had and the fresh baked bread is just addictive.  We were well hosted by an attentive and pleasant staff.  Loved the romantic yet hip ambiance at night.

2.0,4/1/2018,Don't believe the hype.  It's adequate at best. However if you love overpriced pasta surrounded by millennial flashing their parents plastic then this is your place.

4.0,3/25/2018,"Sant Ambroeus reminded me of a cafe I used to go to when I lived in Paris. Even though it was winter, I sat outside facing the street and ordered a small espresso drink. I loved being able to watch people walk by and live their lives, also there is a fire station on the same block.  I was very surprised by the service that I received.  The waiters were very kind and kept checking in on me to see how I was doing, that could have been because I was sitting outside in the middle of winter. No, they do not have outdoor heaters, but I loved my experience. Oh the one thing that I struggled with was locking the bathroom door.

3.0,2/4/2018,"My expectations were high, having loved the sister restaurant in the West Village. This was quite a bit less glamourous. The service was very poor on the night we went, and we waited quite a while between courses (to the point were it became so frustrating that we stopped ordering more). We also ordered a three-glass flight of wine and never got the last glass. The food was very good, though! I'd really recommend checking out the other location. My opinion though, is that for the price, this Soho restaurant needs to do a lot better in the service department.",0,0,0,Sara D.,"Manhattan, NY",16,102,1
5.0,2/1/2018,"I've been here a couple of times now and I am definitely a fan. Sant Ambroeus is exactly what you want from a trendy upscale NYC restaurant in soho - cute and quirky decor with just enough drama to keep it a little romantic, steeply-priced but undeniably excellent food, and a shockingly attractive staff. Like no joke, this place is exclusively staffed by beautiful men. And not like model-hot, I mean like genuine Disney-prince-haired hot guys in glasses and well tailored outfits with elbow patches. (Re: guys like creative director Alireza Niroomand, who are both impeccably dressed and very pleasant and respectful). I see u Sant Ambroeus men. It is appreciated. (Too strong???? Look, I'm already in a relationship but I just gotta be real here. Ladies and gay men take note.)Oh right the food, well ANYHOW, this place is a pretty solid Italian joint. Their salads are lovely and fresh. As for the pasta, I'm a big fan of the Trofie al Ragù di Agnello - which has the perfect ratio of sauce to pasta to cheese to pistachios. The veal ragu is also incredibly solid, with a deep rich flavor without the heaviness or grease of a lesser restaurant. Also if you get the meal to go / have leftovers you get the cutest goddamn take out bag I have ever seen. Also their desserts are fabulous, the Gianduja is the fancy ferrero roche of your dreams, and their signature Sant Ambroeus dessert is beautifully textured melt-in-your-mouth chocolate dream with a gold flake on the top. They also have $16 cocktails that I can justify in that they include strange ingredients I would never actually buy or own and also taste fabulous - the blackberry accented Romana is especially delicious.Until next bonus paycheck, Sant Ambroeus.",3,3,0,Jenna I.,"Brooklyn, NY",103,268,67

When I walked in, it was calm on a Wednesday morning only a few people who seemed like regulars. Loved the decor which was simple elegance with the exception of the plates on the entering wall which was a nice piece of art. We were seated promptly, even had the chair pulled out for us which was nice. Friend got the pancakes while I got the BLT panini. Presentation for both were beautiful- definitely Instagram worthy. Meal made me full, bacon was crispy, dressing was good and my friend's pancakes were good too. They kept our waters topped off, though one complaint would be it wasn't cold and probably tap water. A little on the pricey ($14 for panini, $15 for pancakes) side especially considering there's a cheaper delicatessen a few doors down which serves breakfast as well.

All my being there nobody fill this glass even once.After, I waited for a while, then they would come to take my order. But waiting was too long and started be annoying, because non of the service didn't tried to reached my eyes or hand, they just were hanging around and laugh with each other. I were very hungry, that's one of the reason people going to restaurants. So I wanted  just to make a order asap and wait for the food. I asked one of the guys- could someone please come to me, I am waiting already long... and I got amazing answer - Yes, I am here, you are been  not waiting long, you are waited 3 minutes! Wow, I leave there more than 100$ for brunch. And I just wanted good food and service. That was very rude. I don't wanna hear from anybody how long I've been waited, if I haven't asked them. Especially from people, to who I have to tip 20% , that is not small money. Each customer should be respected, otherwise I have no idea why people offer their service if they cannot serve you the way they should. So after experience like this, and shitty atmosphere while being there and all day after, I cannot put more than 1 star, because you don't remember taste and quality of the food, after someone teaches you to calculate your time like that.",2,3,0,Stella T.,"Los Angeles, CA",72,6,2

For the entrees most of the table got Penne Arabiatta, I got the Salmon Scozzese which was perfectly cooked as I asked and my friend's Linguine Cacio e Pepe smelled out of this world(definitely trying next time).

This is one of my fav salads that I always order when I see it on menus. This one was excellent. I ate the whole thing and was full. Other people at my table got the lentil salad and were raving about it. The prices are reasonable. Service was very good. They were very attentive.

3.0,11/2/2016,"Came here for brunch with family and friends on a Saturday. Sant Ambroeus was recommended by a friend and seems to be doing well with its several locations throughout the NYC. I was able to make a reservation for a party of 6 over the phone. The menu has a lot of delicious sounding options, very authentic Italian (truffle egg salad sandwich, pastas, etc). The atmosphere at the Soho location is cute. The inside is somewhat vintage looking and cozy. There is also outdoor seating available. The service was fine; waiters were friendly. The food in my opinion is a bit overpriced for the quality. I ordered the spaghetti carbonara that comes with squid ink pasta, and unfortunately, it was just okay. There wasn't much sauce to the dish and was just fairly plain. Instead of egg throughout the dish, there is one poached over the top. Other sandwiches my family ordered just seemed okay as well. Definitely a fine experience here, but I'm not dying to come back. I feel like there are better brunch/Italian places to head to for the same price, if not cheaper.

1.0,10/14/2016,I would give this a 0 star rating if it were possible. Don't have this displayed as a dessert place if it is not.We had made a reservation on open table. When we arrived we had told them we would like to be seated for dessert. They had told us to please wait at the bar for our table. We had ordered a drink at the bar and told the bartender we were waiting for a table to have dessert. After 30 minutes we were seated. When seated we had asked for the dessert menu. The manager came up to us and told we could not be seated for dessert only and told us we had to sit at the bar. We had told them no one told us we could not sit for dessert. We had said no thank you to sitting at the bar and hat I would just like to finish my full glass of wine and we would leave. He brought the check for the glass of wine. I had gone to pay for the glass of wine and the manager said we had to get up from the table and finish the wine at the bar. They do not serve just dessert. This was extremely rude to have us wait 30 minutes for our reservation and then tell me we can't sit and finish a glass of wine?! Also this reservation was at 10pm. The manager continued to say the host and bartender must not have heard me when saying I only wanted dessert. The problem with that is that we had told them 5-6 times we were there for dessert. The manager had said he had people waiting to eat dinner. When leaving there was no one waiting for dinner. If we made a reservation then you clearly had the capacity. The manager was extremely rude and I will never return for any sort of meal. He was extremely disrespectful and shouldn't be be in any restaurant. You sir should be demoted.

My friend laughed, Trader Joe's has a better one. I didn't eve finish it, and truffle is my favorite flavor in the world. No oil, and the dried truffle shavings tasted old - like dry paper.They liked their Branzino fish, but my GF pasta Bolognese was shocking. Chef Boyardee all the way. No kidding. #1. A $$$ restaurant serving rice pasta shows they don't know what they're doing. Everyone in the GF world knows that GF pasta or breads  MUST have a combo of flours for the good results. Rice pasta is bland and gets mushy fast. The sauce was pink and lame, with maybe 1 tablespoon of simple ground beef peppered in. No veggies. Are you kidding me? SOOO disappointing and far from anything I'd expect from here and the prices. My friends forced me to take it home since non of us like wasting food, but it went in the trash once home. I'd never cook such bad pasta!Fruit tart dessert was just ok. Only impressive thing was the Tiramisu. Nice.Wow, I thought this was a good place. Skip it.

2.0,8/4/2016,"Came here for Restaurant Week Summer 2016 and I have to say, the dining experience was very underwhelming. First off, the interior decor is confusing. Interior decor gives off a casual, rustic feeling, but they have these bright orange sofas (I don't even know what to call them) that have minimal cushioning and aren't very comfortable and I feel don't really fit well with the rest of the decor. The orange furniture would probably be a better fit at a lounge or club. While reading over the menu offerings, my  friend noticed that one of the waiters was like staring her down. He was standing off to the side but the direction he was looking at, she was the only person there..loll And he had this penetrating stare. That was just my observation, but it definitely made things a bit awkward..LOLL For apps, I had the burrata and my friend ordered the lentil salad. For entrees, I had the Tagliatelle Bolognese and my friend had the Spaghetti and spicy jalapeno tomato sauce. And for desserts, we had the tiramisu and the fruit tart. My burrata was good. Creamy, deliciousness. But it was served with asparagus and shaved truffles..which I thought wasn't a good combination. It was quite bland and tasteless overall, and I would've liked some bread and pesto to accompany the burrata, but unfortunately, this time it wasn't the case. My friend's lentil salad was bland. I thought there wasn't enough dressing. I thought both our entrees were quite boring. I did like the veal ragu that came with my tagliatelle, but I would've liked some shredded cheese on top like some fresh parmesan or mozzarella. My friend's spaghetti was very simple. Just basic spaghetti and sweet and spicy tomato sauce. Boohoo. I could make that at home. Our desserts were definitely the highlight of the meal. Tiramisu was without a doubt, made from scratch! Tiramisu is a classic and it is and will forever be my #1 choice for dessert. My friend's fruit tart had great presentation. It was very pretty to look at with fresh fruits layered on top of the sugar dough tartlet. The Chantilly cream inside was creamy and very tasty! But how amazing the desserts were..the apps and entrees were dismal. I would not come back here again.

The food itself was good, and it was great to see the gf bread option - the side of avo was pretty pricey though so it would have been great if the server let me know that the gf bread was an option/what I'd be receiving.Overall I'd say solid brunch spot.

It's pretty much the cutest ambiance you could ask for, especially on a nice day when you can have an outdoor table and people watch on Lafayette. I love their menus, napkins, oatmeal holders, everything... to me it feels like a cafe that would be in a Wes Anderson film (inside not as much, but it's still cute). The service is also really classy and nice. I can't quite explain it, the servers seemed to behave as if they were in an upscale white tablecloth restaurant for a fancy dinner rather than a casual brunch for a couple of people who hadn't showered yet. They weren't perfect, but always corrected any small mistake quickly and efficiently. The food is expensive, even by NYC brunch standards. To me it reminded me of European portions and prices, which isn't necessarily a bad thing... you may not get buckets of food, but do you really need buckets? The lemon ricotta pancakes were so gorgeous, but a bit dry, and the aforementioned oatmeal was just fine even though I would have appreciated some more nuts and other toppings (the berries were beautiful, though). The tricolore omelet, on the other hand, was perfect. My least favorite item was the truffled croissant sandwich. I'm a truffle fanatic but it was too flavorful even for me. It's like someone dumped half a bottle of truffle oil in there. Would not recommend that. It's a great place even just for a cup of coffee.

My friend and I were looking for a place to have lunch and conveniently, Sant Ambroeus was right nearby in Soho. We decided to sit outside but later on we realized it was a bad decision because it was way too hot! But I would recommend sitting outdoors if it's breezy and shady. The menu was fantastic and this is what we had:Starter: Salmon Tartare & CapreseMain: Tagliatelle Bolognese & Orecchiette PomodoroDessert: Sant Ambroeus Cake & Lemon CheesecakeThe quality of the food was as we expected! Not disappointed at all. I loved the salmon tartare. Very flavorful. One of the staff came over to inform us that they were having a problem with the fridge and had no buffalo mozzerella for the Caprese. Instead she asked if we were okay with Burrata. It was definitely different, but still tasted good paired together. The pasta dishes were good, but not phenomenal. Although, the Orecchiette was not hot. Now, for the dessert... These were our favorites! The chocolate mousse cake was not overly sweet and it hit the spot. There were crunchy chocolate bits inside! The lemon cheesecake was my favorite! Tangy and cheesy, love everything about it!The service was perfect, nothing to complain about. The waiters were very attentive and super nice. But, the food a little too long to come out.",0,0,0,Celeste Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",180,239,1071

Slow service, drinks were forgotten, food was so-so,  ambiance was nothing great, seats are uncomfortable... And for all this, we ended up paying ridiculous amounts of money.

4.0,3/4/2015,"This is the epitome of New York's fine dining. Not only were the staff had accents that made the restaurant so legit, the decor, ambiance and the food was all so perfect. For starters, I came here during New York's Restaurant Week for a pre-fix menu for $38. I dined here around 9:30P, so it was definitely  late dinner with a colleague. The menu consisted a three course meal - why of course. Starter, entree and dessert. Sadly, by the time we worked our way to desserts, they can only to afford to offer gelato, biscottis and fruit tart as their original desserts on their pre-fix totally ran out. Which really made me sad, but nonetheless, the gelato selection were heavenly.The food - let's dive in: I ordered their soup as my starter, butternut squash. Vegetarian friendly and creamy, in the most impeccable creamy way where it doesn't sit heavy in your stomach, where you're so full that you cannot indulge any longer. For the entree: I forgot the name of the dish but basically fish with lentils. I believe it was grilled salmon. It was grilled just right with their sauce and seasoning. I eat salmon here and there and lentils all the time, but it really made me question my cooking procedures compared to the restaurant's. Ha! But why does everything taste better?! Anyway, overall, I had a great experience here, so happy to break in my NY Restaurant Week experience with Sant Ambroeus - so fancy shmancy and well, it does live up to it (:",2,1,1,Chary S.,"Brooklyn, NY",316,278,178

5.0,1/24/2015,"A great addition to the neighborhood.With a slightly higher price-point and above-par service when compared to the neighborhood standard, this cafe/restaurant brings the classic ""Sant Ambroeus"" Italian touch.A simple but more than satisfying menu, with a well executed decor, and refined atmosphere, it caters to any time of day.

There were definitely people there, but it wasn't crazy busy. I liked the ambiance at the bar, although I wish the bartender had been a bit more attentive.Verdi cocktail - I really liked this cocktail. The most prominent flavors were the St. Germaine and the pear, which worked really well together. Gnochetti - This was delicious. When it came out, I was surprised that the pasta looked like it was in a red sauce, but it was really balsamic. The combo of the vinegar and the speck was great. I definitely recommend this dish.

The food was subpar and the service was lacking to say the least. The bloody mary tasted like a can of V8 and the burrata tasted sour.

4.0,10/19/2014,"There is quite a bit of good stuff to be said of this place (one of three locations in New York). The food is of superior quality (though the prices aren't exactly low), the staff is knowledgable, the wine list enticing, and the atmosphere very nice. The only drawback - at the SoHo location - is the very loud music. The musical selections themselves were entertaining (retro '70s stuff), but the volume was so high (even at the end of a late evening meal, when we were the only ones left in the restaurant) as to effectively preclude conversation. And conversation is one of the main reasons to have dinner out, I would think.",0,0,0,Massimo P.,"New York, NY",42,331,10
4.0,8/14/2014,"I came here for a family dinner on a Sunday night. I would suggest calling to make a reservation, as it looks like there are no tables available on OpenTable even though that may not be the case.For appetizers, we shared the burrata e fichi, insalata centocolori, insalata di quinoa. I really liked all of these although I thought the burrata was a little skimpy.For entrees, we had the trofie al ragu, black ink pasta and a uni pasta special. We all had different favorite pastas - mine was the trofie which was heavy with flavor. My grandma's filet mignon was tender and perfectly cooked. I didn't like my dad's veal chop though which tasted dry.For dessert (yes we are a family that eats a lot), we shared the Sant Ambroeus, nocciola, and tiramisu. My favorite was the Sant Ambroeus as I love chocolate, but my family really enjoyed the other two. I'd also recommend getting the Felice Rosso for wine, which is a steal at $55 for a bottle. Sant Ambroeus is a crowd pleaser with a diverse menu to please everyone! Great for groups and service was wonderful.",2,0,2,Melissa C.,"Seattle, WA",110,622,331

5.0,6/6/2014,"Five stars for Sant Ambroeus in Soho - they had it all, the service, the ambiance, and most importantly, the food!Favorites were: - Nima, our excellent waiter who thought of everything before we asked for it- the burrata with fig (one of the appetiser specials)- the black spaghetti with calms (an entree special; the pasts was so flavorful, clams were fresh)- tiramisu - the set up of the restaurant - I really liked how they did not put any tables in the middle of the room, and just had tables lining the wall, making the restaurant feel much more open)A generously poured glass of the St. Ambroeus red wine went very well with the pastas we had (black spaghetti with clams and the tagliatelle bolognese). The tri-color salad was fresh and light, and the quinoa salad although we didn't order it, looked great at a table nearby. Would recommend coming here during an off-peak hour, as I have heard that it is hard to get reservations for the prime times. While they are still fairly busy off-peak, they had tables available at a few minutes' notice at 2 pm on a Friday.Pricey though - would expect to spend between $50-80 pp including tip.",1,0,1,Amelia C.,"Jersey City, NJ",288,251,397
3.0,3/31/2014,"To start - this is a destination awesome for people watching, but underwhelming for food.  Extremely euro-centric.I give the place 3 stars because it's a really ""upscale yet cute"", and the hostess and waitress are ""nice"" but I would not say that are particularly warm.  The brunch menu was a bit lacking and the dishes itself were very ordinary and boring. I looked around to check out the other patrons, only to find most of them were having a cappuccino., blood mary and some pastries.  It's definitely not a place where you should be coming for EGGs, and heavier brunch item.  Again, light, easy portions. Very European.Came here for brunch at 12, and notice the place was a bit empty.  Around 1pm they turned the music UP and the place was beginning to get packed.  I guess they do this to live up the NYC brunch culture?  I felt it was a bit distracting and meatpackin'-ish. Overall I had a pleasant time catching up with my friend here over brunch. We were there from 12-1:30pm and felt a bit pushed to wrap it up towards the end.  Regardless, its an easy place to catch up on some girl talks.",4,0,0,Allison S.,"Brooklyn, NY",149,101,158

4.0,2/23/2014,"I didn't realize there were other locations of Sant Ambroeus. I went here when it first opened with a group of friends and really really enjoyed it. I hadn't been to a really good new restaurant in quite some time. We shared a salad and an eggplant thing to start (i'm not entirely sure exactly what it was since I wasn't paying much attention to the specials, but whatever it was, it was DE-licious.)For my entree, I had the pappardelle with mushrooms. It was incredible. And of course, I had to eat a bite of my other friends' dishes. One of my friends ordered the Veal Chop. Also - incredible. I actually could not stop staring at her plate. The others ordered the braised short ribs (also good) and the branzino (he didn't share so I can't vouch for it but I'm assuming it was very good since he cleaned his whole plate). Actually, when all was said and done, we all cleaned up everything. The dessert menu was kind of a letdown though; there wasn't really anything that looked intriguing. I took off one star because on my second visit, we had a waitress who really did not seem like she knew much about the menu, was kind of MIA most of the night and also kind of gave my friend a weird look when she asked her if she could suggest a healthier option.
