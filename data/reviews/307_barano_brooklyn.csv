5.0,4/29/2019,"One of the best pastas in Brooklyn. House made. I can't wait for a pasta tasting menu at this place. That would be amazing. Pizza is crispy thin crust. Great favor. Americano is one of my favorite. Fresh mozzarella that comes out a station by order is amazing. And if you prefer smoked it can be done. Octopus is a must and so it the chicken. Staff is friendly and helpful. Drink menu is outstanding. It changes quite a bit which is cool because they are very creative in everything that's done, from front to the back of the house. Will definitely be back.",0,0,0,Benito M.,"Sunset Park, Brooklyn, NY",58,80,282
4.0,4/24/2019,"Definitely a good place for a nice dinner even for a walk-in (on a weeknight!) We had a reservation but there were tables available and the bar was completely empty on a Weds night. Really nice ambiance and seating, but the highlight for me was the speedy service and timing of food coming out so perfectly. We had the house bread, meatballs, zucchini flowers, ricotta gnudi and the garlic shrimp tagliolini. The house bread was AMAZING and came with a hummus + pesto dipping sauce that I wanted to cover all my future breads with. The bread also went well with the meatballs which were covered in sauce and tasty cheese. The ricotta gnudi was stuffed pasta shells with really soft cheese and a great tender short rib, probably my highlight. Would pass on the tagliolini as comparatively it was just like garlic noodles to me (prob because the gnudi was so amazing). They change the menu seasonally so would love to return :)",5,2,2,Hana S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",409,602,198
5.0,4/20/2019,"Oh we Loved this place! I'm from Argentina, my boyfriend is from Brooklyn and we in California. We are always looking for unique and delicious food when we travel.. I do recommend this place and we will definitely revisit when we go back to NY. I had the ravioli stuffed with a ravioli.. perfect portion size. I hate ordering pasta because usually it seems like they cooked the whole box of pasta for one person. But this place does it right.",0,0,0,Luci R.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,33,9
3.0,4/8/2019,"My family and I came here for dinner on a Sunday.  The service was good, and the waitress was very accommodating and friendly. However, the food was truly overrated.  I think that the menu items were certainly interesting and unique, especially the pasta dishes, but they did not execute well.  For a party of 5, we ordered the little gem lettuce salad, 2 orders of meatballs, and a margherita pizza to share. All of the appetizers were delicious, but the portions were tiny!  If you do decide to dine here, make sure to get the meatballs and the salad! I wanted to try the tempura-battered zucchini flowers which looked very good. Onto the pastas... My father and brother-in-law both ordered the cavatelli with pork sausage and broccoli rabe, and they both had to send their food back because the smell of the pork was really funky and unappetizing.  They described it to me as like a pungent lamb taste and smell.  They replaced their dishes with the green garlic taglioni with shrimp which they both seemed to enjoy. I ordered the eggplant parmesan which was boring and cold, to say the least. Also, the green garlic sauce left the worst, most bitter taste of raw garlic in my mouth. We also ordered the spaghetti alla chittara which was just a simple pomodoro spaghetti -- nothing special but all in all good. We didn't order dessert because nothing really sounded good and they were serving Oddfellows Ice Cream when you could walk up a couple of blocks to the actual Oddfellows shop and get ice cream for 15% cheaper than at Barano.  I probably will not be coming back to Barano, and I really don't understand all the hype around this place.",0,0,0,Erin L.,"New York, NY",16,9,1

4.0,3/11/2019,"We checked out Barano and again a stellar dinner and cocktails. I tried the Master of Domain a bourbon cocktail that was just so well balanced. Also had vodka with a splash of pineapple. They were so delicious. Perfectly made. We had a beautiful antipasto platter with stracciatella, Italian hummus, warm bread, marinated veggies and beautifully thin prosciutto. It is one of my fav apps. We followed with the meatballs and eggplant Parmesan. The meatballs were soft and beautiful. Another fav. The eggplant was a little to al dente for me but still tasty. We tried for the first time a Gugli pasta with saffron, calabrian honey, pepper and pecorino cheese. One of my fav dishes! The pasta was so rich! Sweet and savory. Hot but not overly spicy. Just delicious. A must try.Another pasta dish was cavatelli with sausage and broccoli rabe. This was spicy but it had great flavor. Pasta was cooked perfectly al dente.  We ended the night with a dish of pignoli and rainbow cookies and a beautiful chocolate almond torte.  The coffee here is amazing. The ambience is romantic and rustic and it doesn't disappoint. Along with the staff, They are wonderful!  You must come visit.",7,3,5,Kim G.,"New York, NY",149,340,1077

3.0,2/23/2019,"How is it possible that a year later, I walk in here for dinner, and have the exact same experience!? That has never happened!After twenty long minutes of staring awkwardly at empty plates and glasses, no less than 9 servers and bussers begin immediately attending to our table, and an invisible switch gets flipped to turn things to supersonic speed. At that point, YOU GET YOUR ASS RUSHED. And we certainly weren't alone--unasked for checks were getting awkwardly dropped along our entire row of tables. Turn it over! Turn it over! On closer inspection the second time, with the smoked mirrors, and the faux marble walls (cheesy, painted) this place is looking to appeal to the New Jersey mall crowd that somehow got lost in Williamsburg and wants some pizza. Uy.The food, just like last time, is FINE. Pizzas are GOOD.You get murderous-looking SHEARS to cut your $25 pizza. Be prepared to cover your ears from the cheering from adjacent patrons: ""what???! I get to cut this myself!!!! YAY I'm half-drunk and I want nothing more than to messily start slicing through my own pizza splattering sauce on all my clothes!!!""A bro drunk on a cheap red wine loses a finger here nightly, I guarantee it. Pretentious, obnoxious, and foolhardy, the shears could get lost with nary a complaint. Not-terrible desserts are the size of a thimble, but Barano seems almost aghast at having you stay that long. You drop $150 on an experience that gets squeezed into 70 minutes. Just...why?! WHY. There. Are. So. Many. Better. Places.This is the know-nothing's version of an on-point Italian hotspot. However, they are friendly, and mean well: this place, graceless, trying too hard, and simultaneously lost in its confusing expectations, will never be for me.",1,0,0,Gabriel T.,"New York, NY",2,60,1
5.0,2/15/2019,"My boyfriend and I just went here for Valentine's Day. The food was so good, phenomenal actually. I was pretty full and couldn't finish everything entirely but tried my best! I would go back here again often. It smells like firewood burning when you walk in. The decor and overall aesthetic is pleasing and we'll laid out. Service was incredible! I will say, some of the two seater tables are pretty close to each-other, too close for comfort for me but wasn't that big of deal, just a heads up. So if you make a reservation I would ask to request a booth or something more secluded if that mores your style.

5.0,2/10/2019,"Absolutely delicious. Surprised it was relatively easy to get a reservation at this place considering how great it is but maybe I just got lucky. The atmosphere is fun and cozy and it's pretty easy to get to. We opted for the chef's pasta tasting and a margherita pizza which was the perfect amount of food for the two of us. The pizza comes with scissors to cut yourself a slice (it's hip and cool) and was thin, crispy and delicious. For the pasta we got spaghetti, the safron gigli, and the duo ravioli. All three were delicious but stand out was the safron gigli, it looked like flaming hot cheetos but was such a delicious delicate flavor. My boyfriend is vegetarian so we opted for three vegetarian options for the pasta but some of the other ones looked equally good. They have an extensive list of wines and beers to choose from as well as really yummy cocktails. Service was fast and friendly too - would highly recommend!!!",2,0,0,Devki P.,"New York, NY",329,79,34
5.0,2/3/2019,"I absolutely fell in love with this place after finding it on a whim with my two girlfriends. We spent our afternoon at an expo and wound up walking around afterwards for some good eats. Peeked at the menu in the window when we came across Barano and ran inside. We were seated at the bar area which faces the kitchen. Actually was a cozy spot, the three of us fit nicely and we had some good interaction with the staff and watching food being prepared. Our server Ken was fantastic. He was super sweet and took great care of us. Even got some ice cream on the house. The food was outrageous! Presentation is simple yet artfully displayed. Flavors are on point, I was very impressed. We split the arancini and Nduja pizza (has pork) for apps; my friends had the eggplant parmigiana and Brussels sprouts salad, I had the ricotta agnolotti - normally I don't do pasta for preference reasons, but THIS was fantastic, finished the whole plate. Desserts were divine; thank you Ken for the rainbow cake suggestion! The torta caprese was richly delicious. Recommend both - and we had some ice cream and cappuccinos as well. Definitely a gem of a spot, we will be back! Thank you!!!",0,0,0,Krista M.,"Queens, NY",0,6,7

5.0,1/6/2019,"My boyfriend took me to Barano for a surprise date, which was a great choice on his part. Thank you, Yelp! It's a romantic, but family-friendly restaurant in South Williamsburg on Broadway. Portions aren't super large, but the pizza and salad we had were delicious. When we arrived at 6:30pm on a Saturday night, it was lightly crowded, but by the time we left, it was starting to fill up. Lots of families, friends getting dinner, and dates going on.I ordered an Aperol Spritz for a drink ($11) and we decided to split the 'Nduja pizza ($25 - the server said it's their specialty/popular pizza) and the Tuscan kale salad ($14). The salad came out first and exceeded expectations as far as salads go. But the pizza? Showstopper. We barely talked as we ate it. It was big enough to satisfy 2 people, but is not going to stuff you. And you cut it with scissors, which is a fun touch.From the hosts at the front to our server, customer service was fantastic at Barano. They were super attentive and made sure we were always taken care of, even with our water glasses. We left full and happy with our time at Barano. I'd highly recommend it if you're looking for a solid restaurant in South Williamsburg for whatever the occasion.

5.0,12/26/2018,"Came here for a quick brunch on a late Saturday afternoon a few weekends ago.  It was pretty empty, so we were seated immediately.  I tried the Bucatini Carbonara and my s/o had the Semolina Pancake.  Both were excellent dishes.  To me, the Carbonara dish was well-flavored with the bacon, pecorino cheese, and the egg.  It might run a bit salty for some - but overall it was a good dish.  The pancake however, was amazing!  We didn't expect it to come out on a giant griddle - but it was enormous.  We probably could've (and should've) shared this by itself.  The exterior was nice and crunchy while it was still soft and fluffy on the inside.  It was doused in the lemon curd and covered with lots of berries.  They also provided pretty much a gravy bowl of maple syrup (and given the size of the pancake, could've easily gone thru if you like to drown your pancake in that).  Even the waiter was surprised that we managed to polish off the pancake.  It was a struggle, I'll admit, but it was definitely worth the extra calories.",0,0,0,Jackson K.,"Rego Park, NY",6,65,18
5.0,12/23/2018,"I love Barano!The restaurant is really elegant and beautifully designed, but also has a relaxed, cozy feeling as well, and the service is excellent. It still feels a little under the radar and I am waiting for it to explode a la Misi/Lilia, but for now enjoy that you can get a table or hang at the bar pretty easily (the bar is gorgeous). The meatballs are the best thing I've ever eaten in my life. I want a pasta with those meatballs and that marinara sauce. It's so f*ing good. Definitely order those! I also love the brussels sprout salad (sounds unexciting but it's delicious). Even the house bread is something to write home about. I haven't tried the pizzas but all of the pastas I've had were excellent. And the cannolo! I wasn't even hungry for it the first time I tried it and I couldn't stop eating. My only criticism is that the service is a little too fast for my liking (food coming out before drinks arrive has happened to me 3/4 times i've been). I like to be able to nurse my drink and chat a little before the courses start coming out, and have a little breathing room between courses as well so we're not in and out in 45 mins. That being said though, the food is worth it, the vibe is worth it, the drinks are worth it. Don't miss Barano.",1,0,0,C. S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,9,2

Bellisimo!!!Those meatballs are why I go out to nyc restaurants. They are perfect, but they happen to be sitting on whipped ricotta and homemade marinara sauce which make them even more perfect. The flavors are phenomenal and the texture is even better. The pizza at this place is some of the best I've had in the entire city (and I've been to all the popular spots).

The chicken liver mousse was fantastic with the blood orange marmellata, and the crispy bread-like thing on the side was also great. My husband had the Italian pork sandwich which he loved, I chose the Egg benedetto which sadly was only okay- I've eaten way better ones in other restaurants before.

5.0,10/21/2018,"Following our recent trip to the Puglia region of Italy, the ""heel of the boot,"" the babester surprised me with a successful attempt at reintroducing Italian-American cuisine to our New Yorker lives. The atmosphere on a Saturday night is lively, speckled with candle lit tables and a bar with high tops in the back. A simple lap around the menu will quickly reveal Barano's understanding of the culinary diversity across Italy. Each unique pasta shape was complimented with its own style of sauce and garnish - you won't find ""Marinara"" or ""a la Vodka"" here. We tried the Saffron Gigli - delightfully chewy little ribbons of pasta glazed with a sweet honey greeting up front and a mild, fresh black pepper warmth as you finish. The balance was unlike anything I've ever tasted and not in the slightest bit overpowering. Also highly recommended are the Brussel Sprout salad and the 'Nduja pizza - I won't spoil these for you; take a chance and taste for yourself. And at the finish line of this beautiful evening was the Affogado; two modest scoops of vanilla and chocolate ribbon OddFellow ice cream, bathed in a silky smooth espresso and served with a pair of biscotti. If your not sold by this point, there are plenty of restaurants that will provide your fettuccini Alfredo fix.

I'm not really a fan of sweet food (unless it's dessert).  So I would recommend it if that's something you really enjoy. The one bad entree I had was unfortunately the one I ordered.  I got the squid ink pasta with tuna ragú.  It was waaaaay to salty and waaaaay too fishy.  I would skip that and go for the rabbit pasta instead or the lamb or the pork.",0,0,0,Peter F.,"Manhattan, NY",39,83,4

5.0,8/20/2018,"Nice place--dark wood, dim lighting, fairly small with a patio. I came here with my mom on a Friday night and the food was amazing. To start, we had the strachiatella and the pizza bianca. The strachiatella (house-made mozzarella mixed with cream) didn't come with anything to spread it on, which was a bit odd, so we put it on the pizza bianca crust--that being said, the mozzarella was so spectacular, both indulgent and fresh, that I had no problem finishing up the dish with my fork. The pizza bianca was good as well--the basil hummus was incredibly bright and flavorful. For dinner, we had the chef's sampler pasta trio. I was delighted to find all three in the sampler were vegetarian--no substitutions necessary! The sweet corn mezzaluna in particular was spectacular--lots of different flavors at play that blended perfectly. For dessert, the rosemary semolina upside down cake was decent--a little dry, but perhaps that's just my take on most things made with less-refined flours--but the torta caprese stole the show. Incredibly rich but not too sweet, with a shortbread crust delicious in its own right, this chocolatey wonder was made just how I like it. Overall, probably worth 4.5 stars, but I'll round up due to the excellent service--no sooner was the waiter clearing our plate from the last course than the next one was appearing.",3,0,3,Lana G.,"Tustin, CA",1,10,5

How about a sauvignon blanc; dont have that. instead a rose on tap; like wine in a box. Kids had a couple of shirley temples; $5 each. For @$% sake. Pasta; portion fits in the palm of your hand. Tasty though. Pizza; now I grew up from the age of 4 to 14 in a pizza shop. This was'nt a pizza; it was a flatbread cracker with some prosciutto, arugula and shaved parm on top. Served with Scissors; this is what really turned me off. $22 for this 10"" cracker and I have to cut it myself. First off pizza should not be cut with scissors. The rolling pizza cutter was invented for this reason and NOTHING does a better job. Not to mention I should not have to work in order to eat after ordering a $22 flatbread. Service at the table; 10 people; mostly pasta dishes were ordered and that one pizza as well as apps.

The cannoli was okay. The cocktails were very good and premium... u can tell that good ingredients were used. The service was great.

Regardless, every single thing here is so top notch. The atmosphere and service are excellent. The wine list is so thoughtful, interesting, and well curated- I've found a bunch of new favorites from their bottle list. Their pizza is crazy good. The pastas are unbelievable. The arancini is an all time most delicious thing I've ever eaten. I'm always too full for their desserts, but I'm going to assume their cannoli are bomb too. I've never had a bad experience here.

5.0,8/1/2018,"We absolutely love the under-the-radar gem that is Barano!! My boyfriend and I have been coming here for over a year - probably over 7 times at this point - and every meal has been delicious. The specialty cocktail menu is extensive, fun, and diverse in its ingredients, with cocktails suited for every taste and liquor preference. We usually always go for the large antipasto platter with smoked mozzarella and either the salted mozz or stracciatella. The smoked mozz is presented fancifully with a smoky reveal, and flavor-wise knocks it out of the park. Their prosciutto is some of the best we've ever had, and their rotation of vegetables is always fresh, fun, and a perfect complement to the meat and cheese. I always opt for a pasta dish here. Their seasonal rotations are SPECTACULAR - sweet corn puree! heavenly little purses of shredded duck! - MMMMM. They always hit the nail on the head as to what I'm craving, and they always deliver. A staple you can rely on is the Saffron Gigli. Slightly sweet, slightly spicy, different than anything I've ever tasted.All in all, this is a treasured neighborhood secret and while we love the fact that we can get last minute reservations any night of the week, we're counting on people to finally discover the amazingness of Barano!!",4,0,4,Anna F.,"Manhattan, NY",2,6,0

Food, service, atmosphere, cocktails and wine/beer all come together for an incredible experience. They have a good vegetarian selection and are always willing to accommodate. The pizza is great and salads/pasta/dessert as well. Whatever the kitchen makes has been superb and unique. The ramp pizza, the breakfast pizza, the grilled peach salad - all so good. Finally, this has got to be one of the best bar programs in NYC. Amazingly creative seasonal cocktails. One list was based upon The Sopranos, the next Schwarzenegger films. So much work and thought into their unique and inventive cocktails. And the wine and beer list that is nothing short of amazing served by a knowledgeable bar manager/sommelier.

4.0,7/17/2018,"i'm kicking myself for not having tried Barano sooner! It's a bit tucked away on Broadway, across from Donna and Blank Cafe, and it's a wonderfully stylish and intimate spot with a great bar and incredible Italian food. I recently celebrated an anniversary there and it was the perfect level of fanciness without being stuffy. To keep things even more casual (and to avoid sitting too close to noisy talkers at the closely arranged tables), we grabbed a tall table by the bar so our servers were the bartenders. This meant that they made great cocktail and wine recommendations, which was a nice bonus. We started the evening with some cocktails. We loved that they were all named after Arnold Schwarzenegger lines. Mine was called Come With Me If You Want to Live and though it wasn't super special, it was a refreshing and sweet way to start the meal. On our server's recommendation, we got the hand pulled smoked mozzarella, which comes in a fun smokey cloche thing. We got it along with Lucky's tomatoes, which is a very simple dish of fresh tomatoes, basil, etc, and a perfect complement to the mozz. I was even more impressed with the beef meatballs, which were enormous and came buried in freshly grated parm. Though the pasta dishes were a bit small, they were packed with flavor. I got the Ricotta Rosilli, which came with asparagus, truffle pieces, and still more parm. It was packed with flavor and the house made pasta was the absolute perfect texture. My husband got the saffron gigli which he thought was a bit over flavored with the honey in there, but again the pasta itself was heavenly. We weren't super impressed by the dessert, which we ordered from their specials. It was a rainbow cake covered in chocolate and topped with raspberries and crispy rice. I just didn't think the flavor was anything special and would have rather grabbed a gelato cone from Gentile down the street after our meal. In any case, we walked away from there absolutely stuffed with cocktails, food, great wine, espresso, and amaro, and we couldn't be happier.

While the space itself is very inviting, the food and service is bizarre. First, the sommelier asked my friend what kind of wine she had in mind and she asked for a simple rose. He came back and proceeded to pour her a tiny glass of wine. When she (politely) asked the waitress about the small amount, the waitress responded that they had a strict 5-ounce pour policy. Okay. That glass of rosé ended up being over $20. I ordered a gigli pasta, which turned out to be a bright orange dish that tasted like kraft macaroni and cheese doused in honey. The sauce was literally just straight honey. The salad we got was a few pieces of iceberg lettuce with heaping spoonfuls of thick caesar dressing. Finally, when my friend asked for some parmesan cheese for her pasta, the server responded that he would have to ask the chef if he would allow it, since the dish already came with a different type of cheese (?!). He finally acquiesced and agreed to bring her some parm on the side. Strange and unappetizing meal all around.

We started with an artichoke-- and I'm glad my Italian grandmother has no idea what Yelp is, because this was by far the best stuffed artichoke I've ever had! The perfect blend of breadcrumbs, light cheese and lemon. If stuffed artichokes are your thing (or even if they aren't), TRY IT! The breakfast bowl was perfect-- though it didn't list it, it came with maitake mushrooms (a favorite) and had so much flavor. My partner had the breakfast sandwich, which was also quite good. As a treat, we shared the honey pecorino biscuit-- and quite the treat it was. GET ONE!! Also, as I mentioned before the staff is always really friendly and helpful.

I thought nothing of it at the time, but it was to be a foreshadowing of the rest of the night and then some. It took awhile for our entrees to come, granted we ordered a steak, but it was longer than most waits for other steak houses I've dined at. Then when entrees did begin to show up to the table, it was not what we had ordered. They apparently had a mix up with another table. After more waiting, we finally received our table's main courses. However, they still got one of my friend's order wrong (which shows up correctly on our bill, will also get back to this later). Instead of further arguing he decided to make due with what was already prepared (he was also one of the individuals we were celebrating for his birthday) since we already waited for so long. Now going to the special tomahawk steak; the steak's quality wasn't bad but the steak was COLD. Which I surmised was due to the first debacle of incorrect entrees being sent to our table and that the steak was just sitting there. Not something we would have expected from a $120 steak, from any other reputable restaurant. Now came time for the bill. We noticed the happy hour drinks we ordered at the bar was fully priced. Which I realize some places only have happy hour prices at the bar, but we ordered these drinks at the bar while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive. They should have notified us to close out our bar tab prior to being seated if they were going to charge us full price!! Completely unprofessional and borderline criminal.So we pay with a single credit card and attempt to leave the horrible experience and taste in our mouths behind us. Now most of the time this is when a review would end, but not in this scenario. The next day my friend who paid with his CC noticed two charges on his card of different amounts from Barano. Now I may understand a bit if there were multiple cards to charge to if we had split the bill, but we hadn't. He calls Barano and speaks to a manager named Jason and he says he will look into it and give my friend a call back. Of course my friend never gets a return call from Jason. In the end, my friend had to go to his bank and deny the additional charge. Completely nightmarish experience from Barano, will never be coming back to this establishment.  Their unprofessionalism can only be matched by their incompetence. So many better Italian restaurants to choose from in the area.",4,0,0,Chun Wei T.,"New York, NY",0,7,2
4.0,1/31/2018,"I had been to Barano for brunch with a friend close to a year ago.  I remember loving the Meatballs we had shared, as well as my Breakfast Bowl with crispy farro, giardinera, and kale, topped with a fried farm egg and a broccoli rabe pesto.  Though we had been two of the only guests in the restaurant, we had been impressed and swore to return.  I happened to be in Brooklyn with someone else a few days ago, and the place instantly popped into my head as an ideal dinner option for us.  I checked online for a reservation, but saw nothing at the 8 pm timeslot we had needed.  I called the restaurant directly and was told that they could save one of their high-top tables for us in the bar area.  We jumped at the opportunity and eagerly awaited our meal.  It was a good thing that I had called ahead, because we managed to grab the last table in this normally spacious restaurant, which was then completely packed.  Based on my previous experience, we started with the 21-Day Dry-Aged Beef Meatballs, which were served as 3 pieces in a cast-iron skillet, topped with a chunky tomato sauce and herbed ricotta.  The balls were airy and succulent, without the denseness that comes from too many breadcrumbs.  The sauce was perfectly seasoned, hearty, and possessed the ideal amount of sweetness.  We asked for some bread to soak up the sauce and were given a platter that was beyond any typical bread basket.  I just knew they had given us the Pizza Bianca, a $5 plate of farro sourdough with a chickpea and basil hummus that was sprinkled with sea salt and oregano.  The herbed pesto that was on top of the hummus really enhanced it, and it was just too good to stop eating.  Since we were unsure of any potential cost, we figured we would see what was reflected on the bill.  We also ordered the Maitake Mushroom Pizza, which was enveloped in mozzarella and ricotta.  While the cheeses were creamy, gooey, and smooth, we missed the traditional marinara sauce.  (We always feel that way about white pizzas, though.)  The added fresno chilies were a zesty substitute, but I wish there were more of them.  Then, we had the most perfect Grilled Duck Breast, which was lean and cooked to perfection!  It was accompanied by brussels sprouts and farro and glazed with a tangy quince mostarda.  The dish exuded rustic, seasonal flavors.  At this point, we were extremely full, especially from the bread, but we were waiting on our Herb Lumache goat ragu pasta.  Waiting...and waiting, but it never came.  We decided to let it slide, since we were stuffed anyway.  When the bill arrived, we noticed that we had been charged for both the bread and the pasta.  After speaking with the manager, we were able to get both charges removed, which we greatly appreciated.  Barano's food was absolutely stellar and worthy of a visit, but the service could be improved.",13,0,7,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640
3.0,1/27/2018,"Food was service was good. Was expecting it to compete with Lilia and Leuca, but in our opinion it is not at that level.  The menu is very limited. We had the artichoke which was great. I had saffron gigli pasta with safron and honey which was very good but the portion was tiny. My wife had chicken which was just ok. Of note, no bread is put on the table, when we got the artichoke, I asked for bread as the liquid it was in was incredible and I had to dunk. I was told that they do not have bread (hmm, an Italian restaurant without bread), but I was told i could order from the menu,  pizza bianca which I did. I did not like having to pay for my bread.Message to management,  why not bread, it makes no sense.

5.0,1/15/2018,"During a girls trip to NYC one of our party chose Barano for our Friday night kickoff and I've never been more thankful. We started with drinks at the bar while we waited for our table. The drinks were prepared beautifully and tasted just as good. They were a great balance of strong and flavorful (& not as expensive as I had expected!)Once seated we chose two small plates, the artichoke and the jumbo prawn. Both were delectable. The jumbo prawn includes a squid ink aioli and I'd be willing to fly back to NYC for that alone. For our main course we decided to share everything so we ordered the saffron gigli and a chefs trio. I can't really describe to you how good it all was. If there was a word I would probably say, ambrosial. Yes, it's that good. Perfect balances of savory and sweet. Pasta cooked to perfection and nice portion sizes. While the food is the highlight of Barano I would be doing a disservice if I didn't mention the incredible atmosphere and personalities of the staff that really bring everything full circle. The playlist is straight from your Spotify dreams (and even better when we found out an employee made it). And the staff...from the greeter, to the bar staff , to our waiter, and anyone else we encountered... it was like being home.

5.0,1/8/2018,"Fell in love as soon as I walked in, a warm cozy escape from the blistering cold outside. Mood: Soft yellow lighting in a really large space with a handsome bar, it's a kind of vibe that's appreciated for all occasions. Love the menu variety, and pretty much everything was as good as it sounds. You can't go wrong with arancini (5/5) which come stuffed with cheese and 4 per order. The eggplant (4/5) was deliciously tender eggplant parm, and with a very cool parmesan crisp on top. Meatballs (5/5) are loosely packed and tender, more of that great red sauce, and definitely get a spoonful of the herbed ricotta. So good! The grilled gem lettuce (5/5) is one of the best salads I've ever tried, a little smoky with all the right components and an amazing whipped lemon ricotta hiding underneath. Not your average salad. Romanesco (5/5) was also amazing - they know what to do with their vegetables - with a little kick of spice.Good thing we threw in a lot of vegetables, because then we went full carb 4 pastas and 3 pizzas and it was the best decision ever. Pastas in order of most loved to still loved eating: saffron gigli (5/5 - sweeter than you'd think and looks like hot cheetos, but it works so well!), paccheri (5/5 - classic hearty flavors), herb lumache (4.5/5 - is throwing gochujang into pasta blasphemy? Not when it tastes this good), Duo agnolotti (3.5/5 - both agnolotti had a strong flavor that I would've liked better together rather than separate).  Pizzas are crisp crust with a uniform gentle distribution of toppings, and you get to cut it with pizza scissors! Give those bad boys a shot, when else are you going to have that opportunity? Kabocha squash (5/5) was amazing, and maitake mushroom (4/5) and americano (4.5/5) were also terrific. The shishito peppers are sliced, not whole, and give a subtle kick.Can you believe we had room for dessert? With my sweet tooth, I couldn't help myself and the limoncello semifreddo was quite spectacular. It sounds intriguing and strange, I don't even like limoncello OR semifreddo much, but this was more like a fresh lightly whipped frozen cheesecake consistency on this delicious crumbly crust, light and perfect. TLDR: Come hungry and try everything! I recommend focusing on the pastas and pizzas, and try the limoncello semifreddo. If I lived around the corner, I'd come everyday.",15,0,16,Lillian Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",461,285,1300
2.0,1/2/2018,"It may have just been an off night but I had a bad experience here. NYE Prix Fixe - $120, so it wasn't a cheap meal. First course was foie gras which was delicious. Not a big deal, but four plates four different portions of food and one was missing truffles. Second course, also delicious but my plate came with foil in a bite. Next course prawns.  My prawn was cooked on the tail end but the core was a bit under cooked. Two other plates on the table were completely under cooked which is pretty easy to tell. The meat was translucent and wouldn't come off the shell. But the worst part was when we sent it back the manager came out to make a point that we didn't know what we were talking about and stick it to us that the prawns were cooked. It's not really an argument you want to make with 2 cooks sitting at the table. At that point we walked out.

5.0,12/30/2017,"This review comes from a very critical foodie; so when I give five stars to a restaurant they deliver on all counts. It was an extremely cold night and unfortunately we were close to the door and it was quite cold. Initially, when we asked if we could be seated elsewhere they were unable to do so however ten minutes later they came back and they were able to move us. They gave us an amazing table where you were able to talk and relax which was important to us since our daughter was visiting from LA and we were six persons dining. This immediately gave us the feeling that they wanted to please us. The Service  was attentive and professional without being intrusive. The waiters are familiar with the menu and make excellent suggestions. The sommelier is extremely knowledgable and he took the time to chat with my husband and compare some of their notes. This added to the flavor of the evening feeling as it was a more personal experience. They seemed to care which is unfortunately many times not the case in nyc restaurants; just a pack them in and get them out and call it a night. The food I would characterize as modern twists on the Italian classics as well as some Nuevo pastas, pizzas, and wonderful appetizers. We ordered so much food I can't even begin to list them.! However I will say the smoked mozzarella is stellar, octopus, artichoke,meatballs, eggplant, duck raviolis,and all pastas were as well executed as when I was Italy. I can't wait to repeat this meal sometime after I complete my New Years resolution like the rest of us on slowing down on the eating!

3.0,11/11/2017,"More of a 3.5. This was my second time at Barano and again I am unimpressed with the service. The food is great. Service is mediocre at BEST. The people there seem like they have no restaurant experience. Which is fine. But clearly the training they are receiving is subpar. We had 5:45 dinner reservations on a Saturday. We went to order appetizers and said that we would wait to put our mains in (a very normal request). The waiter told us he ""preferred"" if we put the order in at once just because the kitchen will get ""slammed"" and he won't be able to make it back to us. It was 5:45....there was maybe 4 other tables in there. But fine. He finally comes back we order everything. Food came out in good timing. We then noticed that he was one of two servers on. Barano is a small restaurant but not small enough for there to only be 2 servers. There was a few other people bringing food out/watering tables, but this doesn't allow for much attention. After our meal we got the check and I wanted to use an open table dining reward I have...which I booked the table using. The manager came over and asked to see my phone and walked away with it. She then came back and said ""yeah so we don't accept that"" in a fairly rude manor. It was $10 so I didn't really care to make a fuss at that point. However, open table now just uses MasterCard gift cards for rewards so clearly the restaurant could have accepted it. I have to be fair and say the food is pretty incredible. The salted mozzarella is a must get as well as a pizza to share.Other tips: try to get a table on the far side of restaurant. It can get cold in the winter and you might get stuck next to the server stand which is often disruptive.",0,0,0,Madison K.,"Brooklyn, NY",396,15,8

5.0,10/9/2017,"The first time I tried Barano was with a friend who is sensitive to gluten so we searched for restaurants with gluten free options. Barano has a whole menu of gluten free items which includes a good portion of their regular menu. I do not eat gluten free but we wanted to try a few things so we ordered off of the gf menu. We got the ricotta and zucchini flower pizza ($18), the saffron gigli ($16) and the little gem salad ($10). I was surprised as to how good the gf pizza dough was. It was chewy but crunchy and had a really nice almost whole-grain taste. They give you a pair of scissors to cut the pizza though they kind of hurt your fingers but it is a nice presentation. The saffron gigli was amazing and I kept thinking about it until my next visit. This is the only pasta dish I have ever had and though was so unique/memorable. My friend and I barely finished the food but we were seriously contemplating ordering another saffron gigli to go. The service was great and the restaurant is quite large which makes it an attractive choice for large parties---which brings me to my second visit.The second time I tried Barano was in September for Rosh Hashana (clearly, not a very religious family but we still have dinners). We had 7 people in our party and we needed a place that can 1. accommodate 7 of us 2. have an option for everyone, especially the picky eaters in our party and 3. isn't too pricy. I thought of Barano and it was a great choice. The menu has everything from very simple dishes to more interesting ones and there was really something for everyone. For starters: we ordered two pizzas for the table, one was a special white pizza with potatoes and kale (it was $16 or $17 I think) and the other was the margherita ($14). Half of us liked the potato-kale more (myself included) and the other half liked the margherita more though both were excellent. I have to say though, the dough was great but I kind of wished I had ordered it gf because I really liked that dough better. We also ordered two artichokes ($12 ea) which were lemony and had a lot of breadcrumbs. They were good but quite messy and there isn't much to actually eat on the artichoke (which is generally the case with whole artichokes). We also got caponata ($5), and while the portion is quite large for $5, this was the least liked dish of the night--- I would skip it. The last of the starters we got were the meatballs ($14). These come with 3 in an order; I did not try these but the people that did seemed to really like them. For our mains, we got several pastas and the octopus. The pastas we got were as follows: maccheroni ($14) a simple yet very tasty tomato sauce spaghetti, an herb lumache (a special with spicy goat ragu, pecorino, and lime bread crumbs) that I did not try but others said was the best pasta, the fusilli lunghi ($17), the bucatini ($17) with roasted maitake and bread crumbs which was excellent, and two order of the saffron gigli ($16). I split the saffron gigli and the octopus ($15) with someone; while the pasta dough was much better than the gf one, I did like that in the gf version the saffron was in the butter instead of in the dough. The gf version tasted a lot more savory to me than the regular which overall had more intense flavors. The octopus was perfectly cooked and had a lot of tasty things in the plate, such as crispy farro and mint pesto and I would 100% order it again. Once again the service was wonderful and everyone loved the food. It was also very reasonably priced for the amount of food we got. I will definitely be coming back again!",5,2,6,Noa B.,"New York, NY",499,211,705

Just a quick walk from the L train it is pretty easily accessible for people living in the city as well.My girlfriends and I shared two bottles of white wine (although their cocktail list looked pretty tempting too!), a few apps and pastas. I think this place is really good for family style because you will want to try so many of their dishes!!I really recommend the octopus and tuna fish as a starter and pretty much every pasta dish. The bucatini were to die for, they come with a mushroom and basil pesto sauce and are out of this world! I also tried the whole fish (snapper) which was a winner. Can't wait to come back and try some of their pizzas.Be sure to check it out! Super friendly staff and service as well.",9,0,9,Cinesina C.,"New York, NY",52,83,37

5.0,8/21/2017,"I don't do Italian often. As a matter of facts, it's just not that my typical food. It feels so awkward to dine in in the classic Italian restaurant. That said, there are one thing that make me want to have Italian: the peer recommended Italian restaurant with a great company.Why does Barano make me want to take a ride to have Italian meal? Part of it because of definitely come from Barano's Instagram post. I don't usually take a mass review seriously but I just felt that this place has something special. But really, it's because every meal I have had here has ended with me feeling like some sort of real sophisticated eater.I was craving for octopus and that was the only thing I picked. The rest I left to the waiter decide what I should have. I was informed that they had a special risotto. I said, we will go for it. Even though I don't know much about ingredients or the price. The result: the food was excellent? I should use the word ""decadent"" instead. The risotto was perfectly cooked and I felt like in heaven. The service is perfect. The entire experience is curated from the moment we sat down, to the first bite we had ,to the time we left. The price of risotto is ridiculous. But really, that's not the point. I happened to talk with the manager who was very professional and very nice. ( even though I dressed like a kid who happened to found this restaurant by luck. But the service was still great.)

5.0,8/13/2017,"Came here for dinner before a night out in Brooklyn. I have my favorite restaurants in BK but after dining here this one has definitely moved to the top of my list. I knew this place was Michelin rated so I was expecting good food but it was better than good! Unlike most restaurants, they didn't start us off with bread. I liked this because you don't fill up on bread and you actually enjoy the food. I started off with the octopus appetizer which was delicious. I always select octopus appetizer when I see it on the menu and this one took the cake for actually being able to taste the charring flavoring from the grill. Yum! We also got the heirloom tomato salad which the cheese was soooo smooth and fresh as well as the tomatoes. I have been craving risotto all week and they happen to have a dish for a special. I believe it was artichokes folded into the risotto with prosciutto and other flavoring. It was delicious! Normally I cannot finish my plate but the dishes were so perfectly portioned and delicious I had no problem finishing it all. This also saved room for desert! I ordered a cappuccino and the tira mi su.  The tira mi su was so creamy and delightful! Best I ever had.   It wasn't just the food that made me feel this restaurant was one of the best but it was also the service. Our waiter Jordan was a pleasure. When we needed him he was always there and when we wanted to enjoy our dinner alone he was away for the perfect amount of time. Not only that but the staff at the restaurant wasn't overwhelming. They were laid back and personable yet professional. I really enjoy that in a restaurant.  Also, the timing of our food was to perfection from the appetizers to the dessert.

We ordered the Heirloom tomato salad (ORDER THIS!) and meatballs as appetizers. The Salad was fresh and refreshing but the meatballs were a little dry and just dint hit the spot. For them sun course, we ordered the Saffron Gigli and Green Lumache. The Gigli was amazing - such a distinct flavor but I don't think I can have the entire dish as main course. If you are a saffron fan, go for it! The Lumache was so promising - great texture, loved the crumbs, but happened to be on the saltier side. All said and done, I will be back again!

The salted mozzarella is delicious as is the fusilli with lamb bolognese. The pizzas come with fun scissors to cut them. The third time I brought my parents from out of town. The waitstaff seemed new and they had shortened the menu. The service wasn't great particularly when compared to other neighborhood restaurants at similar price points. Meadow Sweet, Midnights or Sunday in Brooklyn would have been better choices. A series of little things from running out of the wine we ordered to no longer serving free, fresh bread with their Caponata or Mozzarella to serving entrees while one person was in the bathroom put a damper on the meal.

4.0,5/30/2017,"Came here twice. First time was on a Thursday night in March before a concert at Williamsburg music hall and had a great meal! Loved the menu selection and layout. We had ""pick 3 "" from homemade mozzarella assortment an Italian meat and caponata.  The stracciatella was delicious. We ordered a pizza as an app and it was average, not what you would come here for.  We shared the saffron gigli for din we which was great. Our waiter recommended a great white wine to compliment the meal and truly made the experience enjoyable.Second visit was over Memorial Day weekend- not as impressed. They shortened the menu  - not sure if this is for summer or if they are getting more traffic so keeping it shorter and simple. Had the stracciatella again it was great, but this time it does not come with complimentary bread, it had an up-charge. We ordered the fish special which was very good too. My gf had the tortellini dish this time and she enjoyed it. I highly recommended this place to friends based on the quality of food and my first overall experience, it had the small mom/pop restaurant ambiance. Unfortunately my second experience  feel short of the first - shorter menu - pay for bread that should be complimentary.

5.0,3/7/2017,"Barano is our new favorite neighborhood spot! The staff is impeccably kind and knowledgable, the food is stellar and they have interesting beers on tap and in the can. My husband and I have eaten there three times, the most recent being on Valentine's Day. They were able to book us for a table for two at the last minute (we went early, which also helped), and the experience was wonderful. Our waitress was very friendly and stayed on top of things the whole time, despite getting busy later in the meal. There was a guy named Jason (I think) who came by and dropped the miracle news to my husband that they carry Other Half, which if you are a beer fan and haven't had it, you must. It seems pretty rare for restaurants to carry it, probably because they don't distribute much of it. (They're located in Red Hook and there's always a line around the block to get into their brewery on Saturdays.)Anyway, the FOOD! Our favorites are the smoked mozzarella, which they make in-house and bring to you underneath a glass container filled with smoke - very Instagram-worthy if you're into that - and the prosciutto plate pairs well with the cheese. For mains, the pasta with the rabbit ragu is stellar and the fish is great if you're wanting something on the lighter side (you can ask for them to take the head off for you), and they usually have a great special or two. For example, one time they had a huge ribeye steak for two that they slow marinated then grilled and it was really unexpected and well-executed.It's so refreshing to find a place that has consistently great service and food!

I could eat that mozzarella all day if I weren't lactose intolerant. The pesto on the side was divine as well.

5.0,1/30/2017,"First off, the food was great. Apparently the owner was head chef at Rubirosa, so you know the pizza, eggplant parm, and generally anything with tomato sauce will be on point. But all this is second to the fact that the service was spectacular. Really, as good as it gets. We came here on a Sunday night, and after dinner my girlfriend tripped and fell - broken iPhone, bloody knees, the whole deal. The maitre d hooked me up with tons of bandages, an alcohol swab, and candy to patch her up in no time! Also, the waitress was really great to talk to. She said she's been there from the beginning, and helped get the restaurant's zoning approved.The decor was unreal - it's really perfect for a classy date. Everything, from the vintage table designs, to the napkins, down to the matches at the door, was thoroughly thought out.Now - Onto the food - the margarita pizza was great, and even comes with special pizza scissors to cut the slices as narrow or wide as you like. Sauce was top notch, but bread eventually became soggy, as is the case with most Italian-style pizza. The pesto/pistachio pasta is highly recommended, and the eggplant parm was filled with juicy tomato/cheesy goodness. They gave us a free tart-like dessert that consisted of molten chocolate cake, crisp outer crumb, and a whip cream that was so fresh, it kinda reminded me of ice cream - although it didn't melt.At the end of the day, I think we spent $60 or $70 on a full dinner for two. Location is not so convenient and they still don't have hard liquor, but all in all, worth the trip. Thank you!",12,0,9,Hal D.,"New York, NY",219,147,305

3.0,1/29/2017,"This review is for the Brunch that I just had today, so the information that I am providing is for Brunch and no other meal. I was pleased to find that arriving at 1pm on a Sunday that the resturant was relatively empty, there was a large party and all the banquets were filled but everything other table was open. We selected the resturant based upon some mentions online (Thrillist, etc) and wanted to try something new.The decor is very nice and inviting and they did a nice job in creating a cool environment. We were seated quickly and looked over a pretty nice selection of dishes. The kids wanted hot chocolate and low and behold they offered it on the menu, the waitress mentioned that it was very good and sweet so we ordered it for them ... spoiler alert, it was more like drinking chocolate and was more on the bitter side ... so note, if you are getting hot chocolate for the kiddies ... don't get it if they are expecting sweet and creamy. Also to note, it took an ungodly amount of time to actually get the hot chocolate ... like 15~20 minutes. But that is hardly why they got a 3 out of 5 stars ... They are a relatively new resturant so to a certain extent they should receive a bit of a grace period but it was slow (save the large party) and they should have been more attentive to us, it took quite a while to get our coffee and then take our order. We ordered the anti pasta for the table to start, cavatelli, eggs benedetto, and lemon pancake. It took an extremely long time to get  anti pasta but when we did, the mozzarella was exceptional as were the pizza crusts served with it, the prosciutto was thinly shaved and delicious. The cavatelli arrived and the pasta was well cooked but the sauce lacked seasoning ... could have used a little heat. The eggs benedetto looked the part however it was served on a wood board which made attacking it a little challenging ... the eggs were well prepared but the ham was hard to cut through and lacked enough sauce to make it a proper benedict (it was also cold ... which leads me to believe the kitchen needs better timing). The pancake was huge and the berry compote was tasty but still lacked anything that would put it on the same page as 5 Leaves or Cafe Luluc level. The service was a little scattered and underwhelming, they were nice enough but just not consistent or timely. All in all it was an ok experience ... I feel like they have promise and you can tell that they care about the food though I feel it needs a little tinkering to make it special. One omission from the breakfast menu was bacon ... for a place like this with so much ham ... having a great bacon side would have been awesome. I would like to try them for dinner as I feel like that would be stronger than Brunch.",1,1,0,Adam G.,"Brooklyn, NY",30,7,2

2.0,12/31/2016,"Wanted to try this place since it opened a few months in the South Williamsburg neighbourhood where I live. The atmosphere is nice and it's a really nice setting - that gets it the extra star. Unfortunately, everything else is pretty dire: the food - our party of four ordered a pesto pasta dish, an octupus pasta and assorted starters. In all three cases the food was seriously average and certainly not worth $20 a dish. The octopus in particularly tasted like a tinned tomato and frozen calamari that you could get for about $5. As other people have said, with some of the other food they were trying adventurous stuff and using lots of abstruse Italian words on the menu to justify charging more for the dishes. (incidentally, truffle pasta for $70 anyone? It costs half to a quarter of that all over town). The service was even worse. We got as waitor some guy who looks like Kelly Jones from the Stereophonics. He looked surly all night until we were about to leave when he off course suddenly became fawning. When he brought that bill, we thought we had been overcharged. To be precise - the menu was poorly written: it says ""Antipasto tasting - Mozzarella + Salume + Verdure 25, with Mangalica +5"". This apparently means that you can SUBSTITUTE the salume for the mangalica by paying $5 more. This was very unclear and we explained this but Kelly Jones insisted that he had explained this and that we were too dim to understand. His manner was very rude and abrasive.

Pizza was served with a cut it yourself scissors which we thought was quirky and fun. Fresh smoked hand pulled mozzarella was amazing. Took my breath away on every bite.

They pulled it when we ordered we also ordered the posuitto and caponata.i It was so fresh and delicious. We also had the best pizza. The pork chop was cooked perfectly.  We had the Branzino  we asked them to not bring the fish with its head attached.  It was delicious.  We ordered the squash and some pasta dishes.

5.0,12/2/2016,"I was surprised how good this restaurant was since I had high expectations given the Yelp ratings. My wife and I agree this the first restaurant we've been to, in a long time, where each dish was excellent. There are some great restaurants in Williamsburg, but even compared to them I think Barano stood out. Before I expand on that, would also note that we brought our 4 year old with us, and the restaurant was surprisingly child friendly, despite the high trendiness factor. I would say the must have dishes were the smoked mozzarella cheese appetizer, dry aged beef meatball appetizer, squid ink pasta and the Canolo for desert. The service was just OK. If I could I would give 5 stars minus 0.5 for service. So my real adjusted rating would be 4.5.",12,0,7,J W.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,33,1

1.0,10/19/2016,"We had a really unpleasant dinner at Barano. After making a booking several weeks in advance and calling to confirm the same day, we arrived at 8:30 and shortly after saw the hostess mix up and seat the wrong party at our table, resulting in a wait of over an hour. We noticed another party also waiting due to a similar issue. The manager brought us sparkling wine and snacks. After being seated, our waiter greeted us and then disappeared - leaving us waiting to order for a full 30 minutes, so we weren't able to order until 10pm. The food was good, but at this point, our enjoyment was really soured by the bad service. They set down an extra pasta dish, and we let the waiter know we didn't order it. She took it away and then came back saying, ""it's on us."" It was unclear if it was genuinely an accident or if they meant to comp us a dish, either way it was a bit thoughtless as a number of people in our party are gluten-intolerant and we made that known several times. We we're getting close to 11pm by the time we were getting our mains, and I let the manager know that we'd continued to experience service issues - especially troubling since we were celebrating our friend's birthday and had made that known in advance. I let him know we'd like to have more attentive service through dessert, as we had a show to get to later on. Puzzlingly, he sent us the bill outright (nothing comped, except that mystery pasta), and I had to flag down the waiter to tell him to reopen our bill and order dessert. It was a frustrating, awkward, and embarrassing experience. The manager was too busy chatting up other tables (presumably friends or industry people) for us to flag him down when we weren't getting service or mistakes were being made. I wouldn't recommend it for any kind of special occasion, it really ruined our friend's birthday and was a deeply unpleasant night.",6,0,0,Haley S.,"Brooklyn, NY",74,3,0

We had a light meal with the homemade mozzarella, a pasta and a side of baked mushrooms. All unique and perfectly done.They were almost tripping over themselves to be accommodating.

3.0,9/23/2016,"I went to Barano during dine in Brooklyn and although the meal was a steal, price-wise, there were a couple of missteps.Food: the food was mostly good to great. I loved the meatballs and the sauces that came with the bread served at the beginning of your meal. The mozzarella was good but a tad undersalted so tasted a bit bland. The ricotta cavatelli was good but nothing special and we couldn't taste any hint of spice from the Calabria chili. Now the roasted Amish chicken though...the breast was juicy but some of the dark meat had an odd rubbery texture and was pink. I was told that it was fine and had been roasted for hours and hours but the texture was really off-putting. The beans it came with were quite sour and didn't quite go with the rest of the dish. I thought the desserts of cannolo and Oddfellows ice cream were just okay as well.Service: pretty good but rather pretentious (a lot of explaining going on...)I'd actually give Barano 3.5 stars...maybe I should've tried the pizza!",1,0,1,Su-Yee L.,"New York, NY",118,313,160

3.0,9/1/2016,"KenScale: 7.5/10I'm always a sucker for good old red-sauce Italian American restaurants that display a lot of richness in flavor. When a new restaurant opened up below the Williamsburg Bridge, headed by a chef who previously worked at Rubirosa (the excellent standard bearer in the city when it comes to the red-sauce cuisine), I was immediately hooked into checking it out. According to chef Albert Di Meglio, who grew up in Staten Island, the food from Barana is inspired by his childhood memory in the often neglected borough of New York City tracing back to the Italian roots of his grandmother. Unfortunately, I've had quite a few misses on my recent visit with my girlfriend.The menu at Barana looks like an assortment of Italian classics, from various appetizers including mozzarella cheese and salami to pastas and pizzas to other large savory dishes. Some dishes were curiously off in terms of either flavor or texture. The shredded stracciatella mozzarella cheese was a little bit more salty than I had expected, and my girlfriend and I were a bit incredulous when we tried the meatballs which, contrary to its description that they were from 21-day dry-aged beef, tasted like a chunk of meat loaf from a meat processing plant. I've definitely had better meatball dishes elsewhere, and had to wonder why the texture of the meat at Barano came out so unexpectedly bad. Among the pasta options, we tried the bucatini with rabbit ragu and there was nothing memorable about this dish; the flavor of ragu was on the stronger side, and not in a good way, and the noodle wasn't as firm in texture as I had expected from a bucatini dish. The saving grace among the savory options was the Calabrese pizza that I absolutely enjoyed. The combination of sausage, chilies and peppers was quite remarkable and the perfectly cooked thin crust of the pizza added more delight to the pie. Things started to get better on the dessert side. The panna cotta with milk, honey, citrus and pistachio hazelnut brittle was serviceable, and the other dessert, a single piece of cannolo with ricotta, candied fruit and dark chocolate, was absolutely sensational. I really had no idea that you could add ricotta into a dessert dish to such memorable effect; if I hadn't been nearly stuffed at that point, I might've finished at least two of the sticks. Getting a reservation at Barano was relatively easy, and the dining space was around half full in the course of our meal. I liked the casual neighborhood vibe of the dining space quite befitting a restaurant in Williamsburg. There is full bar with Italian-centric wine list you can complement your meal with. It is a bit unfortunate that my experience at Barano wasn't quite up to the standard of red-sauce establishment that I had set since coming over to NYC five years ago. Perhaps it was just a bad day for the kitchen, but at this point I'm not inclined to come back any time soon other than to get a wine by the glass along with that amazing cannolo.",3,1,1,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738
5.0,8/24/2016,"Amazing, delicious Italian food done in a modern setting with small plates and homemade pastas.  We started with a glass of prosecco, the charcuterie combo (the mozzarella and tomatoes were exceptionally good), and meatballs.  Bread is served with a pesto and a spicy tomato dipping sauce.  It was all delicious. My husband loved putting the salted mozzarella on the bread. I ordered a glass of Sangiovese (fruit forward, nice acidity and balanced) and my husband ordered the Montauk beer (cold and refreshing as beer should be).    I was already almost full and could have stopped there but couldn't resist the main dishes of linguini with clams and the sausage pizza.  We had leftover pizza to bring home in a little pizza box, giving us lunch to look forward to the next day.  We finished with a complimentary cannoli as the icing on the top of a great date night dinner.  Staff and management were professional and friendly.  A wonderful neighborhood gem whether you want to grab drinks at the bar with small bites or pizza, or for an elegant dining experience.  Highly recommend.  I look forward to returning to try the other items on the menu!",8,0,3,CK D.,"Scottsdale, AZ",52,47,31

We started with the antipasto tasting which was just superb. I then ordered the eggplant parmesan which to be honest was not my favorite would've ordered the meatballs instead (which were fiiireeeeee) regardless the restaurant still deserves 5 stars; that's how amazing my experience was. Following the eggplant I ordered the Clam Linguine which is a must try along with the Bucatini. My main course was the Lamb Leg and Bone Marrow. They were incomparable to anything I've ever tried in my life. Brought me back to my days living in Rome. The meal was delectable, exotic, and unforgettable. I've never eaten at a restaurant like this one. From the second you walk in the aromas capture you. The ambiance and design of the restaurant is like no other.

We each has different requirements, some in contrast to each other. He narrowed it down to two bottles which we picked from. When the bottle came we all loved it. The food was great. We had ordered three small plates, a pizza and two pastas. My favorites were the small plates which were the meatballs, eggplant parmesan and best of all the octopus.

2.0,6/21/2016,"Food was great, but the service -- or rather timing of service -- was a disaster. My dining companion was a serious foodie and he picked out this place based on a web search. It was quite a trek for us -- a 20-minute walk from the G Line. Nice decor. We ordered a couple of beers and, at the recommendation of server Jani, we tried the antipasto tasting -- including a fabulous cheese. Then we had a meatball appetizer -- three hearty meatballs in a great sauce. Both of these arrived quickly at the table. BUT THEN the wait began for the main courses. I wasn't keeping track on a stop watch, and I fear that my time estimates might be exaggerated, but after the wait had gone on way too long, Jani stopped by to apologize about the delay and said our entrees (pork, and linguini with clams) would be out soon. After that, it was an additional 10 or 15 minutes. The entrees (finally!) were great. The pork sauce especially was first rate, and they arrived with a free, apologetic plate of mushrooms, but still what should have been a fine dining experience left us with a grumpy attitude as we walked out the door.

There are a lot of little tables by the bar for a more casual bite as compared to the sit-down-and-stay-a-while feeling in the main dining area.We were seated in a bangin' leather booth, which added to the clubby vibe of the place. The menu has a nice set of options. Though it was a bit light on greens for my liking, at an Italian joint I don't really expect things any other way! We had a sampler appetizer plate, the meatballs, grilled squash blossoms, linguine with clams and two pizzas. Everything was standout except for the pizza.

3.0,5/5/2016,"I find it funny that my review of Barano almost directly contradicts that of the famed Food Baby. My group LOVED the small plates we had - the roasted/grilled eggplant and zucchini dishes were both terrific in their own unique ways. I loved that the sauce was plentiful on each dish - nothing worse than when a restaurant is skimpy with its sauce!  However, the pasta definitely fell flat. It lacked flavor/spice/salt/herbs/seasoning/you name it. My boyfriend asked one of the less-than-present (we'll get to that later) waitress for some red pepper to spice up his arrabiata sauce, but was told that they don't have any as they don't make it a practice to ""accessorize"" the dishes once they come out of the kitchen. AKA - don't expect tableside cheese or pepper grating. The pizza was good, but not of Rubirosa fame.Ok, so lastly, the service. It was just odd and the waitresses were super-spacey. We did, however, go on just their second night of full-service, so perhaps the girls were just still in the training process.  They kept trying to take unfinished plates off our table!!  We asked to leave one of the unfinished apps on the table, and they tried to take it away at least 4 times. Much to our sadness - as the app was one of the best dishes we had - we left the plate unguarded for a few seconds and they succeeded on the fifth try. Otherwise, some requests went unattended to by the servers, one server dropped/broke a glass on our table, and one of the servers knocked over one of our phones from the table onto the floor. At that point, it was just humorous and we had a fun time laughing about what kind of casualty to expect next.  No real harm done. The restaurant is beautiful and spacious inside, and in a few months (once some of the service issues are ironed out and we don't have to worry about a server accidentally refilling our laps with water instead of our glasses) I'd like to return for some wine, small plates, and that AMAZING stracciatella.",6,1,1,Stephanie U.,"New York, NY",6,41,2
4.0,5/1/2016,"This new Italian spot in South Williamsburg has some pretty solid food, including small plates, pastas and pizzas that you cut with your own really cool scissors.Of the several things we tried, including the Grilled Zucchini ($15), Insalata Misti ($11) and the Eggplant Parmigiana ($12), the pasta and pizzas were the best. For pasta, we went with the Bucatini ($17), which was filled with generous hunks of rabbit and was cooked to the perfect level of chewiness. For pizza, we tried the Margherita ($14) and the Calabrese ($16), which comes topped with sausage, chilies, peppers, onions and scamorza. Though it doesn't list tomato in the ingredients, it is topped with the same sauce as the Margherita, which made these two a bit too similar, so it would be better to go for a white pie or something else if you are getting two.The pies themselves are a decent size, and the gimmick here seems to be that they are served alongside a giant pair of scissors that you use to cut yourself at the table. It cuts pretty well, and the chewy crusts make for a pleasant and satisfying experience.Service is great too and the atmosphere is nice and laid back. It's a pretty huge restaurant, so it was fairly empty on Sunday night, but there are nice different sections to it, including a bar and seats near the open kitchen in the back. For desserts, they have pretty standard Italian restaurant fare, including an ok Cannoli filled with Ricotta, Candied Fruit and Dark Chocolate ($4) and a Torta ($10) which can safely be skipped in favor of some OddFellows ice cream (which they actually have on the menu as well, or can be obtained from the storefront a short walk away on Kent Ave).",20,5,9,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834
