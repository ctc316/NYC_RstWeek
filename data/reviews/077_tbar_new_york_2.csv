5.0,3/22/2019,"Everything we ordered at T-Bar was truly amazing. We started with the sushi, which came with four flavorful pieces of fresh fish atop a chunky crispy rice foundation. For our main, we ordered the 24-ounce rib-eye cooked to the chef's recommendation (medium rare) and paired it with a side of mascarpone spinach. The steak was extremely tender and flavorful--cooked to perfection. And I could not stop forking into the creamy spinach side! The mascarpone added a rich velvetiness that can't compare to regular creamed spinach. Whether you're doing date night, girls' night, or coming here with the parents, the ambiance is tasteful and classy yet welcoming.

5.0,2/10/2019,"This place is underrated. Putting my steak bias aside, the food was excellent.Yellowfin tuna tartare: mixed with soy sauce, ginger and sesame seeds. Fish was really fresh and tasty, and I'm glad they provided warm crunchy bread to balance the textures and flavors.Chilean sea bass: Again, fresh and moist fish, and it was cooked perfectly. The fish sits upon a base of bok choy (sauced in some sort of soy/ginger combo)Ribeye: They'll slice up the steak for you, and this was one of the better ribeyes I've had. 24 oz never disappeared so fast before.Banana parfait mille feuilles: One of the best desserts I've had in NYC, unexpectedly in a steakhouse of all places.

5.0,1/9/2019,"let's begin with Yellowfin Tuna TartarDrizzle of soy, Ginger and topped with sesame seeds. The tuna was bright and fresh and plate  licking good. I like fresh Tuna...this I loved ! So simple a dish but can go wrong easily. This was a surprisingly great start.We also were treated with the special - Quinoa salad with butternut squash, black olives, fresh greens and mixed in a heavenly light dressing that truly was special. I had never been a big quinoa fan. First time did not make my palate happy. Yet the first time I had avocado I was not pleased. The secret to anything new is flavor. Seasoning and spending a little time and love to enhance the goodness that lies beneath the hype. I love avocados now. Fresh with a little lemon and red pepper flakes. Mixed in as a guacamole and any ole way. Is Quinoa the avocado of the millennials. Sorry but my thoughts on millennials vary. They are smart and innovative. I am not one of them. Although smart and innovative I was born too early and I was just born this way. Thoughtful and polite. Respectful and unpretentious. I envy the millennials that pretention is now acceptable. Thank you for that and thank you for quinoa. It is a lovely grain that can take on many different forms. In a salad as a main as a snack. T Bar did it right. Unpretentious. Clean pure flavor enhancing every ingredient on the plate. Balancing it all perfectly. I ate all the tuna and wanted to be sure to enjoy the rest of the meal as this introduction to T Bar enfolds. Never do I do this when reviewing but I asked to take the rest of this amazing salad home. Yes, Millenials you had me at quinoa. On to the main...our lovely talented and knowledgeable Server Kati suggested steak. It is however a steak house. Also mentioning that the duck is one of their most popular dishes. Michael had the Rib Eye. Medium rare. I opted for the duck. Michael travels a lot and whenever he goes to a big city let's say Boston or Chicago or DC. His quest is meat !! A great steak will determine if he will return. As any red blooded American male and Ron Swanson, Beef and whiskey is the perfect evening meal.  Michael's plate came out with a steak bigger than my head. Beautiful sear and cooked exactly right. A good sign that they have the right chef for a steak house. ""At the suggestion of our server, we ordered the 24 oz. Prime Aged Ribeye Steak. The steak arrived perfectly seared and lightly seasoned with Kosher Salt and Black Pepper. I prefer my steak medium rare to preserve the natural flavor and juices of a prime cut of meat and the chef did not disappoint. No need for any other sauces. The generous portion is plenty for two guests. No disrespect to my vegetarian friends, but this steak would make Ghandi green with envy."" Michael Morrissey  Personally I do like a good steak now and then. T Bar rib eye is one of the best I've had. The preparation was beautiful. Presented on a white plate this charbroiled slab of beef was treated and cooked with kind and considerate hands. Meat lovers should be proud. In a world now where I have almost more friends that are vegan than not for many reasons. I also can appreciate the idea behind the meat lovers appreciating  every part and utilizing it with purpose.Then the duck. A lovely plate. Crispy Long Island Duck. Tasty and flavorful. Served with a side of  sweet potatoes and an orange glaze. It was a great choice. Service was perfect. We had a few minutes wait but to my surprise on a Thursday night at 7 PM this place was packed. A few minutes later we were seated at a corner banquet. Cushioning and comfortable. The décor was lovely understated and not flashy at all. The hostesses and bartenders were gorgeous. I felt as if I was in  a Robert Palmer video. The patrons at the bar were as you would expect on the upper east side. Attractive older gentlemen with women whom you couldn't tell their age or if they were sad. They all had the same smile. Lovely all the same.  The dessert - as I mentioned often the dessert is the explanation at the end of the sentence. We were served 2 very decadent and large desserts. First the Strawberry Sundae. Shortcake, meringue, brandy cream. They say it serves 4 I would say maybe 14. It's massive but very yummy. A steak place that just took a turn to being an ice cream social. Then the Banana Parfait Mille Feuilles. Coconut - caramel sauce. Again can serve 4 but we needed to make more friends to get through this. It was delicious. I always love a brulle. Hard sugar on top of stuff. Who wouldn't like it. What stood apart for me was Kati. A true gem. Beginning with  her warm greeting to our final good byes for the evening. I had been a server for many years and have seen a lot in high end to street food service. Kati not only makes you feel welcome I do believe she truly loves what she does. She loves where she gets to do it and her pride in the food shows in her pride of her service. Knowledge from your server",0,0,0,Faith R.,"Queens, Queens, NY",120,3,0

4.0,11/20/2018,Such pillow-y pasta! I came by for lunch with my bosses today and really enjoyed the ambiance as well as the food. It still has that upscale feel with the prices and the service (I love how they had a different server carry out each dish and place them on the table all at once) but it wasn't super stuffy which meant that we were still able to freely continue our conversation at ease. I ended up ordering the cavatelli which I loved! The pasta was so pillow-y and had such a nice chew. The TBar salad with shrimp looked really yummy as well as the shrimps were nice and plump with such gorgeous tomatoes. The meatballs only came as meatballs which I thought was a bit odd.

5.0,11/6/2018,"EXCELLENT!!I recently went to TBar for a group dinner with long time friends. We had the chance to order several dishes and many desserts. Everything was spectacular, particularly the octopus and the sea bass with bok choy. I live in Astoria so I've eaten a lot of octopus in my days, and Tbar's is a cut above. Crispy on the outside and perfectly cooked. The sea bass also was full of flavor and light enough that we finished the whole dish without feeling overly full.The desserts are out of this world. In fact each one is like a world unto itself, size-wise and creatively speaking. I would go back to Tbar in a heartbeat, and in fact am already strategizing how to organize a family dinner when my relatives are in town.

5.0,8/11/2018,"Amazing food! I came here for restaurant week dinner on a Friday night. You have to make reservations for this place. The decor was very nice but the bathrooms lacked air conditioning. I ordered the salmon ceviche for appetizer, filet mignon with mash potatoes for my entree and assorted cookies for dessert. The first few bites of my appetizer was tolerable but towards the end it was a bit too sour for me. It's a steakhouse so you have to order steak! The only one was the filet mignon on the restaurant week menu with an extra charge of $8 but it's worth it. I ordered medium rare because I want it a pinkish but not bloody. The filet mignon was absolutely delicious, came out tender and juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. The mash potatoes were very creamy and flavorful. I would eat here again. The prices for the other cuts of meat off the restaurant week menu were not too pricey. The wines from the restaurant week were only $38 per bottle, which was not bad! By the time I got to the dessert, I was too full to try all the cookies. The assorted cookies included oatmeal raisin, chocolate chip, sugar and mini biscottis.

4.0,7/29/2018,"We had a great restaurant week experience last night.  The menu was a great deal.  We started off with some deliciously salty olive bread and focaccia.  In addition to the menu, there was a good assortment of perfectly reasonable $38 bottles of wine.  We scored a quaffable bottle of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc.  We all started with the salmon ceviche- nicely flavored.  My wife and I split the chicken Milanese and the salmon.  They were delicious.  We liked the bread so much that we went for seconds.  The service was unrushed and we enjoyed the evening.  We had a 6:30 table and the crowd was geezer- heavy (I'm concerned that we only brought down the average age slightly).  The later arrivals were younger.  Desserts were all very good, but the banana mille feiulle was excellent.  Really nice evening in an unrushed atmosphere.  Based on this, I would give this place another shot.",0,0,0,Joel S.,"New York, NY",37,675,16
3.0,7/23/2018,"Can't say I was impressed much either way here. Food was artfully plated but rather dry, both my dish and my date's. Flavor was serviceable but wouldn't have been memorable even at a less UES price point, so for the elevated cost, it really wasn't worth it. Our waiter showed up promptly, then vanished for several minutes until one of our party asked someone else to locate him. I don't regret it, but I would regret going back.

First we get to the place we get seated the place inside looks nice and clean. Another couple gets to the restaurant they get seated and before us they get the complementary bread they get served drinks and asked if they were ready to order. Waited 15 Minutes to be asked what we wanted to drink the ginger ale had no sirup it was basically water and seltzer. Another couple gets seated next to us they get asked right away about drinks and get the complementary which we still didn't get when we asked the guy looked at us like if we were asking for something so difficult to do. Food comes the pizza looked like school lunchroom Pizza the guy didn't even knew how to put everything on the table we had to move stuff for him, the octopus looked nothing like the pictures on yelp the steak was good not the best omg wow steak mashed potatoes where good I requested a baked potato with butter, got a baked Potato no butter had to wait for the waiter again to ask for butter to get just a little medallion of butter for an 7 inch potato it was big but hello that little butter.

Didn't have time to reorder so I suffered in silence (not that the waiter even checked in on us at any point in time throughout the meal). We had to send the brussel sprouts back because they were legitimately cold-as in not defrosted enough. My wife had the duck, which was overcooked and fatty.

4.0,7/2/2017,"This past week a few friends and I met up for dinner at T-Bar Steak & Lounge. It was my first time dining at T-Bar and I was certainly not disappointed. I was taken in by the causal yet elegant space. The staff was extremely accommodating and knowledgeable. We started with a couple of appetizers. The guacamole with chips was surprisingly good and it was better than any traditional Mexican version I've ever had. We also split a phenomenal cucumber and goat cheese pizza. For the main course I shared the black angus porterhouse for two, it honestly could have been for three. The meat was cooked to perfection, really tender, and savory. We topped the night off with the decadent banana parfait. I was beyond pleased with my first experience at T-Bar and look forward to several more.",0,0,0,Matthew S.,"Baldwin, NY",0,16,5

Their skinny girl margaritas are light and sweet with a hint of a salty flavor that compliments their black angus porterhouse steak pretty well. Their angel chicken wings were also a pleasant surprise! They were lightly topped with sesame seeds and tamarind glaze. It was nothing like anything I've had before! To top it all off, I had room left for dessert and tried their strawberry Sundae.

It was a nice sunny day and they had Prosecco on the menu so we started with a nice cold glass, just perfect. For appetizer we ordered chips and guacamole, the guacamole was amazing, so fresh and just perfectly spicy. We also ordered angel chicken wings and zucchini gapazho which was a really nice surprise. Zucchini, mixed vegetable on a bed of cream cheese, so delicious. Then it was time for the main course. We had Porterhouse steak that came cut up and cooked to perfection. Their steak is out of this world good! It came with a side of their well crispy French fries. We also had Mediterranean Branzino. So well prepared. Everything was so fresh and perfect in every way.

1.0,6/25/2017,"To all of the yelpers who spoke positively about the ambiance and service at this place, I feel tricked and I don't forgive you. When you walk into this restaurant you feel like you're in the dining room of an assisted living facility.  At 7 pm on a Saturday night, its brightly lit, decorated with pastel colors and full of elderly people. The layout and tables are awkwardly set up and there were several servers who stood around talking and socializing with each other rather than focusing on the customers.  We started with a drink but just couldn't stay.  The drink was fine but eating a steak in this environment would have been depressing. Unless you crave the early bird crowd, I would avoid t-bar.",2,4,0,Roni J.,"Manhattan, NY",65,98,204
4.0,5/23/2017,I've been here twice now. Once for dinner with friends and then today for Mother's Day brunch. It feels solidly upper east side. The dinner crowd is... how do I put this... old. We felt like some of the youngest people (by decades) when we came by for lunch. The food was quite good though. I had salmon and I was impressed. I was impressed again today at brunch. My Cesar salad was delicious. We also tried the guacamole which was very good. I had the eggs florentine with fries. Yum. Our table shared the family style brownie ice cream sundae and it was ridiculous. Soooooo good. The service was very friendly and they were happy to accommodate our stroller and rowdy kids.

Don't get me wrong, overall everything we ordered was delicious but we also paid $24 for the two sides and one of them was a small portion of frites. The steak is well seasoned and cooked well. The frites are skinny which I like. The mashed potatoes are a good portion for the price. The bread mix is also better than most steakhouses coming in rosemary and olive flavors as well as a mini baguette.If you aren't too thirsty (they ignore your water glasses unless you flag them down) then this place is quite popular for UES.

1.0,5/10/2017,"Unless your over the age of 65 and want to essentially serve yourself, I would pass. I am giving them 1 star because the food is great- overpriced- but definitely delicious. The service is quite literally a joke. You can definitely tell their business relies solely on old, regular customers- as anyone in their right mind wouldn't return for this kind of service at prices like those.We walked in to an almost empty restaurant (with a reservation) and stood there for 5 minutes with the entire waitstaff staring at us doing nothing until the (unfriendly) hostess finally arrived. Our order was quickly taken, and that was essentially the last we ever saw of our waitress. No coming over to check on how our $50 steaks were cooked, no pouring our $10 bottle of water for us. Nothing. She came over only once everything was done to offer dessert, which we obviously declined.The entire staff stood in a group socializing with the manager while customers looked around baffled as to why their empty plates sat in front of them for 15 minutes. The only thing the manager seemed to care about was going around and chatting with the young girls that work there. Additionally, a heavily pregnant woman was seated right next to us and let them know the space was extremely tight and uncomfortable for her, and I watched as they told her they couldnt move her to one of the 10 open tables in the restaurant.Unfortunately for them, we like to frequent nice restaurants and they have certainly lost us as future customers. We also spend our summers in Southampton where they are opening up a pop up restaurant and we will without a doubt be passing on that- and letting our friends and family know to do the same.",3,3,1,Al G.,"New York, NY",0,2,0

3.0,2/22/2015,"My wife works just a few blocks away from T-BAR and so we came here on her lunch break to enjoy their restaurant week menu. The decor was a bit dated but clean nonetheless. The waitstaff was friendly and professional. For the first course we ordered the Salmon Ceviche and Black Angus Steak Tartare. Both were stellar. Portions were profuse, presentation was pleasing and flavors were just bursting. Would rate each a 10/10. Really the perfect way to start a meal. The main course is where T-BAR seriously and irreversibly faltered. We ordered the Angus Burger and Mushroom Risotto. The Mushroom Risotto was not in fact a risotto, more like a creamy rice. First the rice was not classic arborio but more like Uncle Ben's. Second, whatever rice it was, it wasn't cooked nearly long enough with the stock and wine to make a truly soft and creamy risotto. Flavor was lacking, so much so that I had to add my own refinements to make it edible - table salt and mustard from my wife's burger. Speaking of the burger, it was overcooked, flavorless and lacking toppings including cheese. If you're going to dare to serve a burger without cheese, you better ensure that the meat is flavorful enough to speak for itself...it wasn't. I would rate these courses a 3/10. The dessert paradoxically was great. We ordered the Banana Parfait Mille Feuilles and Warm Apple Crisp. The Banana was caramelized and cooked to perfection. The Apple Crisp had a sublime texture contrast and was just perfect. Would rate each of these 9/10. Ultimately our experience was a shame because T-BAR came close to serving a great meal but I simply cannot recommend a restaurant that can't execute main dishes well.",0,0,0,Konstantine A.,"Manhattan, NY",1,20,0

It was sweet, with a spicy kick, but not too overwhelming. Then for food, we ordered the kale salad, which was perfect. I want to figure out how to make it at home, because I've never had a kale salad that good. To top it all of, we shared a steak and it was cooked perfectly. The sear was amazing and the juices just made the meat melt in your mouth. For desert, we got the strawberry sundae. I am not usually one to enjoy desert, but my goodness this was good.

It came dripping in butter which made it almost I edible. The waiter was super nice and helpful. I will definitely go back. It had a lot of healthy choices and grilled fish.

I really like this restaurant and will definitely be back soon.  We were greeted by a warm friendly hostess and given a nice corner table.  Our server greeted us with two kinds of bread, salty and olive focaccia. Truly fresh and delicious. I ordered the watermelon and feta cheese salad. It was perfectly seasoned. I had the filet mignon as my entree. It was one of the best cuts of meat I have had in a long time. Perfectly cooked. Nice crisp outside, tender pink juicy inside. The mashed potatoes were also to die for, fresh, buttery and creamy, yum. For dessert I order the banana parfait, it was really really good, but I would order the chocolate mousse next time. My overall experience was a ten, however to be fair I will add one caveat, the food was very salty, I LOVE salty so it didn't bother me, but for the salt sensitive people out there you've been warned!",0,0,0,Sue N.,"Delray Beach, FL",21,90,70

Our appetizer, the tuna tartar, was delicious. Waiter was friendly and efficient. Seemed to know the menu well and also was able to recommend the best wines for our order and taste.

The service was pretty good, the decor is fun and hip, the bar area is lively. Prices are very good for steak, particularly on the UES, and the high quality makes TBar a great value for the money.

Attentive and nice waiter who was on top of everything and polite to everyone around us (which was difficult because the table next to us was downright rude).  But the food. Well, it was fine. Nothing was wrong it with. But this is NOT a steakhouse, the steak was clearly cooked sous vide and then slapped onto a flattop for a char just before it was sent out. Perfectly cooked, no flavor whatsoever. The pasta was good, but nothing as good as my favorite neighborhood Italian place.  Spinach and ""hand cut house made"" french fries were good, but again, nothing special or delicious.

The bar area is more of a waiting area there are only 6-7 chairs. Met my date there at 6:30 and they were accomodating seating us without a reservation. After ordering drinks we noticed there was no pasta on the menu and they had no specials, so wanting pasta  we decided to leave , when we told our waiter he was nice about and said they were thinking about adding a dish soon, about 10 minutes later the hostess told us they did needed the table for dinner service. Can you get anymore tacky then that?I Regardless its on a main ave which means Its s tourist magnet, I get it. On to the review, I have a feeing this place was set up for another cuisine which may have not worked out, it certainly doesn't have the manly vibe and the menus is flimsy and thin on dishes, really only has 4-5 if that steaks, couple of chicken and 1-2 fish, but no pasta. Decore is modern with too much light. clientele is strickly UES Jewish, lots of little old ladies right out of central casting. We ended up eating Italian at Vivolo on 74th.

5.0,2/6/2013,"I was very lucky to find TBar at the last minute, this past Monday.We just about gave up on the tired and ridiculous menus of RW.  But, my trusted BFF heard about it and made reservations on the same day, and we got a very nice table, too.It's amazing to us that some steak places do not offer any steak on the menu for Restaurant Week.  At this point, I'd rather order a la carte (besides, I'm not usually big on deserts unless they are perfection, like Payard's).There were three appetizer choices, including a salad and chicken fois gras.  We both got the little Swedish lamb meatballs - they were delish.  Nice large portion, too.What was to follow was one of the best filet mignonsI have had anywhere.  And for RW, it was huge and perfectly prepared.  So filling we could barely finish it.  The steak was served with a nice portion of mashed potatoes.  Also excellent. Served with some kind or mildly garlicky butter sauce on the side.  Tasty, and not overly garlicky.At the beginning of the meal we were immediately served water and a large basket of various breads.  I normally never have bread - but these were irresistible and fresh.The wine list was also good, including some very reasonable reds and whites.We shared a bottle of very decent  Malbec.  They had many varietals from which to choose, including Proseco, all gently priced (especially for the UES).For desert there was a choice of apple crisp, chocolate mouse and some kind of banana concoction.  The third one was too melt-y to take to go.  We took one of each of the other two home.  We were too stuffed and very satisfied.I disagree that the staff was not welcoming.  The hostesses smiled and took our coats and the waitstaff was friendly, service excellent.  Atmosphere was relaxed, contrary to other reviewers put-downs.  Great vibe, sophisticated without being in-your face trendy.  (BTW, half the price of the trendy new restaurant one block away, where we started off our evening).TBar is not stuffy.  I appreciate the neighborhood feel and patrons.  It's grownup.Enough, already with twelve year old foodies and hipsters!  This place was just cool without trying.We sat next to a gentleman dining alone and he said this was his second time back for RW.  He had no desire to go anywhere else.  And neither did we.If it were not for the wine, I'd say the $38 three course dinner was a lot of bang for the buck.  I would certainly return for their steak alone, anytime, after RW.

Standard chop salad; nothing to write home about but not bad. However; my wife's soup appetizer was brought out 15 minutes after everyone else because our hot shot waiter decided not to write it down and screwed it up (the soup was very good and saved a one-star rating). Next was the turkey and stuffing entree. The meat was cheap and dry; and the stuffing lacked any real taste. It was basically a meal you could buy prepared from a supermarket. I figured the Apple crisp and vanilla ice cream dessert would save the day as it sounded delicious. Nope; when it was time to bring the dessert- they were out of apple crisp. It was 8pm, and a price fix menu of only 4 options and they were out of the dessert. . the whole thing basically sucked, the service, the food and the lack of beer selection (and the 20 minutes it took the bartender to serve it from a not very crowded bar). it felt like they had a temp staff in just for the holiday as everything took a long time and/or was incorrect.

5.0,9/10/2011,"My boyfriend and I ate at T Bar last week for the 3rd time.  The food and service were nothing but exemplary each time we dined.  We sat down and within seconds were served a bread basket which is honestly the most sinful bread I have ever tasted!! I started the night off with the T Bar Cosmo (yum!), and Tuna Tartar which was super fresh and delicious. To follow I had the filet mignon medium rare and cooked to perfection with poive sauce ( my fave!) sauteed spinach and mashed potatoes which were whipped to a delightful, fluffy smoothness.  And on to the dessert!!! The best part if that's even possible. The banana parfait!!!!! It had layers of delicious icecream, caramel sauce, some kind of cookie, and toasted banana!! I would go back just for dessert! To top it all off the ambiance and staff are lovely and the owner Tony Fortuna shows his presence there nightly.  He's really involved and very kind. He even said hello to us at our table! Guess he noticed we're becoming regulars. This will be our weekly go to for sure!!!",0,0,0,Tiffany M.,"Southampton, NY",35,3,0

The waiter doesn't talk much and well doesnt care at all. Took another 10mins to come back to get our orders..We ordered steak tartar, procuitto,2 filet mignon and a couple glasses of wine. Food was not bad, but so far, im not having a good time thanks to super unattentive server. He even come back with steak knives after we have our steak sitting in front of us, thats a nice wait..... Ok so whatever, the mignon were.good..... At the end of dinner my bf and i sat back and finishing up our wine, and we saw a MOUSE running around right next to our table....... Thats it tbar, so long. ..... And yes i told the guy who took our bill thats a mouse in there so lets see....

I ordered the vegetarian risotto and it was delicious! Perfectly cooked and yummy! My boyfriend ordered from the restaurant week menu so I was able to enjoy some of his assorted cookies for desert, also quite tasty!!Now our waiter, well he was quite the blob. No personality! Just asked for our orders and that was about it. Walked over at first and just stared at us. Can I help you? My name is xxx. Give me something guy! The bus boys on the other hand were wonderful. Constantly refilling our waters, clearing our plates promptly. I recommend it, I just hope you don't get our blob waiter!",0,0,0,Danielle B.,"Massapequa Park, NY",0,176,0
5.0,10/14/2010,"I was meeting up with my family for our annual Mother's Day lunch here and immediately felt comfortable in my surroundings. It is bright, cheery, hip and modern looking. It feels like spring. Our party of 10 was seated at a long narrow table and didn't feel at all squished, which I feel we often do in small NYC restaurants.  I was so pleased  to get a great corner seat by the window, such a cozy little nook with plenty of elbow room. I had a somewhat difficult time choosing my entree because pretty much everything on the menu appealed to me. A very good problem to have! My mother and I decided to share 2 entrees- score! We had the eggs Benedict (with spinach instead of bacon which I suppose makes it Eggs Florentine) and the turkey burger. Both were excellent. I especially loved that the burger had spinach and cheese *inside* of the meat like a little flavor-surprise, and was topped with caramelized onions. It came on a delicious roll with a side salad- the one disappointment was that it was simply iceberg lettuce with 2 tomato slices. Had I known that, I would have opted for the fries instead. For dessert, my sweet-tooth cursed family order a bunch of choices to share. The strawberry sundae and banana parfait were a big hit with us. The cookie plate was unremarkable. I didn't expect to like the banana dessert, but the crispy caramelized edges were pretty darn awesome. Everything we had was present very nicely, tasted pretty delicious, and cooked to our liking, except for one person's slightly overdone burger. To top it off the service was perfect. Not at all pushy or too-present, but there if you needed anything and very polite and patient. I will definitely come back here again, hopefully next time when the weather is warmer and the outdoor seating is set-up. Great find in the neighborhood!",0,0,0,Carey Y.,"Sarasota, FL",408,338,3
3.0,10/7/2010,"A pretty decent steakhouse on the UES. They have some specialty cocktails which are pretty yummy. I tried this place for restaurant week and their apps are decent. The filet mignon is tender and juicy and was cooked a little closer to medium than medium rare but was still pretty good. The mashed potatoes were bland but creamy. The extra side of mac and cheese was pretty delish. My ex and me split our desserts- chocolate mousse and strawberry shortcake, both which were pretty yummy. If you're on the UES it's definitely a worthwhile steakhouse to try during restaurant week but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.",2,0,0,Sascha M.,"New York, NY",593,822,7
3.0,8/18/2010,"Went here on a whim bc they're a few blocks from my apt and were still participating in Rest Week.I will definitely say, the rest week menu is a definite steal!  If you ordered that meal separately, it would definitely set you back at a minimum $60.  Steak tartare was pretty tasty, very flavorful, not too much vinegar.  The filet mignon was tender (I've had much more tender) and loved the roasted garlic clove to accompany the mashed potatoes.  Creme brulee was just the standard, but I did appreciate there was a nice and thick layer of the custard underneath the sugary goodness.It's a good spot for the UES.  Would I have ventured here if I didn't live in the neighborhood?  Probably not.  The decor is nice, service is good not great, and the food will leave you satisfied.  Oh, the bar and small lounge area do make for a nice place to sit and chat over a few drinks.  Noise level was just right.",0,0,0,Shyla D.,"New York, NY",22,28,0

3.0,10/13/2009,"Another restaurant we came across through Opentable.  We gave it a try for dinner and it was ok.  It was dark, big, and empty when we came in.  There were only a couple other tables occupied and one business party behind us.  They were quite loud and rowdy, but it's not too bothersome.  It's nice to see people have fun!  Anyway, the service was good, no complaints really.  It does seem like a bit of snobby place.  We felt a bit out of place in this restaurant.  The majority of the people were older, more mature, rich-looking, and Caucasian.  I had a feeling they were either thinking or saying, who are those kids?  Do they know how much it cost to eat here?  Hahha...oh well, they looked over at us for awhile but then stopped and continued eating and conversing.  So we ordered a lot of appetizers because I cannot decide what I want to eat, so we got a little bit of everything.  It's pretty cool how they brought it out.  They brought it out in a tier of like four or five layers.  The bottom plate was the biggest and it got smaller, very nice presentation.  I still haven't seen that anywhere else.  Other than that, everything else was pretty normal.  It shouldn't cost as much as it does for normal.  I don't think I'll come here again.  There's a lot of other restaurants I would like to try before coming back to this place.",0,0,0,Truc N.,"San Jose, CA",334,200,45

No one at my table thought the spring rolls were exceptional but I didn't taste them for myself. As an entree I ordered the salmon. I actually didn't like it. The sauce was good but the fish was very fishy. When the waiters came to clear the table the manger came and asked if I didn't enjoy me meal. I said I didn't and she offered to get me something else but I declined because it was late. I did get the strawberry shortcake dessert and it was good. When the bill came our waiter said they didn't charge me for the salmon because I didn't eat it. If anything, I'll go again for the great customer service.",0,0,0,Patrice M.,"New York, NY",192,14,0
4.0,7/15/2009,"OK...full disclosure. This was a fully paid for event for me so I am reviewing from a place of not having had to pay for anything. My cast and I arrived to find our hosts up in a back room of the restaurant on the UES. Lauren Hutton passed us as we ascended the stairs to the back room. The decor is decidedly UN-contemporary. The wallpaper said, ""Hello! Greetings from 1988!"" The see through plastic chairs outside said, ""WE ARE DEVO!"". So from the get go it wasn't a place that would be on my short list to begin with.We sat down with our generous hosts and started our night. I inquired about their bourbons, thinking about a manhattan to start with, and learned that they had Jack Daniels (not a bourbon), Jim Beam, and Maker's Mark. ""OK. Not a whiskey place. That's cool."" I thought. I ordered a Grey Goose martini and away we went!The Tuna Tartare was FANTASTIC. A decent portion with a nice side salad. I have to say it was divine and a great way to start the meal. I followed our hosts' lead and got the NY Aged Steak medium-rare with bernaise sauce. It was also just wonderful. When dessert came around, so did a magician named Oz Pearlman. Now, I have never eaten at a restaurant that hired a magician to entertain the patrons. But this guy...SO GOOD!! He was funny, talented, and mind-bendingly great at magic. He entertained our table for 15 minutes and we all gasped at each trick and stared at each other in disbelief as he plied his exciting trade.The chocolate mouse was delightful and the desserts that spread over the table were wonderful.All said and done, I really have to say it was a great evening. Now that said, I might deliver a very different review if I was footing the bill myself. But since we had benefactors...I can say, it was a delightful and wonderful experience. I'd love to have someone buy me dinner here again.",0,1,1,Carson E.,"Brooklyn, NY",79,186,5
3.0,6/14/2009,"It's an okay place.  A stylish, Manhattany sort of okay.Highlights:* They have a $35 fixed price ""restaurant week"" menu, all year round.  * The strawberry sundae dessert was good.  I only had a bite of a friend's, but it was a very good bite.* The fries were perfect.* The burgers *looked* amazing.  I didn't know that when I was ordering, unfortunately.  I got the mom-makes-it-better salmon.  If I'd seen the burgers first, I'd have ordered one.  Note, they're not on the fixed price menu, and they're $17-20 each.  But damn, they looked good.* Service was great.I'd say this place is not worth it if you're paying full price.  You'd end up paying 60-100 per person, I am guessing.  There are many better places for that money.  But for the fixed price... as I said, it's an okay place.",0,1,0,Daniel B.,"New York, NY",414,641,407
4.0,3/16/2009,"It took me a while to get to this place. I live on the UES, and we certainly are lacking steakhouses, but the menu, for what its worth, seemed a bit over priced.I ended up checking out the menu some months later online, and saw that they offered a bar menu - basically the same as the dinner menu, but less $$.So, we were seated in one of the low set tables towards the back of the bar, and ordered a beer and burgers. My lamb burger was absolutely delicious. Very juicy and flavorful. Romona from the Housewives of NY was sitting next to us (not sure if thats a + or -, but thought it should be noted).I think I would rank it a 3 star if I had paid the full dinner prices.
